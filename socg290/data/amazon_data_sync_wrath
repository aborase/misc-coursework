VI actually received a set of these headphones two years ago through Vine (they still work great). This year I wanted to buy a set for my son for Christmas, but found that the set I got in 2013 wasn't being sold anymore. I did some research and ordered these, hoping they would be of similar quality. Once he opened them today, I was surprised to see that it was exactly the same headphones in every detail but the label! We've just run them through the cycle of music I use to test out headphones, and the sound quality is just as excellent. Here are some details:1. One common problem I find with headphones and earbuds is that they break down with some distortion at higher volume levels. With the volume as loud as I could take it with these, they were perfectly crisp and accurate.2. Let's revisit part of note #1. The sound in these is "perfectly crisp and accurate".3. The high notes are the best I've ever heard. They really don't sound any different to me than my several hundred dollar set of Infiniti towers. Amazingly sharp sound.4. But what about the bass? You never get great bass out of headphones, right? Wrong. I was literally stunned by the bass coming out of these headphones. It has depth AND resonance. You'll actually feel like strings from a "real bass" and a bass guitar are vibrating you. Drums sound like drums, not some little tap tap tap sound in the background.5. The left and right separation actually sounds better than what comes out of my expensive 7.2 receiver and tower speakers.6. Sounds seem to come from all around you, not just out of the speakers by your ears. I could swear I was hearing instruments from a few feet behind my head when I played some top notch jazz.7. Voices are clear and accurate in pop songs.8. Background music achieves a real presense that you absolutely will not hear from a radio or lesser headphones.I've always been a bit leery of spending very much cash on little speakers to put right next to my ear. I now know better, as long as the correct product is involved. I listened to a lot of varied styles of music in all ranges before writing this review, and I never heard the slightest hint of distortion.Let me give you some samples:One of my favorite tests for speakers is the end of Charles Dutoit conducting the Montreal Symphony in the 1812 Overture. The reason? The symphony coordinated with city churches (for the bells) and Canadian naval vessels in the river (for the cannon). With most headsets you can barely hear the cannon, and the bells are just there. With these, the cannon, while not feeling like they were shaking the room, were a solid presence in the presentation. The bells had actual vibration in the sound and the feel. The orchestra itself sounded perfect.Another set of music that impressed me were the jazz numbers on my "77 Sunset Strip" album. This album is not music that actually aired on TV, but music recorded in the studio based on arrangements from the theme and other mood music from the show. The snapping fingers in the traditional opening arrangement gave me chills. Of course, this music was recorded by a top notch jazz ensemble, so as mentioned above the bass and the bass guitar sounded like they were in the room with me.I played a few tunes from the "Wings Over America" live album. The crowd cheers rolled out of the background and into the forefront of the sound as if I was sitting near the staqe.I demoed a piece of music to my wife on another nice set of headphones, then played it again for her with these. Her eyes lit up. She looked up at me and said, "Oh, these are waaaaay better!"The headset also looks nice, with its attractive wood grain covers. This is a minor point compared to the quality of the music, but is certainly a nice perk.If I could give this product 10 stars, I literally would.

VI could not be happier with this purchase.  The build quality is very durable and the sound quality is so good I was shocked that I paid less than $200. I have other brands that are well known that cost nearly $300 that sound great but are not significantly better than these and broke after just a few months. These are built to last and sound amazing for music from classical to classic rock and blues to disco or metal. Whatever you listen to it will sound great with a full range of rich sound not just a heavy thump of bass like some other brands deliver. I bought a second pair as a gift for my brother and I'm getting a third pair for my wife. These really are that good of a value.

VLike these headphones a lot. The sound quality is very good. The headphones are extremely comfortable. My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the fact that they aren't very solid. They are very light. Some may even say flimsy. They are great to look at though. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a quality sound at a low price.

VGreat headphones for the money.  I had forgotten how good full-sized headphones could sound when compared to earbuds, the difference is there!  I thought that these would be over-the-ear headphones, judging on how big the cans looked, but they're not.  This has not impacted my satisfaction in any way.  Solid in construction, but I may need to glue the top pad to the head band some time in the future--it seems to not want to stick in the very middle.After about three month's use (stationary, at a desk), the headphone wire has developed a short on the left side.  Hopefully I can find a better replacement wire somewhere.

VMost online reviews are spot on.  A bit mid bass heavy/muddy.  Overall a nice experience with good staging.  Very comfortable.  Excellent for use with your phone as they are very efficient.  The Mic sounds great.  You can also skip the track forward with a double click.Stock sound is as if the highs are hidden behind some veil.  It is as if they are accurate but somehow out of reach. They are! Just remove the ear cushions. There is a small piece of foam glued to the plastic in front of the drivers.  Simply pull it off.  The sound will open up and sparkle.  No worries if sibilance or fatigue.  Turns the headphones from 3 stars to 4+.

VGenuinely one of the best headphones i have tried over many years of experience.Technically i am not an audiophile. I do not work with music, nor have i produced any before. However, its a field I know well.For people who are reading, i should note that i listen mostly to Trance and Chillstep. I am not talking for any other genre.These are not audiophile headphones. By that, i mean that you do not get a Studio quality. But if you are a person looking for that, you should know that this is not where you would look in the first place.So onto the headphones. The Symphonized Wraith sound deliciously good if i might say. I do not know if the wooden texture is really what makes the difference like a lot of articles state, but the headphones form a resonance that is just magical to listen to. They do not product a unidirectional sound. The sound is so clear, that you don't just hear the instruments, you feel the instruments.- The Bass is not overwhelming. By overwhelming, i only mean that it does not cover the mids and the highs. Is it powerful? Yes. It is very powerful indeed. And really beautiful at that. No distortion at high volumes whatsoever.- The mids are just stunning. Vocals are enchanting, and the headphones uncovers any sound, noise and itnstruments you have never heard before. No distortion at high volumes whatsoever.- The highs are so crisp and so clear. Sometimes, and only sometimes, at high volumes it distorts a bit and they can get harsh, but im talking at 100% volume.For trance lovers. I could make a long ass list. But buy these headphones, and go listen to Alex M.O.R.P.H's Sunset Boulevard, Denis Kenzo's Ashes, or Lost Witness's Eternal Dub Mix. And just enjoy a real state of trance.Now for the minor Con:- If you are wearing glasses, they might get a bit uncomfortable over long period of listening. also, if your ears aren't small, they might not be Over-Ears for you. Believe you me, this is a very small price to pay.1- Am i exaggerating my review?No. I am really, really, really, not.2- Do they get better with burn-in?The Mids and highs get better.3- Have I ever tried other headphones before in order to compare?I have had 20 or so pairs of headphones in my life. Beats, Bose, AKG, TDK, Seinheiser, AIAIAI, Sol Republic, Klipsh etc..Maybe only My AIAIAI Tm-1 might surpass these a bit, but they are danish Dj headphones what do you expect.4- Did Symphonize pay me to write this?I wish, but they didn't have too. Although i must add, they have amazing customer service.Cheers.

VI've had these headphones for a few month now. They are beautiful, well-built and offer quality sound for the price. The product was shipped in a timely fashion as well. The only small problem I've had since the beginning is that I can't skip the tracks and adjust volume using little remote controller attached to the headphones cord thus a four-tar review. Perhaps, seller could offer a replacement of it?Will definitely recommend the product and it's seller.

VPros:Good sound cancellation. Cuts background noise down by more than half. If you got music going, you don't hear 'ish of the outside world.Good sound reproduction, base is like that. Vocals are good. Tested with this song called "Flyin' High In The Brooklyn Sky" by Digable Planets, Joe Sample, Lester Bowie, Wah Wah Watson, has the Hip Hop + Big Jazz sounds... You can hear everything on the Wraiths, has a big orchestra hall quality to the music. On the Beats... Ok music better balanced, but the base is better on the Wraiths. There is a little noticeable distortion under the vocal range, but above the base on the Wraiths (no audiophile lingo to hit you with). When I listened to "Ghost Riders in the Sky" by Johnny Cash, I don't notice the distortion on the Wraiths, but sounds better than on Beats. If you listen to Manteca by Dizzy Gillespie on the Beats, its sounds tinny. On the Wraiths, when you hear them chant "I'll never go back to Georgia.." then the horns come in... its dope. A better listening experience on the Wraiths.Comfortable fit, covers more of ears, like pleather pillows.Looks different that most headphone you see on street, has a great look. Sheet metal frame and real wood on cups, classy.Cost $60, the Beats Solo HDs (discontinued) were $139.Bought these as a gift for teenage kid, loves'em.Cons:My kid says cord gets tangled.Can't give 5 stars, cause of that slight distortion I describe.

VI'm not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like to hear the music clearly. I only have my old headphones to compare to, which are Sony MDR-XD200s. These are were low end headphone, but I didn't think the sound was bad, certainly better than anything I had previously, and they've served me well for seven or so years.Still, I've been wanting to try something new for a while. I was attracted to the Wraiths because they look stunning and reviews indicated that their sound quality was quite good. I recently noticed the Wraith 2.0 with the oval ear cups that looked like they'd be more comfortable, so I went for them.They arrived today. First impressions are that they're smaller than they look in photos, and quite a bit smaller than my Sony headphones. Removing them from the box reveals that they are indeed gorgeously designed. They're almost all metal, and the cherry wood is a striking contrast. The synthetic leather is extremely soft and supple, more so than the real leather in my car! They fit comfortably on my head and over my ears. I've had them on for 5 hours now with no discomfort. The cables are about 4ft long, fabric wrapped, detachable and comes with a spare (one has the extra ring on the jack for mic). The length is just about right for me, not too long or short. They also come with a fabric bag to keep them inNow onto sound. As I said, I'm no expert and don't have any high end headphones to compare them to. With that said, everything comes through so much more clearly than the Sonys did. Individual instruments are easier to pick out and subtle notes I didn't notice before are now very clear. They've got some nice low end punch, but its not just "thump thump" bass, its very clear and not distorted. While  the lows are strong, I don't think they overpower the mids and highs at all. Granted if you prefer more treble than bass these may not be for you, but both are present and that's exactly how I like it.Overall I love these so far and hope to get many years out of them.

VSMALL but Good build quality (rebranded headphones?) with unsatisfactory sound.
p72
sg5
VAfter reading the reviews, looking at the base price point and the general build quality as well as "audio loving" status of the company behind it... I decided to give these a purchase.Lets get the obvious out of the way, the build quality is superb. Its a solid form fitting headset, which is one of the properties I was looking for in a new headset. So you can give a star or two right away for that one.The less obvious, and these are more cons than pros, is that not only are these headphones fairly SMALL but the quality of the audio is not satisfactory. Now, sure if we were to just say, "hey, its only $59" and write off the cons due to price point... I would say that would be some what of a fair assessment if and only if the base price (non discounted) reflected the quality and scope of the set. It does not. In fact, I have to remove a star simply for advertising the wrong base price for these headphones. Here, they are saying its normally $150 dollars, but on their website their base price is in reality $99...and this also brings into question...has it ever really sold for even $99? This pricing and illusion of discount seeks to create the impression of it being far more premium than it really is, and I dont believe in rewarding that kind of consumer manipulation.Going back to the size of the ear pads... even with small to medium sized ears, they seem to clip and push down on the top of the ear as well as the lobe of the ear. The result  is that its not nearly as comfortable as headphones that actually do go "over the ear". There is no reason for the headphones to be this small, they could have easily increased the diameter just a bit more to make it work with a larger number of people. There is also a bit of clamping, so expect some fatigue for longer use. Due to the headband being metal, I suppose you could bend it a bit... something you cant do with plastic headbands, but the consumer shouldnt have to do that.Regarding the sound quality, its not clean at all. Muffled, boomy, the general traits I expect from cheaper headsets. The skullcandy crushers and my older Razer Carcharias sound cleaner and are far more comfortable. The Carcharias actually clears the ear as well and has the perfect diameter. (Disclaimer, those are probably the only good headset to come out of Razer. Its not a recommendation of any of their other headsets or even newer ones.)So would I buy these again? No. Would I recommend them to someone else? Maybe to a kid, otherwise no. Does Symphonized deserve some kudos? Sure, they are solid in build quality, look good and are form fitting...but thats it. This is certainly a purchase I wish I didn't make.One more MAJOR thing, I believe these are just rebranded headsets from overseas somewhere. I question the claim of Symphonized manufacturing much less designing their own products. For proof, check out the LSTN Troubadour branded headphones. Notice any similarities..?

VBest genuine wood headphones under $300, no competition.  Mind blown.
p84

VOVERVIEW;Omg, THESE ARE AWESOME!  I get multiple compliments on them every time I wear these around town.  They are tied for the second most comfortable headphones I've owned (behind Samsung Level Overs), Great sound...This is a small company trying to get their name out there, and are drastically under pricing these Wraith 2.0's.  They have a couple other headphones, but mostly earbuds.  Of all of their products, this is the hero, this is the one you want.  On the European Amazon, they are already selling for twice the price they are here.SOUND;The sound is on par with top notch $150 headphones (almost as good as my $300 Samsung Level Overs which I also love, equal or better than Audio Technica M50x's)  The sound is very very clean and clear throughout, especially the mid to upper registers.  Vocals couldn't be cleaner.  The base and lower mids are slightly stronger than the rest (could be because of the bass resonance from the wood.  BTW, the different wood types are supposed to affect the sound differently, I saw a chart somewhere.  The Cherrywood is supposed to amplify the bass the most according to what I saw for you bass heads.)  Minor amount of sound leakage, but not bad.  The bass was not overwhelming, but good.  There were no holes or gaps in the overall sound profile.  Very fulfilling.  Oh ya, they can get LOUD if thats what you want, no shortage in the quantity department at all.APPEARANCE:They are definately the most attractive I've personally owned out of like 20 pairs. and are by far the most beautiful wood headphones on all of amazon under $300.  I've spent weeks googling every wooden headphone available, pouring through reviews, even ones available in Europe and not the US.  By the way, they cost nearly twice as much on the Amazon.UK as they do in the USA right now.  There are a couple competitors under the $300 mark, but not really, they fall short.  LTSN Troubadour has more exotic woods, and arguably slightly more attractive headbands, but the triangular ear cuff shape makes them significantly less attractive all things considered.  They also cost like $100 more!  There is Audio Technica ATHESW9A Portable Wooden Headphones ($220 on sale)  which look almost as nice, sound nice, but hurt your ears according to multiple people.  I've owned some Audio Technica M50x's before, and I had the same experience of painful uncomfortable ear fatigue and had to return them.  (I have to say the M50x's seriously didn't live up to all the hype either)  There really is NO other competition out there under $300 for wood headphones.  All of the rest are nowhere near as attractive, dont have nearly as good of reviews, or have next to zero reviews at all..They are almost entirely metal and wood construction.  They almost feel slightly light and flimsy, but they arent at all, the construction is extremely good, just lightweight.  There are no ugly logos distracting from the beauty of the wood.  The Symphonized logo on top of the headband is not at all unattractive.CON's;  (easily worthy trade-offs for the price.)Ok, so where did they cut corners?  Nothing major at all, but there had to be some kind of trade-offs.  The "leather" parts for padding, arent leather of course, they are faux leather, but they still look nice and are comfortable.  The chrome part around the wood is in fact plastic, but looks extremely nice and durable, and blends in very very well with the rest of it which is metal.No bluetooth, and the cord has to plug into both ear cuffs.  Not everyone needs bluetooth though, and I haven't found the 2 jack cord thing to be an issue at all yet.  The cord is braided for extra protection, but its still kind of thin.  The cord gains points in attractiveness because the jacks are matching wood.  Oh, and the cord detaches on both ends, so if there is an issue with the cord, it can be replaced easily.  It comes with no hard shell, but I never have used my shells anyways.I absolutely recommend these, and am tempted to purchase more for future gifts (UPDATE*  I did exactly that, and am happy I did), before the price doubles or more, which I think is inevitable.

VI purchased these for a trip I was taking to India.  I knew that the time on the plane was going to be awful to try to sleep.I had no illusions that due the price these were going to be world beaters but I was pleasantly surprised.  I like to listen to live music and have an extensive collection of both soundboard and audience recordings.  These headphones were clear for both high and low end.  I have to admit, while I love live music, I am not an "audiophile" by any means.What I will say is that I listened to studio music, live audience recordings, and soundboard recordings and these headphones responded well.  I did get a bit of vibration when listening to audience recordings but I am pretty sure this was due to the recording not the headphones.I would give these a 5 but the base during "Sabotage" by the Beastie Boys was good but not great.  granted I don't have a equalizer so this could be rectified I am not sure.  all I can say is it did sound good but not great.The real test was when I listened to Stevie Wonder studio Superstitious loud I knew these were very decent headphones.  I would give them a 5 stars but, I don't have anything to compare them to.  But I do know I like what I hear."When you believe in things that you don't understand,Then you suffer,Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no."

VBought this pair of headphones several months back when I saw them discounted at $30. I had been wanting to buy a pair of quality headphones, and had initially planned on getting a pair of the Audio Technica ATH-M50x, but I decided to try these out instead. Needless to say, I'm glad that I did. Let me say it right now, I am not an audiophile, but I do know what I like and what sounds good to me, and these are perfect. They have a nice look and feel to them, they're extremely comfortable (I wear them at work all day), and most importantly, they sound great. I'm not going to go in-depth about the highs, mids, and bass, but I will say that I like bass, so that was a key factor as far as I'm concerned. My musical tastes include metal, rock, rap, classical, soul, bluegrass, etc... I even listen to podcasts, and no matter what it is, it all sounds good coming through these headphones. With that said, even if I had paid $100 for this pair, they would have been worth every penny. The quality of sound, at least for me, is exactly what I was looking for, and at such a low price, I'm glad I took a chance on them.P.S.~ These will also work as a PS4 headset with the other set of cables that are included in the packaging. Obviously, you don't have as much control as far as game sound/chat sound is concerned, but it works well enough if frugality is your friend.

VI bought these on a lightning deal for $38.00 with free shipping.CONSTRUCTION:  They are more comfortable than my all-plastic Sony MDRZX300 headphones.  The Wraiths look and feel great.  There is a lot of chromed metal on these headphones.  To me they look sort of  "steampunk classy".  I like that the cord is detachable and can be replaced if damaged. (less planned obsolescence). The frame and construction look and feel durable.THE SOUND:  Initial impressions on sound quality:  They are more bass heavy - I notice electric bass strings in particular more - not so much kick drum.  The high frequencies are a bit distant.  Treble is not "crisp" or standout (headphones are not fully broken in, this may improve a bit, we'll see).  I think that those that enjoy delicate jazz cymbal work may find these lacking.  My Sony MDRZX300 would not produce the bass these Symphonized Wraith's produce but the highs on the Sony are much more "there" and transparent and the bass is more clinically honest.  (NOTE:  The MDRZX300's are half the price of these Wraith's and they are a good value for what they are.)  Don't get me wrong, the Wraith's sound good.  The bass is a tilt to more bass and lower mids, not some overwhelming overkill.  I just found myself going through a short period of adjustment to the different tonality.PHYSICAL and AUDITORY "COMFORT":  Saving grace, the good news:  If I play the Wraiths at moderate volume, I DO NOT EXPERIENCE EAR FATIGUE, not physically or perceptually over long periods of time.  I find I can literally "wear these for hours".  I have large ears and these fit on, and slightly over, my ears without discomfort. Very cushy padding yet the band pressure doesn't feel like it's squeezing my head or suffocating my ears or making them sweat.SUMMARY:  I CAN RECOMMEND THESE.  For headphones under a certain point, it's pick the immediate design compromise you can live with.  I certainly can live with the design decisions made here:  the compromises are not a big deal. (I'm too busy listening to and enjoying the comfort and music.)  At $49.00 they are a decent buy, I can recommend these.  For the $38.00 I paid they are a steal.If you are not a fanatic but you want warm sounding comfortable headphones that look good, these are your ticket.________________________________________________________________ADDENDUM:  I solved the "cord too short" complaint some have mentioned with this:  https://www.amazon.com/Super-Extension-Connectors-Conductor-Black-2Feet-2Pack/dp/B017SEHZZI/ref=cm_cr-mr-title  works great.

VDisappointing, especially after the Symphonized "Earphones" (and the slightly more expensive Sony V6's)
p132
sg5
V[NOTE: The following evaluation might initially seem confusing unless the reader takes note of the distinction between "head" phones and "ear" phones.]I ordered these because of my positive experience with the Symphonized Wood NRG and Xtasy earphones, which I found the best sounding, best fitting, most durable earphones in their price range ($25).  These full-sized Symphonized headphones, on the other hand, appear to be on the right track, but they strike me as "unfinished" compared to the same company's superior earphones.  If these are your first pair of full-sized headphones, and if you haven't owned a pair of the miniatures, you should be quite happy with them.  It's only in the comparisons that some phones tower above others.In this case, I started with a pair of Sony MDRV6 phones, which Amazon had briefly discounted to the identical price of the Symphonized Wraith's.  Over the years the Sony MDRV6 and Sony MDR7506 phones (which I use every week) have not only been virtual twins but have shared the same price--usually $100.  In my judgment the MDRV6's are worth twice the price of the Symphonized Wraith phones, which do not strike me as worth twice the price of the Symphonized earphones. In reaching the following conclusion, I did A-B comparisons, frequencies flat, no equalization:1. CONSTRUCTION:  The ratio of wood to medal and plastic seems negligible compared to the "mostly" wooden Symphonized earphones.  Moreover, the wood on the large phones is so hard and shiny it hardly looks authentic: It may as well be plastic.2. BUILD.  The phones use the double-sided cables of many non-professional phones (e.g. Sennheiser HD202). Moreover, the cables are approximately the same diameter as those on the company\u2019s tiny earphones. At least the cables, which must be attached to 4 inputs (two per side), are easily replaced should there be a problem like a short or total loss. And Symphonized has thoughtfully included an extra set of 2 cables.3. COMFORT.  Very little, at least compared to their small siblings or the Sony MDRV6\u2019s.  The Symphonized Wraiths sit quite loosely on top of the head and \u201con\u201d the ears, blocking out little sound.  By contrast, the cushy V6's felt like my own personal, custom-made phones from the moment I slipped into them.4. SOUND: The most important and most disappointing aspect. Perhaps the Symphonized Headphones put out the \u201cbiggest,\u201d most prominent (often "thud-like"), bass, but not that much more than a well-fitted pair of Symphony Earphones.  And the bass seems to come at the expense of the mid to high frequencies, which are more present and vibrant on the same company\u2019s earphones and the Sony V6\u2019s. Some listeners may see an advantage in the absence of any high-frequency \u201chiss\u201d in the Symphony Headphones, but while playing multiple audio files of recorded solo piano I was impressed by the Sony V6\u2019s ability to expose the flaws in the inferior MP3 files. In short, the full-sized Symphony Headphones sounded \u201cdistant,\u201d bass-heavy and rather cold despite the claims about better warmth imparted by wood.There are other considerations that some may find of no importance.  In terms of \u201cpresentation,\u201d for example, the Symphonized Headphones\u2019 paper-thin box with burlap-sack \u201ccase\u201d struck me as a flimsy \u201crush job\u201d compared to the elegant, sumptuous Sony V6\u2019s seated on rich satin cloth inside a \u201cshowcase\u201d of ebony and laminate, with a leather-like carrying case and instruction booklet (no instruction included with the Symphonies).Both the Sony V6\u2019s and the Symphonized Earphones seemed whole, complete, each of a piece.  The Sony\u2019s thick, long and single-sided cable put it in the league of the best Studio Monitors (I prefer the Sony VR6 to the Sony 7506 phones that succeeded the flawless VR6's.)  I auditioned all three phones with instrumental music (symphonic, solo piano, jazz), which is my customary music diet.  Perhaps my expectations were unrealistically high because of the surprising all-around quality of the Symphonized earphones.  Of one thing I\u2019m absolutely certain: the full-sized Symphonized headphones are no "value" when compared to either the same company\u2019s earphones or to the Sony VR6\u2019s (or 7506\u2019s, which I did not use in my A-B comparisons).Conclusion: Sony began with full-sized headphones before offering "down-sized" alternatives in earphones conformed to a radically different design.  Symphonized earphones incorporate the best features of existing good earphones into a state-of-the-art (if derivative) design at a fair price, making these the ones to own.  But in coming out with a full-sized model, the company appears to offer a "mocked-up version" of these highly successful and effective earphones, redeploying the cables and circuitry of the miniatures for their exploded descendants.  It's a stretch--one with no small amount of haste combined with over-reach.Note: Should the Sony V6's be unavailable, you should be equally satisfied with the Sony 7506's.  Or for full-sized headphones that come close in comfort and sound (but not build quality or durability), the Koss UR-40's are a good, reasonably-priced,  alternative (five years ago they were $30).

VLong review!!!Pros: Clean crisp sound. Decent Bass.Cons: Microphonics for cords. Glasses wearers might have issues. Movie and TV soundOK This is my first headphone review so please be easy.I am not much on technical terms and such.I know what I like but is difficult to come to words at times.A little about me:Love most kinds of music from Jpop to Classical to Showtunes to Hairbands. Most things after 1990 are not much of an interest to me musicallyMy gear is PC thru HDMI to Yamaha RX-v665 ( burr brown op amps on all channels incl headphones output)Sennheiser HD428  HD439  HD558Symphonized WraithEnuff of me  on to the show:Pros : Sonically excellent. They are a bit low in bass in the 50-100Hz in my estimates.  Sub bass is present and good overall for the price  Mids are clear and not overpowering  Highs are a bit on the warm side. Not boosted like a lot of headphones.Cons : MICROPHONICS. Cords are a determent to the cans.  Comfort issues if you wear glasses  Unforgiving for poor sources.Bought these from Amazon.com when they were on sale for $38.99Shipping was a bit longer than I had hoped for but they were shipped from Symphonized themselvesThese headphones come with 2 sets of cords. Both are about 4.5 feet long and terminate into a 45° 3.5mm jack.NO  1/4" adapter supplied..... shame shame.Packaging is your standard fare.HeadphonesCloth storage bag.cord for Android/IOS with mute buttoncord for straight 3.5mm jacksDesign reminds me of Skullcandy AviatorsCords are a cloth sleeve design which is a determent to the headphones since they do "microphonics" and transmit movement to the headphones at a decent rate of noise.Sitting still in a room is ok but on the go I can see these becoming an issue.Over all quality is ok but the wires do seem thin and might break with rough use.Headphones are of stainless steel in a good thickness and will not bend under normal use. Cans are laquered wood on the covers and have a memory foam leatherette covers.These are very comfortable for On-Ear phones even tho I perfer OVER-Ear phones.There is plenty of adjustment for people with larger headsMy only issue is that they are a bit tight initially in the upper part of the headphone and wearing glasses with the slight pressure MIGHT be an issue for some after sometime.On to the sonic quality.Using Foobar 2000 v1.37 No Eq. No enhanced pluginsCome Fly With My - Frank Sinatra - Silver Box 24bit/96kHz vinyl 2803 bitrate : Vocals are clean and crisp. His voice is clean without any resonance. Orchestrals are a bit harsh and slightly distorted.Styx - Paradise Theater - 1980 - Too Much Time on My Hands 893kbps : Vocals are a bit more subdued but still pleasant. Bass is strong but not overpowering. Highs are excellent and crisp. The  beginning drum notes in the first 20 secs of song can be heard traveling from right,center,left just as it was recorded.Bass 305 - Pump Up the Bass - 1982 - 1418kbps. Digtal and electronic voice sound are clean and understandable. Highs are present and not overpowering. Bass is good. Subsonic is lacking from 50Hz  down. It is there but not with as much punch as I would expect. Midbass is not muddy.Billy Joel - 1998 Remaster - The Stranger - 2404kbps :  Piano instrumental and whistling in the beginning are excellent and clear. No harmonics. Vocals are a bit recessed ( possibly the song itself ).  Bass is present and a tad punchy with good snap and control.Dire Straits - Brother in Arms - 1996 Remaster -Your Latest trick - 796kbps : Horns in beginning of song are phenomenal. Slight echoes in song are clearly heard and pleasant. Vocals are excellent  Graininess in his voice is evident and can be heard. Highs are the best so far and extremely pleasing.Dire Straits - Brother in Arms - 1996 Remaster  Ride Across the River -  796kbps : Bass is snappy and tight and controlled. Good punch to them. Vocals are again clean and crisp. Woodblock  instrument can clearly bit picked up in the song. Harmonics in guitar in great.Star Wars Main Theme - London Philharmonic Orchestra - Excellent quality.Videos and Movies: Here is the issue. Listening to "The 100" tv show with these headphones and some things are missing. Bass is low and vocals seem to be muffled a tad. Trying the same show with the HD558's and there is a clear difference.Conclusion: Good headphones if bought on sale. For the $60 regular price, there are better.**** Update******Headphones are broken in now and things are a bit different.Bass is still decent BUT lower bass could be stronger.Mids are still excellentHighs are calming down a bit.Ordered a 2.5mm to 3.5mm y-jack cable to replace this God awful microphonics in the original cable.Liking these better and betterIf your source material is bad, boy, wlll these let you know. 128kbps mp3s are bad with these.The headphones are really good for this price ONCE burn is has occurred.Updating my rating on these to 4 stars!!

VThe retro design of these is awesome..
p144
sg5
VGot mine in as well. Comparing them to my current portable headphones, my V-Moda M80s (about $150 when I purchased them two years ago), these actually stack up really well, considering the V-Moda M80 was critically acclaimed of its time.Looks:The retro design of these is awesome... The wood just looks great. They look almost like wooden skullcandy aviators. I also consider my M80 very classy looking as well, so I'd say they tie in this department.Comfort:Definitely the Wraith. These are really comfortable for on-ears. The earcups swivel to move with your ears, they just fit really well. Even with glasses on. The V-Moda's get uncomfortable after awhile, even more so with my glasses on.Durability:The Wraith seems pretty decent, but only time will tell with them. Wouldn't be surprised to see them fall apart if I'm not careful with them, but I'd say they are at least average if not slightly above. Not a match for the V-Moda M80s though. Durability is just top notch on the M80s, I've thrown them around so much in 2 years, and they still hold up really well.Sound:The Wraith... Is REALLY good for it's price point. I got these for $40 but even at $60, still really good, could easily sell for $80-100 and still be as good. Not as good as the V-Moda's, and definitely not as neutral. I would never use the Wraith for mixing. But they are a fun sounding headphone, great for listening to most popular genres. EQ in a bit of a treble boost and they improve a bit more. I would say they are even better than the Skullcandy aviators, and close to the on-ear momentum headphones as well, and those are both headphones I actually thought were pretty decent for their price until I found these.Value:Get these... At $40 you would be hard-pressed to find another headphone this good... At $60 it would still be hard to find another headphone this good. The only other sub-$100 headphone that I've heard this good is the Creative Aurvana live, but they aren't exactly a visually pleasing headphone like this one is. I paid $150 for the V-Modas, more than 3x what I paid for these, and the Wraith certainly isn't 3x better, I wouldn't even consider them 2x better. Even if just a portable backup beater headphone, or a gift, at $60 these are a great deal, and an absolute steal at anything less.I have yet to test Isolation with these, but they seem to be okay in that department as well. Check out the Symphonized facebook page, that's how I found the deal on these to get them for $40, they put many of their products on sale quite often.

VI am a collector of all kinds of headphones...Open Back, Closed Back, Sennheiser, AKG, Beyerdynamic, Grado, House Of Marley, Audio-Technica, Sentey, Bose, RHA...and I'm forgetting some for sure. Simply, these headphones are wonderful. Except for the thin metal headband that is a lot more comfortable than it looks, I was delightfully surprised. The wood ear cups are beautiful. I wore them for an extended amount of time with little to no fatigue. Nice padding on the ears with enough pressure for good noise isolation while still remaining very comfortable. Clean sound through the mids to the highs. No real muddiness and not exaggerated or overly bright. The bass was deep but not overly thumpy which blended nicely to the overall presentation of the music. I listened to them streaming directly from my Ipad, vinyl through from my Adcom preamp, as well as through three different headphone amplifiers from CD. (The Music Hall PH25.2, PS Audio GCHA & Music Fidelity V90HPA) I listened to the following on all. (Van Morrison's Poetic "The Mystery", the punchy horn production from Tower Of Power "What is Hip" Live & the beautiful singing cello from Han-Na Chang "The Swan" I could give you an indepth analysis of all but I will just finish just with this...These headphones performed exceptionally well through all mediums and delivery systems, but absolutely exploded to life through my stereo preamp listening to the vinyl tracks of each. What these headphones were able to produce was amazing, and for $59.00 I suggest that you buy two....because you'll want another pair someday after you wear these out.

VGood out of the box, amazing with new pads.
p156
sg5
VThe "tl;dr" summary: Out of the box, these are a step above the headphones you normally find at this price range. With $20 pads, they can knock on the door of headphones twice their price.I bought these a few months ago as a curiosity, as I already had a pair of AKG K550 closed-back headphones for the noisy office environment. Out of the box, they sound like a quality pair of $50 headphones, pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Build quality is higher than most in this price bracket, sound is pretty much on par, with the added warmth the wood imparts, and the comfort is surprisingly good for semi-on-ear headphones (If you have tiny ears, they'll be over ear, but for most they'll be semi at best). In short, great, but not enough to supplant the K550s at work.Then I swapped on a pair of HM5 leather pads. Everything I said about so-so comfort and decent sound was immediately wiped away, these are amazingly good headphones with the new pads. Be mindful, they still don't reach AKG levels in most departments, but they were so close my AKGs now live with my home system and these haven't left my office since. Paired with an iPod 5g and Cmoy amplifier, these things are an absolute joy to listen to.The biggest downside (aside from the stock pads) is the cord. Even the slightest movement will transmit to the headphone, I suspect it's the combination of thin wires and the fabric covering that scratches and scrapes on clothes. Supposedly SOL Republic cables will work with these, might be a worthy upgrade.

VI bought these based on the great reviews, great value and the sound and features. They also are a work of art, with the wood making this the best looking pair of headphones ever.  I am still breaking them in.  I was previously using 100 Bose headphones to listen to my iPad, but they didn't keep outside noise out. What I was looking for were headphones that I could use with my IPad to watch Netflix, Amazon, Huluplus, HBO go.  With time, they will also be used with more music.  I really like the comfort of the seal to my head/ears, even after hours of listening.I also love the accuracy of the sound placement. The closest I can compare it to were those old quadraphonic headphones. Sounds, spoken word, music all are crisp and clear. No heavy bass or exaggerated effects, just accurate sound.  One year warranty.  I have had a lot of headphones over the years, mainly over the ear.....but these are my favorites.  Yes, you can spend 300 dollars on audiophile headphones, but I think 99 percent of listeners would not be able to tell them apart.  I have never heard of this brand before, but I am glad I read the excellent reviews.  Amazon reviews really help me make buying decisions, it's a great system.  By the way, they give you TWO headphone cables.They are NOT designed for heavy abuse, like my cats chewing on them.  My solution was a heavy duty headphone extension to keep the cats away.  I strongly recommend these headphones if you want comfortable, lovely, great sounding headphones without spending a lot of $$$$

VI never write reviews. I either don't have time or simply don't care enough to write it. This product in particular is so good, I had to write about it. Sometimes things are not as good as people say they are, other times people complain about the smallest most ridiculous things. The trick is to try to find a happy balance at the time of reading these reviews.These headphones are not only extraordinary handling a full tonal range, but are also incredibly comfortable. They are described as "on-ear" headphones, but the cushions are big enough to fit your full ear if you are on the smaller side. The triangular shape also helps your ear to not get tired of the pressure. It pressures your ear more towards the top tip, than the bottom.They have a small tilt and swivel, so once you adjust them to your most comfortable position, you would not want to take them off.The price is fantastic. The wood sides makes them unique, elegant and also plays a good part on the fantastic sound they produce. Like any music instrument, the wood influences the acustics of the sound.It comes with two sets of cables. Independent each. One of the sets has a microphone and music controller, the other one is plain. Both sets connect to both sides of the headphones. That might be annoying for some people, but unless you are really picky about one or two cables, shouldn't be a big issue. If you don't like cables, just get Bluetooth ones.Just get them, you won't be disappointed.

VThis is an excellent product. I can't even imagine how Symphonized/Amazon can afford to sell it at such a discount. I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 headphones that I use for my laptop, which I run through a sound processing engine on my mac. I have an iPod Classic, but I rarely use it for lack of decent pair of portable headphones. (The iPod isn't powerful enough to drive the Sennheisers.) I caught a glimpse of these headphones on Amazon, and thought it would be a great chance to make good use of my iPod again. I went for it, and was not disappointed.These sound best with the EQ off on the iPod. The sound is warm and offers a degree of complexity in the lower/mid range which is nice. The bass is not at all overbearing or thumping. It's very relaxing and tasteful. Because it is tilted towards the lower range, there might be a little lacking in the higher ranges, but I don't really feel like I'm missing much. Depending on the type of music you play, sometimes you don't even recognize the character of the sound, and forget you're even wearing headphones! I think that's the best you can ask for any music-playing device.p.s. The headphones have really great build quality, and comes with a really nice fabric bag. They feel nice to handle and wear. They look good too and should fit on any size head.

VThese sound GREAT and block out sound wonderfully! Already sent all my friends the URL because this is a quality product that is a lot cheaper to comparable products that you can spend up to and more than double the price! Very impressed! Bought the Wraith for myself, let the woman use them and she said she wanted a pair, so when I searched the same product, found that the Wraith 2.0 was out... I don't hear much difference in the audio, which is excellent, but they're more round and cover more of the ear than the original Wraiths... Thought I have small ears so they're still perfect for me!! We both live these headphones, and I'm thinking about getting the ear buds too. How many headphones actually use wood for their casing?? Think about it, my home theater system speakers are all real wood casings, and the better the wood the better the sound! Why would I by plastic home theater speakers?? And NOW, why would I want anything other than wood for my headphones????Going to cut and paste this review for my other Wraith headphones, because it applies to both

VWhat can I say that hasn't been already said? I was looking for headphones with a replaceable cord so I wouldn't have to keep shelling out money every time the thin wires most headphones come with fail. I also wanted something that wasn't mostly or all environmentally unfriendly plastic and wasn't $100+. $50 was my limit and luckily the Wraith 2.0 satisfied all three of my requirements. I'm not an audiophile so I can't really say whether the sound of the Wraith can compete with some of the higher end brands, but they sound better than any headphones I've ever owned. Given that this company (Symphonized) elected to make a headphone with a replaceable cord, constructed a large part of it with renewable materials, priced it at well below sub $100, offers to replace the cord free of charge and has incredible customer care, it appears they have a lot of integrity. Even though I will probably not need to replace these headphones, just to support the company, I intend to buy a second pair with the Amazon gift cards I expect to receive sometime over the holidays.

VPros:  Price, looks, sound, quality, comfort, two detachable cords.Cons:  On the ear fit unless you have smaller ears.I bought these because they were heavily discounted and I am glad I did.  They are more comfortable and have more bass than most on the ear headphones.  I wear glasses so I usually use higher end around the ear phones, but I still use these occasionally when I am relaxing without my glasses.  The wood (Cherry) looks great and enhances the bass response.  They needed no break-in period like some of my more expensive headphones and played much louder then other sets so you can use them with just about any source.  I play my Iphone at half volume with these headphones and I can't even use some of my higher end cans on a cell phone.  They came with two cables, one a simple stereo cable and the other with cell phone controls inline.  Altogether I like everything about the sound and quality of them, the only reservation is that I might scratch the beautiful lacquered Cherry wood finish.

VMy wife just got me these as an unexpected present.  After dealing with a seemingly endless parade of earbuds, I was ready for a nice pair of around the ear headphones.  I have been really impressed with the sound quality.  I've listened to a variety of music on them.  Everything from "The Planets" by Gustav Holst, Ed Sheeran's X album, some very bass heavy techno/house/trance, Frank Sinatra, smooth jazz, etc. The very heaviest bass gets a little distorted but the mid and high range sounds are crisp.  It does a good job too of picking up the minutiae like breath sounds (which for me make it feel like I'm listening live rather than to a recording).  You can definitely spend a lot more on headphones and probably get a little more sound quality.  But for the price, these headphones are outstanding...and very nice looking to boot.  The wood and stainless steel look combo is just sexy and makes them look like they cost five times what they do.  Definitely recommend them.

VJust got these as replacements for my lower-end skullcandys.  These are probably the best looking headphones I've ever seen (in my humble opinion) - very classy versus the regular black or colored ones that are out there.Sound is great, and these are much more comfortable than my last pair.  They rest nicely around my ears (I'm a full grown man and my ears are fully covered) and they don't feel like a clamp on my head.  I also like how you can remove the cord from the earpieces, but they snap in nice and tight.  I wear headphones a lot listening to music and audiobooks while up and about.  Previously my cord would get caught on things here and there while leaning over, and would pull the headphones right off my head.  With these, the cord should just pop out instead, so that's nice.Overall very happy with these - very nice if you aren't looking to drop a few hundred bucks on a pair of headphones.

VPros: Great sound with a great look. I see a lot of people wearing headphones in the morning on the train to work, none of them have wood! The build is solid, it feels like its going to last me a decade as long as the speakers hold out. Comes with two cords (one with mic/ button and one without). Its a braided cord so it doesn't get caught on things and slides over things easily. I wish they did this with all their products. Hard to beat at this price point for the quality. Also the cord length is perfect for me when I'm on my phone or at my computer.Cons: Its heavier than most which is a sacrifice from the stainless steal construction. This may take some getting used to if your accustom to light headphones. The adjustments all the way to the smallest size its just about right for me and I consider myself to have  medium size head. Not an issue for me but potentially for some with small heads.

VVery pretty, and good sound, especially for the mids and trebles. But sharp metal edges snag my girlfriend's curly hair frequently. Also, the cord broke soon after getting it. The cord just plugs into the phones and is easily replaceable. The plugs are each mono, and no third-party replacement is available anywhere that I can find.*Update* Good news! They mailed me a replacement cord, and told me that additional replacement cords would also be free! Nevertheless, if you tend to be hard on your cords, you might want to check out their Bluetooth headphones... However, the advantage of the corded version is that for phone calls, the cord has a mic that dangles in front of your mouth giving excellent pick-up. The Bluetooth version, in contrast, has complaints about lack of mic pick-up.

VMeh. For $40 to $50, these are good -- they're eye-catching and they're a good gift. But the sound quality is no better than Pioneer SE-E721 earphones, which are plastic, over-ear headphones. After having read rave reviews, I expected these headphones would give me a live sound or concert hall experience but really they're just another pair of headphones. My guess is that for top sound, I ought to worry less about headphones and more about the quality of the recording and the playback device. I have Symphonized Wraith 2.0 in Cherry and they're comfortable but don't seem to be noise cancelling and their sound, though good, is not particularly impressive. This is a good buy for someone after stylish headphones.

When I plugged these headphones into my iBasso PB2 headphone amp (used to run my Hifimans) these came alive on a whole other level. They are good unamped but really become way better amped.

VThese are great entry / mid level cans! I've owned my pair for about a year and a half now, after purchasing and enjoying their NRG buds. My comparison headphones are Audio Technica's ATH-40, a flat EQed pair of studio headphones.Sound:The Wraiths are EQed somewhat bassy, but not notably compared to other headphones many users are accustomed to. Lows and kicks are great for this reason, but some detail can be lost if you're listening to music played on, say, an electric bass. Synths at all ranges handle very well on these cans, but mids and highs can get washed out, and highs are somewhat flat. They don't sound tinny, but sometimes snares and high hats lack their pop. Because of the way the headphones fit (the ear cups are very small, but I have small ears so they act as over ear headphones for me) the room of the sound can feel somewhat closed. Overall, good sound for the price though!Build Quality:These have been my daily drivers for a year and a half, they go in and out of a backpack constantly, and the finish on the wood and metal band is still perfect. The adhesive attaching the foam band liner to the metal has worn off a little, but nothing significant, and probably my fault from poking it. The wood looks a little fake (or is?) because of how it's lacquered, but still looks great and distinctive. The headphones are very lightweight and comfortable, I've worn them for hours while coding and never gotten pain. My Y-Cable broke in the left channel just a couple weeks ago, but the nylon cord is good, and this brings me to my final point.Customer Service:I contacted Symphonized about the broken Y cable, and also mentioned that one of the channels in my NRG buds had gone out (I'm hard on headphones...). Within a day, they had gotten back to me, and no questions asked replaced the cable and the buds with no charge for shipping or requiring me to send in the faulty product. Shipping was standard, arrived 4 business days after ticket was resolved; pretty good for this sort of thing! I was not asked to write this review or anything, but this is what pushed me to do so. This replacement occurred after my warranty had expired, so major kudos there!Overall:I know I've mentioned a few negatives in this review, but I'm just creating perspective and attempting to develop a comparison to more expensive headphones. When I bought the Wraiths they were $49, and at the time of writing they are $60. I have not tried other headphones in this price point, but if you are somewhat of an audiophile I would recommend stepping up your purchase to a more premium pair. Otherwise, I don't know if these go on sale, but they are definitely worth $50, and still worth $60.

VI've been through many pairs of on/over ear headphones trying to find just the right ones.  I finally found them and got more than expected.  This review if for the casual music lover - I apologize in advance for language that won't make sense to an audiophile.The sound is exactly what I've been looking for.  I'm not an audiophile, but I do expect clear, crisp sound and "real" sounding bass.  I can't stop listening to music with these, its just so nice.  I listen to everything from country to folk to rock to jazz to classical and everything sounds great.  I put some Jay-z on just to hear something with bass and it sounds great too.  I put some Pearl Jam on and it was just so clear.  You could pick out each drum, guitar, etc.  The bass drum sounds what a bass drum sounds like where other headphones it seems to be more muffled or not easily able to hear each drum / instrument.So that was great, I finally found the sound I'd been looking for, which qualifies for a 4 star review.  Here is why I gave these a 5 star:These headphones are a work of art.  The pictures don't do them justice.  The wood is beautiful and the metal looks great.  There are many details that make them so nice to look at.  Looking at these, they look like at least $200 headphones.They are comfortable.  The ear cushions are almost a triangle shape and they are very soft.  You almost don't even feel them on your ears.  They are "on" ear, not over ear.  Which I think is good because they are just the right size, not too big.  They might be a tad bit top heavy, but when fit right, they don't slide off.  I do feel the cushion on the top of my head, but its not annoying.Minor details worth noting are the nice bag it comes with which you will want to use because these things are so pretty, you won't throw them around.  You also get two sets of cables, which is a nice touch.  The cables are even impressive.  They look gold plated but parts that plug into each ear piece has matching wood on it - subtle, but a nice touch that shows attention to detail.  One last thing that I seem to like is the shape of the end that plugs into your phone.  Its sort of shaped with a 45 degree angle that makes plugging in a bit easier and you know its in all the way.  Minor detail I never would have thought mattered, but I like it.At the end of the day, these are perfect for me listening to music at work all day.  So comfortable, amazing sound, and they look like a work of art.

p263
sg5
VI have owned a couple headphones and a couple good ear buds over the years, and this one beats them all. Im not what you would consider an audiophile, as while I do look for the nicest sound possible I dont go out of my way for it.First off these are not "crisp" as in the sound is perfectly reproduced. I've owned one pair of headphones I would say were "crisp" which was a pair of $60 panasonics that sounded really nice, but didn't last long before they shorted out. These produce a much more natural acoustic type sound, as if the musicians playing were right there with you.Right out the box I realized how nice the build quality was, it was nice and heavy, seemed durable, and looked rather nice. As for comfort I'd say these are very comfortable, although the ear pads are made of a synthetic leather type material that can get warm and possibly sweaty when worn for a while.I mostly use these for vinyl, and I plug these into the preamp. I've also used them on my computer and phone, and they've substantially improved the audio quality.Classical music sounds really good with these, I played a record of an orchestra playing a Tchaikovsky composition, and it sounded amazing.Rock sounds warm and with just the proper amount of fuzz. I tested these with a first issue "Physical graffiti", "The Rise of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars", and "Disintegration".Metal and punk rock sound appropriately punchy and loud.Hip Hop sounds clear and deep.

Vlarge ON-EAR headphones makes for odd fit
p268
sg5
Vlarge ON-EAR headphones.Fit - size - buildThese are not fully over the ear. I wish the headphones were about 5mm wider. Size wise these are in-between on-ear and over-ear. This will mean if you have small ears they will fit inside the cushions. I have average ear size and my ears do not fit fully inside the cushions.  The cushions are very comfortable. But this is an odd fit. They do get hot after a while. The build is great metal and wood is put together well with only a little 'Flex' in the headphones. The cable is a little thin but it is braided with left and right markers. Con - the headphones do not have a left and right marker on them. Only the cables have left and right markers. That is really dumb.SoundThe sound is great. These are Warm sounding headphones. Not neutral and Not bass crazy. I would say: slightly elevated highs, normal mids, elevated lows. This sound profile makes the mids sound more recessed than they really are.I have not used the mic yet.Over all I decided I will keep them. I travel a lot these will make a good pair of on the go headphones. they are cheap enough and sound decent enough that if they break or get stolen. I won't be too mad.EDIt: after wearing them for 2 hours I found I could not get used to the odd fit. They are half on half off my ears. Just feels weird the more  I wear them. Returning them now while i can to buy a larger pair.

p274

VThey are perfectly fine, they just didn't fill my expectations. And apparently I had too nice of headphones as a reference.They really aren't bad, even though they have a very colored sound. Heavier on the mid-bass, more recessed in several regions of the mid-high and high range. With that said, they have a nice sounding color, not fatiguing. They do benefit from a burn-in, they tighten up a bit and the sound stage opens slightly. Build quality is good, they have some wiggle and flex to them, but feel like they would take a beating. The cords are thin, but seemed fine. I'm sure they will go first, so it's nice that you get 2.I ended up letting them go, as my intended use wasn't satisfied. I was hoping that they would do a stand-in for passive (or active) noise canceling phones for work and on planes. And these were fine, just not to the level of what I wanted. For what it's worth, I got the monoprice 10010 instead, and I'm happy with the decision (they sound similar to the wraiths, but block way more noise and are more comfortable for me). Sometimes you just have to try stuff yourself I guess, all the positive reviews aside.For context, I have a Senn HD202 and Monoprice 8323 on the low end, and ATH AD-700 and DT880 Pros. I'd place these pretty close (slightly better) to the monoprice 8323 in sound, and much more comfortable to wear/look at.Recap; I had too high of expectations, but for the price ($40), I think they sound very good. Their forte is in the looks department, unfortunately that part didn't matter much to me. Hopefully this additional perspective helps. I'm likely in the minority for what I wanted.

VGood, not great.  I had my eye on these for weeks after reading multiple reviews praising them so much.  Theyre not bad at all, but theyre also not amazing.  The fit and finish first of all was disappointing.  The wood on mine came scratched on BOTH sides.  The silver surrounding the wood is cheap silver painted plastic, and it looks it.  The wood is very thin, I doubt very much youre getting any real benefit of wood, I thik its more for appearance to be honest.  But there is a lot to like here too.  The noise isolation is quite good.  Aside from the fit and finish issues I mentioned, the rest of this set is gorgeous.  The wood looks really sharp from a few feet away.  The rest of the frame is real metal and looks it.  The adjustments for size have a nice, solid click that is very satisfying.  Theyre not heavy at all for what they are.  I do wish they were a bit louder than they are.I got these for $39 so Im pretty happy, but I really wish they at least didnt show up scratched up.  Otherwise, pretty nice but probably not crazy better than some of my other headsets.  BTW, the cables with the mic DO work with Android which is nice.  Im using them with my Galaxy Note 4 and I have decent track control with the button.  IF you can get them for $39, I do highly recommend them.

VI wanted to wait until the headphones broke in some before I reviewed them.  I use these for music, gaming and to talk to family/friends overseas via Skype.  The quality is awesome!  It does not have a mic which is fine with me as I use a Studio Condenser mic along with these.  I am sure some folks who have bionic hearing will find a flaw in them but if you are human and not a cyborg then your ears will be delighted.  They are very comfortable and I love the way they look and feel on my head.  I game for sometimes 3+ hours and my ears don't get sweaty or do I feel like I need to take them off.  Honestly I forget they are on at times and I get up and walk away from the PC dragging these out of the audio jack.  I am 6'5 and have a larger size dome.  These adjust nicely and have enough room to maybe fit Andre the Giants head if he were still with us.  Bottom line, for the price, give it a shot.  If you are looking to spend hundreds on some headphones then feel free and pass these up for the pricier options.  Me personally... I will take these and a few cases of good beer with the money I saved over the more expensive options.  Cheers!

Just enough cushionMic- Very clear (better than speaker phone) and walking the streets in NYC, my family can hear me when I make a call. I dont have to yell.Design:- there is a 3.5 jack to the audio and the other end splits into two for the left/right ear. (unlike skullcandy which has one single cord inserted to one ear) Meaning you can switch left/right sound to your liking- wish that it folded- wood has a clear coating which i dont like. doesn't feel like straight wood. almost like a plastic lining overWill buy another as a gift to my boyfriend to replace his skullcandy worth double this excellent product!

VI may not be a true audiophile, but I do appreciate good music and quality headphones. I did a side-by-side comparison against JVC HA-S400-B, Sony MDRZX100 and Sony MDR7502 Studio Headphones, Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphones and Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor Headphones. The Wraiths did better than all of the above except the Audio-Technica, which I thought were just as good. The sound was a little different, but not better or worse. If you want something better, you\u2019ll probably have to spend $200 or more.The construction quality, comfort and weight are fantastic. Overall, the sound quality is impressive. It very accurately replicates the nuances of the original vocals and instrumentals. The wood casing really does seem to brighten and liven the sound from the driver while preserving the resonance of the bass. I listened to a variety of classical music, movie scores, bluegrass, classic rock and some country. All of the music was at high bit-rate. I love these headphones! Highly recommended!

VFantastic Headphones
p316
sg5
VThese headphones are truly fantastic, definitely glad I got them. For starters they look wonderful, and the stainless steel and wood finish greatly complement each other. On top of that they are extremely comfortable. Though not over the ear they still sit very well and I've been wearing them for roughly 3 hours straight with no complaints. I will admit they are a tad smaller than I imagined. As far as sound goes they are the best for the price (that I've come across so far). Bass, treble, and mids all respond very well, though the bass is a bit lacking for what I normally listen to. I did notice however that these headphones tend to make piano tracks a tad distorted if you have the volume up to high, and occasionally wind wood instruments come across as shrill. You could get better headphones if you're willing to spend more (Bose Quit Comfort series is my personal recommendation), but if you don't have enough to spend on high end headphones these are worth the price.

VThey came like everyone said in a simple package. That doesn't bother me like it did to others, all I cared about was good and sleek looking headphones that offer amazing sound for a great price to boot. These bad boys fall right in that category. My Girlfriend loved them and thought they sounded awesome and looked sexy. She just kept wanting to listen to them. I also have that problem, I find more reasons to listen to music or watch TV shows on my laptop because I want to hear these puppies shine. They sound amazing, the bass isn't over bearing like many beats I've listened too and the highs and sound from the wood cups is warm and enjoyable to listen too. They fit on my head perfectly and I can wear them for hours without it getting uncomfortable. If you want awesome looking and awesome sounding headphones these are the ones to buy, they look like something that is worth more than beats but sound better and are way cheaper, All in all amazing buy and worth the money.

VI wanted phones for casual listening to FM and CDs in bed.  These look expensive, apparently real wood and stainless.  But small; the ear openings are only 1-3/8 by 2-1/8.  I tried tucking my earlobes in, but the earcups are so soft they conformed just fine.  Very lightweight; I wore them for several hours and never noticed them.  Note that the two sides are identical, and left and right are defined by which cable you plug in.  The sound is OK for my purpose, but as noted by others the highs are muted.  Even the treble control on my preamp couldn't compensate enough for me.  One reviewer suggested removing a foam piece covering the driver, and as soon as I figure how to disassemble them I'll try that.  Note that the cables end in 1/8 plugs, so you'll need an adapter or suitably terminated extension cable if you have 1/4 jacks on your gear.  Here's the one I use: Hosa MHE310 Female TRS 1/8-Inch to Male TRS 1/4-Inch Headphone Adapter Cable, 10-Feet

VSo my wife picked up some of the earbuds offered by symphonized. And I was pleasantly surprised with how they sounded. I thought if they can make earbuds sound this good I have to hear their over the ear headphones. I wasn't disappointed. I've not owned a pair of headphones that have made me want to listen to more and more music than these and that's really the point. Throw out all the specs you want, if you don't want to listen to more music you probably made the wrong choice. These are the right choice. These are not super flat studio monitors. These make everything you listen to sound sexy. I found details in songs I've listened to a thousand times that I'd not heard before. They talk down to subwoofer frequencies without breaking a sweat and don't have that plastic resonance that so many headphone out there have. Highly recommended. (my background is 15 years as an audio engineer, and 20 years as a musician if that helps credibility)

VFor the $$$, these are simply the best for the price... but what most people don't realize is that they come in three types of wood for a reason. As in musical instrument construction, before altering the headphones, keep in mind that different woods are used for a reason. BEFORE you buy consider this: the 3 different species of wood offered, give different frequency responses and characteristics as per their density. I strongly suggest reading up on what you may prefer and the keep in mind what music you will be listening too, such as Rap vs Classical. Walnut offers a "darker" more robust bassie response; as in Rap, Dance or even Jazz, where bass lines are prevalent.or for people who prefer bass boost. Cherry offers a bit less somewhat brighter response bringing out a bit more midrange and highs as in Classic or Alt Rock / Country. But Maple has the brightest or "warmest" response, bringing out the mid-range frequencies and brighter highs, this is useful with Classical or more Orchestrated or even acoustic arrangements featuring a wide range of instruments. But do your own research... it'll be worth it.

VGot these at a Radio Shack that was closing for super cheap. Loved them so much I found them here to buy as a gift for my brother. I'll just list the things I love about them.1. Super comfortable earpieces2. Awesome sound! They sound even better than my old beats. (Wood backs on the ear cups give them GREAT resonance)3. VERY sturdy. All the movable parts are metal so they don't get broken while being banged around in my backpack.4. Fabric wrapped cord, doesn't stick to skin while working out, also makes it stronger against wire breakage.5. Individual plugs on the ear pieces means no wires going through head piece. Also means you can unplug the cord so they aren't being flexed and possibly broken in your backpack. One of the most vulnerable points on a headphone set is where the cord enters the headset. Making that point removable is a great way to keep them from breaking.

V- Great look- Great comfort. Feels like soft pillows on the ears. Really Really soft. Didnt feel fatigue at all- Premium build quality. I mean they look like $100+ headphones.- Wood is an interesting material that I never experience in audio before. Im more open to it now after being exposed to it.- Unfortunately the sound leaves alot to be desired. I know sound is very subjective and what sounds one way to me might sound different to another. During my testing, some songs were nice and clear, nice lows, but other songs sounded muddy and really bad. Tried seeing if the equalizer would help but it didnt much.  Also I am not sure if something is wrong with mine as it requires alot of power to drive these? I have to turn both my computer and AIM player volume to 100% to get my music loud like how I like it. Other heaphones I've tested I only needed to put about 40-60%.There was also some static on the left side of ear. Cable is a bit short but I spoiled by the really really long cable that Audiotechnica gives you in their headphones.

p356
sg5
VWhy anybody is complaining about the sound quality is beyong me. Ive had a pair of Sony's, Sennheiser's, Philips, and now these. The build quality is good. The sound is good enough to where I don't have to keep my output device's volume all the way up (unlike almost every other pair of headphones I've had) The lack of volume control on the Mic wire is a luxury I can forego simply because those switches seem to short after sometime, or prevent a consistent audio level by slipping or rubbing against something like a backpack strap. The cups and cushions are decently comfy but a little shallow. Not noise cancelling, but they pass the subway test for sure. And if youre really buying these because you seek the "best" sound quality, you'll get it, but you are kidding yourself. You're buying these because they are some dope headphones and you wanna look fly... Don't lie.

VSimply the best headphones money can buy!
p362
sg5
VIf I could, I would give this product 20 stars. No, I am not a shill for Symphonized. I am, however, a music lover of very long standing. I enjoy all genres of music - and these headphones enable me to do so as never before. An involuntary "Wow" escaped my lips the first time I tried them. Let me give you an example: When I listened to "Rhapsody in Blue" (Gershwin), I could hear gentle percussion nuances that you would only hear at a live concert. A second example I used for testing was Brandi Carlile's "Dreams," the live version from the concert at Benaroya Hall in Seattle. Every instrument displayed its depth and color in ways that have to be experienced to be believed. Brandi's voice, I might add, was second to none with a tonal range and quality I had never experienced before. So, in short, run - don't walk and buy these amazing headphones!

VAmazing headphones
p368
sg5
VBought them a couple of weeks ago and have been in love with them since. Easily the best headphones I have bought on amazon! Here is what's working well for them:1 - The sound is super clear and crisp: you can hear voices coming from different distances as well as very accurate details like the plectrum hitting the body of the guitar. I bought a different brand from amazon about two years ago for more than double the price that does not even come close.2 - Comfortable: they don't pressure your head tightly but they don't seem loose or flimsy on your head either. I could wear them for quite a few hours nonstop without getting tired.3 - Detachable cords: lets you protect the cords if you are transporting the headphones often.4 - Great look: the combination of wooden and metal parts makes them look both sleek and sturdy.

p374
sg5
VIf you're looking for flat EQ, keep looking.  These headphones have a pretty aggressive passive EQ to boost bass and cut highs.Okay now that I've mentioned the EQ portion, I would say these are really nice for comfort.  I wore these for about an hour last night with no issues at all.  In comparison to the AKG M80 Mark II, these have the comfort check mark in my book.The build quality on these is phenomenal!  All metal and wood construction.  I would say the metal on these is a little rough around the edges, but for the price I couldn't ask for better.The connectors to the headphones are really nice.  They come with two styles, one to use as a phone/hands free setup (aka, plug it into your iPhone or Android device) and one that is simply a stereo headphones jack (1/8th inch I believe).

VThe headphones look and sound great, and are a great deal for the price. I would've given it 4 stars originally, but the customer support is top notch and for that alone it deserves all five.I had no issue with the black cushion part coming off, and after almost four months the headphones are still sturdy and look new. I get compliments on the style all the time, and have been asked by multiple people where I purchased them from.Sound-wise they're better than you'd expect, with clear mids, and highs that only occasionally sound tinny, and only at the highest volume setting. It does pick up a lot of the lower bass that cheaper headphones are unable to, but it doesn't always have that "punch" that comes with it. Definitely would recommend the product, and would buy them again.

p386
sg5
VThey have grown on me. My first impression I wasn't impressed but then I pulled out some older headphones for comparison. These imo sound better than any other headphone I won (Ultimate ears UE4000  and Seinheiser HD 202).These are pretty neutral sounding, which is a good thing for me. Not to punchy on the bass, not to High on the treble. I tried various EQ setting via Spotify running on the Iphone 5 but "flat" ended up sounding the best in the end. As far as looks and comfort these are 5 Stars.The wood grain is flat out sexy and the stainless is a nice contrast.Included in the contents are a carrying bag and 2 sets of cables (one has inline mic other does not).For the price I paid (35.00) They are well worth it. I'd pay up to 50-60 for these ans still consider it a deal.

p392
sg5
VThis is an entirely non-audiophile review.  I commute about three hours a day and I go through about one pair of headphones about every year and a half.  I've tried supposedly tough headphones and they already seem to break or the wires short out.  In any case, I was looking for some new, reasonably priced headphones and these turned up.  They look almost exactly like the LTSN troubadores, except they're probably $100 cheaper (or something like that).  They're not really overear headphones, but they're pretty close.  I have a big head and these headphones are really comfortable and sound really good, easily as good as Sony headphones I've had in a similar price range.  I really don't have any complaints, other than I wish they came with a hard case, but they're easy enough to get separately.

I am just comparing the sound accuracy. There is no comparison in terms of sound stage, image, impact, etc. My $12,000 system takes you to the music hall, which I do not know if any headphone is capable of doing.good price at $39.good construction for the priceI use Jriver player version 19, connected to Musical Fidelity V-dac II and then headphone amp.Minus:on the ear (prefer bigger, over the ear model)The manufacture has the potential to build more comfortable, better sounding models. I am willing to pay more for that. Consider the current model as the entry level for audiophiles

It almost matches the performance of an ATH-M30 that i own.Sound is a little "boxy"; not sure if it's because of the wood or not, but i like it.2. Great bass response.3. Physical design is good. The wood definitely makes it look premiumThe bad:1. The cords are very flimsy, and they don't tightly couple with the headset. Any movement results in distortions.2. These should not be called "circumaural". They're more like on-ear headphones; but still pretty comfortable. Not sure if i can wear these for long hours thoughOverall: Great buy for the money

VWhat a Wonderful Surprise
p410
sg5
VI have spent years looking for headphones that satisfy my hearing needs.  (And I have a drawerful.) Finally, finally I have found the Wraith, which at first really surprised me.  I always felt one shouldn't have to spend $100 and up, up, up, for excellent sound.  I was right.  I have no desire to be technical, as a well-trained audiophile that has left a detailed explanation of why these headphones are exceptional.  I just know that the quality of sound brings tears to my eyes at times.  The bass tones make my inner chest thump, and the high notes don't screech, and I'm deliciously content when I listen to my favorite classical, R & B or popular music.  Try them, they will likely make you smile with pleasure too.

VI purchased the Symphonized Wraith Premium Wood Headphones a couple of months ago through my husband's Amazon account. The gear works great, and I love the sound quality, but one of the audio jacks (from the pair provided) has already shorted out on the left side. If I'd known that they'd only last a couple of months, I might have considered a different set of headphones. Especially since I don't see the audio jacks anywhere on their website, and there's no way I'm buying the headphones again just to get audio jacks. I've emailed their customer service to request new jacks, but I haven't heard from them yet. I'll comment on their customer service, if they ever do respond.

p422

VThese headphones sound really good. They have a good balance of sound and the bass is about mid level. I'm happy with the sound.. But.......The only reason I'm rating a 3 is because both my chords already broke and I've only had them for two days. They are ridiculously cheaply made, now I'm going to have to consider buying a different brand to at least hope for chords to last longer than 2 days. I can't even use my headphones at this point. The rod you stick into your device? Yeah both of those just disappeared, without any rugged use. Basically just fell off now I can't find them or use my headphones. So make sure to just keep these at home..

p428

VI have quite a few pairs of headphones in the middle range (12 pairs in the $50 - $250 range) so i would consider myself to be a mild audiophile. I listen to many different kinds of music (Hip-Hip/Rap, R&B;, Rock, Classical, Country). With that being said, i really can't find anything that doesn't sound good in these headphones. They're really a hidden gem in sound quality and they look pretty cool too if you ask me. Bass is punchy but not overpowering, mids and highs are present and crisp. Soundstage is excellent with or without amplification. The smart construction makes them very lightweight and comfortable enough to wear all day.

Though they don't have noise-cancelling tech, the over-ear construction dampens background noise reasonably well.While I am no audiophile, these headphones exceeded my expectations - good sound quality, comfortable design, sturdy construction, pleasing aesthetics, and a reasonable price.

So at least you know you'll have a spare if anything every goes wrong with one of the cords. You get a carrying case for it which looks like it's made out of a fibre like cloth (maybe bamboo idk), It's also comfortable, and if this is your first time buying a pair of great headphones (ie you've never spent more than 50 dollars on a pair) you will be amazed at the clarity and details in some of the songs you've always listened too, because you'll be hearing all the details you've missed with ordinary speakers and ear plugs for the first time.

VThe sound reminds me of the Monster DNA on ear headphones but with better bass and warmer sound. The warmer sound likely is from the wood cups. They're are a bit bass heavy and the mids are slightly recessed but not enough to be too veiled or "V" shaped. Comfortable headband but it would be nice if the included cable also had a mic. Efficient enough to be used w/o an amp, but an amp does add extended dynamic response. Extensively same as the LSTN Troubadours without a mic or wood selections but a better headband. I sold them to my brother as his first pair of real headphones, and he's quite happy with them on his laptop and HTC M8.

VI purchased these to plug into my stereo receiver to listen to my turntable. The sound is excellent and they are comfortable to wear. My only complaint and only reason for giving four stars is that the headband isn't very solid. I expected the connections to the ear pieces to be more sturdy and the overall construction to not feel so loose. Aside from that they are a great pair of headphones.

VNot too bad, good looking, comfortable, they are on ears headphones rather than full size headphone.  The trebles may be muddies because of the foams in front of the drivers.  There is a lot of sub-bass, and bass, mid bass is a little overwhelmed.  Some trebles is showing.  All in all is a good value for the price, but nothing special. If you love bass and boom with some what trebles.

VNice set of headphones.  Sound quality is good.  Looks good.Not sure how well they will hold up.  Unfortunately a mix of high quality components (stainless and wood) and low quality components (plastic, chromed plastic, fake leather). The synthetic leather on the headband (glued on) and on the ear pieces looks / feels cheap and I expect it to crack and fail in a few years.

VOVERALL TLDR: pretty good for price. Ok sound quality, U-shaped sound response, good build, flashy looks. Muddy bass, recessed mids, harsh highs. If you are willing to jump up a price range, then you should do it.I'll start by giving background context so you can see where my opinion is coming from. I will start by saying I consider myself an audio aficionado... not quite an audiophile but I love music, have a growing collection of headphones, use an external DAC/amp, and care about fidelity more than your run-of-the-mill listener that buys a pair of Beats Studio Pros (I am a buyer myself, by the way).So here's my brief first impression, based on the fact that I got these while they were on a great sale for $38.My setup: At home I run a NuForce Icon HDP DAC. Portable, I use the iBasso DX50. I also tried plugging directly into my 2015 MBP. I listen to most kinds of music, with probably more focus on pop, hip hop, jazz, alternative, and electronic.Build:seems like it's trying to give the type of feel you get with the Skullcandy Aviators. I must say that for this price point, it looks exceptionally "cool" and "stylish". Due to business hour restrictions, I had to pick them up while meeting some friends and got many compliments... much more so than I got from my z1000s or SE535s, which understandably are much less flashy (but cost roughly 10x as much). So it's up to you if you want to attract that kind of attention. In terms of build quality, I'm also impressed; they seem sturdy while also maintaining a lightweight design. One con here is that the top padding is insufficient for me. Despite the light build, the metal band digs a little bit into my head. But it is probably easily mod-able, and at this price point I'm not really complaining. Another downside is the cable creates a good amount microphonics. I saw another review that said you can get a good replacement cable but I currently have no plans to do so.Sound:To my ears, these are very unbalanced, with a pretty extreme U-curve. To be fair, this is what the common market often desires. And then to be candidly honest, I noticed that I seem to prefer more of a flat audio response than most, even including audiophiles and aficionados. For example, others feel that the Sony z1000s have a cold sound, but I often find myself enjoying them. I can usually fiddle with the EQ to make it more pleasant to my ears, but these create such an extreme U that trying to balance them gives a very unnatural sound. The bass is muddy. The mids are recessed and unremarkable. The highs are sharp and harsh. On the bright side, these have better sound separation and sound stage than any other headphones I've heard at this price.Notes:One reviewer said you can take out some foam to improve the highs, which I might try doing.If you are a believer in burn-in, I didn't give these too much chance... I logged only around 3 hours total so far.If anything changes the sound a lot, I'll update my review.

VReview for Symphonized Wraith 2.0 Premium Genuine Wood Headphones with Mic
p678
sg5
VAfter purchasing the Sony MDR-270 Headphones (a great set, sad to report that it is discontinued), I went on the hunt for another great pair. I found these, saw the spectacular sale price, and loved the wood finish on the ear pieces. I then placed my order and waited. After using these headphones consistently for a couple hours, I have very good things to report...-Comfort- To be completely frank, these headphones are very comfortable. The over the ear design sets well on most ear types and the cushions felt padded and soft. The only time I took the headphones off my head was due to my own body heat becoming trapped in the headphones. This isn't at fault with the design though.-Sound-Unsurprisingly, the sound quality is also very good. The encapsulating design traps sound and directs it towards your ears, and not towards everyone else in the room. The sound isn't mind blowing, but it is impressive-Design-The design and over all feel of the headphones is very Modern-70's. Personally, I think the wood adds an interesting design touch, but this is really relative to your personal style. Symphonized also states that wood's acoustic properties make it great for headphone construction, but honestly; only a true audiophile will even notice such a change.-Price-For the original asking price, I would say that these headphones are priced appropriately. With the headphones and the original sound cable, you also receive a spare cable and a small drawstring bag to keep everything contained, so that's a plus. However, if you notice these headphones on sale, you're honestly doing yourself a disservice by not scooping them up before they're gone.-Conclusion-These are a great pair of headphones; they're worth your time and money due their visual and physical prowess. If you can find them for sale, do not hesitate to buy them.

p684
sg5
VReview: Symphonized Wraith.Initial Appearance:This set of headphones look a lot like the LSTN Troubadours, I'm sure that is also the intention.The look of these headphones are very flashy but in a retro cool way.Good looking cans.First Impressions:Out of the package they seem cheap when you first hold them, but that's not the case since the headphones pivot and adjust to the contours of your cranium. This makes you believe that they are rattly and loose, that's not the case at all.Looking at the build quality, these have about the same quality of build as Sennheiser Momentum Over the Ear and the Skull Candy Aviators (imho).Very nice build.Comfort:These headphones don't look cheap, and they don't feel cheap when you wear them. They are in one word Comfortable. Probably one of the more comfortable headphones that I have tried. I have owned a good number of SD headphones and I would say that these are on the top of the list for initial comfort. The ear cup is a little smaller than the Sennheiser Momentum Over the Ear, but if you have smaller ears you should be okay. The leather cups are nice, soft and feel comfortable.These are comfy and lightweight cans.Sound Quality:Listening to Hip-Hop, Rock, Alternative and Classic Rock via computer with Fiio DAC.The bass is a bit heavy and possibly muddy, but thats mostly the upper bass. The midrange is good, and the highs fall of slightly in the upper range. These aren't the very best headphones I've heard, but they are solid sounding headphones and can compare in many ways to both Aviators in SQ. I would even say that they are between the Momentum and Aviators, more of a U sound curve.Nowhere near reference headphones but a very good pair of cans for the price and I doubt you will be able to spend less and get more that $40 for a pair of really nice cans.Overall:Very satisfied with these cans.Would buy as gift and would recommend highly!I am not a paid reviewer and have no affiliations with China or with the company, I'm just giving you my honest opinion.SIDE NOTE:Have read about fake reviews being generated on Amazon.This is not a generated review.

VI really want to give it a 4.5, but I'm leaning that way from the 5 star direction and not the 4 star direction.But here are the first impressions upon receiving:I can't remember if it claims to cover the ears, but it does not give that feel of covering the entire ear. It covers my ears but just barely. It is still extremely comfortable and wears just fine (I have not yet tried it for extended periods of time). It looks great and while I'm not a big fan of the logo ("Symphonized") on the very top I'm okay with it because it's at the very top. I get the feeling most people won't notice it and/or won't care. My biggest relief is that it does not use batteries! Instead the cord attaches directly into the left and right earpiece.Something I didn't expect was the cord to be relatively short. It's probably noted in the details but I missed it. I do wish it was a bit longer but is perfect for phone/MP3 devices. I attached the cord to my computer and found that I could not move far away from my computer without having to take off the headphones.Lastly, the music quality sounds great! I can't give a detailed comment on it as I'm no audiophile but it plays music just great. I haven't been able to use it a noisy environment yet but I get the feeling it will shield away most of it. Sound does bleed from the headphones if you turn up volume decently high.Overall, not exactly what I expected but still got what I was looking for. Also, I'm very glad I didn't have to shell out a ton of money for it (I previously owned a set of Beats; so far similar quality, if not better, for less than half the price and does not use batteries).

p720
sg5
VThe other reviews have said it better than I can - these headphones are amazeballs. They sound better than headphones I've tested that are twice the price (or more), namely Monster, Beats, and Bose. Incredibly crisp sound, nice mids, the bass isn't overly aggressive. There's a nice amount of noise isolation and no sound leakage that we could hear easily. This contrasts with some other headphones I've had, where someone sitting across the room from me could hear what I was listening to. They are surprisingly light, given the construction materials - metal, enamel and wood. I think they look great, and the headpiece and earcups are made of very soft material that would be comfortable for long wear.Someone said they didn't know who could have ears small enough to fit entirely inside the earcups - I do! The cups completely encircle my small ears. And ultimately, that made me decide these are better suited for my husband, than for me. I wore them for about an hour, and my ears got hot. (I didn't, however, notice any pressure on my head or ears, like I've experienced with other headphones). The Wraiths fit my husband's head and ears perfectly, as they should. He LOVES the sound - they are "worlds away" from his other headphones - and so he's the new proud owner.If you're looking for top-notch sound at a bargain price, you won't be disappointed with these. They're a very worthwhile purchase for anyone who's serious about music.

VI am so thrilled with these headphones !  The main thing that makes me smile is that they are gorgeous. I love the deep redwood look. When I initially saw these and read about the wood construction I wasn't sure what to make of it. However now that I've used them I think whoever designed them completely achieved a great set of headphones that are also a work of art. The chrome / silver next to the natural redwood looks just amazing. I also found the sound produced to be fantastic. I actually had a coworker try them on and they thought they were Noise Cancelling because they work so well. I noted some questions about this since they are stated as being Noise Canceling. They do not produce white noise for noise cancelling yet they work as well as my noise canceling headphones that generate white noise. I feel this is a plus because I'm not having to use a battery or external power for the noise canceling yet they do an amazing job at blocking out noise. The cords are cloth, which means they have less memory than rubber cords in my opinion. I personally think they are better quality and love them.  I have nothing negative to say about these. I'm trying to think of friends and family I can purchase some for and if anything happens to mine I will be buying another pair.  I absolutely love these and would have been happy paying $100+ for them. There are also some good YouTube reviews on these headphones if you want to do more research.

VMusic is my life therefore I am very particular about my headphones. After doing weeks of research, reading countless reviews by professionals as well as customers, I decided on the Symphonized Wraith 2.0.They had everything I wanted for the budget I was working with and had top reviews. And with good reason, they are everything promised plus some.Thesee pack a powerful punch both in sound quality and build and look very sharp and expensive. Every time I wear them I get complimented.The sound is clear and crisp with rich full lows, clear highs and deep bass. I have noticed however that the sound varies drastically depending on the player. The fit is mediocre for me as I have a small head and have great difficulty finding over ears that fit.  The Wraith gets a point in this category simply because they don't fall off, but they could fit better.For the budget I had and the features I wanted,  these are amazing headphones. The only cons I have are there isn't any way to tell right from left on the ear cups as they are not marked and these are not travel friendly as they do not collapse or fold therefore they are not geared for the commuter.But if you are looking for nice headphones with a great soundstage, nice look and bonus features like in line mic for under $50 but with quality of more expensive pairs, then these are for you!

VI have been looking for noise-cancelling headphones but I liked the way these headphones looked and even better the price drop/free shipping.  Read the high ratings and thought it was worth a shot.I like the two cords that are included and even better the way the plug is thin and angled so it can be plugged into a cell phone with a case and it is easier to grasp. I do wish the phone cord had a volume control like the iPhone ear buds.The sound quality is excellent with the only very minor reduction in bass IMO but overall crisp and well reproduced sound.  Jazz, classical, pop, rock and alternate plays well.The quality of the materials were surprisingly better than expected at the price.  The materials are real metal, real wood and the pads and cups soft and supple with what I suppose is leather or leather-like.  Time will tell how well they hold up.  I keep everything stored in the woven bag included.  The adjustable sliding mechanism seems reliable and easy to use.  The only worry I have is the pivots the cups are on.  Rudimentary post and metal stoppers seem like they could be wrenched off and damaged easily.Overall I am very happy with them and would recommend buying these excellent headphones.

VI purchased these headphones for my son, I was not given anything for my review. I'm not a audio engineer or anything but I am picky about how my music sounds & these headphones sound pretty good. The highs, mids and bass sound separate but unified and smooth. Detailed & crisp highs with nice clear mids, bright but warm. They're not the most bass heavy headphones available on the market but the bass is definitely present and hits tight & punchy, just not overwhelming. I paid $50 for them but would pay twice that and still not regret it. The quality of the build is better than decent too. No cheap plastic body or headband and the metal combined with the wood looks pretty clean. We received 2 sets of wires with the headphones but we only used 1 so far & the cord doesn't seem to constantly get tangled on itself like a lot of others. I bought a couple pair of Symphonized earbuds & was pleasantly surprised so I bought these. There was a very minor issue with 1 pair of the earbuds & Symphonized took care of it FAST. Great customer service & they stand by their products, hassle-free. Rare these days. I would definitely buy these again if I need another set of headphones.

VThese Are My Favorite Headphones Now (out of all my collection of headphones)
p797
sg5
VThese headphones rock! I amazed how much you can drive these babies without distortion. The bass stays clean and tight at high levels, although I don't overdrive them very often (to protect my ears), but once in awhile you want to be able to crank it up when there's that killer RUSH Drum Solo or hot guitar part in Pink Floyd's The Wall. Those are the times you want to crank it up for a minute and these headphones make you feel like you're standing right in front of Eddie Van Halen's Marshall stack with complete clarity. They're also great for watching movies, very good theater sound.Ohhhhh and something else amazing about these headphones. I'm blow away by the sound isolation. Evidently the padding they use in these babies is similar to materials used for headphones you use at a gun range, because when I put them on everything gets real quite (unlike many over-the-ear headphones) and yet they are VERY comfortable and soft.The build quality is awesome for the price. I love the metal frame! I love these headphones so much, I'm thinking about getting my two sons a pair as well.03-14-2015 UpdateSo I'm listening to some high quality studio recordings tonight and the bass quality is so good that I literally had to take these headphones off of my head tonight just to see if I had left my speaker system on. It's not about 'how much' bass there is.....It's about 'how rich and clean' the bass perception is to your ears and your brain. You won't regret buying these headphones!!

p821
sg5
VFirst things first, these do look and sound great.  Packaging was nice, the extra pair of cables with a mic is very handy and the bag is a nice addition for those looking to keep it in something to keep it from getting dirty or damaged.Now onto why I gave it 2-stars.The main reason being the comfort of the earpads, they are just awful.  It might just be my ears(and they are hardly outside the norm) but there is no way to wear these comfortably for more than a 10-15 minutes without it putting too much pressure on one spot and causing a headache.  If these earpads were designed to actually fit over ears or at least be oval-shaped(who the heck thought triangles were a good idea, really?) to be able to sit on your ear then they might be wearable.The other reason is the lack of ability to communicate with the seller in any way other thank a invoice request or a thank you message.  The only other thing I can do is contact Amazon customer support and go through them and so I will do that.

VOk, I'm trying to distinguish the difference between these and LSTN Troubadours with the exception of the price. I got these on a deal from dealnews and said why not take a chance and I'm sure glad I did.The packaging along with accessories were great. It came with two cords [one with a line-in mic and a regular]. Attention to detail and the quality just set it apart. I quickly put these on and all I can say is WOW! I've see some of the reviews compared to other high end headphones and I must say this is right up there for the price point.The mids are clear, the bass is not muddy and the highs has a 'soft' treble. It does not pierce your ears even at high volume. I have Android and using Poweramp App to play music and Oh, what a joy.It also feel very comfy even after prolonged use. I wear glasses and my ears don't hurt even after a few hours of use. It sits nicely without too much push. Check deal news for an extra $20OFF and you won't regret it. I'm even thinking of buying another one.

VI bought them on sale for 38 dollars and I am currently testing them out.  They are very good headphones for the price.  I quickly glanced in the mirror and they do look good.My brother has a pair of bose headphones. I don't recall the model but they are the inexpensive ones.  I believe they are $99.  Anyway, the bose kills these.  The bass is much more precise.  And the music in whole seemed jumbled compared to the boseI then compared them to my sony ps4 surround sound headphones and my sanheiser headphones. All over the ear.  These ones where better than those two.  They were louder. Bass was better and highs were slightly better.Anyway,  what I am getting at is at $38 it is a solid purchase.  But, if I could buy the bose for 38 (which bose will never allow!) I would choose bose.  Actually at the current price of $60.  I would seriously consider spending the extra 40 to get the bose.  But once again at 38. It was a solid purchase

VI call myself headphonecolic. I have low end to high end many headphones. I prefer to listen different type of music with each headphones I own. Headphones are like speakers they have their own personality. All give you variety of listening pleasure. I usually prefer over ear headphones. They have advantage over on ear ones. They are usually more comfortable and have better isolation. When I first saw these they were on sale for $39. I have not heard them before but they looked really stylish and reviews were good. So I purchased one. I've compared them to sennheiser, sony, bose, audiotechnica headphones (all are more expensive). I can assure you that they sound pretty good. Yes they are not par with them but not far either. They are also comfortable and look nice. You can not fold them but you can wear them on your neck. They have long extension. Overall they get 5 stars for $39. I would not pay more than $50 though.

VAside from looking downright stunning, the Symphonized Wraith 2.0 headphones sound infinitely better than they have any right to for their price point. While most of the "good" headphones at this price level I own can reproduce a nice clear bass as I'd hope them too, they tend to falter in the mids to highs. Obviously, I'm not going to be taking my good Sennheisers on a public bus, so I've been sticking with these. After a little toying around with my phone's equalizer (quite necessary), I can listen to my music in significantly better quality than pretty much any "portable" class headphone I've ever tried.Also, these are my first pair of headphones with a remote/mic, and I'm still discovering new ways to use 'em more effectively. The padding is wonderful, and they've held up remarkably well after 2 weeks of borderline constant use (I'll be sure to update at some point down the line).

VI received these headphones and they were defective. No sound is coming out of the right ear. Obviously if these functioned properly, I may be inclined to give more than a 2 star review. I have gotten in touch with customer service and am waiting for a response. I will gladly update my review after the customer service process is complete.With that being said though, despite the defective product I was upset with how short the cord was. It shouldn't be an issue if you are listening to music with a device in your pocket or on your computer but I work in a radio studio and am constantly moving around with the headphones on my head and cannot afford to have a very short cord. I would say the cord still seemed shorter than your average headphone cord though\u2026 even shorter than iphone earbuds. So even if the product had worked, I still would have been upset with the cord length.

VI wanted a nice pair of headphones but something different with good reviews. I came across these on sale for $35 and bought them. When I opened the box, I was not dissappointed. The wood trim is cool and the headband is actually metal. Nice. An added bonus is the cord isn't plastic but cloth wrapped. When I put the headphones on I was really surprised they cut out so much noise.  They aren't heavy and the ear cups are really soft. When the first song was over I literally went back to Amazon to see if I could get another pair for the sale price. If I catch them on sale again, I'll be getting another. .... I also bought as a gift, their earbud version with the zebra stripped cord. My son thinks they are the best he's ever owned. My next purchase will be the matching bluetooth speaker.

These headphones where stylish when they came out of the box however once you held them, the headphones seemed cheap and plasticy although to be fair the headphones were 50$. The comfort was pretty decent however the ear cups were NOT over-the-ear and were instead on-the-ear. There was also a tremendous amount of sound leakage and even at 50% volume, everyone around me was hearing the music. Sound quality was excellent though. I did end up returning these headphones because they were not what I was looking for.ProsStylish AppearanceSound Quality OkDecently ComfortableConsOn-the-earFeels CheapA lot of sound leakage

Vsuper comfy (ear pads feel awesome -very soft-), sound really nice (for the $), and look amazing.  Although.... At first one of the cans would lose audio occasionally.  switching cables around didn't help so I opened them up and inspected the insides.  one of the wires from the jack to the driver (speaker) was sketchy (barely soldered, loose strands hanging about which were precariously close to the positive terminal and likely shorting out to the other wire).  So I resoldered the leads inside, then hot glued the solder joint to help reduce wire fatigue.  DIY repair seemed like a better option that trying to deal with a refund/exchange.  So far, no more audio issues.  otherwise, construction is pretty good.If you carfully pull the earpads off, you'll see the screws.  self explanatory from that point.

VI am so pleased with these headphones! My children's spouses bought headphones for my children for Christmas and sent me on a mission. They bought beautiful LSTN Wood Headphones. I listened to them and fell in love with the sound. I had to get a pair for me and my husband but couldn't spend the $160.00+ for them so I did my research and came across these Symphonized Wraith Headphones for less then a third of the price. I have to say that first of all they are more comfortable then the LSTN's. They come with the built in comfort band so your hair doesn't get caught in the band. Second, they sound just as good, if not slightly better then the LSTN's. No lie. Third, Exterior sounds are minimal. They are so rich looking and light in weight. I'd have to say that this is probably my best buy of 2015!

Over the years i've owned Sennheiser 202's, August EP650s and these guys. The 202's are ok... they don't look pretty and not as full sounding as the other 2.The 650's sound awesome-- immersive, crisp highs, deep rich bass for blasting bangers -- are comfy and look sleek (Check em out if you haven't yet) These guys are similar sounding-- less emphasis on the bass but not saying it's lacking in that department. It's actually a really well balanced sound (I prefer it less bassy) and the wraiths are in a better looking package in my opinion. For $50, it's a no brainer.

VThese headphones are amazing! The sound quality is better than my old Bose headphones.  The proof is in the volume, I listen to music on my phone most of the time and before the volume was at 8 now 5 or 6. I get a lot of compliments on the looks too. I love the real wood on the sides and the other industrial/ mechanical features. By far my best set of headphones. I have semi-large ears so the cups don't sit over my ears but rather on them. This is perfect for me though,  my last headphones pushed on my pirced lobes causing some discomfort. These have a flat bottom so they end before my piercings.  6 stars to Symphonized. I appreciated the email sent (independent from Amazon)following up on this purchase. This will not be my last Symphonized product.

VIt comes with two detachable cords, but both are rather short. One longer cord would have been nice. I understand that they are pushing these a portable headphones. So, a short cord make sense in that respect. However, I didn't buy these for portable use, and I don't think they are very well suited to that purpose. I don't think these headphones stay on my head well enough for even light portable use. I do have large head and have to adjust the bands of these headphones to their maximum size to fit on my head. No, my head is not freakishly large; I have no trouble finding hats to fit me.Overall I do like these headphones, and do not regret the purchase in the least. I consider them quite the bargain actually.

There is VERY little sound bleed even at high volume levels.The cups are are little smaller than I would have liked. I have a large head (size 7 3/4 hat) and the band fits very comfortably with a few clicks to spare, but the cups sit half on my ears and half off.

p945
sg5
VI absolutely love these. They look great, sound great, and are ridiculously underpriced. The sound from these comes in a close second behind a pair of ATH-M50s, which, mind you, sell for around $150.In terms of sound quality, here's the best way I can describe it. The individual sounds will not be, as some headphones are, spread out and easily discernable. Instead, they sound slightly muddled together. This may sound like a bad thing,  but I actually enjoy this effect, as it makes the music sound more realistic. Beyond that, they seem to sound a bit 'warm' if that makes any sense.However, any criticism is completely overwhelmed by the price. You honestly can not beat this deal.

VFirst let's start off with the appearance  and craftsmanship. These headphones are well made, designed and beautiful to look at, the art goes right down to the cord which is pliable fabric-like with sturdy well-made connectors and plugs. The ear pads are just the right amount of firm and soft and are comfortable even during long periods.The sound quality is well balanced between rich lows, mids and highs. Many of the headphones I tested were over bassed and or muddy. These are not overly bassy nor are they overly tinny or bright, they are an incredibly well balanced sound.When you consider the price these are a fantastic value; I would buy them again

p968
sg5
VThese headphones are absolutely outstanding for the price. For one the build of them is mostly metal and real wood which is very unusual for the price. Also the sound quality and clarity is great as well the only small issue being that the headphones are a tad on the bassy side. This makes it so the bassist can heard more easily (which is a plus in my book imo). Overall this is a great buy. Is it as good as $300ish headphones? No but to be honest the difference isn't substantial enough for me or most people to drop a sack of money to get those kinds of headphones.

VAbsolutely love them. The construction seems to be very high quality, so I'm hoping that they'll last a while. The sound is good, a little on the bassy side but man, those bass tones are rendered beautifully. As far as noise-cancellation goes, they're not perfect, but they do a good job muffling the sounds of my coworkers. Also they're very comfortable, I have them on for 8-10 hours at a time and they don't cause me any discomfort or get tangled in my hair or anything like that.For $50? An absolute steal. If you're looking for excellent headphones but not ready to shell out a ton of money, I would absolutely recommend these.

VFor this style of headphones, I wasn't expecting them to be so light. They are unbelievably comfortable and sleek. I am replacing a pair of over-the-ear headphones that had broken because I couldn't get them to sit right (they were very bulky and tight). These are perfect for their size. Also, the sound quality is quite crisp and clear; you can hear every instrument, every low note and high note. There is a bit of noise leakage but I like them kinda loud so, that is to be expected. For this being my first wooden pair, I am extremely pleased with them overall. And I have already gotten compliments about how cool they look. thank you :)

VI was quite surprised by these cans, especially for the price.  Most comfortable pair of headphones I currently own.  (although velour pads would be a nice option)  The soundstage on these seemed initially quite limited, but they've really opened up quite quickly with a nice rich and warm sound now that I've been using them for a few weeks.  I've never experienced the change in headphones from new to "broken in" but the change in these were dramatic.  Listening to Beethoven's 9th (Berlin Philharmonic w/Von Karajan) to Tool's Lateralus or QOTSA's "...Like Clockwork" to random streaming radio, these are a joy!edit:  Sources - iPhone 6, Late 2012 Macbook Pro w/HIFIMAN EF2A

VExcellent headphones, very durable and comfortable. Each earpiece has a jack which the headphone cable V-splits and has a micro jack to plug into. This is key: as from my experience where the wire meets the headphone is the number one point of failure in headphones. Actually having a jack point is a solid mark of quality, and oh, the whole set came with an extra wire set in the off chance the first one breaks.Sound quality is good; I bought these because I work around a bunch of noisy people and sometimes i need to press in and focus, does a great job of drowning out everyone else when my own tunes are playing.

VMore base than Sennheiser HD 449, but not as neutral. They also like to "hug" your ears more, making it feel a little tighter, but secluding all the sound straight to your ears.I got these at $39.99 on-sale for gifts.It comes with two cables: one with mic and one withoutThe cable plugs separately into each headphone themselves (left and right) and one to wherever you want sound to come out of.The mic isn't that great, so you're just left with an extra cable instead just in case something happens to the other.They are definitely worth this price and look amazing!

While it is not the most comfortable thing around, they are not bad, and for someone with a smaller and less sensitive head, it may not bother you at all.  For bigger heads, it may be a bit tight, but I've VERY carefully stretched it out a bit by applying some force to the metal parts.Also keep in mind that these are on-ear headphones (unless you have microscopic ears).

VI bought these to replace a $100+ pair of headphones that fell apart after several years of use.  These sound better.  I think they look better, too.  I am not an audio snob or someone who knows a lot about these things, but I am a musician with a good ear.  These sound really good for what I paid, and they look nice and feel durable, too.  I like them.  These are basically over-ear for me, but I have pretty small ears.  I think they would be on-ear for many people and almost all men here in the U.S.  The foam is thick enough that they should be comfortable as such.

They also come with a second set of cords/wires. The fit is comfortable for him too, not too tight, which is saying a lot because he has a hard time finding hats that fit.

I own several headphones to include bose, audio technica, to sennheiser at twice to 3 times as much as these, but these symphonized hp's by far exceeds them in sound quality and overall performance. I suspect that it is due to the wood instead of plastic build. I wont be going back to plastic any time soon.

VThe audio is pretty good (burn it in a little with loud music for an hour or so). Clear highs, moderate lows. Super comfy ear pads, but the metal headband can probably pull hair if your hair is really long. I had no hair issues, though my hair is short. Only issue is a really short cable, so if you're looking to hook this up to a desktop PC, make sure you have an extension or an easy access to the headphone port.

VThe old saying goes you get what you pay for. At 39 bucks these aren't too bad. After reading a lot of positive reviews I was really hoping for something a little better though. I had previously owned a pair of Harman Kardon CL's that were stolen from me and I was hoping to replace them with something comparable at a lower price point.Sound: I'm by no means an expert but I have listened to a few higher end products and feel I can accurately review this product. While these do produce a warm and somewhat pleasing sound signature they simply can't produce the accurate and detailed sound I have come to expect from high end headphones. The highs are masked heavily by the over accented mid range bass and just are quite as crisp as they could be. Improvements could also be made on the low end where it tends to sound boomy on certain tracks. However there is still a lot to like about these headphones. Compared to my old CL's these have a much wider sound stage and better stereo imaging also while I'm not a huge fan of the bass some friends of mine quite enjoy it. Also as a side note I really don't like these for watching movies. Due to the overemphasized low end and poor treble reproduction dialogue can become very muddy and unpleasant.Build: As far as the build quality I can't say I'm overly impressed considering the wood is fairly minimal and the chrome plastic on the sides of the cups is easily scratched and makes what could look like a premium priced product look rather cheap and lower end. Also when using these as some others have noted the cord can cause quite a lot of noise when moving it about. Im a little concerned about how long these will last as well. I have owned them a few weeks but I will update if they start falling apart. As far as sound isolation these do pretty well but they are NOT noise canceling as the product description describes.Overall: Its also important to note while I'm being fairly critical the headphones I'm comparing these too higher end headphones that were bought at 70-80 dollars on sale as opposed to this pair which I picked up at 40. For half the cost they are still pretty good which is why I'm giving them 4 stars. These actually do shine on acoustic and classical tracks which is what I primarily will use them for and to be honest alot of my friends have given me compliments on these. But if you are looking for something more versatile and accurate for all types of music, movies and games you might want to look elsewhere.

VGood, but no Wow Factor & clamping force is crazy!
p1423
sg5
VMy first impression of this Headphone was "hm..nice sound!" And as i kept on listening the clamping force of the earcups are really tight on my head. I would say this is more of an on ear headphone than over ear.  That was the main reason why i had to return these after a week of use because the pressure was too strong.Built & Design: the quality of these cans does not feel cheap except for the upper cushion which seems to wear out if used for a month or so. The outer end of the earcups are made of really nice genuine wood, which also match with the auxillary cords. The cords are hooked one on each side, so its convienient to pull one off wen engaging conversation while still listening to music on the other ear. The metal or steel parts of the headphones make it seems really sturdy and difficult to break loose. Afterall these cans doesn't seem to break easily and the design is the main reason why i purchased these.Music quality: the mids and highs are pretty secent in my taste. Not too impressive and not as clear and accurate, but i can live with that. On the other hand, the low is not really impressive at all. If u listen to r&b; or rap or bassy music, the bass is there, but it doesnt execute as expected-puchy and clear rather than brief and muddy. I must say these cans are best if you are a pop/party/dance kind of listener. The mids n highs are good, but the bass is a little disappointing. Overall if you listen to summer types of music, these will sound great for you.Other thoughts: when you listen to these they sound really nice. But after 20 mins the pressure starts to push in. After 40 minutes, it becomes very unbearable to the point where if u continue, you will dmg your ears.Overall: These cans are nice to have, but the clamping force is really the only main reason why i am forced to return these, hence the 3 stars. There is just no WOW factor in my opionion. I would have to rate these a 6.5/10

VGreat Sound... build quality could be better.
p1434
sg5
VI'm going to review these headphones in 2 parts (Sound Quality and Build Quality)...Sound Quality:  Outstanding... for the coin you spend on these you're getting a great deal.  For $50 I have nothing bad to say.  I recently bought an open box set of Beats Studio 2.0 for my very hard of hearing aunt to connect to her television and sound quality is much better with these.  As far as the noise canceling is concerned Beats are superior.  I would have bought these for her but the ambient noise makes it difficult for her to distinguish the beats worked great for her.Build Quality:  I was very surprised and slightly disappointed how light these headphones are.  The metal bracing is very thin ribbon metal and will require being more careful with them than I originally anticipated.  The wood (walnut) speaker covers look nice but I thought and hoped the wood would help to add some heft to them but it does not.  They are comfortable and the adjuster works well.  As far as people reporting the headphone wire connections being loose resulting in nosie, I have not experienced this... they snapped in tight and is pretty durable.  I actually bought a 2nd splitter and two cords in case I didn't like the cables that came with the phones but unfortunately the jacks on the headphones are smaller than than the listed 3.5mm jack (2.5mm).  This should have been identified on the website and packaging.  The Beats Studio 2.0 build quality feels superior but they also cost $225 I can't fault Symphonized on this.All in all I can't complain.  You can't go wrong for $50.  I would really like to compare the build quality to the LSTN.  If I can find them i'll update my review.

VI was looking for a pair of headphones that had a plug-in replaceable cord, and that is what lead me to the Symphonized Wraith headphones. The notion of wood intead of plastic proved a futher enticement, and finding a pair under $50 (dented packaging accounted for the price break) sealed the deal. My set arrived after a prolonged wait that I cannot explain. Most outfits want to ship quickly, but these were on a slow boat for sure. The dented packaging looked like wolverines had played tug of war with it. Dented was not the word I would have chosen.But the headphones worked, and they were not scratched or harmed. So how do they sound? Well, OK for $50 to $75 headphones. No worldbeaters here, but clean, clear sound with OK bass and clean highs but a touch of mushiness overall. For on-the-go listening, theser are fine and fairly comfortable. They do look really cool, so if you want a conversation starter in addition to sound delivery that is another plus.So why 3 stars? Well, I like these okay. Although I consider this review to be overall postive, the manufacturer will not. Would you believe that Symphonized actually sent me an email that, in part, read, "We also encourage you to post a positive product review (that is 4 or 5 stars) once you have had a chance to use the product." That alone should give you pause. Try them and see. Return them if they do not suit.

VFirst off I collect headphones. I currently own 19 sets. From igrado, grado rs2e, akg q701, Sennheiser 598, ath50xb, Ultrasone hfi 780, to Superlux 680 evo's, Status Audio etc.I stumbled upon these and never heard of them. Researching them didn't reveal much. But I loved the look of them so I took a chance.Man was I surprised at the quality of these cans. They look better in person than in the pictures. But what really surprised me was the sound for the price. They sound as good or better than some of my higher priced HP.They have a deep bass that is well defined and not muddy like beats. The Mid's are well represented and not buried or recessed by the bass. High 's are very clear without being shrill or sibulant. To top it off the sound stage is very good for closed cans. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good they sound for the money. I liked them so much I am going to buy their Magnum headphones.Don't think twice if you are considering them you won't be disappointed.

VFor $39? Pretty good.  If you like bass you'll like these. The sound leans towards the bassy side. I have no experience with the previous version, but these are comfortable. Came with two cables so you have an extra just in case one breaks. Also comes with a little carrying bag to put the headphones in. The bag probably wont protect your headphones though. IMO the wood looks nice. If I had to nitpick, the wood cup on the right side was a tiny bit darker than the wood cup on the left side. Nothing too drastic though. Cable isn't too long so I think you can take this out in public. Leakage not a problem and isolation is fine for me. Feels a little flimsy.Overall, a nice little wooden headphone. Definitely looks good and the sound is fine.

p1756
sg5
VI am so surprised by all the good reviews.SOUND: The sound quality of these headphones are equivalent to earbuds. I will admit that I am used to "high quality sound." I gave these a try despite they're low end pricing due to the rave, yet erroneous Amazon reviews.MATERIALS: It is made of some stainless steel, but also very cheap chrome lacquered plastic. The leather is very fake.FITTING: I am a very petite lady with tiny features by everyone's standard. My pediatric physician husband at times calls me "preemie ears" do joke about my tiny ears. These do not cover my ears, which is strangely annoying, especially once the heat of the cans rise after some use.OTHER: if you want to test these headphones out despite this review; get it off another site. They can be found as cheap as $45 on some online retailers.

p1768

VGood a sturdy pair of headphones, entirely made of metal and wood. Sound quality is clear but has a certain thickness to it creating a nice tone.PROS:- Made of metal and wood- Clear sound- Durable cord- Comfortable to wear, needs breaking in first.- Stylish and non-distractingCONS:- Double cord on both cups makes things messy.- Cups are ON the ear.- Needs more bass.- Needs a longer cord.I personally don't mind these headphones mainly because they work for what I use them for. However, with the dual cord, it makes gaming messy. Probably one of the best features is the quality of sounds and material put into this product. Though, if you're more into gaming, I would advise you look for something a little more over the year. These can get uncomfortable over time.

VI wasn't expecting too much from these, but I was immediately impressed. The construction seems solid with great looking wood ear pieces and a nice metal band and metal adjustments. The ear covers were also nice and soft. The only average part is the padding at the top.As a reviewer said, these are not over the ear headphones and do not provide any noise isolation. But the bass and the sound volume on these are great for headphones that are less than $60. I was particularly happy with the bass, it sounds amazing. I'm happily using them to listen to all the big booms in gaming and movies.I only wish the cord was maybe 6 inches longer. I have my desktop computer sitting about chest height and right next to my desk. When I plug these into the front, I don't get much leeway to move around.

p1798

VExtremely satisfied with these! I purchased these to replace a pair of Monster headphones (about $120) and for less than half the price I couldn't be happier.  They have an interesting aesthetic to them as well and look and feel like a quality made product.  The metal hardware has little rivets at the end of the expansion band that are hair-pullers if you have long hair but that probably wouldn't be a problem for most folks.  So far I've played folk, blues-rock, alternative, soul, r&b;, and blue grass styles of music and these sound really great to my ears.  My boyfriend tried them out with hardcore metal and made a face--after listening myself I have to agree my old headphones handled metal better than these but I keep my metal consumption to a minimum so I'm still very pleased =)

VMy daughter lover the headphone.The construction seems well made, with exception of the head cushion.The head band cushion held to the stainless steel band with cheap (not so double-sided tape; I would expect a much tougher glue. Instead, it easily comes off. May be a plastic frame design to hold the cushion to the headband would be a better idea.The sound is much brighter than those brand name $100-$200 headphones I have around the house. The mid-range is strong, so is the bass. High is a bit short.I bought this for 40 bucks when it was on sale.For the head cushion and minor weak high, I would knock half a star. Since Amazon doesn't provide the option, I'll give this 5 stars for the overall construction and price.

VThere is no doubt that these are very pretty headphones. They feel well built. The replaceable cables are a nice touch. Any time you fiddle with the cable it makes a funky sound in the headphones because of the texture on the cable. I find that annoying.The biggest issue is the sound. It's not great. I have a pair of Sennheiser HD595 that I got on sale for a bit less than twice what I paid for these headphones. But there is no comparison between the two. The Sennheiser sounds lifelike while the Symphonies sounds lifeless.If you want pretty headphones that will turn heads, this is the pair for you. If you want something that sounds good save a little more money and get Sennheiser HD595 (or HD598).

VVery nice set of earphones, especially for the price.  They are simply built and with metal where it counts, because I have had numerous pairs of earphones break with their plastic components.  I use earphones almost daily and for long hours as a medical transcriptionist/editor, and it is very important to be able to hear what is being dictated with the utmost of accuracy.  I have gone through many different pairs and I like these better than other more expensive brands that I have had.The only thing now is to see how long they last with daily use.  I give them 5 stars, taking in to consideration comfort, sound quality, and suspected durability, etc.  That being said, so far they have earned my 5 stars.

VNot every product can be a 5 star review every time.  Occasionally there are lemons, even from quality producers.  Mine is NOT that pair.  I really like these.  The sound is great, the looks and quality build are great.  They are very unique, a reasonable price for what you get, and are comfortable.  They could be a tad bit lighter but overall, I'm very pleased.  I've purchased and returned 6 sets of headphones for various reasons, none of them of the quality they claimed to be...from $20 to $240.  These?  Awesome.  Finally!

VThese would be 5 stars if I had paid 159.99. 59.99? Wow! I listen to classical music mostly when I'm wearing headphones so noise isolation is important. For me these cans are NOT over the ear they are on ear but they cancel outside noise very well. Also at a comfy listening level (louder than most mtl) my wife cannot hear my music when they are on. Not even a peep. I listened to some rockin stuff that I also like and Dragonforce sounded spectacular. Bass is great and just crazy highs. 59.99!! Dre should buy these.

VThis are not around the ear headphones as many people said. Even if you have small ears, this will always be over your ears. So, the audio escapes, it doesn't fit right, and are impossible to use for long time. At 20-30min you already have ear pain.They look nice, that's why I put 2 stars, the build quality is good, but they feel flimsy, not sturdy.They are definitively not recommended to buy.I bought this for listening music at work. I really regret the choice.

VFit Too Loose Around My Head But Could Adjust
p2112
sg5
VUpdate (6.28.2015) - 2nd part of my reviewMust have step on some one's toes, received 2 down-votes within 2 hours after my previous review.  Hmm...wonder who it was?I was able to bend the earphones together enough that they now fit.  So yes I am keeping them.  If these earphones weren't built primarily of metal I couldn't do that.  They are really built with some nice materials, mostly metal and of course the wood on the earpieces. What you see in the pictures is really what they appear to be, mostly aluminum and wood. How many times to you see that in a product this inexpensive.When it comes to sound I consider myself just an average listener.  I can tell the lows from the highs and the clarity of a sound.  My primary use for earphones is for watching videos (70%) and the rest for listening to music (30%).These have a really nice sound, the highs & lows sound just like it should.  And it's done with such clarity.  I listen to this one music track done at a honky-tonk that had me really rocking & I just had to turn up the sound to almost max, it sounded that sweet!I would definitely recommend these earphones for both the quality of materials and of course the sound.  They did fit loose initially but I was able to adjust to where they fit fine on my head.Forgot to mention it does come with 2 sets of inputs, one has the microphone & the other does not.  They both have the same kind of wood at the inputs to the earphones as do the cups.  Also included is a bag to carry your earphones.  Really at this price you really receive a lot, in terms of quality & the items this company includes.1st reviewReceived just today and when I put them on head they were very loose.  Didn't even try to see how they sound.  I might see if I can make them fit tighter, if not off they go to be returned.However they do look nice and have a very nice finish, reason for the 2 star.  I'll update if I decide to keep them or return them for a replacement.

Anyway, to save some time, I loved the older version, and these sound just as good. I just wanted another pair so I could leave one of them at work. Well worth the price and currently $10 cheaper than the old model.

VSymphonized Wraith Premium Wood Headphones Overrated
p2346
sg5
VI read several positive reviews for these headphones and very few negative reviews, so I thought I would give them a shot and dropped the ~$60 to purchase them. I don't really need anymore headphones because I own a pair of Audio-Technica M50 headphones that sound awesome, however, they are uncomfortable. After wearing the Audio-Technicas for about ten minutes, my ears and temples hurt. I was hoping the Symphonic Wraith headphones would be more comfortable and provide high quality sound; however, I was unpleasantly surprised by the poor bass and overall poorer sound as compared to my Audio-Technicas.  I guess it should not be a surprise that these much cheaper headphones don't sound nearly as good as the much pricier headphones I own, but all of the positive reviews led me to believe that I was getting a pretty great sounding pair of headphones for a very reasonable price, not so. I did generously grant the headphones 3 stars due to the comfort. They are much more comfortable than my Audio-Technicas, but that alone is not enough to grant them 4 stars. They are relatively attractive, but who purchases headphones simply because they have a unique look? Not me. Overall, I am disappointed with my purchase and I don't recommend these headphones to audiophiles who enjoy music that contains deep bass because these certainly disappoint in that area. I won't break down the other sound components because I am not that astute when it comes to the acoustics and different elements of headphones, but I will say this: save your money and invest in another brand of headphones because these are a disappointment. One other positive: the packaging is pretty cool looking.

VThe feel, the look and the sound are warm with these headphones. They are well made, and not uncomfortable on the ears. The packaging was great, and the headphone is of high quality. It is great for all music, except country-western twang....because that music is detrimental to both audio equipment and brain cells !

VDecent speakers but as soon as I put it on my head I was getting glue in my hair. The glue is sub par to say the least and it isn't even dried yet. I posted a picture. You can clearly see the stringy glu separating from the metal. I am now super gluing the leather on the headset to the metal myself. I am laughing at the normal price on these. There is no way I would pay $150 bucks for something like this. Glad I only paid thirty.*edit* 10/29/14Since yesterday when I bought them and had to glue them back together, I can say that I like these. The sound is rich in bass and very capable because of the driver size. They should post those specs in the product information imo. But they look classy as hell. I dig them. But I still dinged them for the glue! I shouldn't have to glue my headset together that is "supposed" to be worth 150 bucks without the discount. Just put 60 as the real price dudes. Just sayin.

VSo far so good with these headphones.  I've only had them for a few days.  The build quality is fine but it's nothing too amazing on the head band but they are very comfortable.  The sound is pretty solid.  It's not completely high-end but they are above the middle of the pack.  They look great too.  I really like that the chord is wrapped and that each ear-piece has it's own plug.  Nothing glaring in a weakness or over the top in a positive.  I have a larger head and I push the range for size.  I've lent them out to a few people already just to try and everyone says they are super comfy.  Not as much bass as Beats but really clear sound.

VI ordered this particular design was out of my desire to try something different on headphone. The wood design did not add too much weight to the headphone (or at least to me, I don't feel it is any heavier than my other conventional headphone). The ear piece can be adjusted easily. The audio plug is marked with right and left, which can be disconnected from headphone when not in use or for easier storage. The audio delivery capacity is beyond my expectation and I would say, for the price paid, this is an excellent piece. I listened a few songs (by Andrea Bocelli) and I felt like I was at his concert. I also like graphic design on the package. The headphone has two sets of audio cable, I guess one can be a spare. Overall, I would recommend this headphone.

VI am very impressed with the quality of these headphones.  I love the look and the wood brings out a classic feel to the headphones. I added a Sound Blaster amplifier to my laptop which added a fuller fill to the audio produced in these headphones.  You cannot beat the price.  I tried a comparing my Bose on-ear headphone (~$100) to these Symphonized, and I have better audio and feel with these Symphonized headphones. I have already recommended them to a few peers in my office.

VREGRET
p2893
sg5
VPlease note that the best head phones I ever owned until these were the one's that come by default with Samsung Galaxy phones. So clearly I am no audiophile and my expectations were minimal at best.So disappointed. I purely bought this product based on the user reviews here and after using it for 2 days I sadly have strong reasons to believe the reviews here could be rigged.I honestly do not know if my product is flawed or all their head phones are like this (in which case no way do these headphones warrant a 4.5 rating).There are 2 sockets on the ear piece for the cable to be plugged into. The manner in which my cable plugs into these sockets doesn't seem right. The connection is v loose and on the slightest of movements I hear distortions and have to re-adjust the cables.I just regret not going for a more recognized brand.

p2941
sg5
V------------------EDIT 8/26/2015:-------------------------------The headphones are still super comfortable, but I'm realizing more and more how, they're just OK, and not good or great.My main complaint right now: After posting my "negative" review of 3 stars originally, Symphonized contacted me to see if they can make it any better. Good, right?Well, first they tried to breeze over my main complaint: THESE ARE VERY BASS HEAVY HEADPHONES, which I had not thought was originally stated in the product description. They tried to make me believe that it was there all along. I was planning on raising my review one star, since I then believed that I misread the product description, and asked them to make sure that it was my mistake. They finally admitted that they changed the product description AFTER I posted my review.I lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars.I'll add that these headphones are SUPER comfortable, which is very important to me.Overall, would I recommend these headphones to a friend? No.------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:---------------------They have a good sound, they feel well constructed, and look REALLY nice.Three major complains:-Way too much bass. The line "The headphones have exceptional audio quality and strong deep bass" was added after I purchased mine (when there were no other reviews). I would not have purchased these if I would have known.-LOTS of noise leaks, so those around me hear what I'm listening to. If you listen in a public space, these are not for you. I generally use mine in my office at work, so it doesn't matter so much.-When the cable touches on anything, it creates a strong sound in my headphones. This is annoying. I generally wear a collared shirt at work, and every time I turn my head, however little, I get bothered by this sound. Maybe that's because the cord is cloth?Maybe the Wraith 1.0 is better for these issues? I've been considering returning these because of those issues to try those out, but haven't made up my mind.Overall: good sound, construction, and wonderful design. The issues mentioned above make me reconsider my purchase. I think I would have looked elsewhere if I would have known that beforehand. However, if these issues were taken care of, this would definitely be a 5 star product.

VStyle is off the hook, but there are better alternatives
p2977
sg5
VStyle-wise, these headphones are awesome. The wood and metal theme is sick. Look and feel is high quality. Packaging seems a little juvenile, but that says nothing about quality.Comfort-wise, they were good. A little heavy to wear over extended periods of time. I wanted them for work, where I frequently listen to music for several hours at a time.Sound-wise, I found the bass to be too heavy. I thought these would be excellent, given all the uber-positive reviews, but as with anything, it's all subjective.I ended up trying out a coworker's SONY MDR-7506 and loved them, so I returned this product and bought a pair of the Sonys. No regrets. I had avoided Sony originally, because I was trying to save a little dough and wanted to be a little more unique and stylish, but in the end, tried and true quality won out. The Sonys are not heavy and sound clarity and balance is far superior to the Symphonized Wraith.

VThese look great. The wood is natural looking, the metal bands complement the cups and overall, they feel like they might have cost a few hundred bucks. But the looks are where it stops. I compared them to an Audiotechnica A900X and a Grado SR125. To tell the truth, these are good enough for 39 bucks. I doubt you will find much better at this price point. But at the list price of 150 or the normal price of 65, I'd stay away from them. At either of these price points, there are much better options.These headphones hardly have a neutral sound. In fact, they have a visible sound signature. The mid bass is highly accented, and masks all other bass notes. It also isn't sharp and is more like a booming bass. This is probably what people look for while listening to pop or electronic. I rarely listen to these, and for my genres, this low end peak is jarring and highly distracting. The mid tones are subdued, and the highs have a few jarring peaks. Overall, there is probably some genre of music which this compliments. I listen to mainly metal, classical rock, and classical. The sound signature did not work for any of the samples I tried it on. My main gripes with it is the lack of detail through out the range. Everything is just muddy - the drums, vocals, pianos, violins. There is no pop anywhere, which is this headphones greatest fault.In fact, after a solid two hours of listening and comparing and contrasting it primarily with the A900X, I can't appreciate the Audio Technica enough. If I had to make this choice again, the AT wins at three times the price. And this review was supposed to go the other way.And to add, I haven't done any burn-in. I haven't noticed any huge improvement in the past with other headphones, it is in my opinion one of those audiophile myths, especially when it comes to headphones. I suspect a few tones might be better if I give it time, but the Wraith has enough problems sonically that I highly doubt they will get better with time.

VI was not expecting much for the cost, boy was I wrong.  I compared these to some more expensive headphones and found these had better sound.  They are a bit bass heavy but I like that.  The sound isolation is good, not geat, but that is the only down side I have seen so far.  Well, except for they feel cheap.  I am not sure how long they will hold up, but with the great sound and low cost, I will buy again if these break.

VVery Nice Headphones For The Price
p3048
sg5
VEvery headphone owner needs a pair of wooden phones just to experience the different sound signature between wood and metal/plastic. These are a wonderful way to do that. Great build quality, very comfortable and good to great sound for the money. At the regular price of $100 there would be allot of alternatives to choose from. At $60, they are a very good buy. The stain is done well and the clear coat on my pair was a smooth semi gloss finish. The cable is a Y cable of which there are not many available in the aftermarket, so keep it away from Fido and the kids. Sorry, but no adjectives about the sound. Too many people here things too differently to suggest a buying decision based on my ears. If I find headphones on line I think I want (and I own 20+ pairs) I order them and figure the worst that can happen is I'm out $6 for return postage. One less meal at Mickey D's.

VClearly not worth $60, I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from.
p3090
sg5
VSeriously, I don't know where all the fantastic reviews are coming from.  These are marginal at best.  The sound is very tinny, they're obviously cheaply made knock-offs.  I've mainly used headphones by monster and skull candy, so I can only compare the sound to them, and really they sound more like the cheap $3 headphones you'd get on an airliner.They are comfortable for the first 30 minutes or so, but then start to feel like they're squishing my ear too much, but I do have an XL size head so that could be it.Not saying they aren't worth maybe $20, but I don't see how you'd pay full price and feel good about the purchase.I hope you don't buy all the hype expecting the world, but if you're just looking for some nice looking cheap cans, then go ahead.

VThe speaker on your phone sounds better
p3138
sg5
VI am completely mystified by the good ratings for these.  The sound is tinny, and even the movement of the headset cord is amplified INSIDE the ear cup, making them unusable.  I'd rather play music through the speaker of my phone than use these. :-(  I swapped out several cords, just to make sure that the cord they sent wasn't bad.  The sound was identical.The worst part was, that my husband bought them as a gift, and bought them in advance, so we can't return them.

VSave some money & go buy some children's headphones & put some wood contact paper on them, you'll have the same result.
p3143
sg5
VThese are the biggest disappointment I've had with headphones. The worst thing about them is this: If your headphones can't even go up to their max volume without distortion, then they suck. No ifs, ands or buts. The creators should be ashamed of these. I'm afraid even if I bought a headphone amplifier, I wouldn't even be able to use it because these can't even handle their own max volume. That's ridiculous. These sound about on par with the horribly crappy, volume-limited kids headphones I bought for $20. The bass is barely there, and to top it off, the box has a major typo in it on the back. I cannot trust a company who makes headphones when they can't even spell "bass" correctly (on the box, it says "base"). These are just another example of a crappy product most likely from China that for some reason miraculously has hundreds of good reviews. I cannot understand why. I understand these aren't going to be amazing for the price, but I wanted "good" and what I got was ripped off.------------------------------------------------------------------------Do yourself a favor and stay away from these, unless you like losing $70 & getting another crappy pair of headphones you don't ever want to use. I will likely try to steampunk these & sell them to someone who doesn't care about the sound quality. Honestly, I'd attempt to get my money back, but I'm assuming it would be ridiculously hard & I would probably lose money having to pay for return shipping even though it's not MY fault the headphones totally suck. I'll tell you this, I'm never going to buy anything "Symphonized" again, that's for sure. I'm beyond sick of products like this absolutely flooding Amazon. I can't shop with confidence any longer here, because 80% of the time, this is what happens & Amazon doesn't care!----------------------------------------------------------------They look nice. That's pretty much all they've got going for them. What a total rip off at around $65-$70! I wouldn't mind paying about $25 for these at most. When I pay as much as I did, I expect a product to at least be good enough to enjoy, but these wont be enjoyed at all. I had waited a long time to replace my crappier headphones with something I could likely use an amplifier with & achieve the good bass & sound results I wanted. I looked at all the wood-style headphones & determined these would be great based on the reviews. Now I'm sitting here wondering if they padded the reviews with fake ones & fake ratings, because there's no way this pair of headphones should have this high of a rating, not for this price!!!!Thoroughly angry. Thoroughly fed up.
