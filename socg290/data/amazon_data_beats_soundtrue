VI've had about 8 or 9 different high end headphones over the last 5 years. These are awesome for a few reasons:WEIGHT: Really lightweight. They are much much lighter than most of my other headphones. This means they are comfortable on your head for many hours, and don't add much weight to your bag when you're carrying them around. Cannot overemphasize how comfortable they are.SOUND: Very full and rich sound. They are not officially "noise blocking" but the earcups are very solidly built and I can barely hear any ambient sound when they're on. They might not be as nuanced as some $300+ headphones but they are absolutely great.COMFORT: Ear cup material is very soft and comfortable. They don't press into the side of your head, nor do they slip around. I cannot believe how comfortable they are.USABILITY: I'm always forgetting to charge my noise-cancelling headphones and never seem to have enough batteries. It's such a pain to have one more thing to charge and maintain, and these do not require anything of the sort. You never have to wonder if your headphones will die in the middle of a flight or during a workday.All in all: there are higher-end headphones out there, so if you're a huge audiophile geek, you might want to look around a bit. While I'm not an audiophile, I am very particular about sound and ambient noise, and these absolutely fit the bill. They are the most comfortable headphones I own and are -- HANDS DOWN -- my new favorites.These would also make a great gift!

VFor some purchasing this pair of BOSE SoundTrue headphones would be quite the investment.  The question then becomes "are these headphones worth the money?" Over the last two years or so, I have purchased several headphones as gifts. My sons (both teens) had been begging for headphones, specifically the Beats by Dre, for some time.  So began my research on headphones on the market. I wanted a quality product for a reasonable price. So when Amazon offered a special on the V-Moda headsets, during the holidays two years ago, I couldn't pass up the deal. I purchased two pair and was pleased. Both of my sons loved them, especially when they compared them to their friends "Beats". The V-Modas were sturdy and not as bass heavy as the Beats. The bass of the V-Moda wasn't amplified and overwhelming. They didn't feel that they were sacrificing sound quality or style. During this same time period, my husband purchased two sets of Sennheiser (PX 100 and 250 series), one for himself and another as a Christmas gift. One set was around the ear and the other, over the ear. So, over a two year time span, I have had the opportunity to listen to music with all of these headphones and can offer an opinion. And while I am not an expert, I am an average wife and mother who intends to use these headphones for recreational purposes (i.e., when cleaning the house, walking in the neighborhood, etc) only.These headphones are:1.  Extremely light weight. Light enough to put in a purse, book-bag or briefcase, etc. without weighing you down.2.  Comfortable. The ear-covers and headband are padded and extremely comfortable when worn. They block out most if not all of the outside noise. Your ears are completely covered and the sound is crystal clear. **While the ears of the set remain secure or in place, I did notice that the headphone would fall down occasionally. To correct this, I would suggest that you adjust the headphones tighter than you normally would, especially if you have thick hair and this seems to correct the problem.3.  Functional. There is a long cord that attaches from your device to the headset. The long cord gives you some flexibility and mobility. But caution, you may want to secure some of the cord if you are using an armband type holder for your device. Otherwise the cord might get stuck on stuff while you are using it. You can operate various functions (volume, etc) from the back of the microphone. It is located on the cord near your mouth. However, I do wish that the microphone with the function button was lower on the cord, or could be adjusted because while it is comfortable when using the microphone, it isn't when you adjust the sound. If it was further down, you could adjust the sound easier and see the buttons clearly.4.  Can be used with multiple devices. I use mine with my IPOD, IPAD, computer and Android phone (Nexus 4, Google Phone).5.  Enclosed in a convenient carrying case. It fits well in most bags or luggage. They are easy to pack up and travel with.6.  Sound quality. While not bass heavy at all, I think these are perfect for all kinds of music. My playlist includes music from artists like Mree, Daley, Jhene Aiko, The Weekend, Diana Krall, Young Summer and Cary Brothers...and the sound is great.  These headphones have a nice, kind of surround sound quality.  These definitely complement all music types. But if you want deep bass, I wouldn't recommend these. But if you want clear sound, these are the headphones for you.7. Kind of Expensive. These headphones cost about $180. And while that price is comparable to others (i.e., The V-Modas are around $200 and the Beats can range from $200 to $300.) on the market, are you getting the same features for the price? Probably. However, if you are a DJ or money is no object, you may not blink at the price, hence viewing it as an investment. But for the average consumer, you have to consider the features and decide if they are worth the money. So if you aren't looking for bass heavy or exaggerated sound, and you like the fact that these completely cover the entire ear, these are the perfect headphones for you. I give them 4 stars.

VWhats in the box?In the box you will find the SoundTrue headphones, a carrying case and the cord to connect the headphones to a device.  I like that the cord can be completely removed from the headphones which makes the cord easy to replace.  The carrying case is different than that for the Bose QuietComfort headphones in that it is rectangular and not as rigid.AppearanceThe headphones are very subdued.  Mine had a matte black finish.  The Bose logo is also in black and barely noticeable.ComfortBose excels at making comfortable headphones to wear and these are no exception.  The cushions on the headband and earcups are soft and comfortable.  My Audio-Technica ATH-M50 feel tight on my head, but the Bose SoundTrue headphones are not.  The earcups rotate and the length of the headband is adjustable, allowing the user to get a good fit. The SoundTrue headphones are extremely lightweight.  So much so that I forget that they are on my head.  I could easily wear these headphones all day.Sound QualityI evaluated the SoundTrue headphones using my iPod, an Android phone and two computers, none of which were attached to an external amplifier.The first time that I put on the SoundTrue headphones, I felt that they had a very flat, uninspired response.  I normally use as pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M50 which have a richer response.  But, as I listened to a range of music including classical, pop, rock, ambient and dub step, I realized that I was hearing components of the music that I have never heard before with any of my headphones including my Bose AE2 headphones.  The clarity of the music was astonishing.  It is not a rich sound, but it is very clear.  What I was hearing was surprising and I kept lifting the headphones off of my ears because I wanted to make certain I wasn't hearing environmental noises.For example, when listening to Why So Serious? on the Dark Knight soundtrack, I was surprised by how much low frequency rumbling I was hearing.  I had never heard this part of the song before.  The guitar played in Sueño Con Mexico by Pat Metheny was amazing and I heard every note played and the fingers moving on strings.The wide range of sounds produced by the headphones is also amazing.  I listened to the new Lindsey Stirling album, Shatter Me and I found that the violin was sharp as were the sub bass components.However, if you are looking for muddy, booming base then these are not the headphones for you.  The flat response means that the low frequencies are not emphasized.  Instead what you get is a very accurate reproduction of the music.  Nor are these studio headphones.  There is still some enhancing done by the headphones.MicrophoneThe controls and microphone are for use with Apple devices.  I could use the controls to pause and start the music on my Android device, but that was the only functionality available.ConclusionsOverall, these are amazing headphones.  Music is reproduced with such clarity that I hear components to songs that I never knew were there.  The sound reproduction and the comfort make this a recommended pair of headphones.

p24
sg5
VI decide to write this review because what I am about to say is not written by anyone before. And that's why I did not know about this when I bought this headphone.DISADVANTAGES: This head-set is ok, and I want to give it 2.5 stars. This head-set got low rate from me because it was not what I expected from Bose which is one of the best brand for sound-devices. I am a big fan of Android devices and NON-Apple devices such as Window laptops. However, this headphone sounds very poor and small with Android devices and other NON-Apple devices. The sound coming from the headphone are not very clear and true when I use it with Android and NON-Apple devices. It does not have a lot of bass. That's why I am very upset and disappointed with this headphone. ADVANTAGES: However, this headphone works amazingly and stunningly with Apple devices such as Ipod, Iphone, Ipad, Mac Books. etc. I do not understand why it is like that but this is true. The sounds are amazing, clear, loud, and true as advertised when it is used with APPLE products. It is also surprisingly comfortable. You can wear it all day without getting tired. It is also very light-weighted and has a lot of cool designs. Moreover, it is made of high quality materials, and it is very durable. People said it leaks sound, and it did not isolate you completely from the environment. However, I think it do isolate you from the environment with loud enough music, and its sound leaking is negligible.CONCLUSION: If you are a fan of APPLE devices such as Iphone, Ipod, Ipad, Mac books,.... I DO recommend this devices because it works and sounds very beautifully and stunningly with APPLE devices. If you are using ANDROID or MICROSOFT devices such as Window laptops, Samsung phones or any Android devices, I DO NOT recommend this headphone because of reasons I wrote above.I hope you all find my review is helpful when buying this item. Thank you.

VReceived the Bose SoundTrue headphones over the weekend and have been playing around with them on my Google Nexus 4 and Sony Vaio PC. So far, they have been pleasant, but they won't unseat my favorite headphones (Sennheiser HD25-1 II Closed-Back). Nevertheless, they are somewhat less expensive and offer a nice opportunity to serve as a dedicated set for travel. Let's get to it....BUILD AND DESIGNThe SoundTrue is made of black plastic that is thoroughly unremarkable. Candidly, for use about town and on the road, that's acceptable since they aren't likely to draw attention and risk theft. Even though the construction appears 'cheap', in the hand and on the head, they feel like a quality product. Tolerances seem very tight and nothing appears flimsy. I don't know if they would stand up to the beating that my HD25 could tolerate, but the Bose is solid enough. Also, the Bose is really light. Extraordinarily so. When I first saw the package, I figured them for a stay at home headset. On the contrary, they fold nicely flat what with the flattening and rotating ear cups, come in an attractive and thin case, and will easily fit into my carry-on. So, while the SoundTrue might not reward the wearer with compliments, it's seems capable of successfully pulling travel duty.FITVery pleasant surprise, these. They are comfortable. Period. Bose indicates that the ear cups have memory phone for cushioning. Whatever they did, these are extraordinarily light, stay in place nicely without feeling tight, surround the ear (at least my ear) perfectly, and never induced a feeling of pressure or fatigue after being worn for 1+ hour at a time. Moreover, they do a very good job of isolating noise from outside without noise reduction (which I do not like). Job well done here.SOUNDThe critical aspect. For my review sessions, I listened to Mark Knopffler, Dire Straits, Yes, Miles Davis, Steely Dan, Dave Matthews and some classical. Seeing the headphones with the collapsible ear cup, I figured the sound would be partially 'muted'. Sadly, I was not surprised. I don't want to suggest that the aural quality was weak or bad, because it certainly was not. Instead, the SoundTrue was just slightly above average and left me with a less than enthusiastic experience.First, the bass: I'm not a bass head and was not disappointed that these headphones lacked boom, but the bass did not feel enveloping or particularly tight either. It was there and worse, seemed to creep viscously into the midrange, distracting from the music slightly. It was a strange experience in which I wanted to both turn down AND turn up the bass amplification. Perhaps on further listening and burn in, the bass will steady itself and lose that deadened feeling.Next, the midrange: This is where I think these headphones really shine. Knopfler's and Matthew's voice were excellent. Nothing over amped and nuanced enough to detect raspiness, strain, whispers and all things dealing with the windpipes. I was very pleased because the guitar strums, horn play and vocals just felt balanced. It's something that is often missing in many headphones today...everything just sounds over-amped. Instead, true to its name, the Bose SoundTrue actually seemed to recreate the sensation of sitting in on the session. Agreed, they are not open back, but a well-deserved ovation to the Bose engineers for making both a clean and warm sound from the headphones.Last, the treble: sadly, as great as the midrange was, the treble could not match it. Indeed, treble seems the weakest link. Happily it's not piercing and hissing. However, especially with Steely Dan and jazz, it just felt like the music fell off a bit when things got a bit unsettled. Maybe it's because the bass is mulling things about, but the treble just seemed to make things feel flat. I got used to it after a while and candidly appreciated that I wasn't being drilled to death yet again by headset manufacturers catering to the ipod crowd. Yet, I couldn't walk away from any of the listenings thinking that I 'loved' the SoundTrues and I believe the trebel is the reason why. Not too muted, not too bland, but it just felt as though the treble wasn't contributing. Yes, that's it...the treble was simply meandering.Anyway, as I mentioned, they aren't going to be my at-home go-tos, but I am glad to report that I'm more than happy to use them on the road, in the airplane, etc. They are very comfortable, sound lovingly neutral (despite my pettiness on bass and treble), and never left my ears feeling fatigued. In fact, these are the first Bose headphones that I've actually enjoyed. And, because they fold easily flat and slip into a very nice carry case, they'll be sure to come with me wherever I go. Cheers, that.UPDATE: As noted in other reviews, the volume up/down buttons do not work with my stock Android KitKat OS. As the label indicates, they are for iOS only. The play/pause button does work, though.

VI got these head phones a few months ago. Within a few days the cable started malfunctioning and I had to start rotating it within the jack to get the sound to come out of both sides. I've been out of the country since then and thus unable to replace the cable. It has only gotten worse and now I have to bend it on one end this way and that to even get the sound to come out of one ear. When they do work the sound is very clear. Not overly bass heavy like some brands. They are very good for simply listening to music, but if your more interested in feeling the music you might want to go another way. They are very comfortable, I go running with them often, and fall asleep on planes/trains with them on. I plan on keeping them and simply replacing the wire when I get home.

VPerhaps not as good as QC series, but still a terrific product on its own at half the price
p45
sg5
VI've had the Bose QC 15 for several years now and have loved using those headphones. I mostly use those for travel. Wanted to get another pair that didn't require batteries that I could use on a daily basis at home. These headphones are absolutely terrific! Though they are not noise-canceling, they are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is superb.If you're comparing these to the QC series, you will find that the sound quality and noise canceling feature is far superior in the QC series, but then those are priced more than double the price of these, plus the fact that you will need to keep replacing batteries in the QC headphones.- COMFORT - like with most Bose over the ear headphones, the leather trim on top and around the headphones makes them very comfortable to wear no matter how long you have them on.- SOUND QUALITY - though not as crisp as the QC series, sound quality is still pretty good. Sound quality beats most of the competition without a doubt.- DETACHABLE CABLE - The headphones have a detachable cable just in case you step on the cable. This prevents the headphones from being damaged. The cable also has a volume button so you don't have to reach for your device every time you want to adjust volume.- NO BATTERIES - Since these headphones connect physically into the device, they don't require batteries, and don't need a bluetooth connection either. I was specifically looking for this feature so that I don't have to worry about changing batteries.- CARRYING CASE - The headphones come in a nice looking carrying case that is made of leather or faux leather material. Soft to the touch, flexible material (unlike the hard cases of the QC series), and space saving design.I bought these for around $110 around Thanksgiving when they were on sale. I see that the price has gone up quite a bit now. If you can wait to get a better price, it may be worthwhile placing this on a watchlist and buy when prices comes back down. Overall a great product!

VIf this is music... what was I listening to before?
p51
sg5
VI think with something like headphones, it's important to make clear where you're coming from as a user. I am not an audiophile. Music was a big part of my life a long time ago when I was part of an orchestra, but I burned out and pretty much just listen to CD's in my car nowadays. I have never spent more than thirty bucks on a pair of headphones and usually just listen to streaming talk radio on my phone with cheapola earbuds that I got at the discount store. My purpose in getting these headphones was to help me concentrate on work by isolating me from outside noise and letting me listen to non-distracting music/radio/whatever to help me focus at the computer. I did research and narrowed my search down to Bose SoundTrue (within a reasonable price range, had what I was looking for), either the around-the-ear or on-ear... with the try-on being the deciding factor, as I wear glasses and comfort in that regard was extremely important.That background in place--I am really and truly glad I invested in these headphones. Not only do they meet my purpose in helping me concentrate, but I have actually started to appreciate music again. Obviously, the quality of anything you listen to will be dependent not just on the headphones or speakers you're using, but the quality of the medium, type/size of music file, hardware, etc. But going back through my music library has been an absolute joy. Not only did I buy new headphones, but I feel like I also now have a whole new music collection to (re)discover as if I'd never really heard it before. Having a high quality pair of headphones has rekindled a love of music that I haven't had in a really long time.So far, the best experiences I've had listening with these have been to instrumental works (Lindsay Sterling, the Piano Guys, other classical music via Amazon Prime streaming), but some of the pop music I had has also turned out to be more interesting than I thought it was, now that I can hear the additional layers. I listened to my old "Sinatra at the Sands" album (it was recorded live) and felt like I was there. While these have no electronic "noise cancellation" feature, I found that the around-the-ear nature of these very comfortable headphones do a great job of blocking out noise and letting you concentrate on what you're listening to.Rather than continue gushing... I'll just leave it at this. I'm glad I made this investment. I'm truly enjoying listening to music with these headphones (and I have used them for phone calls too--works great). They were pricey compared to what I've spent on audio before, but for me, it turned out to be well worth it. If you are an audiophile with a habit of listening to your music on superior equipment... well, I have no experience with that, so it's  hard for me to say comparatively how you would feel about these. But for me--I love them!

VI actually like the headphones, but I am disappointed in Amazon, Bose or whoever is the actual seller of this product. The product appears to function just fine, but it is clearly a factory second / blemished model.  After reading several other reviews to confirm this, the white and blue model has a very easily seen red blemish on the head band.  Mine is almost 1 inch long.I plan to keep the headphones because I did get a good price and like them, but I would like to have known I was buying a blemished model beforehand.  I will mostly be using them at home.

VExcellent Under $200 Headphones
p68

VWhile this is not my first Bose audio product, the SoundTrue are my first Bose headphones.  Previously, I reviewed the Sennheiser HD 558 headphones, and I will compare them to the SoundTrue where appropriate.If you\u2019ve read my other headphone reviews, you know that we are going to start with design.  While the cans look smaller than others do, they still cover my ears completely.  The oval design is close to the shape of the ear, and I find this to be the most comfortable - as opposed to a purely round shape.  The headband and earcup padding is minimal, yet it is very comfortable.  They look smaller than my HD 558\u2019s by quite a bit.  However, the headband is metal rather than plastic, and it has the proper amount of tension to provide a secure fit without clamping.  While I don\u2019t quite forget that they are there, the cushion, lack of clamping, and overall lightweight nature of the SoundTrue make them my comfort champion.  This is the area where most headphones struggle for me because I have a fairly large head.  I realize this is a very personal aspect of headphones, but I haven\u2019t found a better, more comfortable fit to date.  These cans are designed for mobile use with a shorter length cable, a 3.5 mm plug, and an iOS compatible inline control.  This means that they are target for the phone, tablet, and computer group rather than the studio group.  It is also attributable to the mobile design that these headphones are easy to drive with lower power requirements.  I was able to get plenty of volume out of my laptop at 12% volume.  For reference, other over-the-ear headphones usually fall in the 15-20% range.  There are a few design items with which I can pick small nits.  The leather (or leather like) padding makes for a warmer wearing experience.  During longer sessions, my ears tended to sweat.  In addition, the plug is straight rather than right angle.  In my opinion, headphones for mobile devices should have a right angle plug period.  The straight plug creates undo stress.  Finally, Bose included a nice case for the SoundTrue, but you have to disconnect the cable in order to use it.  I would rather not incur the wear and tear on the connector, but I am picking nits.  None of these things is a deal-breaker, but I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing changes in these areas.Yes, I\u2019m finally going to talk about sound quality.  I\u2019ve included my reference songlist below that I keep fairly static across headphone reviews.  The biggest difference in sound between the Bose SoundTrue and the Sennheiser HD 558 is related to design.  The former are \u201cclosed\u201d while the latter are \u201copen\u201d.  The SoundTrue provide good noise isolation, and they leak very little sound.  In other words, they provide more of a private listening experience - great for coffee shops, trains, and other public settings.  The HD 558 are a contrast, and they are better suited for listening at home.  The SoundTrue are excellent across the board in giving an accurate, faithful reproduction of the songs on my list.  There are songs where a closed design is more favorable.  I thought that \u201cAs Hope And Promise Fade\u201d and \u201cSo What\u201d benefitted from the closed design of the SoundTrue because it created a smaller, more intimate reproduction.  The HD 558\u2019s open design shines on songs like \u201cModerator\u201d or any style that is suited to a large venue - think stadium rock show.  Don\u2019t get me wrong.  Both the SoundTrue and the HD 558 deliver excellent sound on all of these.  What I\u2019ve provided you is a contrast along the lines of what types of food pair best with two different styles of excellent wine.If I could only have one between the SoundTrue and the HD 558, I would take the SoundTrue.  The comfort pushes them ever so slightly past my previous champions from Sennheiser.  Hopefully, you have a better idea as to whether or not the Bose SoundTrue are what you need, but please ask questions below in the comments.K'Naan - "ABCs" (bass)Delerium - "Chrysalis Heart" (bass)Guns `N Roses - "Chinese Democracy" (clarity)Evanescence - "End Of The Dream" (detail)Garbage - "Automatic Systematic Habit" (detail)Megadeth - \u201cSudden Death\u201d (channel separation)Chris Cornell - "As Hope And Promise Fade" (clarity)Miles Davis - "So What" (jazz)Tchaikovsky - "Moderato (Swan Lake, Act II)" (classical)

VSuch a Steal! Wow!
p73
sg5
VI am impressed. They are sleek, lightweight, and beautifully designed. They have a full, well-balanced, ultra clean, crisp sound. They sound good at low volume and at high volume. They have a full, rich sound when plugged into a low powered device like my Moto G phone, and they sound even more amazing plugged into my 400 watt Yamaha stereo receiver. They do an excellent job of keeping outside noises out. I live on a busy street near a train station. In the afternoon I like to take a rest, since I'm usually up at 4am. Between the train horns and the cars flying down my street, it's impossible to fall asleep. But I can put these headphones on at low volume, and the train horns and traffic become barely audible, and I pass out in minutes. It helps that I can barely feel them on my head, because they are so light. They are very comfortable to wear for long periods.It is clear that some smart minds invested a good bit of time coming up with an efficient, beautiful design. There is nothing wasted. In my opinion they created the best possible sound in the most efficient possible package. You could probably cram deeper bass into a bulkier headphone, but at the cost of more weight. And with added weight it is necessary to have more support. I recently purchased a pair of Audio Technica ath-m50s, and after 30 minutes of wearing them I felt like my skull was deformed, like I had passed through the birth canal a second time. The Bose feel like my favorite pair of shoes. They agree with my head and ears in every way. For me personally, I prefer a lighter weight headphone with excellent sound quality, and a punchy, tight, light bass, to a heavier headphone that has heavier deep bass. However, as with any headphone (or speaker, for that matter) more power helps drive the low frequency sounds. So if I'm in the mood for bass I'll plug the Bose into my stereo receiver to get a fuller sound. But for chillout music I can just plug them into my android phone and they are glorious.

VGreat comfort, mediocre sound, poor sound levels

VI purchased these headphones as I was looking for a comfortable pair that I could wear a good portion of the day while working in the office.My requirements, in order of importance, were:1)  Low sound leakage (as to not disturb neighboring co-workers)2)  Comfort3) Sound qualityGoing into the purchase, I was willing to give up some noticeable sound quality in return for comfort but still wanted a good sounding pair of cans.  For comparison purposes, I have recently purchased (& returned for separate reasons) both Beyerdynamics DT770 Pro (250 Ohms) (too much sound leakage) and Audio Technica ATH-M50x (not comfortable enough for me) headphones in my search for a pair.Back to the Bose SoundTrue.Cons:My first issue is they are not easy headphones to drive.  I cannot find any technical specifications indicating their impedance, but they must be significantly higher than the 38 ohm ATH-M50x.  In terms of volume level they sound closer to the DT770 250 Ohms when connected straight to a macbook or iPhone 5s with no external amplifier.  This was very surprising to me and I didn't expect to have any issues in this area, but volume levels from the Bose SoundTrue were quite poor.My second issue is they were very flat sounding.  I realize they are closed-back headphones, so wasn't expecting the sound stage of an open back pair, but I was quite disappointed in the sound quality of these headphones.  I tried them connected both directly to a macbook and through a desktop headphone amplifier (I am still in the market for a quality DAC) but in both cases the Bose SoundTrue had lackluster performance.  If you believe headphones drastically improve after burn-in, I will admit I did not keep these headphones long enough to test if there was any difference after extended use.My third complaint is to do with the design.  The ear cups do fold flat (making them easy to transport).  However, they only fold flat in one direction, and it seems to be the wrong way.  To clarify, when wearing the headphones with proper orientation (R earcup over the right ear, L over left ear), if you pull the headphones off and rest them around your neck and wish to flatten the earcups against your chest you cannot.  The ear cups will only fold so they are facing outwards, not inwards.  If you look through Bose marketing material & images for these headphones you will notice what I am talking about.  Images where people are wearing the headphones around their neck always show the earcups facing outwards.  As a matter of personal preference, I find this awkward.Pros:These headphones come with a great case, additionally they are very light and super comfy to wear.  I could see wearing these all day without any issues.

VI was looking for a pair of over the ear headphones that were stylish and of excellent quality. I wanted to relax with these, watch movies and listen to my music. Not bang my head with bass. These are exactly what I was looking for. Bose is a brand you can trust for durability and quality. These headphones are comfortable and oh so cute. They can be used in all my equipment, laptop, ipod, etc. Absolutely love them.

VBalanced Sound Spectrum
p90
sg5
VBose is primarily known for their active noise canceling (ANC) phones though they have for years offered non-ANC phones. This is my first pair of Bose phones that are not in the ANC class of headphones and my impression of them is mostly positive. I do see some room for improvement, though.First off, these are without question the lightest headphones (aside from ear buds) that I have ever worn. I am a bit odd in that I actually prefer heavier headphones but this is strictly a preference, not a criticism. In spite of the weight, the phones fit very nicely and do not feel like they're about to slip off if you lean down. This is not to say they're tight, but they are tight enough to hold well. They're easy to adjust too, so getting them to fit just right is simple enough. If exceptionally lightweight headphones are your thing, this is what you want.The cord is a little different than other phones I have used in that the jacks on either end are of different sizes. This is good and bad. It's good in that there's no question of how to attach the cord because it only fits one way. But, it also means that a normal cord that comes with practically any other headphone will not work.The sound quality is definitely better than average but not perfect (certainly not audiophile-level). The sound spectrum seems to be fairly well balanced. The highs are good and the "edges" are crisp and clean for most tracks. The midrange is ok but slightly hollow. The bass is very good without being overdriven. One of the problems with a lot of headphones is that they tend to overdrive the bass which is fine if you really like your bass, but too much can overpower the rest of the spectrum and give some of us headaches. That these phones do not over-amplify the bass is a pleasant surprise.Having a pair of Bose QC-15 ANC phones, I can compare the two models' sound profiles and there are some slight differences. Where the QC-15s are great at the highs and overdrive the bass, the midrange is sorely lacking. The SoundTrue get the bass right and have good highs but fall slightly short on the midrange (though still better than the QC-15s). Comparing just the sound profiles and ignoring the ANC function, I prefer the SoundTrue over the QC-15s.The carrying case is nice and should provide some protection when packed for travel. I would have preferred a slightly harder and more crush-resistant case but that's me being picky. There's not a lot of extra room in the case so storage is not really an option with the case.The price is a little high ($180 as I write this) and that might be a little steep for some. It comes down to whether a less expensive set of phones delivers the same (or better) sound profile.My overall impression of the Bose SoundTrue headphones is positive. These are very comfortable and exceptionally lightweight and the sound quality is good though not perfect. These phones are above average and are worth consideration if you want non-ANC headphones or if you're looking for very lightweight headphones.

VUpdated: 2-15-2015I compared these against the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro and Grado SR-125. The Sennheiser will be the primary competition because it is a similar style headphone; the Grado will be a sound quality reference at a similar price point to the Bose.PRESENTATIONThey come in a leatherette case that looks and feels nice. They are easier to store than the Sennheisers because they are less bulky. However, the headphone wire has to be removed before storing it in its case.The headphones have an attractive understated style complimented by subtle highlights. I look funny with the Sennheisers on my head, but these actually look good on me.The headphone's outer plastic cover feels very smooth to the touch. The padding feels nice to the touch and the leather looks grainy. Inside the padding is a nice subtle colored pattern. When I hang them around my neck, the interior turn outwards, exposing the highlight. The padding and interior highlight is easily replaceable.When I put them on, they feel light-weight and loose fitting with a comfortable head band. I feel like these would feel cooler than the Sennheisers when it's warmer out.The headphone wire has control buttons on it. I can change the volume, play/pause music, and even skip tracks. It's a very nice touch that, to my surprise, works with my old iPod classic. Another plus is that the wire is very light, which won't damage my iPod classic headphone jack like my Sennheisers have done in the past.SEALMy primary purpose of listening to these would be to block out sound whether I'm at home or walking the streets. These headphones do not block sound as well as the Sennheisers. In addition, the loose fitting design can create distracting leaks in the seal when I turn my head.SOUND QUALITYI listened to these headphones for at least 10 hours. The music I listened to was compressed in Apple Lossless format. I used my MacBook Pro with iTunes for playback. The differences in sound quality noted in this review were also heard on my iPod Classic with music compressed in AAC format at 256kbps VBR quality (iTunes Plus).The Bose headphones went sufficiently loud when connected to the iPod. With the iPod at maximum volume, an album with a DR 12 rating was too loud, but bearable.A headphone amplifier is not a required, but it would improve your experience. I used the JDS Labs Objective2 for testing.- VS the HD 280 ProThe first difference that comes to mind is that the Bose sounds muffled. I think this is something that you get used, but it's obvious when comparing the headphones.The Bose seems to have a deeper soundstage. I perceive some space around instruments, but it is significantly obscured by the muffled presentation.The Bose has a warmer, smoother presentation of vocals.The Bose doesn't seem to reproduce presence very well. For example, guitar strings that are supposed to be close still found far away.The Bose produces a better sense of space.The Bose has a better reproduction of treble. It has more of a glow about it.The Bose has a better transient response. In one song, the Sennheiser blurred a light percussion on the right, where the Bose presented it well.This is a tough one because the Sennheiser sounds thin and tinny and the Bose sounds fat and bloated. Neither produce a satisfyingly natural sound. I'm kind of on the fence with this one,  but leaning slightly towards the Bose.- VS the SR-125The first difference that comes to mind is that the Bose sounds muffled. I think this is something that you get used, but it's obvious when comparing the headphones.The Bose seems to have a deeper soundstage. I perceive some space around instruments, but it is significantly obscured by the muffled presentation.The Bose doesn't seem to reproduce presence very well. For example, guitar strings that are supposed to be close still found far away.The Bose produces a better sense of space. Yet, its reproduction of ambience was only marginally better.When I played binaural music on the Bose, I didn't get the feeling that I was in the room with the music. The music still felt like it came from inside my head. This effect was better reproduced by the Grado, which is probably due to its open back design.The Bose seems to produce a punchier bass drum than the Grado. Although, it seems more uncontrolled and not as satisfying.The Bose has slightly brighter highs.In some songs, the better soundstage of the Bose can be appealing. However, most songs benefit more from the clarity, detail, and presence of the Grado.CONCLUSIONThe first thing I noticed about these headphones was their muffled sound. Because it is missing the clarity, it sounds like it would feel to watch a movie on VHS (remember that): things are there, but they are not defined. In addition sounds have this hollow feel, which ruins their presence. As I progressed, I started to realize that these headphones do not sound natural: they don't present music with convincing realism.For just $20 more than the TrueSound, the Grado SR-225 would win without question. You may also want to check out Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x if you really need closed headphones.So this is my question to you: how much would you prioritize the Look and Feel of a headphone over its Sound Quality? With that question, I feel like I understand why Grado waits until their $300 headphone to add a padded leather headband to their lineup. I think I needed to pay more for Sound Quality before I was ready to pay more for improvements to the Look and Feel.Bose has a different strategy in which they give you the full Look and Feel first, and maybe the Sound Quality later. Bose's lineup only offers 2 headphones: these TrueSound headphones @$180 and the QuietComfort 25 @ $300. I can only guess that the QuietComfort includes improvements to sound quality (not including the Noise Canceling). I wouldn't have looked at the QuietComfort for improvements to Sound Quality, but maybe these choices speak more about their target audience.

VMy pair of Bose on-ear headphones broke.  No sound emanated from the left speaker. I called  Bose for repair options, and they offered to exchange my broken headphones for a new pair at half a price.  The price even included a UPS label to send them the old pair.  I could not pass this offer. This extended warranty program is very attractive.  It gives me assurance that I will have a pair of Bose headphones for a long time.  My old pair lasted like 9 years. Bose may use the broken headphones to analyze what went wrong.  Or maybe they need the broken phones to avoid abuse.  They asked for all accessories.  Why do they need old cases and cables?  To avoid counterfeits?  I do not  now, but I was happy to hand over accessories I do not need.  I kept the connection cables, though.In the process of looking for alternatives to replace the broken Bose, before calling the Bose company, I purchased a pair of Scosche RH1056M and Audio-Technica SonicFuel ATH-AZ1iS.  The Scosche are packed with accessories, cables, a nice case, PC adapter cable for the mic, inline remote, and even a cleaning cloth.  The Audio-Technica have an inline remote.  The sound quality of both is very good, on par with the SoundTrue. The comfort of both is awful, due to tight bands and flat plates pressing the ears.  The Scosche are heavy.  I cannot wear both these headphones more than a few minutes.  Nonetheless, I paid heavily discounted prices and I decided to keep them both.  I gave them to my children, who do not complain about the tightness nor the weight of the Scosche.In the end I had to buy the Bose around-the-ear for comfort.  These are the most comfortable headphones that I have ever tried.  The cups are cups proper, enclosing my ears, offering good isolation.  I can hear well separated, crisp sounds emanating from my iPod touch. The comfort and isolation is worth the investment.I was really surprised that other inexpensive alternatives match the sound quality of the Bose. I am also surprised that comfort is tough to get right.  Why is so difficult for other brands to properly design ear cups and head bands?Bose offering a limited number of headphone products is an advantage. I would rather not be distracted with model numbers and minor variations.  I only want a pair of over-the-ear headphones to plug to my iPod.  With Bose, I just had the option for color.  Beautiful and efficient simplicity.  With other brands, the variety can be maddening.  I am digressing, but the other day I was shopping for a printer, and HP offered a continuum of model numbers, from 5001  to 7999. Really?  I just need one printer.  To make things more confusing, the  5005 model was more expensive than the 6077.  Really?  So, I just closed my eyes and picked a printer from the shelves, at random.I am very happy with my Bose headphones.  I do not think little of them because other brands match the sound quality with lower cost headphones. I am willing to pay more for comfort, material quality, and warranty.  I am glad technology is catching on, which enhances competition to the benefit of the customer.  I am 43 and remember my days with a Sony Walkman, tons of tapes in my pocket, and the hissy sound emanating from the plastic uncomfortable headphones with stiff cables. I listen to the tons of music that I have collected ever since, all fitting in my iPod touch, sounding beautifully with my SoundTrue headphones.

VI am very happy with these. It is important to read the instructions and insert the correct plugs into the correct ports, because the plugs are different lengths, and it is critical to push the plugs all the way into the ports. I suspect that the the people who wrote the negative reviews didn't do this correctly. The headphones are lighter than I expected and I can listen to an entire movie and only need to adjust them once or twice. They are quite comfortable, but if you have large or protruding ears, these might be too small or uncomfortable. I don't think my earns are especially large, but they just fit into the phones. We're having a heat wave here in Seattle and my place is super hot, but the phone pads don't get hot or cause any more sweating than can be expected. They don't block all environmental noise, but they do reduce its volume. I have been using Apple earbuds for years and could hardly hear anything streamed, but with these I can, and with great sound. Be aware that while these do work with a MacBook, the inline controls only work with compatible iPhones, iPods, and iPads.

VGot these for $75 on Black Friday so I won't be as hard on these, especially with the 2nd gen being out. They are pretty to look at and are pretty comfortable to wear. Very lightweight.If you put these on my head blindly I would have never known they were Bose. Sounds like a cheap pair headphones, nothing but midrange. No much high or low to write about. Tweaking with a EQ helps but then the bass comes distorted at a certain volume. It always sounds as if you didn't connect the cable all the way into the headphone jack and just getting treble.I were expecting for these to sound like my Bose Soundlink bluetooth on ear headphones which gives you the "Bose" sound, has inline capability and close in retail price.I also have the red blemish on the left side like some reviewers indicated.These are good if you're looking for headphones that are lightweight, looks & feels good, and can handle basic audio such as podcasts, audio books and light study music. Works as a decent Xbox/PS4 headset too. If you're looking to hear and feel everything you will want to look at the Soundlink or similar.

VI am an out of state college student and needed a good pair of headphones. I bought them 3 months ago and never have been so IMPRESSED by a product. When I study, they are so comfortable. I can listen to music and the quality is amazing. I can take a call simply by pressing the answer button on my phone. I can ignore the loud talkers in the library. I know that they are not completely sound proof, but they block out most sound, even when they are not even playing music. When I am traveling/on  an airplane, you can hear anything. They also block out noise and you can listen to quality music. I put them on and fall asleep. They are SOOOOO COMFORTABLE. I bought these because I didnt want the competitive brand. My college friends all love to borrow these and I could go on and on about how much i LOVE these. BUY THEM if you are indecisive. They are 20 times better than the competitor.

VSound great!  Fit very well on my (big) head
p140
sg5
VI'm a guy with a big head.  I wear a size 7 3/4 fitted baseball cap, and as such, headphones are an issue for me.  The problem I have is the majority of them don't cover my head enough - even when fully stretched out.  I've had headphones in the past that don't completely cover my ears, and that's always been a concern.  So when I took these out of the package at first, I thought I was going to be dealing with the same kind of thing.  Much to my surprise, they fit me VERY well.  The thing is they're not giant speakers, either.  The couple that I have managed to find in the past that fit me are mega huge.  These are not.  Even when properly fitted on my head, I've stretched them out about 2/3 of the way - there was more space to go, so another friend of mine who wears a size 8 fitted baseball cap would be able to use these well, too.I wrote about that first, because to me, I can put up with a lot of issues with headphones if they fit my head well, and don't make me feel like I'm trying to squeeze my brain out through my nose from the things squashing my insides that are sitting outside my ears!These headphones are from Bose, and while I'm not the biggest audiophile around, I recognize the name for what it is - "Quality Sound". I've read many other reviews that talk about how this level of bass is, and that level of treble is, and sound separation, and noise cancelling..  I'm not getting into that level of detail.  What I can tell you is when I wear these headphones, they're quite clear and crisp.  They may not have the most bass of any headphone I've ever wore, but some reviews have said it has "no bass", which is not valid.  It's just not one of these pieces of equipment that pushes bass to unnatural levels.  I like the overall balance, sound, and clarity these headphones provide.  I've gone through about five or six pairs of headphones in the last few years, and while I've liked some, I love these.  If they ever broke, I'd definitely look into getting another pair, because I love the sound, I REALLY love how they feel on my head.One other thing about the feel on my head beyond just fitting my head.  They feel VERY light.  They're the lightest headphones I've ever worn - so much so I've given some thought about plugging them into my iPhone and using them that way - they're comfortable enough to sit at your desk all day, and while maybe I wouldn't want to wear them outside doing anything that would make my head sweat, they are light enough you could if you really wanted to.So yeah, not the most audio detailed review, but they feel light, sit great on my head, and to these pair of ears - they sound awesome.  Can't ask for any more than that.As a side note, I strongly urge you to go to Youtube and search for a review of these headphones done by Lance Gross.  It's a 13:15 long video, and is quite excellent - it is titled "Bose SoundTrue Around-Ear Headphone Review with Live Sound Leak Test".  You will be looking for Youtube video 5dk7ygkPnxk.  Try searching Youtube for that.

p145
sg5
VThese headphones are great, but ...When I tried them in the store, the sound quality was great.  Present but not overwhelming bass (like some other popular headphones out there) and highs and mids that stood out in the mix without making the sound quality harsh or too mid-heavy and narrow-sounding.When I got the new headphones in the mail, I was pretty disappointed.  They didn't sound like the set in the store, were super bass-heavy, and just all around seemed to hurt my ears.  I was about to send them back, but knowing that most speakers need time to break in, decided to play music through them for a solid 48 hrs first.Listening to the phones again after the break-in period was a completely different experience ... they totally opened up and sounded smoother across the entire frequency range without any one frequency sounding too heavy.Breaking-in headphones might seem elementary, but for the price, it would be nice if Bose did some sort of pre-break-in process.  Just beware of this and don't judge your phones before giving them time to equalize.

VI must say, these are great headphones.  I don't know what the specifications on it are, but I was blown away by my first listen using my old iPad (1) running Spotify.  Practically froze me in the awesomeness of the sound.  Later at work, I used them to listen to Spotify on my Linux desktop computer, and the jack had trouble connecting with the plug coming from the computer.  As a result, the sound was at first hollow and tinny - i subsequently jiggled the jack and got a good connection - I mention this because if this had been my first taste of these headphones I might have thought they were terrible.  Bose does say that they are specifically designed for iPads, iPods, and iPhones - so just be aware that on other connectors you might have to jiggle the jack to get the right sound.In some ways I prefer these to sound-cancelling headphones (my wife and son have Bose sound-cancelling headphones which I gave them as gifts, and I have a pair of less expensive noise-cancelling Sennheisers).  For one thing, these do not require batteries, but they also don't have that slightly oppressive noise-cancelling quality that I find can actually be a little tiring.Would I pay $180 for these headphones?  Maybe for a gift.  The Bose brand is hard to beat (and shows you really care) but I suspect for daily purposes you could be a much cheaper pair, and worry less about them being stolen.

VThese are excellent headphones, great sound quality. I love it.Whats Good:1. Sound quality - most important aspect of any headphones are sound quality and comfort factor. And these headphones are great in both. Sound quality is amazing, so clear. I get to experience to true quality of songs now.2. very comfortable - These are soft padded and around ear headphones. Feels very light and comfortable; I can use these for hours without any ear pain.3. in-line mic - I had used Bose OE1 headphones few years back, they didn't have inline mic at that time. Its good to see in-line mic being added. It increases the uses of headphones, allows you to take phone calls as well.4. Works with PS4 - with in-line mic; I am able to use it as my gaming headphones as well. Works perfectly fine with PS4 controller. I don't need to buy separate gaming headsets anymore.5. carry bag - It included a good quality carry bag.6. multiple color options - These headphones are available in 4 colors options, good to have color choice.7. cable is detachable so in case anything goes wrong with cable, you can just buy new cable.8. These are wired headphone, no Bluetooth connectivity. but this also means that no charging requried.9. These looks super cool as well.10. value for money - These are premium headphones in $140 price range. Well worth the price.**If you found this review helpful, do vote by replying Yes to 'Was this review helpful' **

The comfort is great as well you can listen for hours without hurting your ears.  If you want perfect sound I recommend these great headphones worth every penny add your files as Apple Looseless files for the best sound I've ever heard with a pair of headphones.  I'm sure there are better I've just never heard them and They probably cost a pretty penny.

VSo, far, so good.  They sound good.  I have had them for about a month.  One complaint is that when you take them off and put them around your neck the ear parts turn out, not in, so the inside of the ear piece is exposed to the elements.  Also, when I hook it to my computer for video meetings, people cannot hear me talk through the ear phones.  This is annoying as my computer is 3 feet away from me on my docking station, so the computer speaker cannot hear me well from that far away.  There may be a way to make this work by buying a different input converter for the computer.  I'll have to research that.  Anyone know?

VPretty good headphones, delivered quickly with great packaging. Comes with an audio jack which you can take off for storage. Fits nicely over the ears and looks great. Would definitely recommend, although keep in mind it is not bass heavy.Side note though, the audio up and down buttons on the jack does not work with android phones. The middle button plays and pauses music on a Galaxy S5 though. Have not tested the mic function, (if it even exists).4 out of 5 because it feels great, but is pricey, has no android/pc support with the buttons and could be just a tad more bass orientated.

VI would faint
p178
sg5
VI used to use the earbud that came with the iphone, which is not a bad product at all,  but this headphone gave me a whole new experience of sound quality.  I also have Bose IE2 Audio headphones (looks like earbud) for workout, and thought I would try around-ear Headphone.  With this headphone, I felt like I was in the center of the musical theater and made me think the origin of sound was coming from the surrounding air around me rather than the plastic device by my ear canal.  Not only because of it's sound quality, but also because it's so comfortable and I would forget wearing it.  This product reminded me that listening to music, or any sound is the physical experience. With this headphone, I listened to the violin, and they are fantastic with enriched sound in depth and not squeaky at all.  I'm also aware of some reviewers are saying there are better headphones around or better versions of Bose etc... So I would imagine if I hear the headphone sound better than this product, I would faint.  I'm not kidding.  I may try the pricier version of Bose in the future, but for now, I am very happy with this headphone.

VA Very Good Investment
p189
sg5
VI am a college student who loves to listen to her music, and who really likes high quality sound.  Though the Bose SoundTrue Headphones are very expensive, they were a very good investment.  I will be using them for many years to come.  The sound quality is very good--much better than what I had hoped.  I went from using a cheap $15 pair of headphones to the Bose SoundTrue Headphones, and there really is a world of difference.  From listening to Josh Groban songs to Fall Out Boy or pop music, it always sounds like I am right in the recording studio where they are recording the song--that's how good the headphones are.  It's like having superior surround sound speakers right over your ears.The headphones fit comfortably over my ears--the only time that they are slightly uncomfortable is when I am wearing big earrings--the headphone's slight pressure on my ears makes my earrings poke into my skin, but that problem is easily remedied.  The headphones are very lightweight, and they don't make your head hurt even after hours of wearing them.  The only other thing that I would say is to make sure you push the headphone jack all the way into your headphones--push until you hear it click, because if you don't hear it click, the sound will only go to one side of your headphones.  It works perfectly when the jack is pushed in properly, and I have never had any problems with it disconnecting or falling out if it's tugged on--it is very secure.These headphones were a very good investment for me--I use them every single day, and the use I'm getting out of them more than compensates for the price that they cost.  If you want excellent sound quality combined with stylish looking headphones, I would definitely recommend the Bose SoundTrue Headphones to you.  They are comfortable, stylish and they have a superior sound quality.

VNot for all types of music, in my opinion
p195
sg5
VReviewing headphones is a difficult challenge. Everyone has his or her particular tastes, and what sounds "phenomenal" differs from person to person.  Variables such as the genre of music preferred, purpose of the headphones, (ie watching movies, listening to music, or the spoken word in general) and personal preference regarding balance of sound, must also be factored in.I recently reviewed the Bose SoundTrue Headphones On-Ear Style, Purple/Mint and I was able to compare those with two other models of headphones on the market. I was not able to do so with the over-the-ear since the only over-the-ear cans I have are a pair of Sennheiser HD 598's which are an "open" headphone (and sound amazing), whereas the Bose SoundTrue are "closed," or more of a noise-canceling headphone. This would not have been a fair comparison, in my opinion.I compared different genres of music in differing formats; all were MP3@320kbs, FLAC, or regular CD's. For solo instruments such as piano or classical music, the Bose sound excellent. Artists such as Miles Davis, George Winston, and other instrumentals sound really great. It was when I listened to genres with vocals or a wider, fuller spectrum of sound that my enthusiasm for these headphones waned. I found the Bose to have excellent lows and bottom end, but the vocals and the midrange suffered greatly.  The midrange was virtually non-existent, and the highs lacked brightness, clarity, and the crispness that I prefer. It's like the highs have a film or veneer that prevents the brisk, bright, clear sound from coming through. Vocals reek of a bit too much bass for my taste.Bose have a reputation for a signature sound that people often either love of hate. I gave these 4 stars (3.5 for sound, 4 overall), partly out of respect for people that do subscribe to this particular sound. As stated, the solo instruments like piano and horns, as well as classical music, sound pleasant.  Personally, I would not shell out $179 (the current price as I am reviewing) for a sound that is this unbalanced.Other good things about these headphones are the noise canceling quality. Also, the headphones fold compactly, fit neatly in a case included, and the cord detaches and has volume +, -, and pause buttons for convenience.3.5 stars for sound, 4 stars overall

VBose has a reputation of making headphones that sound very crisp and clear. I loved this particular model when I tried them on at the store but I needed some time to research a little more. I then decided to get a pair of these from Amazon. To my surprise, they don't sound anything like a Bose headset. The pair I got sounded pretty much the same as my Apple EarPods. I tried convincing myself that they didnt sound the same, that these are different, but I kept getting disappointed every time.Conclusion? I felt like these were just your average sounding headphones not much different from the Apple EarPods. Honestly quite upset as I expected that 'wow' factor, but I guess it didn't work out.It'll be a while now before I give Bose headphones another try.

VI've owned other Bose on-ear headphones, the Bose QC-20i in-ear noise canceling, and other brands of in-ear headphones. I can definitely say these are the best headphones I've owned so far in this price range.The sound is incredibly clear and full. The bass isn't overwhelming, which I find to be a good thing. Since these are around-ear headphones, I don't have to turn the volume too loud to hear the music. Even when nothing is playing, the headphones block out a decent amount of environmental noise.The best part of these headphones is how incredibly comfortable they are. They are extremely light and flexible. I find myself forgetting I'm even wearing headphones, that's how well they fit.Now for the one flaw. The headphone cord is just too long for certain situations. At work the length of the cord is great. I can move around my desk and I don't have to worry about yanking the cord out of my computer or pulling my phone to the ground. When I'm out and about I find the cord is too long. With my phone in my pocket and the headphones on, the cord hangs down around my knees. I've been tucking excess cord into my pocket, which isn't a deal breaker, but is slightly annoying.Overall, these headphones are fantastic. The comfort and sound far outweigh any negatives. If you can afford these, buy them. It's as simple as that.

Vthese are very good.  at first i thought i might need to return them, but then i realized that i didn't have my audio settings set correctly on my PC, so after that i was satisfied with the audio/sound.  i haven't tested on a phone or mp3 player yet, but on a computer they sound really good.  also they are very comfortable and if you have glasses, they don't bother or press your ears against those side sticks like some on-ear headphones do.  these over-ear headphones are all around pretty good.  just don't expect extreme bass.  don't get me wrong, the bass is still very good, but not extreme.  also the mids and highs are excellent.  the build quality is good as well.  it's not as flimsy as i thought it might be and like other people were saying.  for those that will be running around all over the place and being active and possibly exercising with it, i can't say that it will handle all that stress and last a long time, but for me, i am only using it carefully and at home all the time, so i guess it's easier to take care of and it should last quite a while.  the last thing is the price.  even though these headphones are good quality, i think they should be under $150, and that's the only reason for the 1 star deduction.

VI was able to wear the Bose SoundTrue one time and the sound kept going off and on.  Had to jiggle the cord for it to work. Next day my husband put them on and I said nothing about the problem.  He immediately said they did not work; then I tried again and it was a no-go. Immediately sent them back.  Did not want to replace with the same product in which it could happen again.  Had other earphones that I used for a few years with no issue until I broke them. Needed a replacement and tried the Bose.  My other headphones (forget manufacturer/not Bose)  were purchased at an O'Hare kiosk for $150.  A world apart in quality. I have been a good customer of Bose, but not for this.

VI would recommend these headphones to all music lovers, workout enthusiast, or even someone who just wants to block out sounds.  So if you fit in one of those categories then keep reading for real advice from a real customer.A little bit about Bose SoundTrue:These specific types of head phones come in four different colors; black, white, mint, and lastly black with a mint pattern. They are around ear style with an adjustable band to fit all head sizes. It comes with a nice hard case to keep the headphones safe and protected during travel. Also a pretty cool feature is the audio cord has a controller to your music to play, pause, and change the volume and for convenience the audio cord can be simply removed.Comfort:The memory foam cushions will be your new favorite thing. These cushions feel like a pillow resting on your head.  Not only is the comfort all about the cushion of the headphones but also the weight. These specific headphones are light weight which is something you will fall in love with.Durability:These headphones are known to be high quality and durable. I\u2019ve dropped, stretched them, and sat on them many times and they aren\u2019t broken yet, that says something about the durability to me. To add to the durability I use these headphones most when working out, therefore they have been sweat in and still show no wear and tear.Sound:What headphones are truly used for is to listen to music and by doing that you need good quality. These are great headphones that cancel out sound to make it more enjoyable to listen to the music you prefer with no interruptions.  They have a great sound level that can be controlled to your preferred volume. Also the sound quality has a natural sound of the music and does not add any static or echoes that shouldn\u2019t be there.Dislikes:Though these headphones have plenty of perks, the length of the audio cord is extremely long. Some people may love the length, but since I use these headphones most while working out I catch the cord getting stuck on other objects. I would prefer the headphones to come with two lengths of cords or even a shorter cord. If you feel the same way about the length of the cord, Bose does make a Bluetooth set of headphones that have no cord called Bose SoundLink.I understand these headphones are a bit on the pricy side, but you will get so much more out of them then a cheap, generic pair of headphones. In the end the price is worth the product.

VI decided to spend the extra cash on these back in August, and I have to say that these have to be some of the best headphones that I have ever owned: the quality and durability is outstanding. These are great for several reasons. For starters, the comfort that comes with these is great, they are extremely light weight and are adjustable at the top to fit you perfectly. The ear cups of made of a soft material that doesn't squeeze onto your head but that is sturdy, yet gentle enough, to allow you to wear these for hours on end. (The carrying case that comes included is very handy as well). The sound of these headphones is quite honestly some of the best out there for the price. If you are looking for super deep bass then these might not be the right headphones for you. I have listened to all sorts of different kinds of music on these such as alternative r&b;, hip-hop, rock, house, electronic, and dance, all of which have sounded extremely crisp and clear to the point where I have noticed the sounds on tracks that I hadn't before. While the sound on these is clear, full, and rich, these are not completely noise canceling but they do cover most of the outside noise. Bottom line for sound is that it is the clearest I have heard from any headphones. The price is what gets me on these every time. As a college student, I must say that it is very worth paying the $160-$180 for them because they are quite durable, the sound is unmatched with some of the other competing headphones, and they are quite sleek, all while not breaking the bank.Conclusion: If you're looking for a light, stylish, and quality headphones with clear, rich sound, then I highly recommend these Bose headphones.

VMy son and I both have these headphones and are very happy with them. They are very comfortable and lightweight with good sound. My son does audio production, and while he doesn't use these headphones while actually dj-ing and producing, these are his go-to headphones the rest of the time because of their comfort and good sound.The one flaw of these headphones is the extreme delicacy of the cable. My son has gone through three cables so far (the original and two replacements) and is now on his fourth cable. A cat catching it's leg in the cable is enough to bend the plug or yank the cable enough to make it stop working.BUT! we found a serendipitous solution. I accidentally ordered the wrong replacement cable last time, and it turned out to be a much sturdier cable with a right-angle plug (which is helpful because it does not extend out so far). It's this product: Bose 720875-0020 Quiet Comfort 25 headphones with Inline Mic/Remote Cable (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OGA2QZC/ref=pd_luc_rh_sbs_02_03_t_img_lh?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)This cable needs a slight modification to work with the original SoundTrue headphones: the rubber around the plug that connects to the headphones is very slightly too large to fit into the hole on the headphones, so we shaved a tiny bit of the rubber off using a craft knife and it now works perfectly. Here's hoping the sturdier cable will last longer than a couple of months!

VThe sound on these is punchy and clear - the bass is by no standards booming, but you'll hear every note from every instrument (even the parts you may never have noticed before) assuming the mix is good. Time will tell if these hold up very well - these are the successor of the AE2 headphones, and my AE2s ended up developing a weird stereo balance issue where the left can (which had the cord jack) was louder than the right by a very noticeable amount. They lasted about a year and a half before developing that issue, though, so it's gonna be a while.Other thing, I didn't take a star off for it, but the cord on this thing is really fragile looking. My AE2 cord looked like it would survive the zombie apocalypse, this thing looks like it wouldn't survive getting caught in the carrying case zipper. We'll see.[UPDATE 20 July 2015] This model is well on its way to having the same problem as the AE2. If the cord, where it attaches to the left can, gets bumped in anyway, you're probably going to lose microphone and right can signal, and have to mess around with the cable to restore proper operation. Quite a pain, and makes me concerned that the connector might start to break internally after enough of this foolery.It really doesn't help that the connector on the headphone end seems to be half the diameter of the end that plugs into the phone, making it more fragile.We'll see how long these things stay intact.

VI am a techno-geek and I have lots of gadgets. I already owned a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 2 Headphones - but these are my new favorites - because I can talk on my iPhone with them. These fit very comfortably around my ears without touching or squishing them. Like every Bose product I've ever had the pleasure to play with - the sound is awesome... but Bose upped the ante with these headphones - because the audio is not only awesome coming into your ears, but also going out via microphone.I don't like holding my phone to my ear - so I usually use the earbuds that came with the phone - they're portable, functional and unlike a bluetooth headset, I don't have to worry about battery life. The only problem is the sound quality. It's decent in a closed room with no other noise or breezes made by air conditioning or fans. If I'm on the phone in the car, I will sometimes have to turn off the A/C so the person I'm talking to can hear me clearly. Not so with these Bose SoundTrue Headphones!Another issue I'd have is that the stock earbuds will pick up any surrounding sound and amplify it. A TV on low in the other room booms through the mic, so the person I'm talking to starts complaining about all the loud noise in the background.My mother is hard of hearing in person, much less over the phone, but she has declared that when I'm using these headphones, she can hear me more clearly than she's ever been able to hear me over the phone before. I tested the call when my husband had the TV on normal volume and she could barely hear the noise in the background - and she could tell it was background noise. It was not interfering with the call.I love, love, love these headphones! My ONLY detraction from them being perfect (although they still get a 5 star rating), is that the 3.5mm cable (which is happily detachable - meaning it's replaceable if damaged!) only goes in the left headphone. I'm right-handed and my phone is always in my right pocket. If I'm driving, my phone is on a cradle on my dash. With the cable going into the left ear, it is crossing across the steering wheel to me. If I'm walking on the treadmill, it's across my body from my right pocket to my left ear. I'd have preferred either it being on the right side, or at least a choice w/ a jack on each side. Still - this is a vast improvement of the Quiet Comfort headphones... the cable is so dainty - it doesn't take much to kink or pinch it really good. If you messed it up on the older sets, you'd have to get a new pair. With this new set, you don't have to take Hemlock when your pet chews through the cable!These are a real treat. They are light weight, so I don't get fatigued wearing them, despite their size when compared to the stock earbuds that come with the iPhone. They come with a leatherette zip-up carrying case.

VOlder Version Soundtrue vs. Newer Soundtrue 2 Headphones
p331
sg5
VI recently purchased the Newer version of these, the Bose Soundtrue (Around Ear) Headphones 2 and was unhappy with them so I exchanged them for these, the older version.  Instantly, I could tell a difference in the sound quality with these across a range of music genres.  From Bela Fleck to Beyonce' and Creedence Clearwater to Common, there was a consistent level of great sound.  The perfect treble and bass balance, a depth that Bose is known for, that was missing from the Soundtrue 2 headphones which almost offered too much bass.  Aside from the main purpose of headphones, the sound quality, the actual design and weight of the older version feels substantially better than the newer version which are supposed to offer more padding on the headset and to feel lighter weight, however they somehow end up feeling 'cheaper'. If you are on the fence of whether to upgrade to the newer version of these, save yourself $80 and try these out.  Great deal for unbeatable quality!

VBought this pare at best buy before I had time to really test it. I choose the Bose SoundTrue Headphones Around-Ear for the light weight and comfort. And because I have always associated Bose with good audio, even though I had previously never owned a pair of Bose headphone before. (Too expensive for my then taste.)I brought it home and burned it in. When the base improved very little, and when compared to my Audio Technical ATH-M50, I was VERY disappointed.Needless to say, I bought these full price, $179, at BestBuy. So it was more expensive than my ATH-M50. But in the end, I returned these because aside from comfort, these are inferior in both build and audio quality.I would not pick these when there is much better headphones out there at better prices or equal pricing. If these ever drop to below $75 I might consider them. But even then I would hesitate, because I wouldn't really listen to them knowing I have better pairs at home.Both Audio-Technica and Sennheiser are great brands to look into. There is a reason why these two are popular among audiophiles.

Vlove the headphones - but if you break the cord you are out of luck
p342
sg5
VI love these headphones but it is important to note that there are no replacement cords available for these headphones so if you break the cord the very nice and very expensive headphones are worthless...you pretty much have to buy a new pair.I loved these headphones.  The sound was good, the size was just right and they didn't compress my head and give me headaches.The only issue I had before my cord was broken on a flight recently was that the cord was a bit too long and often got tangled on my chair, etc.  Not a huge deal...I adjusted to it.The bigger issue for me is that the cord broke and now I can't listen to them at all. Not only are replacement parts not an option, but finding a 2.5 to 3.5 cord of any time in a length appropriate for headphones is pretty much impossible.  Just be aware.  If you get them, protect the cord at all costs.**** Edit:  Bose followed up with me directly and the cord is coming but the headphones are too new to be out yet.  They took care of this situation to my satisfaction and assisted me so I could use my headphones, so edited my post with this follow up.  It is still true the cord is not available yet, but it will be by end of summer apparently.

VHEADPHONE SHOOT-OUT !!!
p347
sg5
VBackground:  I got tired of all the mixed reviews of best "closed, around-ear" headphones fewer than $200, so I got  7 of the top recommended brands/models and decided for myself (luckily, they had a 15 - 30 day trial period).  I needed a "closed" headphone so NO sound (for listening enjoyment only) could be heard by people around me.  I'm somewhat of an audiophile and an ex-band director...so perfect sound is important to me (note: I listen to concert band, jazz, orchestral movie soundtracks, choral, classical, and even some pop/rock/country).  My "control" for testing was music from my iTunes Library (apple Lossless files) on my laptop with advanced soundcard.  I wanted to spend fewer than $200.  Here are the following results:1st place:  Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. (score:  90/100 points)  Pros -It does a variety of tasks really good with no real weakness at anything.  It's best for listening enjoyment...not professional studio monitoring as advertised.  It has very warm sounding vocals, a balanced sound (with very slight favor to lower mid range & upper bass), and comfortable (loose) fit on my ears/head.  It handles thick, polyphonic music passages with ease without distortion...while keeping the main melody/vocals volume and tone quality still cutting through with warmth.  The sound feels like you're in a very large professional concert hall!  People with large heads will appreciate the fit of these comfortable headphones.  Cons- Although you have the feel of being in a large concert hall, the distance to the stage seems a bit too far away...perhaps the 30th row.  These headphones are the highest price of those tested (around $170...ouch... but, it comes with 3 different chords to the headphones/ and bag).2nd Place:  Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. (score: 88/100 points)  Pros - Very balanced sound throughout the registers...no favors to any register!!!  It can be used for both studio monitoring or listening enjoyment.  The extra-deep bass extension can be "felt" during musical passages...nice.  This Headphone has as a very "live" performance sound...like you're on the 5th row during a concert.  Best headphones for listening enjoyment under $100 (only $99!).  Cons - The tone of melody/vocals sound a bit thin or "electric" at times during thick/polyphonic textures in musical passages...especially male tenors and trumpet/alto sax solos.  Although you feel like you're on the 5th row during a concert, it sounds like you're in a small auditorium rather than a concert hall.  Fit may a bit tiring after a long period (good clamping pressure).3rd Place:  Sony MDR-7506.  (85/100points)  Pros - These headphones must be the best at studio monitoring...or when you need to be critical and "dissect" music...every detail can be heard throughout every register (you can even hear faults in the recording you never wanted to hear before).  The sound feels like you're in a closed room with a live band)...not a performance concert hall/auditorium (there is a lack of reverb) good for recording professionals (and only $86!).  Very clean and articulate at the "attacks" of instrument/vocal notes (not much sustain with these headphones) throughout all of the registers.  Cons - Very bright sound...taxing to the ears after a while (Treble is very pronounced).  Must use an equalizer to add bass/warmth to the sound for listening enjoyment...Yes it's a pain, but then they do sound good after those adjustments.4th Place:  Bose SoundTrue, Around Ear. (80/100 points)  Pros - These headphones have a good, balanced sound throughout the registers (Note: you will have to turn up the volume on these headphones).  They are very comfortable and "light" on the head....you almost forget you have the headphones on.  Cons - Sound is very "speaker" sounding...like you're at a concert to hear your favorite band  in the 50th row, but the stage is full of speakers playing CD recordings of your favorite band; therefore, there is just too much distance from you to the stage.  Price is too much for this headphone ($150).5th Place:  Koss SP540. (75/100 points)  Pros - These headphones are very cool looking, and somewhat comfortable (I have normal/smaller ears).  The sound is not balanced...favors the bass/mids...good for rock/rap lovers.  Mids and treble sounds have been somewhat muffled...so the bass and lower mids "boom" throughout your music.  Cons - Feels like you're sitting behind the band at a concert.  Not worth the $150 price tag.  Note:  I have a Koss 35 Pro A and love the sound of these headphones (but they are half-open designed, not fully closed) and I hoped these sp540 models could compete...disappointed.6th Place:  JBL J88a.  (68/100 points)  Pros - These headphones are the most comfortable...no competition in this department!  Bass is very heavy....rap/rock lovers will appreciate these headphones.  Cons - The mids and trebles have been purposely muffled...almost non-existent...feels like you're sitting behind the band during a concert (with cotton in your ears).  Price is good ($99), but come on...try to have some balance throughout the registers.7th place:  Grado SR125. (65/100 points)  Note:  This is the headphone I've had for a couple years...and why I started a search for a better headphone.  They are not what I needed because they are "open designed"...thus, people around you can hear them.  Pros - Very crisp and clear mids and trebles...you can hear every detail.  Comfortable fit.  Cons - no bass what-so-ever...thus, bright and airy sound only.  It feels like you're sitting on the 75th row at a concert!  These headphones are rather expensive (around $120 bucks when I bought them 2 years ago...$150 today).

VMay Improve to Five Star After Return
p352
sg5
VJust got the SoundTrue today (on sale for $140) in the mint/black.  Well, I know how my Sony studio monitoring headphones playback my music from my desktop so I put the Bose in.  The first thing I noticed was sound only on the right side.  I pushed further on the cable but it was all the way in the headset.  I twisted it and then both sides of the phones were playing.  It sounded rich and almost like surround sound...very appealing.  But when I bumped the cable cord with my arm, the sound crackled and went to one side again.  I quick returned them for another.  Haven't opened them but it seems no one else has had this problem.  I'll give it a 5 star for sure if the end that accepts the cable connects properly.  I suspect it's a bit too big and not holding the connection.  My other Bose products have been excellent---IE headphones, and the SoundDock system for iPods/iPhones.Update 9/12/14:  Well, I exchanged these for another pair and by pushing the cable in hard it connected, though not as smooth as Apple or some other products.  I guess because I have been using Sony MDR V-900HD headphones for monitoring, I became a bit dispirited because the sounds coming out of the Bose were much, much, lower than I am used to.  No, they're certainly not as bass-heavy as Dr. Dre Beats are, but the lows and mids were just a bit low and the treble (which my music seems to emphasize) was very muddled.  I spanned several musical genres---classic, J-Pop, Folk, Jazz, Rock, and I do like the crisp highs but I didn't hear them.  I am, however, going to keep this a 4.0 star rating because I know a lot of people don't like treble as much as bass and the outstanding comfort was the best thing.  I rate the comfort near perfect, construction and sound quality pretty high, and value somewhat lower.  I have ordered some Klipsch Status (which may be snug) and I may order the Sennheiser Momentums, though everyone seems to say the earpads are too small for people with larger ears.  Now, I will give Bose another shot....from what I've seen and heard about the QC25s, they may be the comfort king for me and better sound.  I guess my final comments on the SoundTrue are...if you love comfort and fairly warm lows and mids, these might really be the ones for you.Sept 18:  Well, maybe because I'm a not too tech-smart senior, but my adult kids told me if I simply had used my iTunes EQ (or iPod EQ) the Bose will sound as bright and high or as low and bassy as I want.  The Klipsch Status are near perfect with a flat EQ, but the rich lows of the Bose can easily be modified, I'm told, by adjusting the EQ.  I also found some Klipsch owners increase the bass on their phones by the "bass booster" setting in iTunes.  Anyway, based on the solid reviews of the Bose Soundtrue, I'm going to likely get another pair and use this thing called the EQ if I want to change the sound a bit.  I never used EQs before so maybe this will be of benefit.  For sure, the Bose SoundTrue, as well as the QC 15/25 headphones are probably the most comfortable anywhere.Update March 12, 2015:  These are my favorites headphones.  I had also purchased the QC25s.  As much as I like the comfort of those, the pressure in my ear was very unpleasant.  When I took them off after using them a half hour, my ear started feeling better, but the next day it would bother me.  The Bose SoundTrue, after adjusting my iTunes EQ, are superb....lightweight, comfortable, great sound, and NO BATTERY!  Bose says the electronic signals going into your ear to cancel the outside noise really don't cause "eardrum pressure" but they could have fooled me...it was very bad.  I've since found several others have mentioned this.  Though Consumer Reports rates the Dr. Dre Beats NC system higher, I suspect I am done with NC.  I rarely go on planes, never on trains, and being retired i don't go into an office.  The Bose SoundTrues are an excellent complement to the Klipsch Status.  I'll take the $290 I paid for the QC25s and put it toward another Bose SoundTrue or maybe the new Sennheiser Momemtum 2 which now have the large ear cups to fit my big head.

VGigantor head/ears friendly headphones at last!

VI originally purchased the new beats studio headphones. The overall packaging was nicer and they were more feature packed. However, I had to return the beats because I could only wear them 30 minutes at a time. I thought i had normal sized ears but it quickly became apparent that was not the case. The earcups were so small that they still sat on my ears, not over. Back to the drawing board, and that's where these fantastic Bose headphones come in. I tried the Bose soundtrue and the comfort is a world of a difference. The earcups are internally larger and actually angle inside, so your ears fit into the cups, so the padding truly rests on your head. I have a 62cm dome, which is xl or xxl by most standards. The Bose have a fair amount of flex built in so this is a non issue. These are stupid light. You will forget you are wearing them, and as such they have been awesome for me when I go running or lift at the gym. Less features than the beats.. But if you value insane levels of comfort, I would spring for these.

VComfortable over-ear headphones that get about as much as you can get from your computer
p367
sg5
VSo, apparently Bose has updated their non-noise canceling headphones.  A little.  Both these and their on-ear versions are now called "SoundTrue" headphones.  Has there been a sudden leap in the sound quality of their basic headphones?  Not really.  They still pretty much give you what Bose always gives you-- a really high price tag for headphones that have decent sound while being remarkably light-weight and comfortable.Let's talk sound quality.  The Bose SoundTrue headphones are pretty good.  Are they great?  No.  Are they more expensive than phones with similar sound quality?  Yup.  You get comfort, but far from amazing sound quality.  But let's reveal the dirty little secret of sound quality these days.  If you are listening either to compressed files, or even lossless files through your computer's built-in digital-analog converter (DAC), that is a bigger constraint on your sound quality than your headphones.  Plug some Bose SoundTrue headphones into a regular stereo with either a cd or a well-cared-for vinyl, compare them to some respectable but cheaper pairs, and you can get better sound quality for the money.  Run that comparison between the same set of headphones on your computer and the differences become negligible.  Your built-in DAC limits your sound quality more than your headphones once you get to decent enough headphones.  This particular line of Bose headphones nearly tops out the sound quality that you can get from most computers' built-in DACs.  Plug a really high-end pair of headphones into your computer, and it won't sound all that much better than these.  So why are you paying so much for the Bose?  For the comfort.  Around-ear headphones tend to give you a more immersive experience than on-ear phones, but they can be clunky.  These are not.  They are light, and put very little pressure on you.  And without an external DAC, sound quality won't get much better anyway, particularly if you have compressed audio files.  If you want sound quality, don't listen to compressed files, and don't use your computer's build-in DAC.  Then, you can get better sound for cheaper.  You won't find more comfortable around-ear headphones, though.  At least, I haven't.So, Bose has two versions of the "SoundTrue" headphones: around-ear and on-ear.  They apparently have basically the same machinery-- it is just a structural difference.  If you have a general preference for one, go for it.  The around-ear phones are slightly heavier because, well, because they have to be.  That also puts the speakers slightly farther from your ears, and allows slightly bigger speakers.  Then again, you are limited by your computer's built-in DAC if you don't get an external one anyway, so why quibble about such things?  At the end of the day, either you prefer the physical experience of on-ear or around-the-ear phones.  Sound quality is comparable, and both are amazingly light and comfortable.  But they're really expensive for the sound quality.  If you want to pay for comfort, go for it.  They are a good choice for casual listening.

VI love these headphones - such a pleasant surprise. Although, being that they are Bose, it should be no surprise at all.For a long time, I was lured into the Beats marketing trap and had the Solo HD headphones on my wishlist. When I was finally ready to make the investment, I tried both the Solo HD Beats ($200) and these ($180) in person. The base on the Beats was way too heavy and out of balance. The cups also did not mold around the ear, but rather, on them and the headband wasn't that comfortable. Keep in mind, I went into the try-on EXPECTING to prefer the Beats. When I tried on the Bose for all of 3 seconds my mind was changed for these reasons:- Very balanced, crystal clear sound (especially for this price point)- Extremely comfortable and lightweight- Cups rotate, adjust and mold AROUND the outside of the ear, blocking out more noise pollution- Headband is extremely comfortable, padded and adjustable - I've had these on for about 3 hours now and don't have the "headband headache" that so many other headphones have given me in the past- The color is perfect - love the mint/turquoise green. They look great while wearing them at work and everyone can see from a mile away that I am "in the creative zone."- The controls on the cord work well with my iPhone and iPad, so if I am plugged into my phone I can easily switch between music and calls without fumbling around.Bottom line: for $20 less than the Beats you can get a way better pair of headphones. Bose continues to be the best in audio.

VMost comfortable headphones I have ever tried on!!
p382
sg5
VPros:1. Most comfortable headphones I have ever tried on. If you have a a large head or irregularly shaped ears or wear glasses, these will still be comfortable. As Bose built it to be so light weight, they hardly apply any pressure to your head. I can have these on for hours and not even notice them, which normally isn't something I am able to do with other pairs of headphones.2. Sound quality is decent and balanced. But if you are just looking for casual iPod listening instead of professional uses, these are good enough.3. Build quality of these are excellent. I already came across many youtube videos as they tried to destroy them but failed. So if you are worried about build quality, simply don't worry.Cons:1. If you are a basshead, these phones probably will not offer enough bass for you. But for me, the bass are good enough and do not overpower.2. A bit pricey :(Overall:If you are looking to buy a pair of headphones for long hours uses of casual listening, don't hesitate to buy those. Although they are a bit pricey compared to ATH-M50, just think that the Bose Soundtrue will offer you the best comfort you will ever have.BTW, some people asked what's the difference between SoundTrue and AE2i, the difference is the appearance and SoundTrue provides a hard case instead of a cloth one. There should be no difference in terms of sound.

VGreat headphones, like the AE2.  However, this is made for Apple products.  I plug it in on my LG G4 and the buttons doesn't work and the end cable was loose.  Nowhere on the description that's its made for Apple.  You search and you can get a different cable that works with android.My son notice that he can hear the music coming from my headphone from 5 feet away which means its hard to be discrete when using in public settings ie library.Bose should ship this with 2 cables or have a cable that works with both android and apple.  The cable for android sells for about $30 so there goes the black friday savings.It's really a 4 stars headphones that's  lightweight, very comfortable and great sounds.  However, the inability to use this on android makes it a 1 star for me.

Vif you can get it under $100 so go for it (i paid in mid $75 on BF). They are very comfortable, probably the best new cans i ever had from comfort point of view right out of the box. But, if you are looking for pure sound - no, most probably they will disappoint you. No, they do not suck, they are decent. But I have Grados(my favs though they are open design, not for everywhere), Sony 7506, Audio-9something and they all beat these Bose.  Grados for $99 sharp (80 series) produce much-much better sound. If you are looking for rich, balanced, natural sound check those Grados. Sony 7506 for about $70-80 will satisfy you better as well. The only cans I have in my position which are worse than these Bose is Bern.I will keep these Bose for occasional use in coffee shops though and travelling.

And these Bose headphones right here blow away my Beats Studio Wireless and every other I have tried. I'm an audiophile and I listen to Hip-hop/R&B;/alternative/Christian and my favorite, Country music! A headphone that finally sounded amazing with all the genres. I turned the volume up on blast and there was no distortion at all. When I put on my headphones I wanna get lost in my music and enjoy it, well, these finally did it! They have good noise isolation because they conform very well to your head, and that's important for me. I'm a Boeing employee and I work in a noisy place so noise isolation is very important! I'm returning my Beats and picking up these!

VTried them all and chose the SoundTrue
p416
sg5
VI favored Bose for wearable music delivery, so I tried them all; in ear, on ear, around ear, noise cancelling and not. These SoundTrue around-ear give me the best all around sound and comfort. The smaller in ear would be nice but even the competitive Bose models didn't match the sound or ambient quietness that I got with the around-ear SoundTrue. The amplified sound with the noise cancelling head phones would be nice on long flights and the battery is not inconvenient, but with these new SoundTrue the ear cups keep things so quiet that I don't expect much difference after my Sony sound cancelling cans and the SoundTrue have better sound over the Bose when not using the noise cancelling feature. And, I saved a few bucks by buying the SoundTrue. I especially like that they work seamlessly with not only my iPhone and iPad but the mic and controls work perfectly with my Macbook Air and even with Skype. I was prepared to reward myself with the best sound and fit in the store and after testing them all the SoundTrue was an obvious choice and all around value.

VI  tried out my nephews Bose AE2's and was sold immediately so I ordered a pair but...fortunately (for me) the seller 'Wizard-Electroland' only had one pair left and the box was damaged so they contacted me to see if it would be alright to substitute the AE2's with the newer version which are the 'Bose Sound True' (for the same price as the AE2's)!  Since I had not heard these newer headphones I took a ride to my local Best Buy store to test drive the 'Bose Sound True' headphones and was equally impressed with the sound quality and additional features these headphones offered.  The volume control does not work with my Samsung phone but the on/off button works fine for talking on the phone etc., this wasn't a deal breaker for me since I use the volume control on my phone when listening to music anyway.  I'm not an audiophile but I feel like the Sound True headphones are just as sound worthy as the AE2's, and would recommend the Sound True to my friends even at the higher price!

VRecently, my husband purchased some Bose on the ear headphones.  He like them pretty well, until... he tried these on.  These are around the ear. They are extremely comfortable.  All three of my children tried them on as well.  I was pleased with how easy they were to adjust for the size of each of our heads.These are not noise cancelling headphones, but you do hear very little if people try to talk to you while you have them on and you are listening to music.As for the sound, well they are Bose headphones.  Now I know why people rave about Bose speakers and the quality of sound that comes from Bose products.  The sound was great.  We have a component stereo system in our living room with Sony speakers.  My husband felt that the quality of the sound from these headphones was better than our large speakers.  I am not an audiophile so I have admit that I couldn't tell a difference.  But, I could tell that I loved listening to music with these headphones on.  A few months ago, we got some Polk Audio Buckle Headphones (which cost $60 more than these!) and the sound was not as good.  But, more than that, the comfort doesn't compare.  The Polks were heavy and uncomfortable on my ears and head.  In contrast, I could wear these headphones for long periods without any discomfort.I highly recommend taking a look at these headphones...

VAll Around Awesome Headphones, NOT for Bass Heavy Tracks
p431
sg5
VOverall these headphones are light, comfortable, and are relatively good at canceling out ambient noise. As a software engineer, I tend to spend most of the day doing head down work, listening to music and so far these headphones seem to be more than up to the task. I'm not an audiophile, by any means, but to my ears, these headphones perform pretty good with the EDM and Jazz I listen to. However, when it comes to hip hop, the headphones will not provide the bass heavy hits you may be looking for.Pros:Light as a featherComfortable as a memory foam pillowProvide some pretty solid passive noise cancelingSolid for music that is not bass heavyA lot cheaper than some of it's competitors (I'm looking at you Dr Dre)Cons:Bass is not as punchy as some of the other cans I have ownedWire looks like it will die long before I'm ready to upgrade

VAverage headphones, bit pricey, not much base
p437
sg5
VI've had many headphones and headsets over the years, but it's important to judge the headphones for what they're intended and of course, the price. My reference headphones are going to be anything from Grado SR60's, Senheiser PC360,PX100's, Logitech H800's, and even Bose Quietcomfort 15 headphones. Yes, some of these are nearly twice as expensive, but others are also half as much.The point is to have a good frame of reference to listen to them back-to-back and see how they sound.SOUND QUALITYOverall, the sound is very crisp and clear. Mid's come in loud and clear. Highs are soft, not too bright, just the way I like them. The base on the other hand is obviously there, but deep base is non-existent. I listened to a wide range of music from R&B;, Rock, Acoustic, Classical, Country, etc. I found acoustic and classical to sound the best. Everything else just lacked punch. I've had them playing for a few hours to get them broken in, but the sound quality really hasn't changed.I connected them to an amp to see if they needed more power, but that didn't really help. In fact, they sounded best when connected to my phone, of all things. It seems that's just what they were designed for.DESIGNThe headphones are over-the-ear closed design. I must say they are very comfortable. The foam padding is very soft and they weigh almost nothing at all. The overall headset has a surprisingly small foot print. They just aren't that big. I'm typically not a fan of closed headphones, but they haven't really done a lot to make them block excessive amount of outside noise. In fact, if you look inside the ear piece, you can see that there isn't much there at all.The speakers are actually angled inside the ear piece. That's something not obvious from the included pictures. But you can see the back of the plastic housing and even the perforations of the yellowish foam padding. I suspect this was done to angle the sound into the ear canal, but I really didn't notice an improvement, and honestly... it looks cheap.Of course on the outside, they just look your typical plastic headphones. You can angle the cups about 90 degrees outward and there is some up/down adjustment to fit your head, but no folding mechanism here.MIC & CONTROLSThe detachable audio cable has an in-line microphone which features volume and play/stop buttons, 3 in total. Since the mic has to be positioned closed to your mouth, the controls are going to have to be used by feel alone. That's actually not a problem. The problem is that with my Galaxy Note 3, only pause button worked. Volume control didn't do anything.The microphone did work surprisingly well though. Moving it close to my mouth didn't make any difference, although it will of course pickup background noise rather easily. I did a bit of walking and talking and the other party never had a problem hearing me. Although I had trouble hearing myself. They are after all, a closed design. Definitely not the best if you like you hear yourself talk.PROS:+ Clear high and mid's+ Very light weight & compact+ Comfortable+ In-line Mic works well+ Detachable cable+ Includes carrying caseCONS:- Expensive- Closed design not the best for mic use- Opening inside ear-piece looks cheap- Volume controls not Android compatible- Poor base response- Doesn't fold for easier travelCONCLUSION:Overall they're a fairly descent set of headphones. The added microphone and in-line controls are a nice touch. Which would make them a great set of headphones to travel with, except the lack of folding mechanism seems odd. Considering their relatively small size, this would have been a plus. However, the lack of real base and high price is somewhat unfortunate. Especially when they don't sound or feel like they should cost this much.

I can wear these for hours watching movies , listening to books , music etc. They're soo comfortable. And the value is good. Sound quality really nice too. Unless you're an audiophile or DJ/producer these will do the job perfectly. And no need for the higher priced noise canceling models.

VIt's hard for me to believe there could be any negative reviews. Instead of sending the product I ordered (AE2)  in damaged packaging, the seller (Wizard-Electroland) sent me the latest version which was the Bose SoundTrue headphones. Hooray! I received them super fast and I can't believe the sound! I listen to a lot of Binaural meditation/relaxation music and a lot of piano relaxation music which can either be therapeutic and take your mind where you want it to go, OR it can give you a headache in your temples and be rather unpleasant. With these new SoundTrue Bose, it's the best experience! It's as if I were there while they're recording. No headache, no false tones, just perfection. I can't imagine a better quality sound. They're are very comfortable as well.

VI have some pretty bad jaw pain from TMJ but wanted a nice pair of headphones to listen to music at work.  The problem is that most headphones apply too much pressure to the temples and after a few minutes would give me a nasty headache.  I tried even high end headphones like the  Audio-Technica ATH-M50x.These, however, are fantastic.  Great sound and very little pressure.  I can wear these for hours with no problems at all.  I don't think you'll find better headphones (combination of pressure and sound).

These are too expensive for that kind of defect to be happening.  I've bought a lot of great stuff from Bose in the past, very disappointed with the quality of these.

VAn honest review - great headphones for comfort
p537
sg5
VI've owned this for 2 years now. I was thinking hard whether I should buy this or the Audio Technica one that people bandwagon over, and I ended up with this and I don't regret it. I know Bose has a bad rep for sound quality at this price point. But I don't care - the positives outweigh the few negatives.This is a headphone for people who prioritize comfort. The Audio Technicas (MH50 or something) have a reputation for being very uncomfortable over an extended period of time.+These headphones are extremely comfortable. Very lightweight too. I could wear it for 6 hours without wanting to take it off. I've owned V-Modas in the past and those things clamp on my head hard. The leather pads are comfortable - you barely notice that you're wearing them.+Very stylish and low profile. The black works well with a suit or any formalwear, especially if you commute or travel for business. It really looks great, in the polar opposite to Dre Beats in the spectrum of headphone aesthetics.+Sturdy even though they are lightweight. I've carried these things for a long time and they've held up very well. Looks like new, minus a few light scratches that are only noticeable up close (it's plastic, so this is expected).+Comes with a lightweight leather case.+Sound quality is better than Apple Earpods, which I like. So this is good enough for me. Audiophiles gave rave reviews of the v-modas I owned; they sound a little bit better, but really I don't care for a slight difference in sound.A few negatives in my opinion:-I don't like the red pattern within the cups. If they went with black, these headphones would be perfect in terms of looks.-The cable drives me insane. Snags on literally everything and tanks easily. It's also quite long. But I guess this is the standard bose cable. It has a proprietary jack too, so you can only buy the $30 replacement from Bose. After 1.6 years of use my cable broke at the phone input end. It does have a nice volume control and mic though.- The treble is a rather low on these, and the bass can be slightly overpowering.Overall, these are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. If you need nice headphones to wear at your desk for a long period of time, look no further than these; you can wear them all day every day. If you want something for a commute or travel as well, these do the job as they are stylish and lightweight. The comfort IMO is most important, which is why I bought these.

VMost comfortable headphones I've ever used!
p543
sg5
VI was on the hunt for a pair of around-ear headphones that were extremely comfortable and had excellent sound quality.  My typical go-to headphones, the Etymotic MC-5 (w/custom molded earpieces) tend to become uncomfortable after multiple hours of use.  While I don't usually keep my headphones in that long, I do travel a little, and wanted an option to use on long flights and other similar situations.These headphones are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I've worn them for multiple hours without any fatigue whatsoever.  After a while, you tend to forget you're even wearing headphones (which is exactly what I was looking for). They feel decently durable as well.  They probably wouldn't last very long under extremely rough conditions, but the build quality is sturdy.  Plus, the few accessories they come with (carrying case and detachable cable) are also built very well.  The case is excellently designed and looks great, and the cable is incapable of tangling (a huge bonus if you're trying to get your phones out of the case quickly).Onto sound quality - these are very pleasant-sounding headphones.  I wouldn't go so far to classify them as 'audiophile' headphones, but that wasn't what I was going for with this purchase.  They have the sonic signature and qualities of any piece of Bose gear - they'll make your music sound good.  I was particularly pleased with how they sounded with rock/metal music.  Additionally, they don't seem to require a headphone amplifier - my iPhone 5 was able to drive them to very loud volumes easily.I haven't yet traveled with them, so I can't speak to their sound isolation properties.  But around the house, they do a good job of keeping external noise (babies, barking dogs, TV noise) out.  Nowhere near as good as my Etymotics (which completely seal my ears off), but about what I expected.These ticked all the boxes for me on my headphone search.  Overall comfort is superb, they sound great with virtually any style of music, and they are built sturdy.  I love them!

VDepending on what your looking to get from these headphones they can leave you satisfied or disappointed.  For me I found these headphones to be a swing and a miss. I must say that I did not use these headphones for more than a few hours but I don't think using them any longer would have changed my opinions.  I have previously used Bose headphones and I loved the AE2's but these don't provide that signature sound and I found that there are better alternatives on the market.Personally I was looking for two things, great sound and comfort.  I decided I loved these headphones as soon as I put them on, they were extremely lightweight and extremely comfortable.  I have no doubt in my mind that these headphones would be comfortable to wear for a few hours at a time.  The problem with these headphones I would not have expected from Bose; the sound was hollow and lifeless and not as clear as I expected.  I'm no audio professional or audiophile but sound quality is one of the most important factors when spending even this much for a pair of headphones and I was extremely disappointed.  There might as well have been a low pass filter inline with the cable because the mids and lows felt very under powered.  Now I'm not the kind of person who likes base heavy music, but there just wasn't enough of a presence to supply what I felt like was a flat / even sound response. Another thing I immediately did not like about these was the clarity.  These headphones do produce crisp sound but you can get such a cleaner and more distinguishable sound from other headphones on the market.After only a half hour I decided to return these in favor of Audio Technica ath-m50x's becuase for me sound quality was the primary goal for these pair of headphones.  If you are reading this article and you are looking to buy a pair of headphones with sound quality in mind I'd highly recommend checking out the m50's or m50x's  you can get much better sound quality for around the same price, or even the Sony MDR 7506 or V6 which cost much less.Unless Comfort is the the single most important factor you are looking for, I would not recommend these headphones.  If you are taking the time to read reviews already, look at the head-fi forums for more experienced opinions.  You will learn everything you need to know to make the right purchase.  I doubt it will be these.

VThe sound is great, but the cord is ridiculously long. It gets caught on weight machines, vacuums or whatever you are doing. At a minimum they should have an option of ordering a shorter cord as an accessory. The tallestNBA player doesn't need a cable that long.

VI have long been a fan of Bose stuff, specifically the 5-cube home theater system and the QuietComfort headphones.  However, anyone who owns Bose stuff knows that you pay top dollar.Enter the SoundTrue headphones. Priced at $180, they are far less expensive than competitors such as Beats by Dre (and you don't look silly wearing them).Great sound.  Not too overly bassy, which is a plus. Not quite as amazingly clear as some headphones at the top end.EXTREMELY comfortable and lightweight, I love how the cups just caress around your ears.  You won't get tired wearing them, nor will your ears get hot/sweaty.  The headphones come in a handy travel case that fits snugly, as we have come to except from Bose at this point.A great purchase.  I still like the Quietcomfort headphones for flights, but man, these are a close runner up for aircraft travel.  I will definitely use the Quietcomfort for travel, buds for exercise, and these beauties for all purpose listening otherwise.

VDISADVANTAGES: This head-set is ok, and I want to give it 4 stars. I am a big fan of Android devices and Apple devices such as Window laptops. However, this headphone sounds very poor and small with Android devices and other NON-Apple devices. The sound coming from the headphone are not very clear and true when I use it with Android and NON-Apple devices. It does not have a lot of bass. That's why I am very upset and disappointed with this headphone.ADVANTAGES: However, this headphone works amazingly and stunningly with Apple devices such as Ipod, Iphone, Ipad, Mac Books. etc. I do not understand why it is like that but this is true. The sounds are amazing, clear, loud, and true as advertised when it is used with APPLE products. It is also surprisingly comfortable. You can wear it all day without getting tired. It is also very light-weighted and has a lot of cool designs. Moreover, it is made of high quality materials, and it is very durable. People said it leaks sound, and it did not isolate you completely from the environment. However, I think it do isolate you from the environment with loud enough music, and its sound leaking is negligible.CONCLUSION: If you are a fan of APPLE devices such as Iphone, Ipod, Ipad, Mac books,.... I DO recommend this devices because it works and sounds very beautifully and stunningly with APPLE devices. If you are using ANDROID or MICROSOFT devices such as Window laptops, Samsung phones or any Android devices, I DO NOT recommend this headphone because of reasons I wrote above.

p593

VI am a Sennheiser fan and have the excellent Sennheiser Momentum on-ear headphones but wanted something new that was more comfortable to wear and had an around the ear design. I decided to give these Bose SoundTrue headphones a try.  They are the first pair of Bose headphones I have owned.Pros: Very good sound quality. Not as good as the Momentums but still high quality. They aren't as loud as the Sennheisers when used with  my iPhone.  Very comfortable design and lightweight. Much more comfortable than the Momentums which sit tightly on your head.  Bass is not overwhelming.  Over-ear design doesn't leak as much sound as the on-ear type of headphones.  Easily storedCons:  They feel cheaply made--I'm not sure how durable they will be over time  As many have mentioned-the cable that comes with them is very fragile looking and easy to knock loose.  Bass is not overwhelming--if you like very heavy bass these probably aren't the headphones for you  Sound is a little more "equalized" compared to the Momentums. Some may not like this style.  They are not noise cancelling.I just got these headphones so it's early but so far they have been fine. They are probably overpriced based on the name but if you want a comfy set of decent headphones you should take a look at these.

VI do like them. THey fit nice around the ear, and deaden sound very well; though, I have yet to test this on the trolley. The sound is comparable to my bose true sound in ear. A little more base, though not as much as I would have hoped. Still good sound for the money. I researched beats too, just like I did when I bought my in-ear head phones. I do believe you might get a little more bass from the beats; however, after searching blogs and customer reviews, the feeling was pretty unanimous that the beats quality is half that of Bose, and many customers had the same complaints about malfunctioning, cheaply constructed parts on the beats. (Images included.) Though there are a couple examples like this with bose customers, they are a fraction of those with competitors. With all of this said. Bose won out.Now. The one thing I noticed, five minutes after opening the package, was that when I twisted the jack plugged into the headphone, (in order to rotate the mic into position,) sound cut out in my right ear. This is a big concern, and I am going to contact customer care to find out what it could be. I promise to update this review when I find out more. I still remember buy products which out mastered all of our modern products in quality. The term "they don't make em' like the used to," is more true today than any other time in history.

p605

VFirst review ever.I am a guy who really weighs his options when it comes to electronics, from gaming mice, headphones, headsets, you name it. I always take my time and not buy out of impulse.Believe me when I say that I've never been disappointed in my entire life with BOSE products. I just couldn't fathom it, for a guy who owned at east 3 bose products at one time, this by far is mediocre.Let's start with the build: Sleek, nice, but totally feels cheap! but it didn't stop me from actually trying it on. It's comfortable (a plus as to why i considered copping these). The cups feel great around my ear and the headset feels light on my head.Comfort: Like I said, totes.Sound quality: Now folks, this is definitely the defining factor.How about  we start with "Absolutely minimal bass response"? SURE if I wanted muddy and overwhelming bass then I should've bought them overpriced BEATS. BUT this product could absolutely DO alot better especially when it is a BOSE product.I like BASS because it gives a nice depth to alot of the songs and pieces I listen to. Mids and highs are nice, but have you ever heard of a musical ensemble or a choral piece performed without the lows of the bass? If you have a good ear then I am sure you know what I am talking about.But for an awesome brand such as BOSE, the Bass response on these little cans suck. I do not know why they would cut back and step down on their specs but for 150+ speakers, these should WOW the heck out of me. But it could barely scratch the surface of MEH.You'll probably be astonished as to how my review was poorly written. But it's out of personal preference to be honest. I just want to let you guys know that this attempt of BOSE to go stylish and sacrifice quality just to be in the mainstream line with Beats and other fashion couture headsets then BOSE just stop. Keep on creating them grandpa looking headsets that actually has the best quality and stop catering to young folks who want fashion and not function.So far I own a bose SIE2 (the first one without the mic) and a bose mini link and I love them both.

VAs time goes on, I am turning into more and more of an audiophile. I'm not educated enough to totally say, "I AM AN AUDIOPHILE!" However, music is really important to me and I need it to sound amazing. I need to hear all of the sounds and instruments. I need the sounds to be of good quality. My first "good" pair of headphones was a pair of Beats by Dre. They were gifted to me and I loved them. They did not age well, though, and I found these Bose headphones on Amazon. If I had the money to buy a $1,000 pair, I would. I'm financially limited, though, and struggled to find headphones that were decent and cheaper. These Bose headphones are it! I read through all the reviews and prayed these would meet my needs. I am so pleased to say that they do. They are definitely comparable to Beats, and I think they're better. I am not articulate enough to explain why, I just know my ears are happy and these very much help me fulfill my music needs. After a while, my ears hurt after listening to music with my Beats. Even if I listened quietly. These Bose headphones don't leave me with that pain at all. They're also very comfortable to wear, much more comfortable than Beats. I recommend these if you're looking for a decent pair of headphones for a cheaper price than the $500-$1000 ones.

VThe lightest and most comfortable Headphones I have ever used.I was looking for some on-the-go headphones, I have some professional studio monitor headphones that I keep at home, but they are too big and heavy to take with me. I tried all kinds of headphones, from Beats, Monster, Phillips, Sony, Marshall, and others. These Bose are for the price, the best. I have never liked Bose because they lack bass, but these new SoundTrue around the ear headphones have good enough bass now. And mids and highs are exceptionally good. These are not the best headphones, Shure, Audio Technica, VModa, all make better sounding headphones, but they generally either cost more, or are big, heavy and uncomfortable. I have some Shure headphones and they hurt my head after about an hour of use, and I cannot fall asleep with them on my head.With these Bose, I can fall asleep with them on. I can wear the headphones for 3 hours with no discomfort. And while my Shure Headphones are professional monitor headphones, some genres of music sound better with the Bose.If you number one priority is lite-weight and comfort, and very good sound quality, get these Bose.If your number one priority is the best sound, get Audio-Technica M50, or VModa M100, or Shure SRH880.

VSo I got the Bose SoundTrue a few days ago, and I can only say they are amazing.Very comfortable even after hours of listening, with soft padded cups that provide very gentle pressure on the head that is barely noticeable. The headphones also sit very securely on the head, so there's no concern of them suddenly falling.The sound quality is great. While audiophiles will probably find it unsatisfactory, for my purpose of listening to music it is great for its price. The sound is balanced and does not over emphasize any frequency, making every note clear. These headphones will probably not fit bass lovers, but I find that tonal balance is important in headphones.I'd also like to mention that the headphones provide very good noise isolation even in the streets of a busy city, without having to turn up the music to deafening volumes.Another plus is that the headphones look really good. I ordered the white headphone that look really really good.As far as build quality, although they are made of plastic, so far they feel rather sturdy and not like they will break the first time they will fall off.

VBose SoundTrue vs New Beats Studio
p632
sg5
VI previously had the New Beats Studio Headphones and compared to those, the sound quality is pretty similar (maybe a little lower but it's not like the Beats Studio have the best sound quality either in my opinion). However, the Bose ST are DEFINITELY LIGHTER which is a HUGE plus! It means you can carry it to more places, and also wear it for extended periods of time without headaches or pain in the ear area! My biggest problem with the Beats was the fact that I could not really wear it for more than an hour or so because it would start hurting. Also, the Bose ST do not need to be charged, unlike the Beats Studio, which is really convenient because you can use it whenever you want.Honestly, if you're not a professional or an audiophile, these will sound pretty satisfactory, and these are PERFECT for travelers since it's so much lighter, more comfortable, and cheaper than the Beats Studio!I definitely recommend this over the Beats Studio for those weighing both as options.*Note: I am not an audiophile or an expert, but I like to listen to music a lot.Hope this helped!

VIt has been said that Bose actually stands for Beautifully Overpriced Sound Equipment, and while that's not a bad thing, necessarily, it can certainly limit the number of folks willing or able to shell out bigger bucks when there are so many "almost as goods" from which to choose. It is in fact the name of Amar G. Bose, who founded the company in 1964 and has indeed been building superior consumer and professional sound equipment ever since. (Bose has also conducted research into automotive suspension technologies and cold fusion, who knew?)But there is nothing like the best, and there is nothing like Bose. The SoundTrue Headphones are nothing short of amazing, and meet every requirement I have found indispensable in cans- they are lightweight, comfortable, fold easily for travel (with a perfectly sized carrying case) and of course, most importantly, possess an amazingly superior sound. While evaluating a good deal of headphones, it was not difficult to declare these one of the best in this price range- let's face it, with audio gear it is always possible to find something bigger and better- you could easily exceed the price point here. Amazon lists hundreds of headphones, 8 that are over $1000, around 35 well above $500. (Tell me you would be able to realize the difference of these 50 models..) So the SoundTrue fall comfortably in the mid-low end. And still out of reach of many. But-"Vivid" is a good way to describe the sound, well balanced and colorful, a realistic and dynamic presence, great separation and realism. Nearly every frequency is used and used well, as in only a few headphones I have used I had to actually reset the EQ on my ancient iPod to tune the Bose to their fullest potential.The only negative I could think of is one that is usually hard to find and difficult to test- that would be how quiet they are to an outside listener. The Bose are better than some, but at higher volumes- or so I have been told- they are quite audible.The included cord provides another slight complaint, while working as advertised, I find I have no need or desire to use over-the-ear phones to conduct a phone conversation. The microphone in the switch works extremely well, but again, I can't see using it very often if at all- what would the other use be, voice notes? Gaming? For me, the same feeling about that.The control switch gives nearly full control over my device; volume (which must be repeatedly pressed in a stepped fashion) pause, track end and track forward.  I would swear that one time and one time only, I was able to make the Fast Forward and Fast Rewind function work, but have never been able to duplicate it,. I would not be surprised if the jack of my Pod has enough wear to make this happen.The rest of the cord comments are simple. A few other competitors include a simple cord that is audio only- though lighter, it is possible but unlikely it could also deliver a better response, But what it does do is eliminate the slight if slightly annoying presence of the mike/switch, and has only a 3 step plug, which I have found, unlike the 4 function one, will work with all adapters for any system with an appropriate jack. The included cord will disconnect from the earpiece, not uncommon, so I would assume a straight cord is available as an option. Or should be.If you are looking in this price range, and until I discover and recommend another brand at this level that meets or beats the Bose, I would suggest you give a serious listen to these for consideration.

VI had the old version of these. The new ones are a great improvement. They are pretty much the same fit, comfort, and sound quality.The headband is nicer and thicker than the old version. The line in is only to one headphone, so it is more convenient. It is also removable which is easier for management and storage. The case that it comes with is compact and pretty nice. The headphones also fold flat it in it which is much better than the older ones.These fit my ears better, because I might have larger than normal ears. My ears seem to not fit well in Marshall Monitors or Sennheiser momentums. Those are the ones I almost bought.I also chose these over the QC15's, because I don't need to have them "on" to play music. If the QC's had this function, I probably would have gotten them. I am also one of the people that feels the pressure the QC15s put on my ears when they are powered on.

VVery nice headphones for your iPhone
p672
sg5
VI am no audiophile, but I found these headphones to produce excellent sound quality, at least to my liking.  The highs are a little muted, without sounding muffled, and the bass is nice, without being overpowering.  The package says it's designed for iPhone & iPad, and it works great for those applications. The one aspect I did not like is the cord.  It's about as thin as the one on Apple's Earpods, and it feels a bit cheap.  It's also long.  I inadvertently ran the cord over with my rolling desk chair because it was dragging on the floor.  Fortunately, there was no damage, and the insulation wasn't broken, but it just feels like I'll need a replacement sooner than I had hoped.  Fortunately, you can just unplug it and plug in a new one.  Bose has them on their site, though I didn't see it on Amazon.  That's really my only point of contention.  They come with a nice case, and they fold up nicely.

The headphones fit perfectly over my ears and though they're not noise-canceling, even with my iPod not turned up very high, I can hear only my music and the sound is stellar.  I mainly listen to rock and roll and the sound is mind blowing to me.  I would recommend these headphones to anyone that's looking for decent sound but doesn't want to spend a ton of money, and they look good too! I got the Black and Mint and they're sexy :)Additionally, I was listening to Pink Floyd Pulse and I can actually, clearly hear audience members cheering and saying things, amazing!

VI've tried a variety of higher end circumaural headphones from Sennheiser, Sony, Beyerdynamic\u200e, and others. It seems that I always experience one of two problems: either (A) the earpads are too small to actually fit AROUND my ears, or (B) the can is so shallow that the speaker smashes up against the cartilage of my ear. Both are very unpleasant experiences, especially since I wear headphones for extended periods of time (sometimes up to 12 hours a day).The headphone designers of the world seem to be telling me that my ears are gigantic. However, I have compared my ears to many other humans and they appear to be of average size.Bose circumaural headphones are the only ones I've found that actually encompass my ears, and the cans are deep enough that my ear touches nothing inside. It is glorious. They're also very light weight and have memory foam earpads, so my ears are very happy even after many many hours of continuous wear.And they sound good, too.

VI finally figured out why the volume control does not work on these headphones - if you read the guide that comes with it you find that the instructions assume it is for use with Apple products - even though there is nothing in the product name at Amazon or initial description that even gives a hint of this. About 500 words into the additional description on the second page one finally finds something that specifically mentions use with Apple products, implying perhaps that full functionality may not be available with other products. These are good headphones for the price (especially when on sale) but got to give a lower rating until Amazon fixes the product description and also links between the Apple and Android / Samsung, etc. version so that it is clear which is which.

VThese headphones are excellent. I have struggled to find headphones that were the right balance of comfortable, good sound quality and a decent price and these headphones have it all. I wear these pretty much 40 hours a week for work, and they are so comfortable that I keep them on even when I'm not listening to music. The cable is nice and long but not too long, so it doesn't keep me trapped close to my computer but I don't get tangled in it either. The sound is very balanced, as opposed to having a 'disco smile' (high highs and low lows) so if you want really bass heavy headphones go elsewhere. They keep noise in very well (which was a concern of mine) and they aren't noise cancelling but if I am playing music at a reasonable level they keep out annoying ambient noise.

You're better off spending $150 more dollars and just getting the $300 ones in that case.

p713
sg5
VVery comfortable!  I travel overseas a lot and was looking as much for comfort as sound.  I tried some noise cancelling headphones (including from Bose) and found them a little strange and they were not particularly comfortable for long periods of time.  These feel like almost nothing on your ears; I recently wore them for 10 hours straight on a plane and never felt uncomfortable.  The sound is not the loudest, but I think for movies (which is mainly what I am using them for) they sound nearly perfect.  If you primarily listen to music and wear your headphones for an hour or less there are probably better values out there, but for movies and/or times when you need to wear headphones for extended periods of time, these are hard to beat!

VExcellent item! Worth the money. I already have earbuds from sony with extra bass boost. I was looking for sweet sound which is what Bose does. Initially you may not feel it but try same song with this monster and then one of your existing pairs which you love. You will find Bose more realistically producing sound with minutest details in the song/movie! It also does noise cancelling to some extent well. It is very light weight and fits on ear very well. It is well suited for extended hours of use. These are definitely my also goto headphones for all air travel! Bose is there for a reason for these many year so buy this if you care about sound. You wont regret it.

VThese are the lightest headphones that I have ever owned. When you have them on, it sometimes feels as though you have nothing on your head, and the quality of the headphones is great. If you watch shows with them, you feel as though you are immersed in the world that you are watching because of the little details in sound that you can hear. Some may say that they are not the best headphones that this amount of money can buy, but they really are great. Everyone will always have an opinion about which headphones are better, but I'm not interested in debating that. All I can say is that these are great, and I definitely recommend them.

p736

VThese headphones were perfect for my recent trip to Europe. They helped drown out the noise of airplane travel (despite not being noise canceling, I definitely noticed a great difference when they were on vs off my ears). They're comfortable, fitting around my hear and stay on my head. Plus they're WAY more comfortable than earbuds. My only complaint is that the cord requires some twisting occasionally in the airplane armrest in order to have sound come from both ears. Also, when using these on a phone call, it's odd to not hear my own voice playback into the headphones, causing me to almost shout.

V* Excelent Audio* Light. Really, as advertised you barely feel them. Can be used for several hours* Nice styling. That mint color in the cable contrast very well with dark clothing* The cable length is just perfect* No need to worry about batteries as with noise cancelling / wireless optionsComming from the QuietComfort 2 I can say SoundTrue headphones aren't the best for the noisy office nor are the best audio fidelity offering from Bose. But I wouldn't use a QC2 in the street. Its heavier, easier to break, the cable will break in a couple of bus trips.

p754

VI've owned the previous version of Bose around-ear headphones and they lasted me a good 7 years with fantastic quality up until the end. I just received these and they sound just as good and are a little smaller than the other pair. The only problem I had with the last pair was that the cord on the end that plugs into the headphones was specialized, so you could only buy the official replacement. These headphones have a universal connecting cord which is a fantastic improvement. Definitely looking forward to listening with these headphones for the next few years.

p760
sg5
VThe weight of these is almost nonexistent really, REALLY lightweight! While I have the Bose QC25 I wanted some headphones for running and use at the gym (in ear-always, always fall out and I have tried many). These fit the bill just great and I sweat on them, run with them, mow the lawn with them and they just keep on ticking while blocking out most of the noise around me. I just wipe the sweat off the pads and continue exercising, or you can wait until you're finished working out. The pads have held up nicely. Now, if I want headphones to get immersed in noise canceling it's the QC25 for sure. But for general knock-around and VERY lightweight earphones with decent quality sound, these are the ones.

The cable is very thin, which I don't think a 100-headphone should have. It does not worth the price. The sound was okay for the first two or three hours; however, after that, sometimes i can only heat from one side. I thought it was because of my laptop, but i try on different devices and it still stays that way. This is a disappointment for me.

And the cushions over the ears make them easy to keep on for long periods of time without hurting. I do wish I had spend the extra $$$s and bought the sound-cancelling ear phones, though. You can still hear outside noises, which don't necessarily interfere with the sound but are somewhat distracting.

But IMO they are not the hallmark of Bose: Bose sells a couple of very clever items, headphones among them, and mostly they sell overpriced gimmickry. But the headphones consistently rate high. These are an attempt to get a lower price headphone in the market, I guess, but they just don't sound great. They sound okay, but not great. You have to go up in price or switch to their earbuds for better sound, I think.

p835
sg5
VBose doesn't disappoint with the sound on the SoundTrue around-ear headphones.  Let's start with the slight negatives - size of the headphones are quite large, and might make you look like a DJ.  However, these large cup-like ear pieces are large for good reason - to allow the sound to really resonate.  The only other slight negative I found with the SoundTrue is I had expected a little more ability to drown out ambient noise, however, it should be noted these are not sold as noise-cancelling headphones, so I can't fault the SoundTrue too much here.  For those who wish to have true noise-cancelling with excellent sound, check out the Bose QuietComfort 3 model.On the positive front, two key items on these headphones are comfort & sound.  I will wear headphones for an hour or more and these don't feel too tight or pinch.  The headpiece extends to fit to your head with ease and the cups may cover the majority of your ear (if you have smallish ears).  Best bet is to try these out in store first to be sure you are happy with fit & appearance.  For sound, I find these are well balanced, give excellent quality output across a wide variety of music and are in-line with what you'd expect from Bose brand.

VGreat super-lightweight headphones
p845
sg5
VA few points about the Bose SoundTrue headphones--They are among the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They are so lightweight I forget I'm wearing them. They create no pressure against the ears or head, no matter how long they're worn. They don't overheat or become sticky or muggy, no matter how long they're worn. The leather on the ears cups is very soft and non-abrasive.-They are made of plastic, which doesn't feel particularly heavy duty (probably why they are so lightweight), but don't feel as if they'll break any second. The ear cups swivel widely, and the plastic is flexible in general.-They feature a long cord, with inline volume control and microphone that work great. They also come equiped with a study carrying case.-The sound quality is excellent for this level of headphones. As I explore different headphones more widely, I am gaining a better appreciation of the more subtle differences between different headphones and different brands. (Although my ability to describe such differences remains minimal.) These headphones generally sound great. As for more subtle differences, the Bose-lover in the family can't get enough of them, saying the sound is "stronger", while I prefer my Sennheiser Momentum Headphone - Brown, which I would describe as more "detailed".In the end, there is no better way to choose headphones than to try them out youself, especially to determine whether the size and fit are right for you.

VThe bad: These are not very loud. As in, maximum volume is something you might find yourself hitting and wondering why there are no more bars to add. And that's compounded by how it sounds like all your singers haven't warmed up properly and the sound just isn't hitting their sweet spot, even if you know Adele can sing and your symphony sounds so rousing they could awaken an undead army. It's overly distinct in the higher, crackly sounds, kind of like how you can over sharpen an image and suddenly all the edges are pixelated and oversaturated. They also feel very fragile. It's probably my imagination, but the plastic even feels low-density. On a personal note, I don't like that when it expands, it creates three arcs in curvature over your head. Most just create a flattened arc when expanded.  If you don't know what I mean, you'll have to google someone wearing it because I sent mine back.The good: Do I even have these on? They're not that quiet, but they are that comfortable. The weigh nothing, they don't clamp, they're softer than the pillowcase you've rubbed your face on for a year. The ear cups know exactly what shape your ear is, and even the angle at which they grow from your skull. I love that. They're fairly stylish, come with some carrying accessories, and four, yes FOUR color choices. If that doesn't express you, what does? Sarcasm aside, it's a good effort.In general, these kind of feel like having the around ear headphone version of apple standard issue ear pods in terms of build and tactility (sound goes to apple). If that's your thing and you have money to spare, then maybe these are for you. If someone gave them to me or I could buy them for $20, I would use them. But even at black friday prices, these went back. I am much happier with my ATH-M40x's.

VJust ordered a second pair
p954
sg5
VOk, I am not 100% sure that these are the new version of what I have now but I'm nearly certain they are. They look identical except for the cord. Mine are 5 years old, going on 6, so the cord seems to differ. Mine has a interlocking shape on the headphone side so it can't spin. And no mic or volume/play/pause control. BUT, sound quality and comfort are the front runners of these in my opinion.  I am a singer/songwriter/producer and DJ. All of which I have been most active in within the last 6 years.  I was in the market for some good headphones to monitor my audio with in the off chance I couldn't turn up my studio monitors. These were probably not the best bang for my buck at $150 range. But so unbelievably comfortable. OMG. I have worn these headphone in excess of 8 hours at a time on more than one occasion and can honestly I doubt there is a headphone on the market today that can beat the comfort of these. If indeed the model I am reviewing is what I have now.  I did, by the way, order a pair of these 3 days ago with hopes that this is the same pair I bought before with some minor updates and colors. I will update my review upon receipt of them.  Moving on, the sound quality is as others have said, it's pretty flat. Not the best for monitoring if you are a producer/engineer. As a home recording artist and DJ these are the sh*t. For monitoring.... just ok. I almost always have to change my mixes after mixing using just these headphones. Sound totally different on my Yama ha monitors. But again, if you are a DJ or recording artist who just wants something comfortable and good to listen to while you are recording/performing, then these are the business. Obviously. I am buying another pair. Granted I got a black Friday deal for $75. But I feel they are worth the $150 I paid for the first pair. My brother has is also a DJ and has a few sets of his own headphones but insists on using my Bose whenever he has the opportunity. I just bought him a pair of Shure DJ  headphones last Xmas and he said they aren't nearly as good for DJing. He lives the around the ear style as much as I do.  And they aren't bulky. Super light weight. Comfort like I've never felt and not over bassy. As a producer/engineer I appreciate accurate sound. Tho these are no match for a studio monitor, and I have yet to find a pair of headphones that are, they are not exaggerated on any level. Well I feel I'm rambling, but I want to comment on the durability. I just now noticed after more than 5 years of heavy use that the outer layer of the ear cushion is coming off. Never seen it on me or anywhere else,  but I notice it's wearing off a little bit. Other than that, no issues whatsoever. Cords fine. Comforts the same as its always been. Sounds the same as always. If I had known that I was going to feel the way I do about these I would have paid over $200 for them. Well worth it in my opinion.

VExcellent Headphones! Have been using them for over 5 months and LOVE them! Only a few problems.Pros:1. VERY comfortable and lightweight. They are sleek, stylish, low-medium profile and the cushion on the ear cups is so soft and plushy.2. The noise canceling is perfect, enough to where outside noises don't interfere, but to where they aren't completely blocked out.3. Variety of Colors and Styles.4. Quality of Sound is very high for the price you pay, but not for true sound experts who are looking for a definite sound. But if you are particular enough about your music and want good quality. THESE are it for you!5. The price around $100 for most is acceptable if you want to spend a good chunk of change for good headphones, but not put yourself in debt compared to those over-priced Beats headphones. If you can find these for $90 or less (like I did) then it's almost an insta-buy!Cons:1. The cable pulls out a little too easily from the headphones when they get snagged, I supposed this could be good or bad depending on if it's a release feature, but I find this happening more often than I'd like.2. The In-Line volume controller only works for iPhone. I have an android and cannot turn up or down the volume with these headphones. It's a little disappointing. The mic does work on Android along with just Play/Pause. It will also take you to S-Voice.3. On certain formats/devices like Cellphones, MP3's and other audio that doesn't feature a wide range of volume control, these headphones aren't loud enough. I have found that when I am listening to Spotify on my Android and I have these headphones in, I want to turn up the sound and it's already at MAX. That is kinda disappointing too when there is a song I like or I need to hear more. It doesn't happen though on my computer speakers when I plug it directly into the speaker and turn the volume knob, then they get REALLY loud. So it's all in the device/format medium.Overall: If you buy these headphones you WILL love them and use them ALL the time. I have had them over 5 months and would not be sending them back anytime soon. The sound quality is THERE and the comfort is there too without the large price tag or being too large. Bose has done it again with these headphones and with a few minor shortcomings they are oh so sweet!

VI was actually pretty disappointed with these. I own quite a few Bose products from home stereo to the Quiet Comfort Noise cancelling headphones to the Soundlink Bluetooth speakers, etc, and they've all been quite impressive with their ability to sound better than expected for what they were, except these. I ordered these off Bose.com thru a heavy holiday discount so I was pretty happy with the purchase, again until I received and tried themDesign - 3/5 - these are quite comfortable for sure and the around ear design gives a nice seal to the sound. The cushion is soft and the headphones stay tight on the head. however, the way these are designed, if you ever look at yourself in the mirror wearing these, the headband flare out like sci-fi objects. The QC noise cancelling headphones I have are not like this at all and look compact and nice. These in my opinion are a little over the top. If you're looking for something discreet, these aren't it.Sound - 3/5 - I spent a good 30 minutes comparing these to my apple earbuds and other pair of bose QC headphones and the sound coming out of these seem very filtered and weak. I kept wondering if there was a plastic film I was suppose to peel off the interior but there weren't. The bass is weak, the treble is clear but again there's a level of filtered quality about the sound that is very disappointing. compared to the QC which has a deep resonating and warm sound, these are crispy and bland and left me disappinted.I paid $70 for these through the holiday sale but will return them. I can't imagine having paid $170 which was/in the retail price

VThis is a review on why I love these headphones for WORKING OUT! (GYM, LIFTING, CARDIO)  I didn't want purely workout/blue tooth headphones because if I'm going to spend a lot of money I want to be able to use them for multiple things - computer use, workout and travel (these would be PERFECT for the airplane).My criteria --Replaceable ear pads (since I will be sweating in them)- I compared these to more fashionable options- beats, monster DNA. All of which you can't replace the ear pads, so when those wear-out the headphones are trash.-CORD- Other reviews complained about the cord. Although it's too long for working out, I can deal with it because the cord NEVER TANGLES. It's lovely not to have to deal with that! I also don't get any cord sound which would be a deal breaker.-Noise canceling- They are pretty dang good at ! I can barely hear other gym members!-Leaking sound-They are also great at not leaking so others can't hear what you're listening to- SOUND QUALITY- there are mixed reviews on this. I find that vocals and high pitch tones come out crystal clear but bass tones are muddled and lacking. So that was disappointing. DO NOT BUY THESE PURELY FOR SOUND QUALITYComfort- 10 out of 10Appearance- in layman's terms- Beats will make you look trendy and cool - Bose will make you look techy and smartI bought these during the black Friday deal- they were half the price. I would NOT SPEND $150-$200 ON THESE. In my opinion they are not worth more than $100.

VThese are my first pair of headphones and I give them 2 thumbs up! I really like how the frame of the headphones is made with a flexible metal to accommodate different head shapes so you don\u2019t have to worry about the headphones snapping in half while putting them on or taking them off. I was a little hesitant to buy these headphones at first considering the price tag, but they are WORTH IT. I ended up buying a used pair but I think they\u2019re actually new just the packaging had been opened. I love that they include a case to protect the headphones when not in use. To me, these headphones already feel like they\u2019re noise-canceling as they cover your ears entirely. I\u2019ve tried the noise-canceling headphones that require batteries and couldn\u2019t really tell a difference. The noise-canceling headphones would be a better choice if you\u2019re going to listen to stuff in a room full of people talking or when there is construction or a fire alarm going on in the background. When not wearing them, you can kind of use them as a speaker - just follow the law of constructive interference ;) In addition to providing great, clear sound, these headphones are also head-turners! I\u2019ve already had several people come up to me asking where I got them! Definitely recommend these, especially if you\u2019re new to the headphones game.

VBose has a reputation of being overpriced for average sound. While I agree that Bose is overpriced and you can find better sounding headphones for cheap, it doesn't change how great these headphones are. They are very comfortable around the ears. They come with a cord you put into the headphones. Very useful, because they can be replaced. And the sound is great. With these headphones, you don't need to use any equalization. The headphones already sound great out of the box.However, there are some faults. For starters, the headphones suffer from bad leakage. If you plan on using these headphones in public, it's best to keep the volume down, otherwise, everybody a couple of feet away will hear what you're listening to. I did some research and discovered that a lot of around the ear headphones have this problem. I said earlier about how great these sound out of the box. However, if you do try to equalize the sound, the headphones will start to sound off. This might be the reason Audiophiles are so against Bose, because they design their products to have a certain sound and changing it makes them sound very inaccurate.Overall, these faults didn't keep me from liking these headphones a lot. I recommend them

VI bought this headset because I already have an old Bose headset that I like a lot. I wanted this one for the built in microphone and controls. I like it a lot for many reasons: it is very light that I can keep it for hours without having any head or ears discomfort. the controls work well (sometimes there is some delay with my MACBOOK Pro, but most of the time the controls work right away). I noticed that my old Bose headphones have a higher sound output at the same volume settings on my Macbook Pro, but again this was not that big of a deal. Also, their price was significantly reduced on Amazon, so I got a very good deal. Compared to the Beats Solo 2, this is a much better headset. I got a Beats solo 2, and it hurts my head and ears if it stays on for more than 30 minutes, and with the Beats Solo 2 I have to toggle with the jack that connects to the headset to get sound output from both ears pieces, not to mention that the price is higher than that of the Bose headset (before the Amazon discount, the price is almost the same). Personally, I prefer this set big time and recommend it over the Beats Solo 2. I would give it 4.5/5 stars but again there is no option for stars fractions. Overall I'm totally pleased with it.

VI am enjoying my soundcolor  mint green bluetooth speaker so much I decided to get a pair of Bose headphones. Note, I typically use Klispch Image S4's for portable use and Audio Technica's for my keyboards and home listening so really didn't need a new pair.This purchase is honestly more out of curiosity as to how the headphones are. Note, as I am still in the burn in period (and I do notice them sounding more in line with the classic rock/blues jazz etc. I might come back and give these a 5 star- which isn't to say they aren't excellent but I was astounded by the bluetooth speaker. Right now I would rate them around 4  1/4.I would say they are the most comfortable headphones I have tried on, almost as comfortable as the QC25's but not quite.As opposed to the Audio Technica's which might have more of a lower end these are presenting the music as it has been recorded.The strength seems to be in the mid's with a nice clarity in things like hi-hats and cymbals. Vocals are very clear in the mix.There isn't as much bass as I am hearing in the bluetooth speaker-but i know that is a speaker and this is designed for general use accross all generes of music.

VI just received my Bose headphones today that I purchased from Amazon during Black Friday sales. My white Bose headphones also have a red blemished stain on the left side of the headband like many reviewers were saying. It seems like it is some kind of numbers that are being smeared off, but not completely and it is permanently there. I like the headphones, but it is a nuisance since I purchased them as "new" from Amazon. I can't believe Bose will sell its product with an obvious flaw on the appearance. The sounds from the headphones are very clear and nice. I have a pair of Beats Studio and It has a lot of low and heavy bass. Bose SoundTrue is different, it is not bass heavy and it provides clearer vocals from a singer and better high and mid sound all around. This headphones are very comfortable and they are more comfortable than the Beats Studios for sure, but Bose doesn't look as cool as Beats.  I would have liked this pair of headphones a lot if the red stain wasn't there because the headphones have nice sounds and they are very comfortable for the price I paid. Don't know what to do.  I am still thinking whether I should return it.

VI grabbed a pair of these during the Black Friday specials, but I am already a Bose fan with my noise cancelling headphones I take with me on every flight. These were for "casual listening" but it turns out my daughter's Beats broke before our family trip to Mexico, so I gave her this set. She was a headphone snob, thinking Bose was so ... consumer. But these headphones changed her mind. She started to proclaim they were "amazing" and I know they sounded more natural and balanced than the Beats she had before. I also know that as an audiophile, the mid range is not as transparent as my Grado SR80's but you wouldn't notice if you didn't have those as a reference. I also have two Bose bluetooth boxes and they really do sound excellent for what they do and for the price I paid. I have to admire a company that has, over they years, created consumer and commercial products that do stand out among some of the best values in their respective markets. That's why I gave them 5 stars, not because these are the BEST SOUNDING Headphones ever, that aren't. They are the best sounding headphones I've found at this price point. That's why.

VI picked these up after trying a few different headphones in a local B&M.;I wear glasses, and my main requirement was that a pair of over-the-ear headphones had to be light.  Since I'm pretty sensitive to pressure on my head and I travel internationally quite frequently, I've been pretty much limited to in-ear headphones only.All I can saw is WOW - these things are light!  I recently took them on a 24 hour door-to-door trip and I didn't have any issues with pressure, headaches, or any other problems that have plagued me in the past.Plus -- the sound quality is quite nice.  It doesn't have a huge amount of bass (no, these aren't Beats) -- but I found them very pleasing to the ears.The mic works well with Android phones (but as expected the volume buttons don't work) - however, my primary purpose for purchasing was not for use with my phone.Overall, a great pair of cans, and highly recommended if you are a sensitive glasses wearer and are looking for a great fitting, nice sounding, portable pair of over-the-ear headphones!

VAfter getting the newest beats 2 over the ear earbuds and not being so impressed I wanted to try something else. These are my first bose product and first time wearing the around the ear style. Originally I got these to plug into my iPad at home while the hubby is gaming, for travel, just for fun really. But I quickly became obsessed with these. I wear these for all those above reasons but also surprisingly I take mine out to jog/run outside. The sound is just so rich compared to any other headphone and the comfort level- I don't even feel them. They are not noise canceling but when I'm using them it gives me a sense I'm the only one around!Only consThe cord is extremely unnecessary long and flaps around when exercising.The top black padded area can start to slip forward when running and needs pushed back onto your head. Small adjustment for the quality of sound.Oh and can make you a little bit warm as its trapping in a bit of heat duringAlso I don't sweat excessively in these as I'm sure that could cause some damage- just common sense!

VHave purchased around 7 pairs of Bose headphones like this (4 of the SoundTrue) and 3 of their predecessors (Bose AE2). Superbheadphones for their time. No one seems to make high quality headphones like this that "last". Sorry, but fact of life. We live in adisposable society... get used to it.  All of the AE2 ones have failed after 1-2 years of heavy use by my sones and I (they sleep in them, sometimes). The cables break (and can be replaced separately) but, in the end, one of the two sides will stop functioning. I still buy them. Tried other types .. no better. I assume the SoundTrue ones will go the same way and can update you in a year or so. Recently, the white ones were on sale for $75 and this seems a realistic price ($175 rather too much). You pay more for the Bose name, of course. This review sounds negative but the sound quality is great and the *comfort* fantastic. Very light and you can wear them all day. I do for hours. I would recommend waiting for sales and stockpiling this product.

VLove this! Got this as a back up to my HD-598's...and to use with a splitter when watching movies on my laptop with a friend in a nursing home. One thing I found out is the cable tip does not work well with the splitter, cuts the sound by half and...warps the sound...as if it's partially shorted out...I wonder if this is why the 1 star reviews. But it does work, and sounds awesome when plugged directly into the laptop. I am ordering another after market "upgrade cable" without the telephone feature, to resolve this issue. In addition I don't have much faith in the long term durability of the thin wire Bose supplied. Seem like Bose would/could provide a better/thicker cable with these.I find myself using these more than the HD-598. They have a great sound quality without any equalization. Great bass...clear and clean all the way around. I am pleasantly surprised. I find them even more comfortable then the 598's. These do warm my ears more than the open back design of the 598...so might not be my first pick come summer.I have the white ones and...no red mark to be found anywhere...maybe just lucky.Comfort,,,excellent, sound is superb, way better than the reviews had led me to believe. Cable is poor. Despite the thin cable I have to rate these 5 stars. They just sound way to good, and are to comfortable to rate lower. A great buy.

VI will admit, these aren't very different from the original Ae2i model. I will acknowledge that I absolutely love the black matte on black. Looks, super cool and the inner red design is simple and eye catching. The comfort is unmatched and one of the main reason I never choose any other headphone design by other companies namely, beats. Then the new cord is I don't know, made of something special because it doesn't intertwine like other cords, this one stay relatively straight, so although there not bluetooth...their not annoying either.  Believe it or not the sound wasn't too spectacular. Bose for me is the gold standard for quality headphones and this model is no different but there definitely not more impressive than other earlier bose models but hey, they are bose they are new and they sound great. And again, the new look is awesome and the detachable audio cable is another plus, no longer afraid to have it rip(come out), I can always get a new one.

VHands down, the best headphones I have ever used (that really isn't saying much, but these are truly great).I am not a huge music or audio person, just someone who likes to not-hear people talk on the subway, and these do the job perfectly.  They are unbelievably comfortable (seriously, it's ridiculous how comfy these are.. headphones ALWAYS hurt my ears or head, and these just don't at all), the sound quality is amazing, at least for my experience - there are lyrics and instruments I've literally never noticed/heard before, on songs I've listened to thousands of times, that come through crystal clear.  Its remarkable, and while they are not noise cancelling, they REALLY reduce the sounds around you, even with no music playing. It's seriously insane.  Again, I'm totally a laymen when it comes to audio equipment, but these are absolutely amazing in every possible way.  I don't think there is any way I could be happier with them.

p1217
sg5
VI tried many headphones and spent hundreds of Dirhams (local currency in the UAE)  on different brands that either hurt the head or the ears. These are the most comfortable of the lot with spongy on ear rings that hold the headphones in place and block out sound . These headphones block out sound and make you hear only what you're plugged in to hear.The headphones come in 4 different color variations and the box they come in contain a cord to connect to your device (laptop, iPhone or other smart phones) plus a case to keep it safe and clean. I got them for approximately $190 through Virgin Megastore in Abu Dhabi. So Amazon's price is much better than what I got it for. However, I got a lifetime warranty with the headphones from the store, so if anything goes wrong, I can just take to the store to replace the non functioning part. For this, the Bose salesman gave me a warranty card, which I'm not sure Amazon provides.

VI got these for Christmas, and I've used them every day since.  They're a comfortable, light-weight set of headphones, and I'm really glad I have them.Notes: \u2022 They are NOT noise cancelling.  For me, I didn't want noise cancelling because I didn't want to deal with batteries, especially surprise dead batteries while traveling.  These do muffle most sound though: my boyfriend yells a lot while playing video games, and I don't hear him when I'm sitting on the couch next to him. \u2022 The mint is more bold than the picture.  It's more of a cross between sea foam and mint.  Still very pretty. \u2022 They DO come with the case, and it's a simple case but matches the headphones. \u2022 A few people were commenting about the detachable cord being a problem, but so far, as long as it's plugged in correctly it works.  A detachable cord beats having a ruined connection.  I'll keep this updated in case they stop working.

VSound is clear with a variety of music.Highs are crisp and clear without being "tinny" or piercing. The bass is satisfying and center is audible, not drowned out by either lows or highs. The sounds seems to come out flat which is nice if you like to equalize it after, for example I can amplify low and highs and still hear the center.Vocals sound great and every word is comprehensible.The quality is comparable to AT M50's, however the bose headphones are much lighter and easier to travel with. They're smaller. They seem to sit better on the head, the M50's get a bit annoying after a while.The M50's definitely get louder than the bose set, but the bose are certainly lpud enough. If anything the M50's are too loud.The cord seems to be weak, it hasn't broken but the potential is there. It's thin like the cord on run of the mill earbuds. It's a 2.5 male on one end and 3.5 male on the other.

VThese headphones are awesome.  Nice color!  Everyone at the gym, and I do mean everyone, has Beats headphones (nothing against Beats by Dr. Dre) so I decided to take a different approach .  I'm in no way a sound engineer but, to me, the sound is really nice!  I have, what I would consider, a small head and small ears (I've been told I have little elf ears sans the pointy tops) and as a woman most over the ear headphones don't fit.  These fit nicely as long as I'm not doing crunches on the floor.  That's when the headphones fall off.  However if you have a medium to large noggin' you should be fine. The only drawback is the chord.  It usually unravels several times during my work out. So I think I need to get the wireless version for the gym.  I'll keep these at work where I'm stationary most the time. Would I buy these again over the other brands absolutely!  My only wish is that these came in more colors!

VI purchased these for $75 on Black Friday from Amazon and LOVE them.  I work from home and have to wear headphones for audio for a large portion of the day.  A few years ago I started using Beats only to have headaches and replacing them twice because the audio would go out in one ear.  Went back to my "old faithful" Bose headphones until literally they fell apart (they were probably close to 10 years old and being used roughly 5 days a week -- however, the audio never went bad, just the ear cushions).  Just upgraded to this pair and I love how light they are.  They don't cause headaches, and they cancel out a lot of outside noise by just putting them on.  Great purchase with the Black Friday deal, but I'd still pay full price for these any day.  They are smaller and not as bulky as they appear in the picture, but they fit comfortably and adjust to larger sizes if needed.

VI bought these as a portable  or travel set of cans. I'm no audiophile but I like my music to sound "real". I want the instruments to sound as I think they really sound as if I was there. I wanted passive noise isolating and I wanted comfort and I want a "real sound". I compared these to my Noontecs and my Audio-Technica M50. While the Noontecs are the lightest  they don't sound as well as the other two and being on-the ear they are not noise isolating.As to the M50s I feel they sound somewhat better , especially  with the bass, but they are massive in relation to the Bose and not nearly as comfortable. I wouldn't want to wear them on a long flight even if they sound "better".In sum, I prefer these for travel because of noise isolation and comfort but I'll stick with the M50s for at home listening of not long duration

Varrived really fast. Nice packaging and design. This is the most comfortable pair of headphones I have worn ever. I can wear them the whole day and there isn't any pain at all. Quite often I feel like I am not wearing anything. Perfect for those long haul flights. The quality of the sound is pretty good. Not focused on bass, but I didn't want too much bass either. However I was a little bit disappointed in the fact that when I listen to music on my iPod at 75% - 80% volume level, the music leaks and the person beside me is able to hear whatever I am listening to. Besides that, it does a pretty good job in noise cancelling, despite the fact that it isn't a noise cancelling headphone.Overall, I am very satisfied with these pair of headphones. The comfort level is over the roof and that was the main reason why I decided to purchase them.

I travel light: one rolly bag + a bag over the rolly bag handle.  All must be lightweight and/or worth the space it takes up.  These headphones fit my needs perfectly.  So comfortable with great sound.  Amazon had a sale a couple days after my first search.  *Note* it was not clear (to me) from the Amazon entry whether or not the coordinating cover was included; NOTE: the coordinating cover is included.  Note: there's space in the cover to hold my nano.  I would definitely recommend to all.

VI was excited to try these out and due to a special price, decided to give them a try.  I seen mostly very good reviews, but wonder if I simply got a bad set?  I have only tried these on my laptop and some YouTube videos I have played many times on headsets much cheaper sets.  Out of the box, very disappointed.  My cheaper sets play out much better than these.  I tried to adjust other settings, but still no "punch" very low bass mix and over-all not impressive.  I'm not bashing these and think I may have simply got a bad pair?  But first impression, very disappointed in the sound quality.  Again, I put these up directly against other sets I have (all much cheaper) on the same unit and same music/source, so it is a legitimate test.  Any suggestions in possible diagnosing to confirm this is just a possible bad set?  TIA

VSo if your going to spend a decent amount of money on headphones I wouldn't recommend these. They are typical nice headphone. The music quality is good but I think the quiet comfort style and beats headphone have better quality. I really wanted around the ear headphones and while these do go around the ear my ears were touching the speakers. These are not advertised as noise canceling and they are not. Some of the other reviews have been saying they cancel out a decent amount of sound but I really have to disagree with this. If your on a train or a noisier floor of the library these won't do anything for you. I was also disappointed with the fit. They were not snug to my head. They did not move around a lot but enough that I found it annoying. I am returning them and splurging on the quiet comfort 25s.

I read that the connectors have issue and that was our problem.  If i wiggle the cable it moves the sound form one ear to the other but not to both.  Called Bose and they have a wonderful customer service.  They offered to send me a new cable or a new headset.  I am going to go the cable route as they did say mainly these are cable issues.  they send the new cable free of charge.  if that doesn't work then you can do an exchange where they give you a free ups label to send yours back and they send you a brand new headset.  Got to love that customer service!!  This review is about the headset not the seller.  Thrillingaudio was a wonderful so have no issue with them.

After finding out it works as a mic on my Playstation 4 I was sold. These are super lightweight and cushiony so they don't feel heavy or hurt my ears. I got these in mint color so I also look super cute wearing them. The sound quality I cannot get over... I compared the sound quality with a pair of $100 Sony headphones my boyfriend had and the sound quality was amazing on both, but his is much larger. So the fact that these sound this good and are also light and compact is amazing. I am so surprised and in aw with these headphones. Best $100 ever spent ( I bought these at Fred Meyer for $104 with a price match from Targets website if you want to save a few bucks). Also the small carrying case makes it super convenient to bring them anywhere and fit right into your purse. If these headphones are this amazing I wonder how well the $200+ Bose ones are. Definitely recommend!!

VI've owned AE2's for years, while trying several other high end headphones, but I always preferred the AE's for their natural sound and superior comfort.(others are too heavy or compressive and get uncomfortable quickly) You could easily forget you're wearing these!. I found other headphones to have unnatural bass that really just drips all over everything hiding the subtleties. My first ae2's lasted many years as I was able to easily replace the chord twice and cushions once. I was a bit shocked to see the new higher price at first, but with time and inflation it would seem to be about right. The fact is I'd pay even more for these if I had to. As far as I'm concerned nothing compares!

VSo-So in my opinion...weak on punch, though decent mids and highs
p1366
sg5
VI am not a huge bass fan (aka bass at the expense of all else (read "low end Beats", but I like its presence.  These headphones seem to lack the punch of a mid-range Beats (like the Mixr), and general volume is mediocre.  I do believe the mids and highs are fairly true to the source, and the construction is decent, but the fact that I've seen these Bose cup materials wear poorly on another model, coupled with the lack of volume and anything I'd consider a motivating bass presence makes me tepid on these headphones.  I think you can get better for the price and form factor / weight (my Beats Mixrs (I got on clearance from Walmart) are begrudgingly still my favorites, though I think Beats in general are way too pricey for what you get)

VAfter using these headphones for a few days I'm a total convert. I had no idea what the songs I was already listening to sounded like! These headphones really do enhance the experience, and I'm hearing elements of the music now that I never knew were there before. I work in a cubicle in a really noisy office (well, opposite the office of someone really LOUD) and the over-ear feature means that I really can tune her out. Honestly, sometimes I put these headphones on without any music just to tune her out (or I'll put one ear on while I'm on the phone so I can focus on the call I'm on) because they really do block out unwanted noise. The best part is that  the turquoise color is totally cool and I look really awesome using them!

VYou can't beat Bose for sound quality.  These were a gift from my husband.  I wouldn't have spent so much on myself but I am very glad he did it for me.  I let my mom borrow them for a flight and when she thanked me she said she really appreciated how much they cancelled out the noise around her.  While they do cut the noise a little, my husband has the Bose QuietComfort 15 that are actually noise canceling and there is a big difference in the amount of noise that you really hear.  These are very comfortable and I do like that you don't have to replace a battery or anything like that.  I love the Tiffany blue color and they fit me well.  They've lasted me over a year and despite being heavily used, they still look new.

p1384
sg5
VI had a previous model of these headphones for something like six years (and my dad used them briefly before he gave them to me), and I loved them but they finally died on me just recently. However, the new ones are even better. The cushion part is slightly larger (in diameter, not bulk), which makes it more comfortable- the old ones began to hurt my ears after a while from being squished by the headphones, but that hasn't happened yet with the new ones. The cushion on the top is better as well. The sound is fantastic; I had excellent timing in that I purchased these just before the new Muse album came out, and I'm loving it! And definitely bonus points for style, these are so much cooler looking than my old ones.

VExcellent headphones. I've been looking some good headphones in order to avoid listening whatever people around me are saying (on cafes, in my office, etc) and they work perfect for it. If you turn the whole volume up, your ears wont hurt at all (once I hurt my ears because one song was a bit louder and the volume was too high), these are quite clever. About the noise cancelling, you will still hear some noise if the music is off but once you play it, you can forget about everything.Of course if I could have pay hundreds of dollars for some 100% complete noise cancelling, but I think considering the price, is the best choice if you are looking for some I-don't-care-about-anyone-around-here headphones.

VThese were reviewed by users who testified to how comfortable they were.  But really, they're just OK - after wearing them for a while, my ears hurt.  They really are no more comfortable than any other headphone I have owned - these are lightweight, which is good - but comfort as the strong selling point is not accurate.  I have an old pair of Sony headphones that were beginning to wear pretty badly - thought I would replace them with a newer, state of the art headphone.  Bose is about the best manufacturer of speakers on the market so I felt safe in ordering these untested.  They're dull compared to my Sony headphones - missing the higher and lower spectrum - they sound muffled.  Will probably return them.

VI have a son who had a pair of these, and when I tried them on I couldn't believe the level of comfort they provided. I was on the phone with my health insurance company for hours using this headset. I didn't get anywhere with the insurance guys, but even after such a long time the headphones weren't uncomfortable. I'll never go back to "on ear" headphones again. These are hugely more comfortable than my Audia-Technica ATH-M30 pair, which are very comfortable for shorter duration use. I am definitely NOT an audiophile, and can't really tell you about the quality of sound in any technical way, but certainly the sound is great and that's good enough for me. The microphone works great too.

VTruly the best headphones I have used in my life. I have shopped around all kinds from over ear to around ear headphones from Beats to Sony to Boss and these are by far the most comfortable headphones I have tried. The sound quality is equally impressive with good bass and treble. Although these are not designed to be noise cancelling, they do block out a good amount of noise that I have to take them off when people speak to me. All other headphones start to hurt the ears after a while but these guys feel so comfortable that you won't even know it is on you. For some reason, it makes the ears a tad bit moist the first few uses but somehow that has disappeared.

VI love these headphones so much. They don't feel too tight, they block out just the right amount of noise, and the built-in remote works amazingly with my iPod and iPhone. It's been like experiencing my music library for the first time. The biggest drawback for me is the cable itself. It's so long, thin, and delicate that it snags and tangles easily. I owned this pair of headphones for two weeks before the cable needed to be replaced. The headphones themselves are stellar, but the durability of the cable is awful. Luckily, I was able to order a new cable on Amazon with ease but I think it detracts from an otherwise exceptional pair of headphones.

VI did not purchase these on Amazon, but if you're anything like me you always read Amazon reviews before buying on any platform. I had the previous generation/style and I loved them. I used those and my new SoundTrue headphones to produce hip hop. They have a great bottom sound and the mids really are "true." My only gripe with these is that they, unlike it's predecessor, squeeze my head and glasses. They help keep any outside sound from coming in, but I loved how my last pair fit. They start giving me a headache after an hour. Kinda sucks. I don't have an over-sized head or anything! Other than that, they sound clean.

VThis is an early review.  I just received my Bose SoundTrue Headphones yesterday.  I am learning Spanish and listen to a lot of audio books in Spanish or instructional material.  I wanted headphones that had a very crisp, clear sound.  These headphones are excellent for that.  I tried them also for music and I think they are great in that arena too.  For me, there is adequate bass that is well balanced.  I don't care for the muddiness that can accompany many bass rich headphones.  It's all personal preference and I really love the sound I am getting from these Bose for the purpose I am using them for.

They tend to block a lot of sound when you are listening to music, although they are not noise-cancelling, you will definitely be separated from the outside world. The cord does not work with android phones. If you get these you will not be disappointed!

While they are not specifically made for reducing outside noise from your surroundings, the fact that they are around-ear style does make it block out some more sound than an on-ear headphone. So this blocks enough sound off for me without completely isolating myself from the outside world. This way I'd be able to hear enough in case there was some sort of emergency going on. Anyway, I love these.

Nothing terribly exciting, and for the price, I would hope for a lot more from all ranges, and especially the bottom end.  ATH-M50 are my go-to for price/sound/comfort ratio.  Sennheiser if I want a small improvement to sound.  Bose if I'm looking for comfort (i.e. long plane rides).

In other words, the sound coming through the headphones can be heard from a person sitting within 3 feet when listening to music at a moderate volume (i.e. the same thing was observed when listening through $20 ear buds). Finally, the headphones are comfortable, but I found no other real advantage when compared to a cheaper set of ear buds.

However, these are extremely light and you can barely feel them on your head.If you're looking for decent travel headphones, this might work for you. If you're looking for mostly desktop headphones, save yourself the hassle and go with Audio-Technica M50x.Pros: Decent sound quality, Very light, Provides some noise canceling.Cons: Sound quality, Cheap material, Overpriced.

VI really liked the headphones and used them every day for 6 months.  Then the sound died in my right ear.  I try and tweak the settings but the sound is good for a minute or two and then dies again in my right ear.  The headphones feel great on my head, the sound is good when they work but I am not sure they are a reliable long term tool that you can use everyday and expect to work every time.  I would rank these as 1 star and suggest any serious buyer might want to do more research and look for a headphone that you can depend upon.

p1542
sg5
VFirst off, I bought these headphones in white during black Friday for $75, which is a phenomenal price. They sound great delivering a lot of bass, and offerinng crisp, realistic sounds for instrumental classics. However, one down side is that the headphones have a pink streak on the lower, right part of the band, as mentioned by others. It's not really noticeable, but I guess that may have been the reason that they were about $35 cheaper than the other colors. Other than that, these headphones were really worth it for the price.

VGood headphones for traveling. Wore them over a 24 hour travel day overseas (and back) and they held up great and were very light and easy to wear. They sound good to me, better than my Beats, and are much more comfortable to wear. My head is large so the beats felt tight on my head. My only issue is that the first pair I ordered, the right ear cup went out within a day and I had to replace them. They aren't incredible sounding but they do the trick for me. My main use is travel, so that's what I am basing this on.

VGood sound quality with my LG G3, very comfortable. They do have a quiet static hum when listening which is disappointing. It's not noticeable during louder songs but if I'm listening to something quiet it's mildly annoying. Don't quite understand why these headphones are specifically made for Apple products to the detriment of other users. That said, they're very comfy, I have quite a few ear piercings and on ear headphones get uncomfortable after a short while.  Apart from the static the sound is very nice.

Its a whole new experience listening to my music collection on these.Very light to put on your head. My ears' cartilage didn't pain when I put these on for a prolonged time.

VI got these because just had ear buds and they weren't very comfortable, so my relative had an older model of these and Just started using them. I asked for them for Christmas and they are the best. They are comfortable for as long as you wear them. I have an issue with the wife becomjng disconnected, so I like that you can change the cord and not just the whole set of headphones. They turn out if you don't want to wear them but listen to music, like speakers. Also, the case is very durable and stylish.

Tried them with my iPad and was getting shorted out in the left ear. Duh! I hadn't pushed the pin in hard enough. Problem solved. Not sure what I'll do about my iPhone, I don't like taking the case off. Other than that, these headphones are very comfy and deliver solid sound. Just what I wanted as far as that goes, but I'm no expert.

It is completely removable though so if it becomes a huge issue I could easily replace it.I really recommend it; so much so that if these broke I'd probably buy another pair.

VI have spent a lot of my life with headphones on. Broadcasting and in consumer electronics and Ham radio, I've been there. Worn good ones and not so good. When I put this headphone on, it reminds me of a gel David Clark at 1/2 the weight. It's not an active noise suppression but if all headphones were built like this headphone, there would be no need for that. Except for maybe helicopter or similar aviation.Having used a lot of products that Amar Bose produced, this one is exceptional.

VI bought these headphones on Amazon for $120 and i have to say it is so worth the money. I don't want to degrade the quality of beats, but they're overpriced by $50-$100 in my opinion. The bose soundtrue (in white) looks better and sounds 90% as good as beats products. If you're looking for low, deep bass i would look into beats solo 2 or beats studio, but if you're looking for crisp sound quality for a great price and an EXTREMELY comfortable set of headphones, look no further than the soundtrue.

VThese headphones are incredibly comfortable, but far the most comfortable I have ever owned.  The sound quality is good, but it's not blowing me away.  Good clarity but the sound stage just doesn't sound as full / big as I would have liked.  I think the have been listening to my Sonos system for too long and am used to the sound from that system which probably isn't a fair comparison because these are just headphones.  Overall I'm happy these are a big upgrade from entry level headphones.

VI owned other quality Bose products before, this product is no different. Build quality & performance are the best. High, mid & lows are perfectly balanced. I do not like headphones such as Dre & Monster that are heavy in bass but lacks highs & mids. I like the around the ear model better than over the ear because it's comfortable & cuts outside noise effectively. Wish Bose could have made the head band foldable also like the Sony for more portability. All in all, I highly recommend it.

VI have enjoy these headphones for a couple months now. I am not sure how these head phones and sound quality compare to other more pricier models or brands. I think these have good sound quality to them. I dont have an iPhone or iPad or iPod, but I can use them on my speakers I have for my desktop computer. I use Altec Lansing speakers. They were shipped within the time they said too.

I'm not an expert on sound-quality but they sounded great to me.

The biggest niggle I had with these cans was their SQ.  The mids and bass were alright, nothing special but I was left desperately wanting much more from the high's.  The sound was borderline muddled in the 500hz + range.

VSuper Comfortable, Super Mediocre Sound
p1891
sg5
VMaybe it's just me, but the main reason I was looking for a new pair of headphones was for the sound quality.  I have little interest in any other feature really other than amazing sound.  Before I get into that rant, the headphones are super light, incredibly comfortable, and do a pretty great job at masking outside noises, even though they aren't officially noise cancelling.They're not that stylish (for me that was something I was into) and the sound is mediocre at best.  The bass is almost nonexistent, so if your musical genres of choice primarily have a lot of bass, these headphones aren't for you.  The treble is harsh and everything sounds very open and tinny.  I didn't think the headphones did a good job of holding the sound in.  The cord was way too long for my preference.  I'm mostly a commuter and listen to music while taking the subway too and from work.  The cord is so long and kept getting tangled in my bag and even caught on other people.All in all, I wasn't a fan.  Definitely not worth the money for the poor sound quality.

VComfortI\u2019ve worn these for several hours off and on at work and they were indeed comfortable.  Sometimes, I\u2019d forgotten that I had them on; they\u2019re lightweight but quality material.  There was only a small issue with moisture buildup inside, but goes away when you take them off periodically to do other things.Sound QualitySound quality is relative, and I\u2019m not picky.  Admittedly, these sound better than a $10 pair of on-ear headphones, but \u201cbetter\u201d is the limit of my opinion as it matters to me.Stereo vs. monoListening to a variety of songs, I can verify that stereo sound is standard and cannot be changed to mono.  This is an issue for my husband that is deaf in one ear.  It is quite a drawback to only be able to listen to half of some songs with no option to switch to mono.  For me, it doesn't matter as I prefer stereo.Sound ContainmentThese around-ear style do a good job preventing outside sound from getting in.  What comes in is muffled.  I can still hear my phone ringing, which is good.Product OriginHeadphones \u2013 stamped on the inside of the left arm is \u201cEngineered in USA Assembled in Mexico\u201d with the word \u201cMexico\u201d a noticeably smaller and more compact font.

It was nice to be able to move around my office, eat lunch at another table of the desk, without taking the headphones off.  Listed dimensions of the headphones and ear cushions are also true.

VThe pair of headphones sits comfortably on your ears. The sound quality is just OK, enough resolution in mid-range, but doesn't go very deep in lower side. Unfortunately, the pair I received has the same red blemish issue other buyers noticed. Since it's just for home use and not a gift, I will keep it.

VI'm not a total audiophile, but I love music. There's really nothing quite like sitting down and just listening to music with a stellar set of headphones with your eyes closed. I had some audio and music studio courses in college, so I've been schooled in the ways of good sound. Not only that but living with a professional musician means we don't settle for crap sound quality and it's not uncommon to have lively musical debate at least on the regular.I've previously had another set of Bose around the ear headphones that I liked a lot, so I was thrilled to get an updated set with the most recent technological advances.I listen to most every type of music, from rock and R&B; to hip-hop, classical to folk. The only thing I don't like is country. Lately I've been diggin on old school Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Bruno Mars. If it has horns, sign me up. Everything sounds incredible and full with these headphones. Also I use the sound choices in the settings of my ipod to enhance a particular type of music(there are choices like rock, pop, hiphop etc). Without a particular setting on some jams, I am getting a bit of distortion on the percussion. The subtle differences are much more noticeable with the bose headphones then with any other set I've ever had. You'll pick up on instruments and tones you never knew were present.The headphones come with a great little leather pouch to make them easily portable and they're lightweight and fold in so I wouldn't hesitate to travel with them. They're extreme comfortable too. I have small ears, and I cannot wear anything that goes in the ear such as earbuds, they just fall out or if I can jam them in enough to stay, they hurt. So these are the perfect solution for me.The only thing I've noticed that is a downer is how easily someone sitting next to me can hear what I'm listening to. I hate to disturb other people (sorta the point of wearing headphones).I don't blast it because I don't want to damage my ears, but I do want to enjoy the fullness of the sound. Also, the volume control on the headphone wire doesn't work with my older iPod, though it works just fine on my iPhone 5s. All around though, such a great set. Bose never disappoints

VI'd originally purchased the NCredible NTune On Ear in purple about a year ago, but they were too heavy for my head and kept pinching my ears. Then I found these and I love them! They're a perfect fit for my head, very light and fit around my ear perfectly. They don't claim to be noise cancelling, but when I have these on even with the volume on low all I hear is my music, which is great for the office! I also use these with my Roku 3 remote and the sound is great. Unlike the NCredible's though there's only one port for your cable a minor thing and did not keep me from giving it 5 stars. The case that they come in seems very durable, but a bit bulky.Update: I did drop it down a star because this a biggie and also irritates me that companies still do this. If you have an Android phone that you're using these headphones with, you *can* pause your music using the cable cord but that's it you can't lower or raise the volume, that part only works with the iPhone (boo!). I haven't tried switching the cord and using the one that came with my NCredible, and I probably won't since I'm afraid it could mess up my headphones.

VFantastic sound, extremely comfortable
p2510
sg5
VFantastic sound, extremely comfortable, solid construction, and a sleek design (matte black) -- these are the primary qualities of these headphones. The sound quality is well balanced, with a slight emphasis on the low end and treble. A non-audio enthusiast will probably consider the sound quality to be extremely good, especially when compared to most $150 pair of headphones. There is little objection to these headphones being some of the most comfortable of all time -- even if you wear glasses. They feel quite durable and are very flexible; the ear cups swivel and will likely fit over your ears perfectly. The design is subjective, but I consider it very to be sleek, while subtle at the same time. The matte black version doesn't look obnoxious in public, which is something that headphone wearers may be concerned about. The biggest, and in my opinion, only downfall of these headphones is the price. At nearly $200 total, this isn't a bargain. However, I would still highly recommend them due to the near-flawless execution of nearly every aspect of these headphones.

VPurchased them, tried them on my iDevices, computer, and Android phone... Returned on the next day. With or without equalization, the sound of these headphones is extremely poor. I do give it 1 star because right away I was able to hear sounds for the first time on songs that I have listened to thousands of times already. I exchanged these for a Sennheiser HD201, which cost $100 less and its audio quality goes from 1 to 10! I give the Bose another star for its looks and because they are comfy.

I dont write reviews but I am a big fan of bose I have a Soundlink and its just a piece of art for us. This thoroughly disappointed me. The notes are average and so is the sound clarity I mean you can get the same quality at much cheaper price. I compared it with my iphone earbuds and decided to stick with them. Hence i am returning it within a day of getting it.The built and all is fine and neat but the sound quality is poor or to say the least not upto the standards of bose

p3116

VJust purchased the "Mint" colored SoundTrue and returned the Beats "Studio" which cost $50 more on sale. The Bose SoundTrue sounds so much clearer than the Beats Studio which was muffled and also has a poor review on Amazon. A great feature of this headphone is the light weight, comfort and no batteries required. At $149.00 they are the best headphones available for the price at this time. At first the color appeared to be more feminine however, after watching a sunday night football game where on of the team's were wearing tights the same color I no longer think it is just a girls color.

Very light weight and cups your ear completely so that you don't feel any pressure on your ears. Sound is also really great. I am not really a bass person but, I think that the bass here is good and enough unlike what others say. Bose is what you expect it to be.

VI had the old generation set like this and they lasted me about 8 years! The only reason they failed is because the wiring to the head phone jack started to lose connection, and for that reason I love the fact that the wire for these is detachable and replaceable. I have only had the new ones for a week and so far they have impressed me. Love the improvements especially the swivel joints that allow better fitting and better packing in the new awesome carrying case. Thanks again Bose for a great product\U0001f44d\U0001f3fb

p3397
sg5
VI really tried to love these headphones but I just couldn't.First of all these headphones are super light and the design of the ear cups are meant for maximum comfort. They truly are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used.But the sound made my ears bleed. It sounds like all the voices and instruments are kind of tiny and acute. After I took the headphones off I could feel my heartbeats on my ears for quite a while. Im not an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it. I have some Audioengine A5 speakers and when sound comes out of those speakers a smile comes to my face. The sound coming out of these bose headphones made all my favorite music sound annoying, specially the ones with high voices or high pitched sounds. I was listening to Kesha's timber song and usually I can listen to that song over and over again but with these head phones I just couldn't stand listening.
