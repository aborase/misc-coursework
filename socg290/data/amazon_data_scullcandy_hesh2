VWhen I was considering buying these headphones, I was reading a lot of reviews on them that made me not want to buy them. People were saying they were the crappiest headphones ever & that they're a waste of money. Truthfully, these people are just plain wrong. They're expecting way too much out of $50 headphones. I think that these are pretty beast for $50 headphones. They sound amazing & the bass is awesome as well but not so overpowering that it distorts the sound. They also do an awesome job of blocking out surrounding noises. I know there are a lot of people who say these hurt your ears after wearing them for too long, don't worry about that too much. Just a simple readjustment will stop that from happening. The only thing that's a bad thing is that they do leak some sound. But that's not that big of a deal for me so to me, this product is flawless. Another thing: everyone is saying that these are made out of some cheap crappy material that breaks easily. Once again, wrong. If you don't yank them off your head & actually make an effort to take care of them, they should last a while. & even if they do break, Skullcandy will either replace it at no charge or replace it for 50% depending on what happened. So if you're not planning on buying these because of all those reviews that say this product sucks, you should just go ahead and buy them. You'd be surprised at how amazing they are & how all those reviews were just a bunch of bs. These headphones are just so amazing. My very first pair & I couldn't ask for anything better for such a cheap price. Oh yeah, they're also stylish as well (;

VConsidering I bought these headphones for $50, the sound quality is very good.  I also own a pair of $120 Able Planet NC Headphones and of course there is a significant difference in sound quality.  Do not buy these if you are looking for a pair of traveling headphones as they do not assist in reducing the low humming of voices or car engines.  However, they are good headphones with decent enough quality to play a wide range of music.  And I would agree with other reviews... I have never heard a non-powered headphone pair sound this LOUD when simply plugged into my iPod.I strongly recommend these headphones to anyone on a budget who is looking for a decent pair of comfortable, over the ear headphones.  Personally, I use them when I play the drums.  They cancel out enough of the noise from the drums and they're loud enough to still hear what you're playing (without spending over $300 on Studio headphones).

V### Updated 2 December 2013 ###There are absolutely better headphones available to enjoy music on, that should be obvious.  But someone with a budget, who can't spend more that a few bucks, isn't going to consider a $300 pair of cans when shopping around.  I'm going to be as objective as I can be and only review the Hesh based on its price range.  (even though reviews like these are very subjective)MY EXPERIENCE:  I've listened to music avidly since I was old enough to walk.  Oldies, soul, RnB, classic rock, funk, alternative, metal, hip-hop, punk, even classical on formats such as vinyl, cassette tape, CD, MP3 and telepathy based music (word).  I'm only 29, but I think I have a fair opinion on how each genre should sound when you hear it reproduced on audio equipment.  Professionally, I've been in a career for 7 years now that involves serious critical listening skills (transcription of foreign languages).  I won't bore you with the details, but almost every day I wear a high-end 2 lb headset for about 12 hours.  I also dabble in amateur home studio music production, and have learned much in the past years about mixing and mastering tracks on reference monitors and headphones (shouldn't mix on headphones though).  I hope that you will trust me with at least the technical aspects of this review.THE BUILD TYPE:  The Hesh is a pair of Closed Back Circumaural (around the ears) 50mm driver headphones.  The two main types of circumaural headphones are closed back and open (or semi-open).  Most likely, you won't be able to find a set of open-back headphones for under $50.  That shouldn't bother you though, since open-back headphones have an airy sound (a drier, tinny sound).  Most people who want to 'enjoy' their music will prefer a closed-back set, this allows for a typically deeper sound, with more natural bass.  The soundstage may become more cramped (because of the physical properties of the headset), but I would say people who are going for the Skullcandy are looking for a more exciting extraction of the music they listen to.  This is to say that the main demographic of Skullcandy consumers is probably those folks who want 'Beats by Dre' type sound but can't afford it.  You want bass, you want it in your face, and no less (whether its good for the music or not).  I get that, and hopefully Skullcandy gets that enough to include some quality in their production.THE BUILD QUALITY (4 out of 10): I've already seen a fair share of negative reviews criticizing the build quality of these cans.  Know one thing, something made of thin plastic is easier to break than something made of metal or wood.  It shouldn't take a genius to realize that its more affordable to build something out of plastic than other nicer materials.  The Hesh is made of cheap plastic, so it can be sold cheap.  Increase the material quality = increase the price, duh.  That being said, there are a few things to be realized.  I am a responsible adult when it comes to taking care of my electronics.  When I buy something that lacks durability, I treat it as such, and am careful with it.  Most Skullcandy users are probably the young crowd, teens or whatever.  A younger person can't be expected to be as responsible with their possessions, especially since their parents probably paid for it.  Parents, if you're complaining this headset falls apart after a short period of normal use, you should probably re-evaluate YOUR definition of 'normal use'.  A kid will probably break this headset before an adult does, this is just the nature of responsibility (in my opinion).  Continuing, here's what I think of the quality.  The worst offense, I'd say, is the ear-cushions.  They are very stiff right out of the box.  The first few hours/days of wear time will be somewhat uncomfortable until the stiffness loosens up.  I hope in time they will soften up, because I'm use to gel-filled pads with my work headphones, and soft leather ones with my studio reference cans.  The earcups are also somewhat on the small side.  I have a larger head, with medium size ears so I was a little surprised how small the earcups were when putting it on for the first time.  The head band is also cheaply made, with minimal cushioning against the head, but not completely awful.  Wear times longer than an hour or 2 could get pretty uncomfortable, and perhaps sweaty.  I don't think these headphones were made for very large heads either (like I was saying, more for teens) as the compression on my head is fairly tight.  The cable is shorter than would like it to be, its about the same length as my earbuds cable.  I would prefer at least 6 feet for circumaural cans, a cable as short as this one just makes the headphones feel more like a toy.  The build quality of the cable is also pretty cheap, and will probably be damaged by accidental crimping, tangles, tie-ups, etc.  To avoid this I just have to treat with care, like I plan to.  To summarize the build quality, I will just say two things you should expect: cheap plastic, stiff cushioning.(((UPDATE: The stiff earcushions are still a bother, and the smaller size of the earcups still lead to quick discomfort after listening for more than 30 minutes.  Nothing has broken or been damaged yet, but the uncomfortable build is still a major issue for me.)))THE LOOK (6 out of 10):  This brand (and market) of headphones is usually more about style than substance anyways.  Quality costs more, but looks cost almost nothing.  These are larger headphones, so wearing them may make you look goofy; but only as much as any pair of larger headphones you put on.  They look okay, and there are several flashy styles/colors to choose from.  If looks is more your thing, get Skullcandy.SOUND QUALITY (2 categories)1.  BURN IN-  10 minutes (5 out of 10): Right out of the box they sound like expected.  Unrefined across the  entire spectrum (w/IPOD).  But know that almost all headphones need a break in period (called the burn-in).  The burn-in period could be 24 hours of play-time or it could be 200 hours of play time.  It really depends.  At the  time of only 10-30 minutes of play time, I find it to be too strong in the low-mids and also  high-mids.  The bass at first seems to be attractive, but I realized after a few minutes that it was  actually the pumped up low-mids that sound like bass frequencies (they are just above the bass frequencies).  The chief problem with boosted low mids (or any part of the mid frequencies) is the problem of listening  fatigue.  Some headphones are so well balanced in sound that you could listen all day and your ears won't  be tired or worn out.  I already listen to headphones all day professionally, so listening fatigue is extra  irritating to me.  The last thing I want while listening to my music is a headache from boosted dB in any  part of the frequency spectrum.  It just shouldn't be there, but at $50 or this kind of deficiency should  be anticipated.  You should also know that at this point I've only tried these on an IPOD, which I'll go  over soon.  My opinion at 10 minutes of burn-in: Almost poor.  It needs more time to break in, then I'll  re-evaluate it.  24 hours (combined playtime): Not much difference...  3 months : Unless the source of music is EQ'd before reaching the headphones, the sound is going to be less than satisfying.  Plugging them into a non-EQ'd source (even a high end one), you hear the sound flaws of the headphones.  I don't think these headphones have aged very well after break in.2.  FORMATS:  IPOD (6 out of 10)- Most customers of the Hesh will probably use it primarily for the IPOD.  EVERYONE should realize the problem with listening to an IPOD with any kind of headphones: The audio source  quality is just as important as the headphones thru which you listen to it.  If you plug a set of $300  headphones into an IPOD, do NOT be surprised if it sounds just as crappy as a $20 pair of headphones.  The IPOD, while it is a great readily available media for playing music on the go, is not made for the  HI-FI and audiophiles market.  You MUST expect a lower quality of audio when plugged into it, and should NOT  be surprised when your music sounds like junk listening to it thru any set of cans.  This problem is  exacerbated when you listen to a lossy compressed audio file (usually an issue only with MP3).  To truly  evaluate the headphones, without unfocused or unknowledgable bias, I have to check the IPOD against other  formats.  As a tip, if you're going to listen to music on the IPOD with these, select R & B or Classical as  the EQ setting.  I find either one of those settings covers most music genres nicely, and makes them more  pleasant to listen to.  Bottom line, the IPOD is far from the most ideal listening source, when it comes to  audio fidelity.  (((UPDATE: While I don't think the IPOD is a Hi-Fi level source, listening to music with the EQ setting on R&B;  seems to sound pretty good.  I switched out between listening to a un-EQ'd vinyl record thru a Marantz receiver  and the IPOD, and the IPOD sounded better.  I think it was because of the EQ setting.))  Laptop (6 out of 10) - Not much better than the IPOD, with one exception: I can control a 10  band eq with most audio programs I use.  The key to using the EQ is you want to subtract the right  frequencies rather than boost anything.  This will help to avoid listening fatigue, which if you don't  know by now I HATE.  If in any program (such as ITUNES) try these settings: Boost 32hz and 64hz 3 dB,  cut 125hz and 1khz by 3 dB, boost 250hz and 500hz by 1 and 2 dB, respectively.  Boost 2khz and  4khz by 1-2 dB.  Boost 8khz by 2-3 decibels and leave 16khz alone.  This might help bring better  sound out of the headphones even if only marginally.  DAC - ((updated)) My recording interface is a USB Roland Octacapture.  Essentially it is a digital to  analogue converter.  I only listened to a few things thru this with the Hesh, so I can't properly evaluate  it.  But it seems like it would sound okay thru this, but just for listening to music or playing video  games.  It'd be horrible for doing any audio work (like mastering a track).  Headphone Amp - ((updated)) I didn't end up getting one, but I still highly recommend it, especially a  tube headphone amp.  It helps balance out impedance problems in the signal chain.  I'm sure the impedance  is low on these though, I haven't checked in a while.  Low impedance headphones are easier for amps to  drive.  Stereo system - ((updated)) I have a Marantz SR7005 surround sound A/V reciever system at home.  When I  tried the headphone output while listening to a vinyl record player thru a high-end preamp, it sounded  pretty terrible.  It lacked clarity, the bass sounded really muddy, and I couldn't believe the mess being  made in the mids.Thanks for reading folks, this is the final draft of this review.  I sold the Hesh at a garage sale late last year.  I'm very happy to be rid of it, but that's ONLY because I can afford better headphones.  I've owned Denon AH-D5000 headphones this whole time as well, so consider my bias for expensive gear into this review.  I know the Skullcandy Hesh is a cheap piece of plastic to most, especially me.  But its not made for HI-FI snobs, its made for the affordable crowd who want a flashy pair of cans with pumped up bass, even if the listening spectrum is badly unfocused.  If $50 or less is your budget, I say go ahead and try them out.  But be prepared to give them time to adjust to being played, treat them with care, and plug them into a good audio source ((or use R&B; eq setting on IPOD)).  But I would look at other brands/models first before getting these.  And stay FAR away from Beats By Dre or any other similar knockoffs (Ludacris makes some).  They are truly the epitome of overcharging for garbage quality.  There is too much snake oil in the audio equipment world, don't be the one to buy in to it.

VI Love These Headphones
p25
sg5
VI'm used to using the separate headphones where you rotate this awkward piece of plastic behind your ear because those are cheap, but I decided to buckle down and get some nice over-the-ear headphones because the original ones I'm referring to never seem close enough to my ears. I love the style and color; I feel like Skullycandy is all about expression. I read the reviews before my purchase and I took note that these leak sound (which is unusual considering the style), but I truly don't mind. I usually only wear headphones when I'm walking outside or at home, not in public places anyway. This product also comes with a pouch which is really neat; I just store these and my iPod in there so I always know where they are. I also love how the cord doesn't get tangled and ruined like most headphones! Whatever material they used for the cord is ingenious.

VI got these for my daughter's 14th birthday and they have been a huge hit. She was using the cheap iPhone earbuds that Apple provides and even tried some of the noise isolating earbuds (cheap ones).  She kept losing and/or breaking earbuds or the rubber pieces that actually seal them into your ears.  My daughter is really into fashion.  So, when she saw the Paul Frank monkey headphones, she wanted them.  She's not really concerned about sound quality or even how sturdy they are.  But, I was.  After reading several reviews, I was a little concerned about how sturdiness.  After having had them for a week, the quality seems to be decent.  They aren't exactly built like a Mack truck.  But, I think if cared for properly they will hold up.  The cord seems to be pretty decent quality.  The sound is really good.  Definitely as good as I would expect for the money paid.  One knock on them is the plastic used for the cushions on the cans doesn't breathe at all.  So, your ears can get very hot and sweaty very quickly in these.  The look is very cartoonish.  But, it's perfect for a teenager or a pre-teen. She gets lots of compliments on them.  Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.

VI bought these cuz i broke a cheap $10 set and i thought they were really big when i first got them. It was only because i wasn't used to these type of headphone,but that was easily forgotten with how great they sound. They came with a pretty nice little bag with the logo all over it and a sticker!Anyways, the point is the moment i plugged them in i had to reduce the volume on my laptop. I had everything set to the lowest volume and could hear just fine. they feel kinda stiff at the band that goes on top of your head,but i'm careful with my stuff,so it should last.~great sound~muffles a good amount~great for guitar practice~gets a little tiring on the ears,but you can get used to it~great design~be careful with the adjusting band and it'll last you

VComfortable, Good Sound Quality, Would Recommend
p55
sg5
VI bought these headphones 2 months ago, and so far, I love them! First and foremost, the sound quality is good. The only setback is that the bass is not as strong as I would like, but I prefer a lot of bass, so these would be perfectly fine for the average listener. I listen to pretty much every type of music, and everything sounds great. The design is comfortable, I've worn them for hours on end without any problem. The speakers fit over my ear, unlike other over the head headphones I have tried, and they have a snug fit without that "crushing" feeling some headphones create. Before I bought them, I read many reviews where people commented that the headband had broken, but I have had no issue with this. They have been extremely durable, I have taken them on many trips, and have had no issue. Sound isolation isn't the best, but this is not a huge issue for me. In a loud place, such as on a bus or train, sound isolation is not a problem at all. The only time I have had any issue is in a car or quiet building. Overall, I am very glad I made this purchase, and I am currently looking at buying some lowriders, which would be less bulky to travel with. But these will still get plenty of use, and I got them for a great price compared to some other brands!

VThese headphones can play really good sound. I have had them for a couple months now and they are still serving me great. they are big and soft and comfortable and can play really loud without people around you being able to hear it.

VI was pretty hesitant to buy this but once i got it, i loved it. Yes, it is true that this headphones are not very comfortable and feels like a burden on head after extended use, bu, it is worth for the amount of money spent. The sound quality is great, bass effects and beats are pretty good, better than the ipod ear phones. To avoid the disadvantage i mentioned, i keep on switching between my ipod earphones and skullcandys at some intervals. Also, one big turn on is the look. It looks SEXYYYY..It also comes with a small skull sticker(Rasta) which i stuck to my ipod case on the back :) ;) Makes it look FUNKYYIt is a good buy, i find it better than any other skullcandys especially skullcrusher and GI.

VThese are definitely great headphones, at least in my opinion. They are comfortable, the noise cancellation is great, they look nice, and everything else about them is nice as well. I honestly don't understand why everyone dislikes this brand, their headphones have never broke soon after I got them, as the reason why I've had to buy them over and over again is because I keep losing the earbuds, which is simply my own fault. I use these as DJ headphones (I've just begun DJ'ing, and this is currently all I can afford), which means I'm not sure how they would work outside (if they could be damaged in the rain, for example). I assume that they would work just fine because of their durability overall. The art work is very nice, especially on the over-the-head part. The ears are comfortable, canceling all noise around me. Overall, these are definitely worth the price and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a cheap, but reliable pair of over-the-head headphones.

VHesh Headphones
p120
sg5
VLet me first state that I am a Radio DJ and an audiophile. I know how good headphones sound and I know how bad headphones sound. Normally low-budget headphones provide decent sound quality. After owning a few pairs of different Skull Candy headphones, I can honstly say that they are all just gimmicks. The 2011 Hesh headphones sound terrible. They sound extremely flat and the bass is virtually unnoticable.  As I just stated, I know how bad headphones sound and for Skull Candy to market these as premium headphones with 50mm drivers is complete BS. I have listened to a complete multitude list of songs and albums set at different kbps and genre and each song sounded terrible with these headphones. A cheap pair of Sony headphones sound way better than any Skull Candy product.The only genre that sounded better than Apple earbuds was Rap/Pop/Dance/Electric. Rock music sounds awful with these. So if you generally don't care and want to look cool, by all means waste your money on Hesh.For similarly priced headphones I would recommend Sennheiser HD 202  II Professional Headphones (Black) for these have the best overall sound for entry level over-ear headphones. Trust me, AVOID SKULL CANDY!!

Great look and a great buy. The only thing that bother me about the headphone was the material that it is made out of.  One week after I got them, the blue cover to the speakers came apart. Haven't yet tried to figure out a way to fix it but overall, the product is a great buy if you can keep it from falling apart.

VI don't know why so many people hate these things. They are good cans with comfortable, soft leather ear covers. My only complaint is that THESE THINGS LEAK. I'm not worried about my cans leaking, but if you need private headphones, these aren't for you. But if you're like me, these are good headphones, with nice clean bass especialy for hip-hop/rap. I ordered them late wednesday night and they were here friday morning. Great buy, I deffinately recomend them.

VThese headphones are great!  They are probably the best headphones for $32.  The bass is great and the sound is definitely comparable to beats by dre.  Just make sure to take care of them or they will snap.  There is one flaw though.  The only problem is that if you are listening to these headphones for about 1 1/2 hours-2 hours then your ears will get sore.  Other than that, best headphones I've listened to for the price:)

VThis is my second pair of Skullcandy Hesh Headphones. The last pair suffered from cheap construction as well as this one does, but for $50, you can't beat the sound, and the comfort. This aren't noise canceling headphones, they amplify, if you listen loud enough, others can hear what you're listening to. Other than that, my second pair, will see if they last six months, good computer mixer sound as well.

VI bought these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. He stated the sound quality is great and it blocks out external noise.  He really likes the cloth cord as it does not tangle or knot up like the plastic cords. His favorite part is the 'Rastas' theme as it reminds him of  his trip to the islands.

VI love these head phones! Their so stylish and compared to my last earbuds, have amazing sound and are comfy!PROS:Pretty comfortable, i bought them on sale so for 35 bucks they have amazing sound! The noise blocking is pretty good, it depends on how close you are and how loud it is and stuff but its good. I LOVE THE CORD! Its amazing! It never gets tangled, and also makes for a nice toy to play with when im bored in the car! The padding on the sides and top is very nice too.CONS:Well along with style, they dont look the best sitting on the top of your head cause they look kinda flat. Its hard to explain but they dont look super awesome if you wear them normally. but who really cares. Umm it does leak sound, but its not bad. as long as you dont have your music blaring its okay. and again it also depends on how close someone is to it for them to be able to hear it. The only other thing is they kinda suction to your ears and it gives me a little headache after a while.But overall these headphones were worth all the money! Annnnd as a plus it comes with a carrying bag and a skull candy "Skull" cut-out! I put mine on my laptop:)Hope this was useful! It was also my first review! ^,^

VI received my black and blue pair of SkullCandy Mesh headphones a couple weeks ago and I have to say I love these headphones! I'm a college student who is almost always on his laptop (I use it for music, my tv shows, soccer matches, and sometimes hw) and these headphones seem to excel with whatever I am doing. I was worried that the large amount of bass these headphone promise would take away from the clarity of them, but that is absolutely not the case. These headphones are comfortable also, I only seem to have discomfort with them when I wear them for a couple hours consecutively and am also wearing my glasses, but a simple readjustment should fix that. The thing that stands out to me most is how alive the crowd sounds when I'm watching a soccer match, it's amazing. My roommate often watches hockey on his laptop, and he often borrows my headphones to do so when I'm not using them because it makes the sounds of the ice really come alive! This is an overall great pair of headphones, and I would definitely recommend purchasing them, because like I said before, they aren't just good for music, they're good for any kind of listening.

VI was a little skeptic when I ordered these.  There weren't many reviews on these or the over NBA themed headphones.  But I have to say I am very satisfied with these headphones! The sound quality is great and they look cool!  The only little thing is they don't fit over the ears that well (my ears are average) which can be a little uncomfortable after wearing them for a while but it's not major at all.  Overall a great product I definitely recommend these!Update:Ive had these for a few months now and they still work great.  Although one of the side adjusters recently broke.  I didn't drop them or anything I was simply adjusting them when it cracked.  I was able to fix it with some duct tape and some plastic to act as a splint.  If you get these just be careful with use the plastic on the adjusters isn't that strong.

VFirst of all, all you audiofiles out there are dumb as hell nobody cares if these headphones aren't as good as your 300-400 dollar headphones! And if they break, CHILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Skullcandy has got your back and will replace them...for life...free of charge. As far as sound quaility these headphones are pretty good. I listen to music...A LOT. And I listen to almost every genre, but I mostly listen to John Mayer,Maroon 5,Dave Matthews Band, etc.. And these headphones work excellent. Although they are not listed as sound cancelling they do offer some sound cancelling properties with music playing. As for appereance these could look better I think. They looked good in the picture, but the ears are pretty big, and you can look a little goofy. They do sit on your head good and they will stay there! I warm up for wrestling in these and they stay on good through that. The cord isn't too long and having the cord go to only one ear is nice. BUT you can't wear them around your neck very well. And they don't have swivel cups.Overall I would give these headphones a 4 out of 5. But if you are buying these on amazon I would recommend the Skullcandy Skullcrushers, although they do require a battery I found the sound cancelling properties better. Also they had better overall sound quality. They are much easier to carry around and the bass is much better. Also they have swivel cups.

VThese headphones were, let's just say, adequate. When I first got them I was super excited because they were my first headphones that were over $30 (assuming that more money meant higher quality,) and all of my friends had recommended them to me. When I first put them on, I was sad to say that I was not very impressed. The only difference between the sound of these and some regular $10 ear buds that you could buy in a vending machine was that the bass was brought out a BIT more. Besides that, almost no difference. Even after a 24 hour burn-in period I noticed almost no difference. I must admit, I was a bit disappointed. However, I can admit that the comfort of these were alright, I could wear them for hours with no discomfort. The main problem with these though, is that they break very easily. When I say this, I mean that they break after a period of time. I had these for 5 months with no problem, but then one day I noticed a slight crack, and then it went downhill from there. After that, I counted 7 more breaks in the next 2 weeks (by now, they were pretty much just big duct tape headphones.) My last complaint would be the price. Seriously, $50 for these? I think now they MIGHT be worth $30... maybe. With all of these factors considered, it's safe to say that these were certainly not worth the money that was spent. You can easily find higher quality headphones for $50.

VGood for closing on the job. they cancel out well if you turn them up loud. But I have six holes in my ears and these headphones are pretty tight right out of the box. Uncomfortable. And if you're over six foot tall or have a bigger than average head size, you're probably not going to like these. Carrying bag you get with these is a nice touch, keeps them safe inside a bookbag or duffle bag.But all in all: They are too tight, especially if you have earrings. The cord is braided, but is very short. The sound is good, but not fifty dollars good.

Cord is a good length, and I like how it's wrapped in cloth material. Good choice for headphones.

VI bought these looking for a medium grade set of headphones for until i could afford a high quality set. They live up to the skullcandy name of being sound quality when compared with the price. These did not blow me away. They are simply an adequate set of headphones.In terms of comfort, I can wear them for an hour or two before getting uncomfortable. The foam does not squeeze but they are firm. It has the feel of a lower grade headphone in this area but no actual complaints.One issue Skullcandy is known for is how you have to go through their headphones like, well, candy. But they have started a life-time warranty that made me comfortable enough to buy a somewhat more expensive pair anyways. The cord is wrapped in a cloth to add strength, and they feel sturdier than i was expecting. I have had them for about five months and they have lasted, which is a pleasure.Sound is kind of an issue. The bass is impressive for a pair of their size. They have a clear treble. However, one thing I noticed is that it seems like the sound is obviously coming from the left and right (I know this sounds obvious but bear with me). Most headphones will have the effect or feel of the sound being centered in your head, but these seem like the sound is coming far from you in either direction, possibly from behind. This effect is strong enough where it irritates me but it could just be the way they fit on my head, or it could just be my imagination. I don't know.Overall they are what Skullcandy usually is: Better quality than their price indicates. The $40 I paid for them was a good price. I wouldn't pay more for them, and anything less would have been a very good bargain. A very adequate set of headphones.

VI will start off by saying these headphones arent bad, just not the greatest. Right out of the box you will notice they are rather "creaky" and feel a little cheap, however I am not too worried as they dont really feel delicate, just plasticy. Mine has a cloth cord, which I like a lot, it feels tough and its unique. The packaging was a huge pain to get into, they seal it everywhere possible, so you really have to hack it up to get the headphones out. Upon first putting them on, they feel a bit tight and almost stretched out to fit over my head. They do make your ears very warm (to the point of sweat) and for me they get uncomfortable to wear after only about 20 minutes due to them being very snug. Because of this I wouldnt recommend these for gaming sessions or media editing.Getting to the sound; at first they sound "in your face", deep bass and loud. I have read that headphones need a "burn in" period, which is basically a break in period, and that headphones will sound better after several hours of playtime. I began to notice improvement in overall sound after about 3 hours of use, vocals sounded cleaner and everything was more balanced. Going into specific genres now, we'll start with metal and rock. The vocals sound a little overpowered here and dont really stand out against the music. Also metal can become rather fatiguing to listen to as these headphones make it very boomy/thumpy. For metal and rock, I would rate them a disappointed 2/5. Next some bass heavy dub, which sounds good on these, any vocals come through nicely I dont really have any complaints there as I think these headphones were meant for bass heavy tunes, so a 4/5 on that. Now trance/dance music featuring crisp vocals; the vocals could be better and the again the beat of the music tends to compete with the vocals which are supposed to be the focus, but they do sound pretty good here, I give them a 3/5 almost a 4 but not quite.Bottom line: based on the price (not comparing these to top of the line headphones), sound quality is an overall 4/5, but the comfort and build quality/fit are at a 2/5 so I give these headphones a 3/5 total rating. In my opinion they look very goofy while worn, they do have some cool designs though. The way they are marketed makes them come across as more of a toy or fashion statement than anything else. Understand that these are marketed for teens mainly, so thats why they arent the best for adults, like myself, in terms of fit. For the price of them they are not bad, but I would suggest going with something else as there are so many other brands of headphones for around 50 bucks.

VFor me, when a head phone costs more than $50, it better be good. I bought these at the store for $50 after my other headphones broke. I like these big ones, but they are kind of hard to find in stores. Its mainly just ear-buds they sell, which i don't like.I bought that and Sony MDR-ZX100 Headphone for $20, so i spent about $70 on both headphones. Anyway, I tried Candy first, because they were bigger. I was disappointed that it didn't come with a audio enhancer on the cord. My other pair (that broke), for $30 came with this feature (they lasted about 5 years or so). I put them on, and they fit my head very well, and your ears just slide right in.I turned it on (my MP3 player), and noticed it sounded different than my other ones. It sounded lower quality than the one i replaced it with, so i fiddled with the custom setting on my mp3 player, ect. It still sounds off to me, like the songs are low Q or something. If it makes any sense, it sounded like a triangle in terms of how the music is distributed. The lower stuff, guitars, ect, come out on both ends of the head phone and sound further apart (stereo), and to me, more balanced, but the vocals and drums are at the top, and sound like they are more mono, like a focal point, which bugs me. I guess if you like this set up get it, but the other headphone i bought, Sony MDR-ZX100, are square, as in, it doesn't sound mono, and everything is stereo and balanced, rather than having a middle-like focal point.The cord is short, but very light, it looks like a string, which is nice. It doesn't look like it will tangle or knot easily. It should have came with a sound enhancer for $50. IIRC, the one that does come with a sound enhancer is like $70 or something crazy.It comes with a stupid sack case thing, and a stupid sketch thing, just to raise up the price probably, I could have lived without both. These will be my backup head phones, and Sony's will be the main stage for now.TL;DR[-]Overpriced[-]Doesn't come with a sound enhancer[-]One cord coming out of the left side[-]Comes with a stupid carrying case[-]Drums and Vocals sound mono (like a focal point or something)[-]Other instruments sound stereo[-] I like the design with the skull[-]Short cord[-]Cord isn't heavy or bulky, but very thin, string-like[-]feels cheap[-]Light (as in, not heavy)Overall, its ok. It comes down too, if you like the focal pointing or the drums and vocals sounding mono or not. Not bad, i like a few thing, but the focal point kills me. Also, its very expensive, and doesn't come with a sound enhancer.

p270

VIve already used these headphones for a week now, it really works well on music, but it sounds even better if you use your EQ on your ipod or your portable music device, it helps the headphones adjust to what you want them to sound like Rock,Electronic,Dubstep,Techno,Alternative,Country you name it these headphones work like a charm. My only problem seems to be the noise cancellation a bit, i can still hear a little bit, but that is only if i focus on that. I have not had these headphones break on me so far and they seem to work like a charm. It feels like i am a DJ and the sound is kept within my ears only, plus i can feel the bass on Dubstep and the sounds the way they were sopposed to be without the earbuds these are excellent. Plus for the price they are C+ headphones, meaning they are above average quality for a cheaper price than what they use to cost(60$), buy with confidence. One last thing be gentle with your headphones when sliding them down, because i keep noticing by the reviews that they say the Skullcandy headphones will break, but i bet that is because they put to much force adjusting the sides to their ears.August 2011-------------My Skullcandy broke sadly i accidently sat on the side of it, i had good times with this one, and i learned that these headphones are good but not great. I recently baught Sennheiser HD 202  II Professional Headphones (Black) I hate to say it but Skullcsndy looks good but is decent at best, but Sennheiser is a relieble brand like Bose,Koss, in which it can deliver on Dubstep,Bass and all of that plus it has good noise cancellation which Skullcandy barely had it. It is 20$ right now with HD type headphones, and i am liking it right now as i baught it, to me it is a steal. This is only an alternative if you do not want to pay the price for Skullcandy and want something that is cheaper and better.

VThese are great headphones, The over-the-head strap is comfortable (there's some kind of padding in it). I like how the cable only comes out of one of the sides.The cable itself is covered in some sort of fabric, so it is tough, and also flexible. The cable will never retain its shape, which is good. You should never have to worry about this cord getting tangled. The cable is only 3ft long, so you're a little limited there, but I have never had an issue with the length (except when I try to get up from my desk forgetting that I'm still wearing the headphones).The ear pieces are a good fit. There is sufficient padding around the ears so you shouldn't have to worry about them being painful. They are sufficient large enough to completely go around my ears and make a good seal.Sound. The sound quality is good. They are quite loud, and I have never noticed any issues with the sound. However, the domes on the outside tend to pick up external noise. So for example, wind is easily picked up by these phones. So if I'm wearing these outside on a windy day, the wind will be amplified in my ears by these domes. This is one of my annoyances with this product.The other annoyance is the fabric. I feel like the fabric that covers the ear padding as well as the over-the-head padding seems like it might be the kind of fabric that will deteriorate over time, or that it will crack.Overall: Good headphones, good sound, good fit, not the best for cancelling external noise, fabric doesn't seem reliable.Recommendation: Go for it, I love these!

I must admit I really brought these headphones because of the awesome design and I have heard some good words for the actual sound quality which was quite promising and true.Although the setbacks that made me think "Why didn't I read a review like this one" was that upon sleeping in my SOFT bed full of PILLOWS with the headphones on I woke up in the morning to realise the frame supporting the two earmuffs together had suffered a gut wrenching crack. The headphones are still usable and it isn't much of a problem, but if I were to accidentally bend the frame any more it would surely snap. Now you could probably point the finger at me and say I could of rolled around too vigorously at night which would of snapped it, but I have read quite a few articles online by a simply Google search to use as my evidence of a poor quality frame. The major problem I see here is that Skull Candy is a well known brand and should live up to its expectations, in Australia you have to pay about $135 dollars at the local skate shop for these, I'm just glad I got them for an awesome price at Amazon.Now my half hast attempt is to try warranty them at Skull Candy Australia, if I get rejected it won't be a big deal. Now if I were to have brought them from the local skate shop here I would of surely had to tie a slipknot out of the audio lead and kick the chair.

VDon't Expect Headphones 2 Last Much More Than A Month
p305

VMy mom brought me to the mall the weekend before my birthday since y birthday was the second Monday of school & I couldn't have a real birthday party & I told her I wanted Dr. Dre headphones but then we found these awesome headphones & since they were cheaper than the Dr. Dre ones & more cool looking she got me those instead & now just yeaterday I noticed once I got on the bus that 1 of the speaker things was loose but figured it'd be fine so i continued to use them for thr next few hours but 2 or 3 hours later the speaker thing came almost completely off only dangling from the cord. I don't use them roughly or anything, I a very careful with my stuff, in particular any thing that was given as any kind of present 9especially if it's as awesome as these headphones. These are sound canceling and even have some sort of blue tooth in them so u can talk on the phone for ages without having to unplug them and putting ur ohne 2 ur ear. They are extremely comfortable and fashionable looking even come w/ a bag that I find a waste of money, since I only ever used it for about a week and got sick of it & now only plan on using it when I pack my headphones for a trip or something. Anyway I went to a cousin's place and she was able to glue the speaker thing back on & said I had to wait 24 hours to use them again so I am going 2 try them out & see how it goes, hopefully I wont have 2 buy a new pair of these. :(

VBest Budget Headphones On The Market
p310
sg5
VI have owned these headphones for nearly a year now and thought I could finally put my opinion on them for the public. My initial impression of these headphones was "these headphones have way less bass response than say, my pair of beats" - which I no longer own. They do, and if subwoofer range bass is your cup of tea, then a pair of overpriced beats may be the headphones for you. These headphones are very balanced in their approach. Discerning ears may be able to hear or notice that they may have too much treble response, which can sometimes be slightly shrill, but in this price range - there is some legitimate give and take as to what you get. These headphones are extremely durable - my dog got ahold of them one day and pulled the ear piece off the headphone itself and it slipped right back on a lot easier than I expected. I travel with them quite often and they are in my suitcase and they have held up to the test of time. I took a full star off due to the treble being slightly shrill at times and the fact that if you are a warm blooded person they can heat up your ears and cause some uncomfortable experiences. As I said, I sold my beats headphones after finding these. I am sure there are better headphones out there (Sennheisers, etc) - but as far as performance, stylish design and everyday wear and tear - these are practically unbeatable in this price range.

VThese headphones quite simply are ok. They're not great nor are they terrible.{SOUND}I listen to a lot of dubstep and with dubstep there is a lot of jump between deep bass and high highs and everything in between. The highs are pretty good as well as the bass, but the mids aren't very good at all high mids are very prominent while the low mids have trouble coming through. Overall the sound is ok.{FEEL}As a person with a very large head and very large ears it is hard for me to get good headphones, though these fit very well. My fit inside of the cups even though they look very small. There is also plenty of room if you have a big head. I usually have to pull headphones all of the way out to fit my head, but I'm about to notches in on each side and they fit great. They have a thin mesh, nylonish head band with surprisingly feels pretty nice. The general construction feels solid with nice soft, rubberized plastic through out.{LOOK}If you're buying skullcandy headphones this probably matters to you and they look pretty good!

VReally great headphones, at least for the sound quality
p332
sg5
VI had bought these with the intention of having great sound and pretty good bass (albeit they aren't to the point where they meet how much Beats can withstand bass, but if you're not a major bass head it's ok). When I first got them they were extremely adjustable, but no matter how much you try to keep these adjusting sides with care, they will ALWAYS break. I guess it's because of some cheap design flaw, but I overcame it because i was able to use these headphones one the very last notch, subsequently meaning i had to duct tape both sides of the headphones (the left side broke first then the right side). Ironically, this headphones performance has not diminished because of this. I say that because the wires run though the inside of the headphone extenders and the headband itself connecting both earpieces. You can even use these with your gaming system and hear crystal clear audio, even the own footsteps you and anyone else make. Overall I have to say these are some really nice headphones, design and all. Oh and the little bag it comes with for these things is so nice too.

Vokay so i'm going to break this review into parts to make it easier to figure out what im talking about. I am rating them in comfort, style, and sound. each rating i give is one out of 5 starsComfort:****I gave this four stars because despite other peoples comments on this i thought they were coftrable. They fit over my ears perfectly and the headband is the perfect size for my head. I gave this four stars though because i've read from other reviews that the earpieces are too small to fit over most peoples ears, and i do have rather small ears so they might not fit over most peoples ears.Style:**so i gave these headphones two stars for style because they are huge and they will make you look rather dorky. They are also a lot bigger then i expected, but style doesnt matter much to me since i only listen to music with my headphones at home.I would have gave style one star if it wasnt for the cord the cord doesnt tangle and is really cool.Sound:****the sound overall i would give a four because after listening to music with them for awhile i have found they make my ears tired like i dont want to listen to things it might just be my pair though.The sound overall is very nice and smooth. I have found after listening to songs i like i have found new parts i hadnt heard before while using other headphons keep in mind though that i usually use a cheap pair of $15 headphones. Another thing to consider though is that they leak sound. They are also very loud for a pair of heaphones they are about as loud as my old headphones at were when i turn the volume to medium but if you really like loud and turn it up to full volume it has a bit of base which is an interesting thing ive never found while listening to other over the ear headphones.Are they worth the price?:Despite the few problems I found with these headphones I think they are well worth the price. I truly belive that you wont find a better sounding pair of headphones for this price. And if mine do happen to break i will definetly be using my warrenty and getting annother pair. Point of mentioning skullcandy has a lifetime warrenty on these headphones so if its a problem with manufacturing they will give you a full refund and if you break it they give you 50% back on them.so In conclution I think these are worth the price and you should definetly buy them.update:1-2-13 ive had these headphones for quite awhile now and they are still working which is amazing :) none of my headphones have ever lasted this long.

VI just received these in the mail today-safe to say this was a pleasant surprise to come home to. Anyways so i checked out the reviews and i must say i was amazed. before buying these i read all types of reviews from amazon to best buy to skullcandy itself and upon trying them myself i give it a solid 5 stars the quality of the sound is great the bass is clear and on point the drops you hear them wetter than rain. the durability appears solid as they are well manufactured and so long as you take care of them they shall last you- but then again all electronics are that way no?So i'll finish with this; if your on the fence about purchasing this product cause of the few bad reviews or on the fence in general i say GO FOR IT!! any fan should have this as its a great way to support as well as listen to your favorite jams. lastly these are $60 headphones available for 30-35 thats a steal in my opinion!

Vgood sound, not comfortable
p356
sg5
VExcellent sound - comparable to the quality of my Bose AE2's with a very high efficiency (volume produced for the input given - as loud as I have ever seen any headphone produce). They are heavy and they bother my ears after about 40 mins. I have a large head but tiny ears and the design of the cups just does not work for me. The cups are not large enough to go all the way around my ears so they apply pressure to either the pinna or the lobes. The padding on them is not soft enough to compensate for the pressure they apply on my ears and the discomfort gets to me after a while. The headband is somewhat bendable and you can reduce the pressure they apply to your ears to some extent but it is still not enough. I like the sound enough that I have been wearing them several times a week for the last 3 months and unfortunately they have not gotten any more comfortable with breaking in.

p361
sg5
VI recently picked these up in the store and so far they are almost just like the Turtle Beach X11's (Minus the stupidly long cord X11's have, and it doesn't have a mic). The cord is about 30" (30 inches), but the Turtle Beach X11's is like 14' (14 feet). The braided cable is a nice touch, it is also on most Razer headsets. The surround sound is awesome, I would say it is exactly like the X11's. The bass and treble is great, plus a good bass makes the shots echo in-game (I love that :P) the surround sound is great for spotting enemies. It is a great headset for the price! (I got it for $60 at the store, the 2nd version is $70) Fairly good noise cancellation, would without-a-doubt recommend to anyone looking for a good gaming and music headset!P.S. Has one audio plug, fits every cell phone, laptop, and MP3 player ;)

VGreat Pair of Headphones for the Price
p366
sg5
VI found this pear of headphones elsewhere, and decided to write a review here for the community. Highs are very good, lows are enjoyable and the overall build quality is good. This is the first generation, so they do feel a bit plastic-y, but not so much that you feel like they will break at any moment. They isolate outside noise very well only when the music is high, but that is usually not a problem for me. The leather cushions add for an extra luxurious feel and are very comfortable to wear, partly because the top of the headphones is also padded. The leather has its downside as well: your ears will warm up after about 30 minutes of constant use. The cord is of appropriate length and doesn't limit your mobility. If you're on a budget, this pair of headphones is still a very good buy, even if they are a bit outdated.

VMy opinion and overview....I  believe the average person will find these comfortable, but for me, sadly, they are not.It seems that if the cups were constructed just a little bigger in circumference,  my ears would fit inside allot more comfortably.  I would advise trying em for a couple hours or days before throwing away the packaging..I will be returning them for that reason :(.other than that Id say these phones are a great buy and if you like rap, dance, or anything with bass, these go hard !!If you want a great set of cans, then forget buying those 20 dollar pair and invest some more $ in these, you be happy with the sound, and  Skull candy has that lifetime warranty, so your set. You'll waste more $ replacing those cheapo's besides the sound quality is levels above .

VI was thinking about getting these headphones for a while. I had owned many pairs of skullcandy headphones and they had usually lasted me a long time. I wanted to upgrade to a pair of studio-like over ear headphones and it came down to the skullcandies and the beats by dre. Although the quality is lower than the beats in both sound and comfort, these headphones do a great job for a great price. The Beats are better than these, however they are not superior enough to justify the price. If your looking for a solid pair of headphones all around, then these are for you. They are light weight, sturdy, and block out sound (great for buses, trains, crowded areas). Little discomfort on ears due to them pushing on your ears, but you will break them in. Like I said for the price, you can't go wrong.

VSkull Candy Hesh Scattered review
p388
sg5
VPros:- Good sound quality- Looks really sexy ^_^- They're simply amazing headphones. I'm really satisfied with my purchase.Cons:- All of my skull candy products (3 earphones) have broken within a few months. So I'm hoping this won't happen to these headphones. Unfortunately, people have said they're very fragile and break/won't work easily.. So I'm just putting this up here as a warning. Mine are fine, though.- Very LITTLE sound leak. If you put the sound quite loud in a rather quiet environment, you'll be able to hear your music.But this is not really important to me. It is for most people. So I'm guessing this would be a con. This is probably due to the cheap plasticky sides of the headphones.Overall: I love them and I recommend them to music lovers. :)

VOverall, the sound of these headphones is top-notch for the price range, although the highs are a bit muddied VS the lows. Nonetheless, sonically, I'm impressed for what I paid.However, these headphones HURT. I'm a skinny guy, 25 years old, normal sized head and ears, and these things make me feel like I'm wearing a vice on my face. If you wear glasses, don't get these at all unless you've been dying to discover new pressure points behind your ears. They squeeze really hard all things considered, and the earcups are deceptively small so you have to actually wrap the cushions around your ears in several steps to actually make them fit on your head.Overall, great sound, really really uncomfortable for someone who has an adult-sized head.

VI was actually inspired to get these headphones after purchasing a pair of Skullcandy Skullcrushers.  Those were a quality purchase and these headphones didn't disappoint either.  There isn't a person I give these to that doesn't believe they are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent.  One unique attribute of these headphones is that the audio cord is wrapped in nylon instead of rubber.  They come with a nice carrying bag for travel and the every component of the headphones is sturdy.  The designs on the earphones are attractive as well.These headphones are definitely a deal for the money and I can see myself buying many more pairs in the future.

VFirst of all, these are Skullcandy and they do sound good. The bass sound is excellent , but the overall sound isn't loud enough. They make me want to increase the gain on every Mp3 I own. Now, just hold on a second, because these are fairly loud. My ears aren't ringing after listening to music through theses headphones. I bought these used and I always expect some problems, but I had to completely rewire these headphones. The headphones started making fluttering sounds and I know they were shorting out. They now work just as good as new. These headphones are just okay and don't regret buying them, I just wish they were about 3 notches louder.

It is not over-powering like the Skullcrushers, or many other, more expensive, headphones. And these headphones actually grow softer with use.  When I first bought them, I thought that the padding was a little hard, but after owning them for 2-3 months, I must say they beat my old Sony MDR-NC7 headphones in terms of sound quality. Definitely one of the top choices for a pair of headphones under $100. I definitely recommended them!

VI have to say, they're just okay. They don't fit over my ears quite the way I'd like, and they were a tiny bit small for my head. So for those people who have large heads, it's not probably the best product for you.Plus, they're just so bulky. I didn't think they'd be quite as bulky as they were =/But one good thing is the wire. As with all Skullcandy headphones I've ever bought, the wire is covered in fabric instead of rubber. It's therefore more naturally durable, though if you're not careful it can actually break more easily.

VI got this headphones for engineering purposes because they are simple, NOT biased and NOT EQ'ed for studio monitoring. Listening to music though this guys is pretty awesome to be honest, bass in punchy, mids are excellent, and treble is crisp. I use an Apogee DUET for recordings, and having this headphones plugged into the headphone jack of the Apogee makes the sound much cleaner and clear. I listened to all the genres I could possibly think off, and they all sound amazing with this headphones.This might not be Beats by Dr.Dre, but for the price you got yourself some excellent monitoring headphones. If you are into DEEP bass or DEEP hip-hop beats... I recommend the Skullcrushers by Skullcandy (unless you want to drop some major coin on major studio headphones).

I cannot say how durable they are becuase i only got them today, but if you take care of them they should last. One tip: when you take them on and off do it in a straight line. This prevents less movement of unnecessary parts. They also come with a pretty nice carrying bag. Also, don't bend the cord around the jack too much so the cups will still work.

VSkullcandy Headphones
p452

VThese headphones have changed my perspective about over the ear headphones. I used to not like them because no matter how much you would turn up the volume you could still hear people talking. Now with the NBA headphones with just putting them on it is hard to hear people talking. Then as soon as you start playing music it is like that is the only sound in the world because that is all you can hear. All in all the Dwayne Wade NBA Skullcandy Headphones is the greatest headphones I have ever purchased.

VThe first day i received my skull candy hesh headphones, I instantly loved them. They look amazing, they aren't the most amazing sound quality in the world, but they are well worth the money, my father has a $70 set of bose headphones. My skull candies blow them out of the water. Im a college athlete so im on alot of long road trips. These headphones are ridiculously comfortable, most of the time i have to readjust  every two or three songs, not with these puppies. I recommend them to anyone!

VI have only had these headphones for a couple of weeks, but they seem pretty good. The bass is pretty loud though. If you listen to rap then you're probably okay. I listen to Hardcore and Pop Punk and I have to mess with the EQ on my iPod so it sounds better. They look amazing though. There should still be a Scalabrine edition...Oh, whatever website they were from took FOREVER to ship. They took over a month just to leave the shop. It also took them over a month to charge my card.

VThese head  phones are most definitely funky in appearance but I'd have to say that the sound quality isn't all that great. It's perfect for me when I need an escape but if you're walking down the street with passing cars? Forget about it. Even if you turn your ipod up all the way to hear the music you're not going to want to because the distortion of the speakers makes you want to cry. But like I said, they're perfect for around the house use and I use them all the time.

VI bought these headphones with a bit of reluctance because of some reviews, but some people obviously don't know what they're talking about. The whole thing is great! It even came with a nice carrying case. The sound is amazing, crisp and extremely loud. I have to turn it really low so people don't hear it! Bottom line, definitely reccomended. I've tried Beats by Dre, Sony, and Bose, and surprisingly the cheapest headphones I bought are the best. Great product.

But for $50 dollars ( I got them for $30 ) you get what you are paying for they are great head phones. I think that 'beats' are way too expensive so I found these and they seem almost as good. i have used both and I like the Hesh better. GET A PAIR. They also have great bass.

VA decent pair of budget headphones
p568
sg5
VFor ~$50, you will get a decent product. Although many people will only buy it because of the brand name/looks, you won't get a bad pair of headphones. The large 50mm drivers make for loud sound. Whether that's good sound or not is a whole different story. From the ears of an audiophile, you will immediately hear imperfections. However if you've just come from cheap iPhone headphones, you'll hear heaven. There definitely is a burn-in time. When you first get it, the bass will be a little overpowering, bleeding into the mids. The highs won't really be noticeable either. However once you've got a few hours into them, they start to even out. I tested these with dubstep, electro, rap, and rock in FLAC format. If you're listening to mp3, you're not going to hear what these headphones can actually produce. The Hesh don't actually have a ton of bass compared to others, but the bass is smooth. If you're looking for head-thumping bass, you're not going to get it from these. What you will get is a smoother, more refined bass. The mids are harder to detect. They're not as prevalent in these but a trained ear can hear solid mids. The songs I was playing didn't really push the highs too hard so I can't vouch for certain the quality of the highs.I liked the different color varieties so you can personalize your headphones. They're not at all bland. The headphones are sleek and aesthetically pleasing. I only have one complaint in that the cups are a little too thick. You'll look kind of like Mickey Mouse walking out in these. It doesn't really matter to me since I'm only going to use these for office/travel use.The construction is where the Hesh falls apart for me. It's made entirely of cheap plastic. I can see they did it to cut down costs but in the end, these headphones will not last. The adjuster band killed the headphones. After a few months of use, they snapped one-by-one. I ended supergluing it together but now it will no longer be able to adjust the size.The comfort is also not a huge win for me. The headstrap does not have a lot of padding. It also doesn't create a lot of friction. It can be good or bad depending on how you wear it but for me the headphones just kept slipping off my head. The cup pads are very stiff. They're made of a fake leather material. It's very hard and uncomfortable compared to other headphones. Depending on the size of your ears, the cup may be over-ear or on-ear. It's just small enough and just big enough to be both. The cups will end up hurting your ears after a while of wear.These come with a gold-plated 3.5mm jack so you can use it for your iPhone or PC. I've had no connection problems or power problems. I've accidentally run over the cord/jack with my chair and no damage has been done. The cord is made of nice braided fabric so it will last longer than other rubber/plastic cords. The mic is of decent quality. Phone/Skype calls will work pretty well. However since it is an inline mic, they tend to pick up a lot more things than you want. For example, my friends could hear my mom in another room or my dogs barking outside.In the end, I wouldn't exactly recommend these to anyone but it's not exactly a bad choice if you're set on getting one.

VSkullcandy Hesh Headphones
p573
sg5
VQuite a few months ago, I had bought a set of these. To my satisfaction, they are still as good as new I had brought these to school with me, and I found that the Headphones can take a beating, but don't be expecting you can fling these across the room and they will be fine durability-9/10I had bought the Scout version of these, being an outdoors kind of person, and Hesh fit the bill perfectly, and they turned a few heads as well. in looks-10/10I listen to music as much as possible, mainly rock, or hard rock, or heavy metal. These make the music clear as day. I could here every pluck of a guitar string, every beat the drums threw out, and every voice fluctuating there was. I also tested other styles of music based on what I had figured a lot of people listen to today; First I tried was dubstep, The sound quality is clear and crisp, but the Bass in these aren't as strong as something you would find in Skullcandy's "Skull Crusher" model. If you want as much bass as possible, go for the Skull Crushers. I also tried orchestral music. Every song from the popular music group "Two Steps From Hell" was a new experience. I heard new melodies, and new harmonies. I heard sounds I had never even picked up on with my old set. Another thing, these get LOUD. I mean if you crank up your computer's volume to the max and put the speakers together, they will shake in your have. If you put the volume at the max, and listen to even a relatively calm song, you won't be able to hear very well for a few minutes. All together, I had came to the conclusion that these are well rounded headphones that make great work of many, if not all genres of music. Sound-9/10The microphone on this set, I had found useless, It's plug-in has a triple stacked whatever thing (One of my friends tried to explain it to me) that enables the microphone to connect to the computer using the same plug-in as the headphones themselves. The reason I found this useless was because of the fact that it should mainly be used on a cell phone, which I do not own. But that's just my opinion. The microphone for me gets a 5/10 just because I don't have a need for it, but most might.On of the deciding factors that had me itching to buy this pair of headphones, was the comfort. I would be wearing these for many hours of the day. I am a gamer, so I figured if a get good comfort, then I would get more out of them; being able to wear them longer. I have only slight comfort problems, sometimes I will get a pain right below the back of my ear, from how tight they can be, but once you adjust them to a size that would fit you, you can wear these all day. Comfort- 8/10The next section of my review is the closer, affordability. being $50, they were the most expensive headphones I would have bought to the date. To me, do to all of the factors stated above, I would say these are the choice for you if you are looking for the most efficient way to spend your money on headphones. Although somewhat expensive, they are completely worth it. Affordability- 9/10

VI have had these headphones for about 6 months, around 2 of which they were not in use. I'll break down their features by section. I paid around 30 dollars for them.Sound: 2/5Honestly, these headphones are nothing special in sound. Upon receiving them, I was immediately disappointed by their quality. The bass is rather weak, the trebles are muddled, and the highs are unfocused. Depending on the price you pay, this may be acceptable, but if you're looking for sound alone, a 15 dollar pair of headphones could beat these. Although they are around-ear, the headphones are not very effective at passive noise cancelling, and leak a great deal of sound.Comfort: 2/5I found that after wearing these headphones for more than an hour, my ears started to hurt. Part of this is due to the fact that the drivers are round, whereas ears are not. What results is that the upper part of my ear gets clamped more than the rest of my ear, and this causes a lot of pain when wearing them. Additionally, the band is not very flexible, which creates quite a bit of pressure on your skull. However, for people with smaller heads and ears, this may not be a problem. The leather on the ear-pads is not bad.Design: 4/5These headphones look quite good when you're wearing them, but it should be noted that you intend to carry headphones on your neck, it will be impossible with these. They clamp around your neck completely, making it difficult to breathe. So if you are not wearing them on your head, you must stow them somewhere else.Durability: 1/5I put these in a backpack on a flight, and the adjuster on the side cracked. The problem is that these headphones are entirely made of plastic. Had the adjuster been aluminum or some type of metal, this would not have happened. Admittedly, this was my own fault, but this was ENTIRELY avoidable. Aluminum is cheap, and even that is found nowhere in this set. The mesh inside the drivers is also easily ripped, although I haven't experienced this. The fabric appears quite low quality.Portability: 3/5The headphones come with a nice bag, and the non-tangle cord is a nice feature (and should be standard on all headphones when possible). On the other hand, the headphones don't fold up, so there is no way to reduce their size.Bottom line: If you can get these headphones for around 20 dollars, it's not a bad deal. However, these are by no means a spectacular set. There are better options out there for the money that you would spend on these.

VI'm pretty picky with audio equipment and I would not have purchased these if I had not owned a pair of Skullcandy before. I purchased my first pair of Skullcandy on clearance, because I needed a basic pair for work (quality didn't matter). After using the 2XLs ( the other set) I was immediately impressed with the quality. The lows weren't over enhanced and the highs were very clear.After I purchased this pair I wasn't expecting to be disappointed and I was right. The quality of audio from these headphones is very high, especially for the price. The lows aren't over emphasized and the highs are crisp. The mids seem to be just lower in volume which is perfect for my taste.I've seen some complaints on this product and I can't imagine them being caused from the headphones themselves. I'd suggest getting a pair and trying them yourself. A few reviewers suggest that the device determines the audio quality and that's not particularly true. The quality of the music depends on the file you place on the device. Most devices that were made any time recently are built with the hardware to handle higher quality audio. If your music is 128Kbps then you can't really judge anything. I'd suggest 256Kbps at minimum and 320+Kbps preferred.The noise cancellation is remarkable. My wife was listening at maximum volume next to me on the couch in a silent room and I couldn't hear anything at all. She never knows if I have the music on or not when I'm wearing them.The mesh wrapping on the wire protects it immensely. The plastic sheathing on typical wires get pulled and tugged very often and the mesh is very strong which prevents damage on the wire.The 3.5mm jack is very small so it's not bulky. It seems sturdy even though it's very small.The wire comes from one side of the headphones keeping the wire from being across your face.Buy these headphones, you won't regret it unless by some chance you get a DOA.

VThe packaging was taped back together but it was a refurbished product. The headphones themselves have been reconstructed to a degree of quality higher than that of a pair of the same headphones that my friend just bought fresh from Skullcandy. These cans are, for the price, very high quality and the build construction is solid.The headphone cord is thicker than normal and feels very sturdy and does not tangle. The cans fit tightly on the head but the head band is not noticeable and only the headphones themselves can really be felt especially if you are not thinking about them. Again, this particular product feels more sturdy than an original from the online store and it clamps onto my head more securely than the original, though it is still comfortable and not to tight. Your ears do get warn and i use mine as a replacement for earmuffs when it is cold outside but i have never had a problem with "sweaty ears" so I cant comment much on these headphones from that angle.The padding is more than sufficient although there is some sound leaking if that is an issue. Above 75% volume on a standard ipod will allow others around you to enjoy your tunes with you if they listen close but the leaking isn't significant and is easily offset by the sound quality.Bass is low and clear with minimal distortion even at high volumes. The Highs and Mids are clear as well although it is obvious that these are built for bass emphasis. Acoustic and concert music both sound wonderful and the sound stage is adequately large and deep. They are built for R&B; but i have yet to find a song or genre that sounds less than adequate through these cans. I listen to a lot of House music and artists like Morgan Page sound wonderful on these.Hesh Headphones are not professional quality and do not stand up to headphones priced in the 200+ range but for the 30 i paid for them through amazon they are head, shoulders, and body above other headphones that can be bought for the same price. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for a solid mid-level pair of headphones that can take a beating and still keep playing and pounding on. I personally would have paid full price for these (49.99) if I had needed to and still would have  gotten my moneys worth.

VVery good, with a few trivial problems
p596
sg5
VBasically, these headphones are 100% worth the money you'll be spending for them. They look pretty good, and they get pretty loud so even if you feel weird about having them on your head you can hang them over your neck and you can still hear the music- plus it's really cool.First things first, these headphones are not THAT sturdy. They are durable enough so that if you drop them or maybe even throw them on the ground, they won't break but be careful where you store it because they have been known to snap. The headphones are mostly plastic and there are a lot of moving/swiveling parts. A little bit of TLC will prevent these headphones from breaking- plus it comes with a cool little bag, a sticker, and a spray paint stencil.Next, these things are pretty tight. If it's your first time getting skullcandys or you're upgrading from earbuds/cheap headphones, these things have noise cancelling foam rings, and they snap onto your ears pretty tight. This is good and bad- It's good because it does cancel out some of the noise... When I'm listening to my music on normal volume I can't hear anyone unless they're shouting into my ear, but its bad because it can get uncomfortable. It's the type of thing you have to get used to. When I first put them on I was like "Darn, this is really tight" but after a few days I got used to it and now they're pretty comfortable. It also varies from person to person as some of my friends say that they are really tight and others say they're perfectly comfortable. Something else to keep in mind, they don't fold up like other skullcandys or other headphones for easy storage... They stay in the headphone shapeThose are the two main cons about this product, but it still gets 4.5/5 stars because the sound quality is aboslutely amazing. I listen to rock, pop rock, punk rock, alternative, metal, and dubstep (techno but VERY heavy on the bass) and this headphone can easily take any of these. One of my favorite things to do is to close my eyes, set my EQ to bass booster, and listen to the skullcandy doing work. It sounds absolutely amazing and the headphones handle the heavy bass extremely well. I brought these headphones to school and people were trying them out and they were mostly all impressed at the quality of the music.All in all, if you're looking for an afforadble upgrade to your cheapo headphones or annoying earbuds, this is a great deal. With only trivial problems and amazing sound quality, what more could you ask for from a pair of $35 headphones?

VThese Paul Frank inspired Skull Candy brand full ear headphones offer a cute look for fans of the artist but overall they should not expect any sort of significant quality in terms of both sturdiness and sound. The speakers wrap around the ear comfortably, and while they do feel sturdy enough, these obviously aren't the type of headphones that should be taken outside in the rain or dropped on the floor too often. The wire is actually a good highlight as it is wrapped in a soft yarn-like material and not your typical rubber, therefore it feels more like a shoelace and not so much a wire. This ensures that the wire will never become tangled or stuck in any sort of annoying twirls especially if you're the type that likes to wrap up wires when the item is not in use. Therefore, just take care of these physically as they may tend to scratch easily.Now in the area that matters - sound quality. Unfortunately, most of my rating was lower simply because of this. The headphones emit whatever sound you put them through, but for the most part things just sound too average and flat. There is no significant bass or overall good balance. The bandwidth is not Bose or Westone quality, so don't expect to be blown away. I mean, even in the least. Plus right out of the package, I noticed that with some songs, if the volume was even significantly louder than average, the headphones would make this small rattling and distortion type of sound, as if the speakers weren't strong enough to handle a higher than average volume. This is the biggest disappointment with these headphones. One would think that with speakers this big these phones would be strong enough to handle a good amount of bass without any distortion whatsoever. Then again, Skull Candy has always been notorious for their style of substance, and these headphones are unfortunately no exception.These are a good idea for a collector's item if you are buying them for a fan of the Paul Frank artist, but if you want to do your music justice, spend a little more on a quality brand, like Sennheiser, Bose, Westone, Sony, Phillips, etc. (Actually, some of these other brand names would probably offer BETTER sound quality headphones for a cheaper price).In the end, being a big fan of music, I simply cannot recommend these, or any other Skull Candy product.

p618

VThese headphones are great. I got them last year for christmas, and they're awesome. The sound is amazing, there's little to no leak, and I love the pause/unpause/skip button on the cord. There are a few problems though, and they are enough of an issue that I decided to share my experience. If you wear these for too long, they tend to hurt your ears a little. Also if it's hot, they get sweaty. The worst problem, however, is that they break. I don't know if it's just me, but a week or so ago they started to break. When I had them hooked up to my computer, they would sometimes randomly do short bursts of static, or a loud popping noise would occur. Also, the part of the headphone on the left ear right above the speaker and below the size adjustment thing broke. It just came loose, and now whenever I wear the headphones, the left ear sticks up and won't fit over my ear anymore. This sucks because these headphones have great quality and I love them, except they haven't even lasted a year. This is pretty disappointing because now I actually have to buy some. I've tried my best to preserve these, but alas, duct tape has failed me. All in all, these are amazing headphones. I'm no audio nerd, but I think this sound is great. It's clear and loud and everything is just perfectly blended. If you're thinking about getting these headphones, I recommend that you do, but maybe get them used or for cheap because they will, inevitably, break. So, if you get these, treat them as nicely as possible and prepare yourself for when they break, because they will, and it is rather heart-breaking. These were some great headphones while they lasted. If you get them, maybe you'll get more than 9 months of use out of them.

VAfter reading several bad reviews, I figured maybe they just had a defective product. After weighing the good and bad reviews I decided to buy them and if I did not like them I could just return them. It took only two days after I placed my order to get my headphones and I have to say they fit great. Some reviews say they are bulky, they don't fit right over my ears, they are made of cheap plastic, when you wear them around your neck it does not fit right. Well to the not fitting right over the ears I will be the first to say I have huge ears and these fit comfortably and with any over the ear headphones you have to adjust them after wearing them for a long time. They are a little bulky but that is exactly what you are buying, bit headphones that will fit over your ears. One review I read about the cheap plastic and they bought it for their child(teen) and after a few days they broke. I am only 22 and can tell you those headphones did not bread from normal wear, the teen probably horsing around with his friends dropped them and broke them, as with anything if you drop it or are rough with it they will not last. Overall I give these headphones a 5 out of 5 and they are about 60% noise cancelling without music on. I don't know what other reviews have said but when I am listening to music at half volume I can't hear anything, they are perfect. I highly recommend these headphones. (and if there is any defects skullcandy has a warranty and will replace them or if you break them you can get a new pair for cheaper)

VI recently got the "Rasta" version of these headphones, and I am more than satisfied (as always when it comes to Skullcandy).Comfortable fit (even with an earring in), easily adjustable. Sound is a little more bass-prominent, whereas I find the earbuds to be balanced, but my skullcandy earbuds hurt my ears after prolonged use. I can use these over the ear headphones all day (literally, a 24-hour period) without feeling discomfort.Great for music, great for TV or movies. I'm sure you could find headphones with a better sound, but for the price? These are clearly the winner.Also, it came with a drawstring pouch for toting the headphones around, a sticker (that you can put "somewhere cool" and submit to Skullcandy for a possible prize), and a stencil of the Skullcandy logo.I love the design, and the top of it is wrapped in a real woven band (feels nice). My family complimented me on how awesome they looked. The cord is a bright green as shown. It easily untangles (and doesn't tangle easily) but I find that it sticks to its shape (if you bend the cord, for example, it's going to stay a little bent). It's the same type of cord as the earbuds I have. It's also pretty long.The headphones are also durable-- I've dropped them about four feet and nothing happened, also I accidentally banged the two parts that go over your ear together, with no damage.All in all? I can't find a downside to these headphones. I'd recommend this buy to anyone!

VMy Mom bought these headphones for me for christmas and at first they weren't the ones i wanted at first i wanted the skullcandy skullcrushers, moslty for the bass.  When I got them I didn't know what to think of them because i hadn't look up on them very.  I had actually wanted a pair of good headphones moslty to listen to music and to help out when creating music for mixing I do like bass I'm very into my bass music and I know there are people that say that the sound sucks and that the bass is cheep and that your better off buying a cheep pair of earphones which is stupid because they have amazing bass they aren't over done most headphones can get into bass.  I thought the sound of these headphones were awesome to me the cancel out just enough sound so I can focus on what Im working on.  They are built really good they have very comfortable and i have big ears, and the cups fit really good on my ears I can listen to them for hours on in and my ears won't hurt.  also the built on the top of the headphones has amazing padding.  I also have read that they look extremely cheep, but to me they look really cool, and they also come a nice little bag that is very nice.All in all great pair of heaphones for a person who is in high school and doesn't want to spend a whole lot on headphones because I am know to break stuff very easily so far they are very durable.Beast headphones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VI bought these for occasional use on the test bench as I repair audio equipment for a living. I wanted a pair of affordable headphones that offered full range sound and a comfortable fit at a reasonable price. I didn't need a headphone that is extra durable for daily use that need to take a beating.The Skullcandy Hesh fit the bill perfectly. At an affordable price, the frequency range is nicely balance between the bass and treble - with a bit of a dip in the midrange as I expected. They are comfortable and block outside noise very, very well. The soft storage pouch is a really nice plus too.A couple extra thoughts to pass along. These are not audiophile grade headphones, they lack detail and refinement found in higher-end headphones... however if you are going to listen to MP3 audio, they are just fine. Also they did not sound good at all when I first listened to them! These do need "break-in" to sound good. I connected them to a home receiver, cranked the bass, and let them play for an hour - made a big difference.Lastly, for home listening you will need an adapter for 1/4" jacks (should be included IMHO) and watch for clearance sales on outgoing colors and styles. They are not worth their full price - there are much better headphones available for just a little more (the Sony MDR-V6 comes to mind). But when the price is discounted, these are a good deal.

VI really enjoy these headphones. I received them today so I will be sort of loving and bias towards them. My shipping was super fast, they shipped out on Monday and I received them today(Tuesday). They sound good and are somewhat noise cancelling, not completely, but that's OK. I haven't "burned" them in yet so I do not have a good view on the bass, even though I should point out I do want a little bump in my music since I do listen to rap/hip hop mostly, but I don't want it to be too over powered and rattle my ears. You don't need to worry about having them at full volume I only have mine at 40% and they are LOUD. They are not bulky on the head like other headphones and I love that. They were $20 cheaper then on skullcandy's website. They look great, even better in person. Only problem is you can tell from the get go how they are made with plastic. For the price though I'm not complaining I knew what I was getting. They fit comfortably on the head and I enjoy wearing them. Overall I get them a 8/10. Only thing holding back is the plastic and because I haven't gotten to experience them burned in with full sound quality and only having them 1 day. I would recommend these things in a heart beat for people wanting a stylish good pair of cheap headphones. Hopefully skullcandy expands into other sports like football and I would gladly buy another pair of Steelers!!

VThis is my first set of over ear stereo type headphones.  I've used ear buds for the past few years, and I am definitely not an expert when it comes to anything audio.  But Wow!  What a difference these make!It's awesome to be able to hear the same favorite songs in a new way.  It's like you can hear what the artist actually intended you to hear.  I walk to class with these on all the time, and they do a good job blocking out the noise from the outside.  You can still hear certain things if the volume is low enough, but that's okay with me as I'd rather hear a car coming at me than not.I love how the headphones look.  There have been some reviews saying that they don't fit very well.  I think it's like a new piece of clothing.  They definitely felt awkward at first, but after about 2 days of wearing they felt like part of my everyday attire.Durability might be a question, but I've dropped these, smashed them in my backpack and choreographed my hip hop dances with them on and they don't show any sign of breaking.  Honestly, I try to take care of them but since I'm at so many placed everyday they do get banged up.  You can't beat the warranty, and that was a huge factor in me buying these.Overall I would recommend these to a friend.  Other people might say different, but I think they look great, feel great, and sound great.

VThese headphones sound all right, they're more balanced to my ears than my Sennheiser CX-300 IEMs. They are definitely not worth $50 though. I got these on sale for $25 and I found that they sound more like headphones in that price range.1. To me they are extremely uncomfortable since they clamp to your head like vice-grips even after letting them stretch out, and they're pretty heavy on my small head.2. They sound better in terms of tonal balance compared to my Sennheiser CX-300 in-ear headphones. The mids and highs are laid back compared to the more forward bass and seem a muddy to my ears (the notes seem slurred and not very detailed). The bass is there and has a decent bass punch. I do have to compliment them on their soundstage. The soundstage for these closed headphones is definitely a lot larger than my Sennheiser CX300's. A larger soundstage makes the music recording sound more realistic, as if you were in a concert hall, so that's a good thing.3. The cloth carrying case that's given in the package is not very useful unless you're storing these headphones somewhere for a while. I use these at school and they're reaaally bulky since they don't lie flat nor fold. They are not very portable.4. The pleather ear pads are stiff and also uncomfortable. They do isolate some noise but not too much since the stiff pads do not conform to my head. In the back of the headphones' ear cups, there is a gap between my head and the pads themselves, despite trying to adjust the headphones around.I haven't had any problems with these myself, but when I move them, they do make a creaking sound so I'm not sure how durable these will be. For $50 I hope they last a while. I've had my $25 Sennheiser CX300's for 2 years without any problems yet.UPDATE March 24, 2011: I took a look at my headphones in the sun today and I noticed that the joint connecting the 50mm driver housings with the adjustable headband has a crack in the plastic on both sides of the headphone. It seems like this is the weakest spot of the headphones considering other reviews, and I can see why. At that specific spot, most of the flexing of the headband occurs there, which is a hollow plastic tube. Very poor design on Skullcandy's part.UPDATE July 13, 2011: So the cracks on the headband have now become even larger and my right ear piece is barely hanging in there. I'm looking for a replacement headphone at the moment since these are really loose on my head (due to the headband cracks).UPDATE August 9, 2011: Now both sides of the headband have become cracked to the point where I cannot place them on my head and remain in place. They slide off of my head since there is essentially no clamping force. I purchased a Shure SRH940 headphone and my review for that product can be found on its product page here: SRH940 Professional Reference Headphones

VOk so i have had my pair for about a year or 2 now and there still going strong, I love them... I dont really like the bass on them but other than that the sound is crisp, clear, and overall just good.they are hard to wear for a long period of time(like 6 hours or so)The only thing that I really saw as a reason to mark off one star was that they broke on me(plastic broke)So one day i was using my headphones and they fell off my head onto the ground and the pastic part that makes the earpiece swivel broke so the right ear just hanged down by the wire. I really got aggrevated and tapped it but nothing sticked. So finally after a week or two went to the store spent 5 dollars on crazy glue glued it completely(used half the bottle) and now they work perfectly!Overall I recommend this to anyone who can not afford the new version.My reasons for recommending1)Good sound quality(not enough bass but not by much)2)blocks a lot of the sound from the outside3)Is comfortable as long as you dont wear it for more than 6 hours5)VERY load... this thing gets very load so when your testing sound quality put your computer volume on 35-40 because it is insane :DHope this review helped you make your purchase! :D

VAfter looking at noise cancelling headphones @ $150-$200 a pair, my son settled on these for abou $40 on Amazon.  We tried the Dre, and to me, they are a piece of junk.  So, for $150, you are getting a noise cancelling piece of junk that is a status symbol due to the name.  I read reviews on the Dre, and everyone complained about the breakage, and they were right.  I went to Best Buy, and the floor model was broken.If you want good quality and nice sound, these SKULL CANDY headphones are for you.  I used to DJ about 20 years ago, and I fell in love with my Sony headphones and I have them to this day.  They weren't noise reduction, but they worked just fine.  Same with these.  I can hear the highs and lows very nicely and they handle the digital sound perfect.  Why spend all that money on a name, just buy these.Specs:-These fit nicely OVER his ears.-Cord is a nylon covered material that doesn't kink or knot.  It's a great feature.-Color is cool.-My 11 year old son loves them.If you decide that you want noise cancelling headphones, forget the Dre or any of the midline stuff, and buy BOSE quiet comfort headphones.  They are worth the money.  If you want a good entry level headphone, these are very good and won't break the bank at $40.

VI heard about these new "beats" headphones, and looked them up online and discovered that they were very stylish, and I also discovered the price, unfortunately. I am a huge OKC thunder fan, and play basketball a lot.I sampled the beats from one of my friends while we were shooting hoops. i realized why the beats have horrible reviews. The sound quality is very poor. I decided these Skullcandy headphones were going to be the best choice for me. I have had them for 6 months, and i these six months i have discovered thse things.  1. The sound quality is absolutely insane. I have never heard headphones that project the sound so clear. I am more of a pop- rap guy, and these headphones are amazing.  2.  these headphones NEVER fall off. I have taken these headphones to their limits, and they have never let me down. I have done every workout  I know of, and they have never fell off. ever.  THE VERY FEW COMPLAINTS... I would really have liked the parts where you can adjust the size to be metal.  2. After 4+ hours they start really hugging your ears and they start geting uncomfortable. But if you take them off for 5 mins, and then put them back on, they'll feal good as new.  overall great headphones.

p773
sg5
VI'm not buying another pair of these.  I was very excited when I first saw the headphones, thinking they were stylish, good quality sound, and economical (mine cost $30).  Unfortunately, they only delivered as I had expected in style.  They looked exactly the same in real life as they did in the pictures online.  For the first few months, I really loved them.  However, after I took them on a trip and wore them for more than an hour and a half, they started to hurt my head.  I felt like my ears were being crushed.  The headband pulls the cans together way too hard.  Granted, my head is larger than average, and as far as adjust-ability goes they fit _around_ my head very nicely, but for extended listening these headphones hurt.  Now I'm no expert on sound quality, but these didn't seem too magical, and from what others have said Skullcandy is primarily about style.If you have a small head, care about style over quality, and can't afford Beats or some more fashionable but comparably low-quality pair of headphones, by all means buy these.  Otherwise, go for a pair of cheap Sonys, JVCs, Koss or some other brand that puts sound quality and comfort first.  You'll thank me later.

VI love these headphones. I got my husband the audiophile the Derrick Rose Hesh headphones for Christmas and when they arrived he loved them, but I too loved them so much that I ordered the Paul Frank's for myself, because I hate earbuds. My ears are so small they never stay in. These are great headphones, and I got them even cheaper on Amazon than on Skullcandy. I noticed that there are many reviews that say they hurt after a while, but I'm not having that problem at all. I'm thinking that maybe it depends on your head size, because to me, they're extra comfortable. I wear them mostly for my daily commute into Manhattan by train and their great! I don't blast them, but I can hear my music comfortably as well as stay aware of my surroundings. I get tons of compliments on them too. They're like a fashion acessory - and I do love fashion. The only issue I have is that they don't have the in-line mic. For those who say they hurt I say maybe try another one of the skullcandy line, like maybe the agent or the icon. They're over the head but not as snug as the hesh line. Hope this helps!! Electric Animals, I'm coming for you next!!

VAs you would expect from Skullcandy, the style of these headphones is great. The ear piece is more round and sticks out more than the picture lets on. The design and comfortability is great though. Great for someone who is looking to have a nice pair of headphones to match their style.When it comes to quality.. maybe not so great. I'm used to using Bose quality headphones/ earphones and honestly I'm not so sure these are the ones to try and compete. Now I'm not going to go into saying that these are the worst out there, because they aren't. Sure they get loud enough to enjoy. The bass is OK but don't expect to hear the deep bass described on the website. Everything else is heard pretty well, but it's just not as clear as I think it could/should be. There is no umph. Anyone whose has used Sennheiser Headphones,Bose® Headphones or even Bose® headphones most likely won't be a fan of these. I'm sure not.For any kid(like most) who haven't been exposed to any of the named, these are a good choice.

p826
sg5
VI really like these headphones, even though I just got them today. I picked Skullcandy for their reputation, and I wanted a solid pair of over the ear headphones with good bass and sound quality for $50 or below, and this is what I decided on. I'm really glad I picked these! They're pretty cool looking and the sound quality is awesome, lots of bass but not so much that it's too overpowering. They fit well on my ears, though they might hurt if your ears are either really sensitive or abnormally large, I guess. They seem pretty heavy duty for the most part, but even if they don't hold up (Again, I just got them), be aware that Skullcandy has a really awesome warranty where they'll replace them if they fail randomly and they will reimburse you for half of a new pair if you break them by accident, no matter how long you've had them. That alone is enough to make them worth the price, as you will never have to pay full price for another pair. Just be sure to write down the date you bought them and you're golden. If you are on the fence about these, go for it.

VSkullcandy is awesome
p832
sg5
VSkullcandy's are awesome headphones, They're not THAT delicate, I'm very rough with my headphones because I only buy headphones that can take a beating! I bought a Celtic's pair in 2009 and it lasted me a year (My ex boyfriends pit puppy chewed them apart) after the quality of the sound and bass and for under $100 I decided to buy another pair of Skullcandy Hesh headphones, I bought the shattered Rasta ones, I was worried about them not lasting too long because the cord was plastic instead of braided (Like the Celtics ones) but they lasted until January 2012, and the pull down part broke, they still work (nothing a little duct tape can't fix) But I'm not wearing duct tapped headphones out in public, I ordered another another pair and again, AWESOME headphones, You cannot find another pair of headphones with great quality sound and bass for the price of skullcandy (between $50-$125) and with HEAVY abuse they last about a year, NOT bad (Before skullcandy I was buying $20-$50 headphones that'd last me a month or two, then I'd have to replace them)

VA Good Set for the Money
p855
sg5
VMy original review appears to have been based on faulty data and I apologize to the Skullcandy people.  This set has decent power, clarity, and a good range of sound.  It does not have AC-DC concert volume, but at this price, I really didn't expect that.I had written that there was a good deal of distortion at higher volume levels and this remains true, but I am speaking about what most people would consider an insane decibel load for the human ear.  After 45 years of playing like Tommy Chong, my ears are shot anyway, but others might like to preserve their hearing.The cord is a bit short, but I own many extensions, so if you need a longer cord, pick one up.  I really like the fabric feel of the cord.  It should help it last longer than a traditional one........time will tell.In short, I recommend these phones both for the average listener and for the Rockers out there who are tired of wimpy low end headphones and on't want to drop a few hundred dollars for the big boys just now.

VSkullcandy Headphones are some of the best headphones you can buy.But on the down side of the subject, they are pretty expensive to.  You know how they say, "this is music to my ears.", these headphones bring that metaphor to life.  They are very high quality, it feels like you're actually at the band whose concert you're listening to. like I said earlier, they are a great pair of headphones, and there just a great product to listen to music with.The first time I listened to a pair of Skullcandy headphones was after school at my friend's house.  He had a pair of them on his bed so i asked him if I could listen to them and he said yes so I picked them up and I pressed play on his IPod.  They sounded great!These are perfect headphones for kids and adults any age.  Someone who would really like them would be someone who enjoys music, also, I wouldn't recommend putting these were a baby could get a hold of them because they are expensive, other than that, they are great headphones.

VBought a pair at a local FYE store, got to the car and they sounded awful! everything was crunchy and distorted. i realized the driver or something was busted. Went  back and traded them, the new ones sounded better. pretty decent sound, good price, and looked really good. i also liked that the headphone jack could be removed from the headphones just like you can with the beats. but these leaked really bad, and didnt have very good sound cancelation. but my goodness they are very uncomfortable. ive had uncomfortable headphones, but after like an hour or 2. with these. i had a headache in 10-15minutes. they squeeze way too tightly. I took them back, i got the skullcrushers, they are SOOO much better. and the sound is way better too. they dont leak much at all unless you crank them and are standing right beside them, and they do a great good job of canceling surrounding sounds. plus they have dual drivers, and a subwoofer! id get skullcrushers. or atleast not the hesh, unless you have a very tiny head!

VThe third set I've bought, but only because my son stole my first pair and my second pair got torn apart in a move.  I am allergic to Latex and cannot use ear buds and I also have a hearing problem, so my needs are different than most people.  Depending on my work schedule, I have been known to wear these for 8hrs while entering data and experience little to no discomfort.  I also do not have to turn up the volume very loud anymore, saving my already damaged hearing. I can also hear for the first time minute details in movies (ghost noises in my paranormal shows!) and the sweetest notes of Vivaldi's concertos. Pure bliss! And let's not forget how AWESOME they look!!  Everybody giggles and comments on the devil monkey and "Be Good Tomorrow" stitched along the top.  Totally me!!If you are looking at more expensive headphones, I would seriously consider these or any other Skullcandy cans first.  The quality and customer service (Lifetime replacement) cannot be beat!

VI rated four stars for some reasons:First lets see the PROs:  +4 starsPros: - Very good sound quality,  - Best sound in R&B; and Pop Music  - very nice design and fit in your ear.  -  the wire cord is made like "shoe lace" so it won't twisted.  -  And most of all the price is very reasonable not like ( "BEATS by DRE" it's very overpriced ).On the other hand, I noticed some CONs: -1 starCons: - made in cheap plastic.  - bass are not too impressive, I preferred "BEATS BY DRE" if you want a super excellent bass.  - wire are not detachable But, as I heard Skull Candy have already released a new heads check it out in Google.So overall,I am satisfied for my purchased. Definitely, I will recommend this product to all who don't want to pay big $$$ for a headphone, and if you want a good sound quality with average bass, this is the right choice.

p883

VI purchased these headphones from my local F.Y.E store. I got them on sale for 35 bucks thinking they'd be great for just listening to music. I didn't need any high quality headphones at the time, so I figured these would be perfect. And to be honest, for a few months, they were. Right out the box, they were especially louder than any other headphone I've tried! The 50mm drivers are to thank for that, even though these are the only 50mm headphones I have ever listened to. The sound quality served my needs quite well. But these were my second pair of Skullcandy headphones that broke. I won't go into my first pair's experience but this pair was different.I was listening to them at high volume when all of a sudden the left driver started cracking, so I took them off to see what the problem was. I tapped on the outside of the left cup and the speaker stopped working immediately and it hasn't worked since. These headphones were nice and they were loud with quite a lot of bass, but I doubt i will be buying anything else from Skullcandy for a while, sadly. The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of its loudness and its sound quality which, to me, sounded remarkable. Great product while it lasted.

VGreat Headphones, no problems, great for sound isolation at work
p888
sg5
VI use these at the office when I need to drown out the rest of the noise and people.  Either fire up Spotify or start into my own collection.On the plus side when you fire these up you discover a whole new side to your music colection that you've never heard(if you've only used the cheap plugs that came with your mp3 player) for not much more than the bottom line pairs.These are not fully up to par with the high end sennheisers, beats, etc.  Some people will take that as a negative, but you're also not paying the price for those head phones either.  I've heard people complain about breakages etc, mine have been rolling in the bottom of my backpack for 7 or 8 months with just the little sack they came in for protection.  I've got a fairly fat head(7 3/4 hat size, and they fit comfortably sound great.They are not specifically advertised as isolating, but you put these on and you won't likely hear your coworkers or any workplace noises.

VI got these headphones to replace a pair of $7 Vibe headphones that were starting to have audio problems, which i got to replace a broken pair of Skullcrushers. The sound quality is very good, with all of the genres I listen to, Metal, Classic Rock, Electronica, House, dubstep and SID. All of them sound amazing! the only problem I have with them is that the foam parts of the earcups are too small, and after about 2 hours of skateboarding and listening to music, my ears started hurting. Other than that Great buy(i got mine used for $28 bucks, they were treated pretty badly, but i bet that brand new, they would be worth the $40-$50 you have to pay) the cord never tangles, I never have any problems with the minijack not fitting in my mp3 player or reaching it(i'm very short for my age though)Pros: Great sound quality with most genres of music.Cons:Earcups are too small, plastic feels brittle.Decision: BUY THESE! THEY ARE AMAZING!

p905

VThe Headphones are Overall Amazing, especially for the price. the sound Quality is excellent and they are comfortable to wear on your head.Now the Only issues with these headphones are that when you wear them around your neck they kinda choke u a little. So Avoid that, I just used the slack of my belt to wear them on my pants when I had to take them off.And the other thing is that the Plastic extension on the headphones are of poor quality, the right hand side broke off from just normal wear and tear and the right hand side is now cracked. I easily fixed this with Black duct Tape, and no one notices.the speakers on the headphones are truly amazing, they never scratch or get any type of interference. So GOOD JOB! on that part SkullCandy! by now my headphone speakers would have blown... you can Definitely BLAST the music and not expect to go deaf or break your Headphones. LIKE I SAID EARLIER- GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!!!

VI bought a pair of these from the local Entertainment store and have had them for about 2 years now and I can say that this headset is awesome! Sound is great and they're really loud for what they are. I was never expecting this much volume from a headset that doesn't require batteries. The sound is great, I can wear them for a long time before they bother me but like any headsets they will start hurting eventually but thats just the ears' way of saying they need a break. I see a lot of bad reviews saying these are cheap and break easy but I have dropped mine a fair share and they are still intact and work perfect. It is most likely user error to people who claimed theirs broke so soon. These are $50 dollars, so quit expecting them to work like $300 cans! These are just perfect for anyone who wants high volume and great sound at a decent price but know that you are getting what you pay for, Skull Candy, NOT DRE BEATS!!!

VI took a chance on purchasing them while shopping at another retailer. I was looking here at another brand,(which I'll still purchase cause I want them), but at this moment I was in need of a pair for my HTC One with Beats Audio. The moment I plugged them in, I was thinking to myself, "They'll probably sound OK" That was an understatement. The enhanced sound quality from the Beats Audio of this phone gave these headphones some serious knock. The bass response isn't overpowering, but it's more than adequate. The highs and mids aren't piercing either, so you won't get that scratchy sound I hate. The only genre I've listened to with them so far is Dubstep and Hip-Hop, and I've been more than impressed by the sound quality. For the price, you can't beat them. If your looking for some serious sound on the go without breaking your wallet, then Skullcandy Hesh gets 2 thumbs up from me.

VAfter dealing with earbuds for years I made the decision that I needed a pair of actual headphones.  I toyed with the idea of shelling out big bucks for BOSE headphones or even Beats by Dre.  Thankfully my lack of funds forced me to explore less expensive options.  I paid around $30 for these headphones and could not be happier with my purchase.  The sound quality is great and I am thrilled to have bass back in my life.  Some of the reviews mention that these headphones might not last as long as others, I just bought them a few weeks ago so I can't comment on their long term durability but they seem to be constucted just fine.  Also people mentioned them not fitting over big heads.  I have a large head and the headphones fit perfect.  The ear pieces are mad comfortable and work as ear muffs to (it's winter in Boston)!You will not regret buying these headphones!

VThe Best For The Price
p950

VI bought these headphones a while ago and I love them. I kept looking at the Beats By Dr. Dre but the price tag was just too high for my liking. For the price of these headphones you get a lot. The sound is very nice. I have listened to a wide range of music and they can handle most of it. The highs are a little muddy but if you get past that everything else is perfect. The headphones in my opinion are very comfortable. I listen to music for long periods of time with them and I do not get the headache that occurs with in-ear headphones. They seem very durable and they have lasted me through everything. I have taken them on a couple of trips around the world and they are perfect for the plane. Overall: when you get these headphones you can expect to be sucked into the music world and they look stylish. They were a great buy. Hope this helped.

VI just got these headphones today. They're amazing! Very nice, very stylish, very padded. :) The sound is AMAZING, literally like no other headphones that I have ever tried before. The bass is AWESOME and I love them. HOWEVER, there is one big down side. (Which is why I didn't give it a 5.) After about twenty minutes these headphones hurt your ears. /: Maybe it's just because I just got them today and they haven't "stretched out" or because I was just sitting down in one position, but they were really tight. I think that if you were doing something at the same time, such as moving around or reading a book, you might be able to ignore it. But just sitting down and listening to music, they really hurt. I'm not sure if this will go away with time or not though, so I'll update in about a month. I would definitely buy them. :)

VThese are amazing!  The quality is amazing, the sound is amazing!  I love how they come with their own satin carrying bag, embossed with the 3 tag on one side and the Skullcandy logo on the other.  I am so impressed with their built in mic- the sound quality is amazing (both for myself and the caller on the other end) and they are so comfortable!  The construction is great, the only draw back is the white around the pillowy ear piece-- being a woman, they will probably have makeup residue left over, but I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.  This price is phenomenal and the quality is so well worth it.  I have used many other types of headphones/sound equipment.  I was a little hesitant after reading reviews, but I will be gushing about these headphones to anyone who will listen!  MUST HAVE!

VI bought these because I was sick of the terrible quality that earbuds give, I wanted something more for home use but it turns out I cant really use these out of home much anyway.The sound is great everything is clear and I was impressed my the quality of the bass for the price! The only problem is that unless you are surronded by quite a bit of noise everyone can hear what you are hearing. I have even been able to use my headphones almost like portable speakers they are so loud off of the ears. So thats a negative but it is the only reason I gave the product 4 stars.They are a lot more lightweight than i expected but i also expected to be more metal details etc, but it was mostly all plastic which gave them a little more of a cheap feel, but hey they are 40$ not 90$ so you get what you pay for.

VThese headphones are really awesome! I agree with all of the other 5 star comments, these are boss. If you go on YouTube, there are a lot of really helpful reviews on skullcandy headphones, especially for the Hesh's. If you are wondering if these are going to cover your ears, my ears are on the smaller side and they kinda touch the inside edges, but this shouldn't be a problem. I'm positive that these aren't cheaply made and that they ARE durable. These are sick.****************************************UPDATE!*************************************After a week of daily use for a week or so, one of the wires broke internally. Sweet while they lasted, I guess. I know a friend who has a pair of these and his have lasted a few years, so I guess I got a dud.Oh well.

VWhen my brother asked me to buy him these I thought they were a ripoff but I eventually bought them. After he finished using them I decided to try them on and see how well they sounded, my mind was blown. Being the first high quality headphones I think they are amazing, whatever music you listen to is going to sound great. Now a few months after even I started using them on a daily basis when my brother is at school so they get like 7 hours of use everyday and they don't seem to notice. We don't treat these like they are some sort of jewelry they are always on on the desk sometimes I wear them to go workout.The build is very durable and I don't know how other users manage to break them in such a short notice, they must treat them like crap.

Vthese are great ipod or mp3 or android headphones with no adjustments needed.  but if you own an av amp like sherwood or denon the high powered amps that put out 200 watts a channel i own a sherwood usa hd receiver. you will need two do one thing before plugging them in  if your bass is set at +5 or higher you will haveto turn it down anyware from +2 -1db or the bass will completeley overpower the headphones and you will completely blow the driver so they are great headphones you just haveto adjust the bass setting when plugged in two a receiver. the perfect bass setting for me and they still pump amazingley is -2db.by the way i never blew these they sound great its just common sense that an amp will blow these without adjustments.

VOne of the best sets of headphones I've ever owned. Very sturdy, amazing bass and sound. I've grown a lot of hate for Dr. Dre because of how overpriced they are. All you need is a great sounding pair of headphones - and these are it. They sound absolutely beautiful on newer songs such as Imagine Dragons - Radioactive, however they sound great on all songs.Instead of wasting a ton of money on a pair of Dr. Dre's headphones, buy these.*EDIT*After an honorable use of two-three years, I've gotten new headphones. I got the Skullcandy Crushers, and they're very nice. I decided to come back to these headphones as a spare but they sound like rubbish now. Was surprised at first, but these things are dirt old.

VGood for an mp3 player
p1047
sg5
VI bought a pair of these and they fill the need I wanted them for: inexpensive, full ear cup headphones to use with an mp3 player. Which is obviously what they were designed for. The cord is too short for anything not within arm's reach, and do not come with a 1/4" adapter. Plugged into a stereo, or recording equipment, or an electronic musical instrument, they don't sound all that good. Very colored sound. Way too much bass, for my taste. But for an mp3 player, they fit the bill. With a little tweek of my Sansa's EQ, they sound pretty decent, and the snug fitting ear cups really block out external noise well. The large drivers make these loud, so I can turn the volume down some and get better battery life out of my mp3 player.

VAfter trying some Skullcandy earbuds, I decided that the quality of Skullcandys products was good enough to purchase some earphones. After seeing the prices of high quality earphones, I felt that  Skullcandy would be a good value. I chose the Hesh earphones mostly on looks but the specs had a little to do with my decision as well. When I received them I immediately connected them to my iPhone and played all different types of music to really test them out. Sound quality overall is good but the bass isn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. They also weren't as loud as I would have liked either. I don't want to blowout my eardrums but sometimes you just want to crank it up and you can't really do that with these earphones.

VGreat Until Broken...
p1059
sg5
VNot gonna lie, but these headphones do actually produce great sound. But since they're essentially all plastic, they break so easily. I had mine for only a month until the adjustable band on one of the headphones snapped in half and I had to super glue it together. And it lasted for about a few more months like that! I mean, the sound still worked and I didn't really care as long as it worked and the other band was adjustable... But... Then the other band broke where I couldn't fix it with superglue, and then the sound started going... All in all, they're great headphones but NOT worth the price. $50+ for cheap plastic. Do more research before investing in ANY SkullCandy product. You're just buying plastic and design.

VOk first of all the people that say these headphones suck, suck. I would say I am an avid music listener and always have headphones on or in. These have pretty sick sound quality. If you are expecting a lot of bass though you may be a little let down. Now I'm not saying that the bass sucks, but it was a little less than I thought it would be. Also they are a little fragile, but if you just take care of them you'll be fine. Finally, if you are looking for sound cancelling headphones these are probably not what you want. They do cancel the sound alright with music on but you can still hear background noise. Over all these headphones are a great buy for price and I would definately recommend these headphones to everybody!

VAfter having a server ear infection resulting in a tube being put in my ear I was told by my doctor to switch from earbuds back to headphones. I have heard very good things about skull candy so I looked into getting a set of headphones made by Skullcandy. While browsing I ran across this pair and fell in in love with them! They are very good. Perfect noise cancellation, fits my ears extreamly well. My only complaint is that they are kinda bulky and don't fit around my neck as well as I had hoped. These head phones come with a drawstring bag to carry them around and protect them as they ride around in my backpack when not in use. If a friend asked me to suggest a pair of headphones i'd tell them to go right for these.

p1100
sg5
VPlease read this before buying!! These are my SECOND pair of skullcandy over the ear headphones. The first ones where the foldable subwoofer model and they broke after about 6-8 months of use. I chalked it up to coincidence and concluded they must have been weak because they were collapsible. So I purchased this pair here, treated them like they where made of glass, and they are still already fracturing after less than a MONTH of use! The plastic part where the ear piece slides up and down is what has started to crack, causing one ear piece to be much less snug than the other, and I KNOW it will eventually just snap off just like my previous pair did. Learn through my experience - DO NOT BUY SKULLCANDY. They look awesome and sound great but WILL BREAK ON YOU IN LESS THAN A YEAR OF REGULAR USE, EVEN WITH THE MOST GENTLE OF TREATMENT.

VSo I got these for a 13 year old as a birthday present. So far it looks stylish as I got the "Dwayne Wade" Edition. The cloth is cheap looking but solid. The only place that really concerns me is the plastic adjustable part that allows your headphones to get smaller or bigger. It seems pretty easy to snap....even a 13 year old could do that. Anyways I just got it a week ago and the sound is good. Bass is solid and higher pitch parts are above average. Make sure you leave some breathing room for year ears though. They are very tight and easily make your ears sweat. Overall I would buy this item again as it was only $31. Although no Bose, I may just buy 7 of them to equal the amount I paid for my bose :)

p1123

VWhen I used to listen to music it was like a surface level sort of thing, I got the music in and that was that. I'd been using Skullcandy headphones for as long as I can remember and had never even considered over the ear until recently. When I first got my buds I thought I had never heard music the right way before, it was just so much more immersive as Skullcandy tends to be. When I bought this product it happened again, I rediscovered sounds in my favorite songs that I didn't know were there, minor nuances that just made the sound a much more enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and any and all consumers as well. Great quality as always from Skullcandy.

p1129

VThis a great pair of headphones. They are low priced for the great quality of sound they put out. The volume can get loud so it would be a good idea to moderate the volume level. These headphones do a good job of canceling out other noises by you.  They look stylish and feel soft. My only complaint would be the size. They do feel a bit small on the head and around the neck. Good thing they're adjustable. The only other thing that would be a deciding factor is if you like how they cup your entire ear inside. Not to mention the cord to insert them into your MP3 player is a bit long which can get annoying.  But if you're looming for a great pair of headphones at a low price, this is the pair to get.

VOkay, these headphones are O.K. they have good low end beats and the sound isn't distorted when the volume on the ipod nano is on full. I'll give u a quick pros and cons chart.  Pros:-great low end beats-compact-extremely comfortable if you have a small head-handles high volume  Cons:-cheap plastic-this probably doesn't go for most people, but i have a hearing loss so I cant listen to loud music, so i have the volume low. But when the volume is low, the beat cancels out the other noise such as synth, if you listen to house or dubstep like i do. Sure, if the volumes loud it's still crisp.-uncomfortable around the neck.

VAfter reviewing several different options, I chose to go with these due to the price and the specs. This was my first pair of Skullcandy headphones. I usually spend the extra money and go with top of the line sound products such as Bose or Sony. I knew they would sound good, but I was very pleased after using them for just the first time. I didn't realize these headphones would do so well with noise cancellation. The sound from these things boom! I've used them for music and also with my PS3 for loud sound at night. They are very dynamic and put out loud sound even when just hooked up to my mp3 player. I've already ordered my second pair of Skullcandy headphones.

VMy husband and I both bought a pair of these head phones so that we could listen to music while in the school library.  When the head phones are on you can't hear anything from outsiders and outsiders aren't bothered by your music.  We have had our headphones for over 9 months and these have certainly held up to the test of time and the use and abuse that comes with our daily commute.  They are super comfortable, I can wear my head phones for hours at a time (which is really good when I'm writing a mid term).  Recently my husband has started wearing them outside when he is doing yard care, and they are really good at muting out the sound of the machinery.

VI put these on my wish list because my old Sony earphones had the fake leather peeling off all the time and leaving little black bits in my hair/ear. I ended up getting these as a present for my birthday.These Skullcandy Hesh headphones sound pretty good but the build quality is poor. Less than a week of having them the fake leather is peeling away from the headphone cup. At least its not leaving bits of stuff on me but it wont be long before the other side starts to do this I imagine. Has it hindered my ability to listen to music? No, not yet, but if the thing starts coming undone within a week or owning then I dont recommend it to others.

VBrittle and broke pretty easily
p1163
sg5
VHonestly I can be pretty rough on headphones. But these stayed at the office and were only dropped once or twice. the really skinny piece of plastic that allows the band to be lengthened snapped (not that big of a surprise). I got mine for ~$30. I see them listed for over $100 for some reason.??? I wouldn't speed nearly that much on these even if I didn't think they would just break again.Sound quality was decent for over the ear. Ok bass, that didn't buzz or rumble too much. Decent treble. If you want to give some one a nicer (looking) pair of headphones for a gift and not be upset if they break, these would probably work great.

p1169

VI love SkullCandy headphones, but was a little disappointed at how stiff the ear covers are on these headphones. It makes wearing them for long periods of time a little uncomfortable, and sometimes painful so that I can't wear them anymore and have to take a break. I am going to see if I can replace the ear covers with a softer more cushioned cover, but if not then I will be purchasing new headphones somewhere down the line.Also when I bought these they were around $50, what a waste of money now that they're cheaper!!Other than that they have great sound, I love that the cord is covered in a cloth lining - it makes it more durable!

VIf you have gauges, these will hurt your ears. If your ears stick out even a little bit, these will hurt your ears :'( i have 16mm gauges and cannot use these for long periods of time otherwise my ears start throbbing. It feels like they're squishing my ears into my skull. At this point, I prefer Apple's crappy earbuds and if I cant find those, I'll wear these around my neck but it's not comfortable so it doesn't last long. I've had them for a year and continue to try to use them but it always fails so they just sit in a box for the most part :( sucks because i love these so much and really dont want to buy a new pair of headphones.

VGreat Quality for the Price
p1187
sg5
VI found that the Skull Candy Headphones were very stylish and received a number of compliments on them. For the low price I purchased them for, the quality of sound and noise cancellation were excellent. Also, they arrived at the exact projected date in wonderful packing condition. However, upon wearing them upwards of 60 min, they become annoyingly uncomfortable and can sometimes cause a headache. If one plans to wear them for less than an hour at a time, they are a great value. Unfortunately, they are not exactly dorm-friendly, as you must wear headphones in order to watch movies or listen to music for long periods of time.

VThese do leak sound, but if all you're going for is style, these are the right headphones. They are also a little tight on the head, but it's really something you get used to (or over, after the first couple wears). Very durable. I'm not some sort of audiophile, but I still love these headphones. I had a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s before, and they were pretty much equivalent to these headphones in everything except comfort and style (they were way more comfortable, but less stylish). In the end, you really are just paying for the brand, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Skullcandy never fails to shine in terms of looks.

VThese headphones are amazing.  My son cannot hear a word I'm saying (which is great for him bad for me) and the sound is crystal clear.  Another good thing I noticed is the cord is wrapped with this fabric material instead of the usual rubber or plastic that ends up bending and tearing. My son uses it on an old 3G iphone with no problem.  My husband had trouble getting a good plug in and working properly with his iphone 4 w/ otterbox.  I haven't tested it myself to see if it's the cable plug in what but the quality of the sound is wonderful.  The price is low enough compared to others like this.  I highly recommend!

The cushion is really good, its size is ajdustable, even the cord quality is way superior than others..!!With this headphone i can listen to really noisy/loud music without feeling pain and without hurting my ear.I recomend you buy this product..!!

So, I did the  thing that everyone else does, I sent them into skullcandy headquarters for evelauation. So I have been waiting...and waiting...AND waiting for them to give me the heads up that they have recieved the damn things and say that they will send me a replacement set. NOPE, I have been waiting since APRIL for them to send me at least an email or text or SOMETHING. I sent them emails and emails and emails.

VWith so many great reviews I was really looking forward to receiving a really solid pair of headphones. But I didn't think these Skullcandy headphones were as good as people said they'd be. Personally I thought it was too heavy on the bass, which I found ok for hip hop and r&b; but not really suitable for other genres. However, for the price I can't really complain though because really really good headphones run hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. So overall I'm pleased with what I got based on the low price I paid through Amazon, but otherwise if you pay retail price then I don't think it's worth it.

p1221
sg5
VI just recieved my Hesh Skullcandy Headphones yesterday and I already love them.  They came with a carrying sack and they are very good for noise cancellation.  While it doesn't cancel all outside noise, it is sufficient.  The only bad thing I can say about these headphones is that they aren't quite as loud as I would like, the maximum volume isn't very loud.  The bass also leaves something to be desired, but it is pretty good for the price of these headphones.  I would definitely recommend these to someone else.  Now to see if they're like all other skullcandy headphones and don't stand up to time.

VThese Hesh headphones are decent for the price, but they are uncomfortable. They squeeze your head a lot and the padding is hard and irritating. Makes long listening sessions almost unbearable. The construction is cheap plastic, and the sound gets distorted as the volume increases. But for the price, they are pretty good. I suggest lower volume listening, so that you get better overall sound. They look stylish, but for $60 I bet you can find better. Look for brands like audio technica, sennheiser, and grado. If you aren't an audiophile, then these are great. If you are, go for something else.

VI bought these headphones from Bestbuy about a year ago. I put in hours of research trying to find the best bang for my buck. I came across these and i really liked the style and power so i grabbed them. About 8 months into owning them i was putting them on and they snapped... Thankfully Bestbuy let me get a new pair because they were still under warranty. All in all i am very pleased with these and will continue to use Skullcandy. Just remember to be careful putting them on. The way they feel on your head is very nice but takes a bit to get used to. Buy this and you won't be disappointed!

VI will get right to the point, I only have a few things to say about these headphones after I have used them for about 5 hours watching movies, tv shows, listening to music and playing video games on my computer.PRO: soft ear pads, very nice crisp sound undistorted by excessive base, the look is good and they do wonders to keep sound out.CON: there to tight around my head, they compress the cartilage in the back of my ear and it hurts after about 1 to 2 hours or so, but I knew about that before I bought them from other reviews. If it worn't for that one thing; I'd give it 5 of 5 stars.

VI loved these headphones for a few months, just given the great sound.I however like wearing my headphones around my neck while i'm not listening to them, but the cups do not have enough swivel to complement the bulkiness. The material connecting the cups to the headband doesn't help either.  They are held together by a thing plastic that starts cracking and eventually breaks. Sure you can tape them up, but then you can't adjust them.Again, I love the sounds, and of course the look, but for the price, even with warranty they are hardly worth the trouble.

VA great headset but I do feel that for the price of $50 there are way better things out there.Sound quality is worth the $50 and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with that. For me however, the sound is all it's worth. The headset itself feels flimsy and is made of cheap plastic. The parts where it extends tend to break and because of that you need to be very careful about where you put them down and how you wear them. If you have a rather large head like I do, this may not be a good idea.All in all an ok headset. But one you need to be super careful with.

VAt first, I loved my Hesh Skullcandy Metallica headphones.  With the tight ear pads and in-line volume control they were the perfect match for my treadmill TV watching.  However, because the sliders for the headphones are plastic they cracked and became broken.  Now my headhphones are useless.So even though in the short-term I enjoyed them, they did not last without breaking.  In looking at the Skullcandy website, I noticed that most of their overear headphones have plastic sliders.  This is something that clearly needs improvement.

The sound is perfectly fine for headphones, and I'm willing to splurge abit just for a brand name. I admit they did get uncomfy after awhile, but that was because of my small hoop earrings pressing into my ears. Flip them in, or take them off. Otherwise, beautiful.My only big issue was the fact we didn't have enough for everyone in the house!

If you are on a budget, and only want to spend around $25, look up the Monoprice 8323, they will have the same durability, but will sound almost twice as good for $25 then these do and they are selling at $50+.

VSkullcandy Hesh is a very good quality. I was very satisfied with my purchase even after a couple months of use. However, these headphones are not very comfortable for prolonged listening sessions. The plastic headband is soft. Later I noticed a small crease on both sides. This crease continued to grow until the cups completely dislodged and held on by only copper wires. However, the headphones failed during the return policy period, so I got refund thankfully. I would buy HESH again if Skullcandy improves in the plastic quality.

The bass is there but it's not over powering the rest of the important parts of the song (Cough cough beats). They aren't that comfy, infact after 20-30 minutes they started to hurt my ears. But remember they are around the ear. Overall I recommend these headphones for regular listeners or anyone on a tight budget. Keep in mind that these retail for $60 elsewhere!

They are pretty snug and tight on my head though but maybe I just have to wear them in a bit, they are stiff straight out of the box and I do have a big head. Good sound though!!!

They're really much nicer then I thought they would be and have a good heft to them which gives me the impression of strong materials.  These are good headphones hands down.

VThis Product is Amazing!! Its built pretty sturdy, the material feels nice, and it fits pretty nice! For $35 on amazon compared to $50 dollars at zumiez this is a great buy! It shipped pretty fast even with the Free Shipping option and they sound great! Wouldn't mind buying another pair sometime! :) Great Product overall, the only thing is that after awhile your ears get kind of hot so you have to ventilate them a little bit! But I don't mind that so for me they work perfect!

VGood Sound Quality, For the Price
p1363
sg5
VI purchased these because they'd been recommended to me by a friend. In hindsight I probably should have gotten the DJ-style headphones, because they collapse and are therefore more portable. Although these headphones are very comfortable for the most part, they are a tight fit (width-wise) and tend to be snug on the ears. This is good in the sense that they won't fall off, but bad because they get uncomfortably tight very fast. Otherwise a decent product, for the price.

VI got this delivered in a timely fashion as always, coming from Amazon. At first I didn't like them because they made my ears heat up too fast and didn't envelop my ear as I would've like. After about a week though it became better. The sound on it is nice, rap music, rock or whatever, the sound is always nice. The sound also doesn't leak that much, so you can listen to decently loud music and not bother your surrounding. It's a nice purchase for the price.

VThese headphones sound very nice, the clarity and tone are great.  Additionally they are pretty comfortable on the head and not too heavy. I also like the looks, kinda funky but fun.  Almost all headphones sound better than simple ear buds but I was not able to actually compare them to high-dollar brands.Overall I am happy with the purchase and would recommend them for someone wanting a nice sound with worring about them getting stolen or misplaced.

VI had two pairs of skullcandy hesh headphones and I'm unsatisfied with them. They look cool when you wear it but for me that was about it. The sound was okay  it wasn't good but it wasn't bad. The thing i dislike about this headphone is they hurt your ears after 10 minutes. Not only that they brake really easily. Both my headphones broke after two months of usage. But, the good thing about this headphone is that it is not expensive for a headphone.

You definitely get more than you what you pay for in my opinion. The bass is amazing. However it does not affect the quality of any other sound in my songs. You don't need to listen to these at full volume like I normally do because they are LOUD and amazing.

So I bought these as a replacement and was thankful I could find the same headphones online.  The process was easy and arrived quickly and she loves them!

VAt first, they were great. The sound quality was great and everything, but after a while, only one side of the headphones worked. I found out it was because the wires on the inside were very small and kept breaking. I got it fixed, but 2-3 days later it broke again. I don't really abuse my headphones, so I was pretty mad. I don't reccomend buying these headphones unless you really like the look, cuz that's what you're paying for.

VThese headphones are very nice looking and the sound quality is good for the price.

If you're looking for high-end sound then these are not the headphones for you, but if you want an affordable, good (not great) set of headphones, these will do just fine.

VFor the price you pay the quality of the sound is amazing. The clarity of the music is amazing and good for the price the only thing lacking is the plastic that makes up the headphones. It is cheap and when used everyday on a normal basis the plastic tends to give up and can form cracks which eventually can break. The last problem is the cups, they hurt the ear when used for more then 30 to 40 minutes.

The sound quality is superb, the design is great, and they fit and form very comfortably to size.  Only drawback is that they are easily breakable because of the plastic design.  I highly recommend it to any music lover.

VThe moment I pulled these headphones out of the packaging and plugged them in, they were ALREADY broken! The sound only comes out of the left side of the headphones and it is a terrible quality sound as well. I am incredibly disappointed as my boyfriend has a wonderful pair of Hesh Skullcandies and I really wanted a pair of my own. I guess I never will at this point, because I'll never be buying from Skullcandy again.

VThis headphones are awesome, cheap in price, and you can buy much more expensive Seinheiser ones that sound a lot less powerful that this ones. They isolate surrounding noise very well, and the bass is powerful yet not intrusive in the quality of the music. They also look great, GREAT HEADPHONES; GREAT GIFT!

VI was really attracted to these because of the Boston Celtic team colors and KG as the featured player.  It is top notch Skullcandy performance as over ear headphones and sounded great.  Only problem I had was that the head band is made of plastic and didn't adjust too much. I wear a size 8 cap and these headphones were on the tight end when I put them on.

VSqueezes AROUND the ears too much.
p2355
sg5
VI got these headphones for myself as a Christmas gift.  I've been wanting some "real" headphones because I just got tired of how pathetic earbuds are.First the GOOD:  The sound is good, pretty much what I was expecting from earphones of that size/price.THE BAD:  Despite its padding, and despite breaking them in, these headphones squeeze in AROUND the ears too much (not the actual ears).  I can actually feel the pulse of my heart beat push through the pressure the earphones are creating.  It's very uncomfortable after just 5 minutes or so, which is unacceptable because, I mean, who the hell only wants to listen to 5 minutes of music.  I put a large bottle in between the speakers so as I'm not using them, it will slowly break in the phones so they aren't so stiff.  Even though they are significantly looser now, they still restrict the blood flow around my ears.  I shouldn't be able to feel my heartbeat through my freaking ears/head when I'm trying to listen to music.IN THE END:  Good sound, but too uncomfortable to wear long enough to enjoy anything.  For $50, that's kinda BS.  Unfortunately for me, I can't find the receipt.  If you buy this, SAVE THE RECEIPT.  I wanted to give 1.5, but I guess 2 stars from this reviewer.

VSuggest AVOID SkullCandy Over The Ear headphones
p2378
sg5
VI would strongly suggest avoiding these SkullCandy over-the-ear headphones.First, they sound terrible.  Listening to a favorite piece of music, suddenly I'd open my eyes and say "Where is it?"  There would be pieces of music simply missing.  They sound muddy and bass-heavy, and just plain awful.. especially when you have to wonder what pieces of the music you aren't hearing at all.To top the experience off, they broke!  (No great loss!!)  Flimsy construction of earpiece holders.  One just snapped (and it was under no significant pressure.)SkullCandy in general is now on my Do Not Buy list, as I consider them a rip-off.  I replaced these crummy $58 (approx) set with a $20 (approx) pair of Sennheisers Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black) and all my music is back.  They're *much* cleaner, more accurate, more comfortable, and from past experience with Sennheiser they will be rugged and long-lasting.I can't imagine quite whom the target audience is.  Perhaps those who have never heard even a reasonable set of headphones?Hope this review helps someone else avoid a similar disappointment!

p2556
sg5
VI brought these about a month or two ago. At first I was one happy camper as the sound quality was great - WAY better than my old Sony MDR-V250s to be sure! Before purchase I'd read some of the reviews warning about the weak plastic pillars but just blew them off. Dumb move on my part for lo and behold not two weeks later it happened to me on the right side! It hadn't cracked all the way through yet, mind you, but was clearly headed in that direction. The left side wasn't looking too hot either. I considered returning them, but riding the train home from work I saw a girl with the EXACT SAME model headphones as mine. She'd wrapped duct tape around both the pillars so I just decided to do the same. Didn't really want to go through the hassle of a return, and after all the audio, at least, is first rate...Bottom line...I really can't recommend these. Sure they SOUND good but for the price you pay, the construction should be much much sturdier. Neither my Sony MDR-V250s nor my XD100s have fallen apart like this and I've had both of those for far longer while paying way less!

VExcellent Low-Price Headphones
p2688
sg5
VI have been using these headphones for approximately one month now, and I am pleased with my purchase.  The sound quality is some of the best I have ever had for paying $35 dollars for headphones, and is an incredible improvement over the $30 (vastly overpriced, and utterly crappy) Apple ear-buds. They have the typical good quality of parts that Skullcandy is known for, and they feel solid and fairly sturdy. These headphones DO NOT have any significant noise cancellation when you are not listening to music, but they were not advertised with that capability, so I was not expecting much. When you are listening to music you hear almost nothing else. My only complaint with these headphones is that, because I have a rather large head, they put some pressure on the top of my head, which can get uncomfortable over time, but it is not anything serious.Overall, this is a great product and an excellent purchase for anyone looking at budget headphones. I absolutely recommend these headphones.

V$50 Dollar Junk Headphones
p2718
sg5
VI remember reading the posts about how they break easily and I figured that most of the posters must be negligent, but I've been proven wrong.I bought the headphones for myself as a X-Mas gift just to have one side crack while I was placing them over my head. LITERALLY. Not even a month and they broke up going over my head.A week later and that side has snapped off completely. Now... it's not like these were even my daily wear headphones, I only wore them when working from home and the sad truth is my dollar store headphones, and $13 Skype headphones have lasted over a year.Why the bass was great and the noise cancellation was unbeatable what's the point if you pay $50 for a month? Unless Beats by Dre are actually durable and worth the money not only have these headphones turned me off from Skull Candy forever, but perhaps all premium headphones.Good riddance...

VOverpriced at Retail
p2723
sg5
VThis pair of headphones was $50 originally, but through discounts and promotional offers, I got them for $12.  I'd say they're definitely worth $12, but far from being $50 quality.  The sound is pretty good for the price, but that's pretty much the end of the pros.Cons: Ear cups will likely crimp the edges of your ears which can be irritating after 20 minutes and very painful after an hour; cord is very short; the headband is connected to the cups in a way that makes the headphones sit extra-wide on your head, looking a bit goofy; no volume control within the headphones themselves, you have to rely on the source; virtually no noise-canceling--certain external sounds actually seem louder when the headphones are on, albeit distorted; small amount of sound leak.Once again, everything above being said, they're worth $12, DEFINITELY not worth more than $25.  Skullcandy's $10 earbuds are a much better value and very similar sound quality.

VSkullcandy hesh black/blue review.
p2771
sg5
VI am a 15 year old kid and I bought a pair of skullcandy skullcrushers a couple months ago and they still work perfectly but I just got the hesh yesterday and I would like to say for 34$ it's an amazing deal it has great sound quality and the bass is tight. They do cancel out voice very well and I Do prefer these over the skullcrushers because it has better sounding bass and the sound quality is almost the same and that's a 20$ difference plus te hesh feel more durable but what sucks the more u adjust them the more stress there is at te top of the headband and they stay on your head great! My problem is that I have big ears and it doesn't completely cup my big ears but oh well I would still recommend these to anyone on a budget (like I am) but if u pay over 45$ for these go with sony headphones or sennheiser. Oh I almost forgOt they do leak some sound not a lot but I mainly use them to run and to ride my bike and they are great!

p2865
sg5
VBefore I bought these headphones i read tons of reviews about them because my music quality is really important to me and i wanted to make sure i was making the right choice. With these headphones, i made the best choice without a doubt. I've read reviews about how they hurt you're ears and are uncomfortable. I'm sorry, but thats a bunch of bull. They are extremely comfortable and i can wear them for hours without any problems what so ever. The music quality is very very impressive, i love using them whenever i can. The bass in them is fantastic, but also isn't overwealming and does not distort the music. If you love enjoying your music, and are looking for a quality pair of headphones, you've found them. And for $35-$45 are you kidding me? enter your credit card number right now and get these headphones. The only problem you should have is deciding what color you should get. Enjoy!!

VI managed to get these headphones on sale for $40 and am pretty satisfied with them so far.  The sound quality is great for the price I got it for and further tweaking with an equalizer can further enhance these headphones.  Outside noise is reduced quite a bit and is almost eliminated completely when listening to music at a reasonable volume.  My only complaint is that these headphones aren't quite the most comfortable and the cord for them is a bit short at about 3-4 feet.  They press down on your head a good amount and the pleather headphone coverings get kind of hot after a while.  Overall I think they're a good kind of middle ground headphones.  Comfort may be a bit lacking but their quality is quite a bit above other cheap headphones that I've tried.

VMuddy sound, OK price
p3148
sg5
VI bought these mostly based on price and the microphone and somewhat on reviews.  They seem to work OK, but I find the round over-the-ear design doesn't fit my ears very well (they're more oval ;) and the clamping force is pretty high, although not terribly so.  I only gave them 2 stars because from the very first they sounded "muddy" to me.  They play plenty loud and have plenty of bass, but the sound is just muffled, or something.  I have other inexpensive headphones that sound better to me, so I wouldn't go with these again.  I should note that I have mostly used them with an adapter cable to plug them into my computer(s), so it's possible that the adapter could be causing the bad sound, but I did plug them directly into an Android tablet with similar results, so I don't think it is the adapter.

VThe first pair of these I bought fit comfortably. The sound quality was pretty good, but although the cups fit over my entire ear, they let in more outside noise than I wanted them to (used on my daily ferry/bus/street commute). Returned the first pair when edge of the vinyl ear pad cover started to come out from under the hard plastic cover on one side after less than a month (exchanged for a new set). When the second pair started to do the same thing, I took them back too - the clerk was unsurprised, indicated they got a lot of that with the Skullcandy headphones. Didn't give them a third strike, decided to try another brand instead.

That is, in part, why I went for these.  I can't believe all of the possitive reviews.  I'm very disappointed.The sounds were distorting and the bass was weak, even when I messed with EQ levels and moderate volume levels.

VThese are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever had the displeasure of owning.  They place a constant pressure pincering onto my skull, and my ears dont fit within the cushioned hollows so I have to fold them in or adjust constantly to get sort of a smooshed ear fit.  Im an average sized adult male, these should fit much better.Sound is adequate, single sided cord is nice.  Rest of headphones feel too large and plasticy, but also fragile.  Hoping to return them tomorrow after just a few houes of ear torturing ownership.

VI ordered these as a gift for my brother because he produces music and is a huge miami heat fan. I figured what a great way to combine both of the things that he loves sports and music. He used them when producing beats. My brother indicated that he loved thie sound quality of them, however he didn't use them that often as he obtained so better quality studio headphones. Overall I would say due to my brother liking them I will give them four stars. They are a decent set of headphones, not high quality though. I would recommend them to anyone looking for headphones on a budget or just something temporarily.

She plugged them into the TV at night to listen to movies without making much noise but couldn't get %100 sound without holding down the volume knob. Very strange. That's the only minus we have on them. They look great, feel great, and have AWESOME sound! No better headphones for your mobile electronics!

If you do decide to purchase a pair of these headphones you must remove them carefully otherwise they'll break in time. Since I got no reply from the seller I have reattached the earphone using zip ties which will only last until I find another suitable pair. This time I'll be more careful. Buyer beware.

Cons: Material is a bit flimsy looking, after about an hour and a half of usage and they began to hurt the outer ear.

(after 15 minutes, your ears start to get sore) they came in perfect condition from the seller, so its not their fault that these broke like they did.

VI got the Shattered Rasta, design is cool.Pro'sDecent sound quality and bass to the untrained ear.1 wire from the left side onlyFull over head paddingAdjustableCon'sTight after wearing them for a while. A while being 50 minutes+Not as much bass as I wantedFor $32 it's a good buy. They were too tight for me though so I sold the Hesh and got Skullcrushers.Skullcrushers are the better buy for $10 more on here. <--Insane BASS & more comfy

VI bought these head phones thinking that they would be comfortable around my ears...... They are not! After about 20 minutes my ears are hurting and I have to constantly shift them around just so that I can stop the pain that is caused by them. I wear a 7 1/8" hat so i dont think my head is too big. These head phones are just not comfortable.

VThese headphones were the best until a couple of days ago I was putting them on and they snapped!!!! The headband is made completely out of plastic!!!!If u want "temporary" headphones then I suggest these, if not, then get some aerial7 tank like I just did right now.Good bass, good sound, cheaply made.

VA moment of peace for the best/most durable headphones I have ever owned...
p3456
sg5
VThese were definitely my favorite style/model of headphone by SkullCandy. Sad to see that they have been discontinued :( I had my last pair for a good 4 years before my son snapped an earpiece. The one thing I might upgrade in regards to this product is wireless capability. I would still purchase this pair over a newer wireless pair though. Thanks for such high quality products, SkullCandy!

VThese aren't bad cans but they don't surround your ear and are very uncomfortable. Only reason I got them was a warranty replacement. My sennheiser hd 202's sound 10 times better and were only $23. If you are used to good sounding music these aren't for you. If you wanna look cool have at it lol

VHurts your ears. Literally broke after ~4 months
p3467

VFirst off, I would like to point out these pair of headphones are horribly made. The bad shape hurts your ears, unlike most other headphones.Second, this piece of crap literally FELL APART after 4 months. BOTH hinges SNAPPED off one day when i put them on. WTF?Sound is pretty decent and loud. But that's probably i have a beats computer...

VI got this in March. I didn't like it at first because it wasn't very comfortable and it rested on my jaw hinges, but I kind of got used to it. The sound quality is good, but nothing to boast about. After a road trip, I fond the right ear of the headphone detached and now pretty much unusable. I'm not sure how this happened, but I'm sure not buying this again.

p3484

VGot them earlier this month. Love the quality of the sound, I love the DJ/Studio headphone style, BUT they break unbeliveably easialy. This is my second pair. broke in the exact same place as last time. The arms are very flimsy despite how the might look and feel. I STRONGLY recommend Adjusting the headphones to a comfortable size then coat the arms in super glue, then fill the ENTIRE area with hot glue. Then cover the hot glue with duct tape, preferably black. The wire is very thin and brittle, if an arm breaks it won't be long before it cuts the wire.On another note, these things get REALLY loud, and they leak. Everyone around you can hear what you are listening to, and you can hear them too. Even though they are over the ear they do nothing to block out outside noise and they might as well be speakers. The sound quality is amazing for the price. I spent a little under $30.If you do decide to do what i did with the tape and glue, make SURE you get them comfortable first, they might be comfortable at first, but the get uncomfortable real fast, i suggest making it slightly bigger than you think you should.

VI purchased this as a gift for Christmas. My cousin loved it! Great price for a great product. We tested it out and it worked great. It is cushiony and comfortable to wear. He uses it all the time! I also like the color compared to the others (easy to match with outfits). It doesn't look or feel cheap. Great for the price. I would definitely recommend!
