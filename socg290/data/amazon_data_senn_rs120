VI like the RS-120 wireless headphones. Light weight, comfortable, good sound. Work well on my treadmill. I like the fact that I can simply place them back on the attractive stand and they are automatically connected to the charger. I do not have to connect a charger cord. The instructions say that they cannot over-charge. They are expensive, however.

VNot What I Expected
p14
sg5
VThis is my first wireless headphone purchase so I can't say if the problems I experienced are inherent in all wireless headphones or are unique to these phones.  Nor can I say for sure if there was interference specific to my home.  I certainly am no audiophile but I have to say I was disappointed in my overall listening experience.  There is a very distinct humming sound in the headphones.  It is particularly  noticeable during periods of silence.  I found the playback quality of the music to be acceptable, but the crackle and humming very annoying.  I tried to no avail, to tune the noise out by changing to each of the three available channels.  Of course the music drowns out the background noise but the silent portions of a track or album are often a significant part of the overall listening experience.

VGreat Headphones, and you can listen to the neighbors !
p20
sg5
VLike many have said these are great sounding headphones with good build quality. The ability to recharge them by just hanging them on the stand is a good idea and the sound quality is excellent for something this price.I think the equipment works on the 900mhz frequency and it is capable of picking up one half of a conversation on a 900mhz cordless telephone. Because the phone works on two similar but separate channels you won't get both sides of the conversation. I was surprised to hear the neighbors coming through the headset when I had my PC (the sound source) turned off. If you use a newer 2.4ghz or 5ghz phone this won't be an issue, but if you have a 900mhz baby monitor or cordless phone there might be some bleed through. Luckily there is a fine tune wheel on the side of the headset and you can lock your own signal in. Oh the whole very impressed and worth 5 stars at the price.

VNot for office or bedroom
p26
sg5
VWhile these headphones offer unbelievable wireless range/reception and really good FM stereo sound - they are not for a quiet office or listening at night with your spouse sleeping next to you. Their "open-air" design bleeds all the sound out of the headphones - so if you're listening close to even mid-level volume: your co-workers will hear and be distracted/annoyed by your music and your spouse will kick you out of bed. They are just too "open" to use in a quiet environment where you don't want to disturb surrounding people.Pros:- lighter than they look- super long range and and great reception- easy to charge- sound like clear FM stereo radio- crisp highs, decent midsCons:- cheap look and feel- transmitter base is ugly cheap-looking plastic with a tall gyroscope-yoyo metal thing to hold and charge the headphones- weak bass- sound bleeds out of headphones distracting those around youUnexpected amusing feature:- adjusting the tuning enables you to hear people's phone conversations.Overall: Get these if you need long-range wireless headphones that are loud and sound great and where disturbing others will not be a concern.If you need wireless headphones for a quiet environment (at a similar price and quality) I would recommend the Sony MDR-IF540RK Wireless Headphones.

VDisappointing reception
p32
sg5
VSeems like the reviews on Amazon for this product fall in two categories - 5 star love-fests and 1-star complaints of reception.  I'm afraid this review falls into the latter category.  I'm using these headphones literally 8 feet from the receiver, and I hear distortion when I turn my head or just when something in the universe shifts and causes these headphones to make a high pitched noise.  Also, you have to get them balanced PERFECTLY on the cradle to charge - otherwise the little charging light goes out.The name implies German quality, but these are Made in China, and seem very cheap and poorly engineered.  Back to Amazon they go...

VThese headphones have some good points:  comfort, easy set-up out of the box, good directions, and they are attractive.  Unfortunately, I hear a constant HISSS  when wearing them. Not always a loud hiss, but always detectable, and sometimes quite annoying. This may be the nature of the FM signal.  Also, I get about 20-30 feet from the base & I start getting annoying interference (I would estimate the range to be just shy of the distance from my sofa to my bathroom).  Last, if the phones don't detect a signal, they go to LOUD WHITE NOISE!!!!!!!!!  Don't try muting the commercials!!

VThe sound from these is very good, as long as it stays tuned in to the base which for me wasn't very long at a time. They have an analog tuner on the headphones that you tune into the frequency of the base. It was like an old car radio from the seventies and before, every time I'd turn my head I'd have to readjust them. I wasn't far from the base either, generally within 5 feet. There was a constant hiss in the background all the time also. I have a $20 cordless phone that hisses less than these did.

VUnusable because of Auto Shutoff
p50
sg5
VThese headphones work for about 10 minutes and then the wireless sender shuts off and the headphones start blasting loud white noise into your ears. To reset it, you need to get up from the couch, walk up to the sender, unplug (!) the sender from the sound source. Ten minutes later, you'll get another blast of white noise.This seems to be caused by what a Sennheiser "engineer" thought was a good idea: Auto-Shutoff. If the sound source signal is low for a while, the sender thinks that there's no sound to transmit and shuts off. The receiver in the headphone loses the signal and starts blasting white noise at a level that drives you up the wall. Apparently, at Sennheiser labs, their "engineers" only watch movies with explosions every 60 seconds, so this problem doesn't manifest itself. How this terrible design can pass any form of QA is beyond me. And of course there's no way to override this feature with a switch, because Sennheiser knows what's good for us.This shoddy product went straight back to Amazon.

VI purchased these because I have hearing loss, and some shows are aggravatingly difficult for me to hear at ANY volume. This has been a good solution for me, and for the sanity of others in the home, too. In fact, I bought a second, much more expensive pair of earphones from a the same manufacturer (for use in a bother room), but the second pair was specifically made for assisting in TV viewing. These actually work better for me at less than half the price.Pros:*Comfortable*Rechargeable*Good sound*On-board volume controlCons:*Not adjustable for tightness, and they're a little loose on me*No on-board tone control (ideal for me would be to have a treble control)*Full-sized, so it make it difficult to rest the head on a pillow, etc.

VI'm going to keep it nice and simple. I bought this headphone a week ago here on Amazon and LOVE it! It has exceeded my expectations.1. it's very light and the ear pods are very comfortable. the headphones are well balanced once worn.2. the battery life is great! I charged it the full 24 hours initially and am now going to use it until it completely drains. Three of these cycles should ensure the best battery performance as memory effect will be reduced in subsequent chargings.3. the range so far has been great. I can use it all over my house without any deadspots. I've even gone to the end of the driveway without any problems....soon I'll try farther out to see what she/he can do!4. I have not had any of the interference issues some have had, but it can be easily corrected with a frequency adjustment5. All in all, I think this is one of the best items I've ever bought on Amazon and I find myself using it all the time.

VBefore ordering this headphone I read very carefully previous reviews. The reviews I read were helpful, well written and I was stimulated to write my own. There were basically two groups of reviews, one being highly complimentary of the RS-120 and the other group complained about noise, hiss, and comfort. My own review falls in the first group. However I must say that noise and hiss can happen in some environments and are not necessarily a problem with the headphone. In fact, it is easy for me to induce noise/hiss when I approach the motor of the refrigerator or I approach the emitter from other electronic equipment. Noise/hiss are nightmares for engineers and sometimes there is not much that we can do to eliminate these problems in the immediate physical world that surrounds us. We need to troubleshoot to get the best location of the emitter in order to enjoy this remarkable set of headphones. And the price at Amazon was a real bargain.

VBefore you get all excited with all of the 5 star reviews, I'd recommend you read the following:Now, before I begin that, for the price, these headphones cannot be beat. The design is absolutely wonderful--it's obviously Sennheiser did their homework on design and the base is very cute and functional.With that, I'd like to add some negatives that some of the other reviews, may or may not have mentioned.1) There IS a noticable hissing sound at pauses/low volume music/movies.  No way to get around this.2) The headphones are designed to be FLAT and not ones that surround your ear. However, they are much more comfortable than my Sennheiser HD497s, but noticably less comfortable than my HD590s.3) The bass is REALLY lacking on these headphones. Please don't believe what any of the other reviewers are saying. I am no audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but the bass is almost non-existant.  The highs and mids are great, but the bass needs work!############ AMAZON USER WARNING #############4) The unit DOES come with an adapter, but the design of the splitter makes it INCOMPATIBLE with most Logitech speaker headphone ports and (some) Dell laptop computers. You may have to go out and buy another one from radio shack!I thought about returning them, but every time I look at them and think about wireless music, I change my mind!@@@@@@@@ WARNING @@@@@@@@@@:AMAZON HAS RAISED THE PRICE BACK TO $99 from $69!Be warned!@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

VI got these wireless headphones primarily so that I can listen to audio at night and not disrupt my girlfriend when she is trying to sleep.  They have worked out wonderfully for this purpose.I have liked other Sennheiser products in the past so I thought I would give these a try.  I should mention that I got these refurbished for under $60.00.  You can purchase a new pair of the RS110 wireless headphones and get the same thing but without one feature I consider important, not having the rechargeable batteries.  Even if you were to install rechargeable batteries on the RS110 model they would not have the ability to be charged by just resting them on the cradle of the transmitter this set has.  That is worth the difference to me right there.  So far I have not needed to change channel settings to get a clear signal so whether it is worth the extra money for the RS120 is difficult to say.  Perhaps if one has a 900MHZ cordless phone it might be a more useful feature to have the ability to change channels to avoid that interference.  There is a cordless 900MHZ phone in my home but it is upstairs away from where I use these and I have not had any issues from it.  It may be a better buy to get the RS110 headphones if you don't need the multiple channels.These headphones have a transmitter which has a small AC adapter that plugs in to the wall to provide power to the base unit which is the transmitter and charger for the batteries located inside the headphones.  The headphones themselves use a pair of AAA rechargeable batteries that are installed by removing one of the foam pads from the headphones to uncover them.  The ear pads come off with a twist to gain access to the batteries and I suppose if ever needed to replace the pads themselves if ever worn out.SOUND: I get very clear sound through these.  I have a home theater which is my primary use for them so I can watch TV or other content on my home theater at night. I have a very nice surround speaker set up and while I do notice a difference between a high end multiple speaker system with a powered subwoofer it is not anything that is an annoying transition to what these are capable of putting out.The ad talks about "Bass Response" as a feature however there is no "Bass Boost" or other way to increase bass on these other than to increase it at the source you have them plugged in to.  The frequency response is 22Hz to 19500Hz and so that is a typical full range of sound although I have noticed some other wireless headphones with slightly lower frequency response such as 20Hz.  I have however played music of various varieties through these and have not had any issues.  I am a musician and like to listen to music and have no issues with the sound from these.  That said if someone absolutely has to have really high amounts of bass these might not be able to deliver that.  For me from TV programming or movies to music I am perfectly happy with the sound from these.  I was only willing to spend so much and do not feel the need to have more than these can deliver and have no plans of saving up for a higher end set.There is a small wheel on one side of the headphones to adjust the volume level on the headphones so you don't have to adjust the volume from the source once they are in use.  Next to that is another adjustment for frequency, this is to tune the headphones in for clarity just as one would do with an analog radio. Once I have done this I have not experienced any static at all.  Even when the headphones are turned on and there is no sound coming through them I do not hear any hiss as some have said they experience.  No complaints on sound of this system from me.COMFORT: I find these very comfortable for wearing for long period of time.  They have flat foam that covers ones ears, I far prefer this to having something going inside my ear or even smaller headphones that rest inside the ear (those types with 1/2 inch or so foam).  As I use these at night and end up often falling asleep I do not wake up with any ear pain which is great.  These are also very lightweight and do not put pressure on the sides of my head from too much tension yet stay on just fine.SOUND ISOLATION: These headphones do not have any fancy noise isolation or noise cancelling functions to them.  They also do not have over the ear surrounds to help seal them to your ears.  This is not an issue for me but it does mean that one could potentially have to turn up the volume on these headphones to overcome any other unwanted sound in the surrounding environment.  Again not an issue for me at all, I could hear someone talking or even like right now I can hear myself typing on the keyboard.  None of that is an issue for me, I have them at pretty low volume and if I wanted would turn them up if I was annoyed.  What environment you are in when using your headphones will dictate what features you might want to have if you don't want to hear any other sounds and have the volume low at the same time.VERSATILITY:  These work great for me for all my uses.  The transmitter comes with RCA connectors which one would use for things like the audio out from a TV or other device that does not have a headphone jack.  The set also comes with an adapter that plugs in to those and turns it in to a full size "phono" plug, the type of connector that large headphones are usually plugged in to.  Then one can pull the large phono jack off to reveal a 3.5mm jack which is what one uses for things like smartphones or most computers or other smaller devices.  So this set up comes with what you need to hook them up to most any device you want to hear audio from.CHARGING:  The transmitter or base part of the unit has large metal holders on top where you hang the headphones when not in use.  There are metal contacts on the inside top of the headphone head strap that when touching the wire metal holder on the base unit charge the batteries in the headphones.  There is a red charging light as well as a green on light on the base transmitter unit.  This is very convenient.  There is also a on/off switch on the headphones themselves so one can turn them off when not in use if you happen to not put them on the charger and avoid risking having the batteries run down. The claimed amount of time the headphones can operate between charges is stated at 20-25 hours.  I have not used them long enough without putting them on the charger to find that out for sure yet.The set does come with a pair of NiMh rechargeable AAA batteries which should last a long time taking many charges.  If you do have to replace them ever just remember to get a pair of rechargeable ones.  These will work if you install regular non-rechargeable AAA batteries which one might do in a pinch but if one does so they should remember that one should not attempt to recharge them.RANGE: These operate off radio frequency (the 900MHZ range) and like any radio signal is designed to easily go through walls and most structures.  I live in a 3 story house and have found that range to be pretty accurate.  There is the occasional short burst of static if I am walking though the house wearing them but I rarely have need to do that.INTERFERENCE: Again I only have one other specific 900MHZ item to deal with in the house.  I do however have loads of home theater and computer equipment in the main room I use them in as well as a large air cleaner unit and do not hear interference from any other devices.So I am very happy with this headphone system. For music do they sounds as good as my really expensive over ear Sennheiser headphones with are corded? No. But those are both not wireless and a LOT more expensive and these still have very acceptable quality sound.  Do these have great sound isolation from hearing any other outside noise? No, but in my case there is not a bothersome noisy environment I have to contend with.  If one wishes to have higher fidelity and or better noise isolation or even noise cancelling then perhaps another set of headphones is going to be necessary to fill those requirements.  For me however these have worked out perfect.  Again I paid under $60 for a refurbished set. I have no regrets and have no trouble recommending these just as long as the noise isolation/cancellation feature is not mandatory.

VI have used these headphones for about 5 months and pretty much hate them, here's why.* the stand allows you to select 3 different discrete frequencies, but the headphones make you tune it in to the right frequency with an analog knob, which is awkward, imprecise and is always getting knocked when I adjust volume.  If there's 3 possible frequency settings on the base, there should be 3 on the headphones.* after a minute of no output from your computer the headphones will generate static VERY loudly into your ears.  Apparently this is to save "battery" life, I'm not sure how generating very loud static saves any battery life, and since all you need to do on your PC to start them up again is press play, so clearly it hasn't turned off the receiver.  If it went dead silent that would be fine, but generating static is annoying/pointless.I'm not an audiophile, I don't care about the sound quality so much, I just want an easy to use pair of wireless headphones, this is not it.

VI looked at many options for headphones to wear in bed while watching TV, DVDs, etc. so that I wouldn't disturb the rest of my family. I ended up buying these and couldn't be happier. Previously I had used a LONG extension cord and some old earbuds, but these over the ear models give far superior stereo sound, are extrememly lightweight and comfortable (and adjustable), and the battery charge lasts many, many hours. The charging stand is elegant; you just drop the headphones onto it, and they begin charging through the contacts. No fuss at all. The headphones have a volume control and a tuning control. Once tuned to a clear frequency, the sound is pure and hiss free. I have been using them at a distance of about 12 feet, but have wandered into other  rooms with them without loss of signal or quality. I highly recommend them.

VI would think twice before buying anything more from Sennheiser.  I am a gadget hound. I purchased their headsets and, frankly they worked great, for about 3 weeks before they stopped working.  I contacted the customer service organization, I sent them my headsets and base for repair, 4 weeks later, they sent me a brand new headset.  *** THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT THEY NEVER RETURNED THE BASE ***.  I've contacted them 6 times so far.  One of the times they said they were going to return the base to me but they never responded after that (no base was sent).  It has now been close to 10 months... and multiple attempts to contact them... no replies... no base... wish I kept my money (plenty of other options out there.) I am writing this review after being kept on hold for 59 minutes on their customer service line.

VMy wife's idea of watching TV is to turn it on loud enough to hear it across the house and then do other things while listening to it in the background.  This bugs the crap out of me.  I avoid TV like the plague and I especially don't want to hear it in the background 24/7.  My logical arguments and rational reasoning did nothing to pursuade her to turn it off and listen to something else like say commercial free classical music.  Anyway, as a last resort I bought her these head phones.  It worked like a charm!!!  This model was probably overkill for TV listen but I was desperate and didn't want to take any chances.  I would definetly buy another pair if something happen to these.  The sound quality is fantastic and the range is far better than I expected.  The signal is clear as a bell all the way out to the street.  She doesn't even turn on the TV anymore.  She tunes in the channel she wants to listen to through the DVD/VCR player.  No more unnecessary heat production and power consumption.  I don't even know it is on.  Can't say much about the longevity as I have only had them for 3 weeks.  But as of now I recommend these head phones to anyone in a similar situation.

If I get more that 30 ft away with a wall or window between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference.  Occaisionally I hear other peoples phone conversations on the headphone.  Nevertheless I'm pretty happy with them and I'm sure my wife and even the neighbors are happy I no longer have to turn the TV up to 11.

VI have had these headphones for about 2 years, and so far I am very satisfied with them.  I use them to mostly listen to programs Tivo has recorded whilst I cruise around the house taking care of chores and such.  Makes such chores much less painful to do.  The only tiny quirk is you will quickly learn that when you place the headset back on the base, to make sure it's hanging correctly (ie, touching the metal correctly) and the red charging light is on before you leave.  I have several other Sennheiser wireless headphone models and love them all.

p129

VI puchased these so my wife can watch TV while I read.  I'm in law school, so I read everyday for many many hours.  Anyway, these headphones are horrible.  I don't know if it's Sennheiser's problem, or if the technology for wireless headphones just isn't that great yet.  In any case, here is a list of the problems we've had:1)deafening static blares through them the second you push mute; basically, if no sound is going through them they start screaming at you so loud you almost throw them across the room.  For instance, if my wife wants to tell me something, she pauses the tv and starts talking to me, but then the headphones send that horrible static through them within a few seconds so she has to pause the TV and turn the headphones off.  This=annoying to her, and rightfully so.  I'll take a long cord any day over that nonsense.2) There seems to be a bit of static interference most of the time.  Don't get me wrong, sometimes they sound great, but for the most part they do not.3) We've also now had to replace the batteries, but we've only had them for about 1.5 mos.  That=lame.Anyway, for the price these are not recommended.  I thought I was buying my wife the Ferrari of headphones, but I ended up with something more like a Daewoo after suffering abuse for five years at a rental company.Again, I'm not sure if Sennheiser has anything to do with these problems; maybe the technology for these just isn't there yet.

VDispatch from an Electronic Cesspool

sg5
VThese things work even in my electronic cesspool of a house. My roomates are noisy; cordless phones, wireless router, cell phones, TV, audio, multiple computers and the worst screamer of all -- the 2.4GHz heating/air conditioning unit. Even within this challenging environment, these headphones sound good as long as I stay within 20 feet of the transmitter. Outside of that they slug it out with the others. Although as far away as 50 feet, I can settle down on my bed, taking care to hold my head still, and only occasionally hear a hissy-fit.Yea, the audio is pretty good although not excellent. Yea, they are distance challenged at least in my environment. But hey, they are nearly cheap and some of the best performing wireless headphones around. I'm keeping these until a new generation of perfect wireless headphones arrives, whenever that be. They definitely solve the problem of listening without disturbing others and give you some freedom to listen and roam.Be mindful that there are several adjustments to make. First, there is the channel selector on the included base unit. Secondly, there is a thumb wheel on the right side ear piece that fine tunes the signal. I believe that other reviewers who could not get these to work didn't understand these adjustments.This is a weird product to review because it is both flawed and solved the problem.

VI get home sort of late at night, and like getting on my treadmill. The thing is, I need to distract myself with tv to get in a good workout. Unfortunately I needed to turn up the tv extremely loud in order to hear it over the treadmill, which I don't think my condo complex neighbors appreciate at 10 or 11:00 at night. Enter the rs-120 wireless headphones. This is the first set of wireless that I have owned, and was a little nervous that the electronic treadmill would interfere. The reception is perfect for what I need it for - the tv comes in great. The set fits comfortably and stable while I run. It also stays charged forever! I keep them hanging on my treadmill, not always sitting on the base. I have only recharged once in 6 months, and then pretty much only because I was cleaning and moved them. The only issue that I had the first time I used them was that the channel I had them on picked up my neighbors phone conversation. Kinda freaks me out that they could be doing the same! Nothing too juicy was said, though :), so I just changed the channel on the headphones and ran.

VI bought these beautiful sounding set a few days ago from J&R; and its absolutely wonderful! I got the whole set with the adaptors and stuff exactly like the way you see in the package. Seems like some of you did not get the everything like you should have in the package. Check the supplier of your headphones 'cause you should get everything like mentioned, or else strangle them! :-)Anyways, I'm using this headphones at work and even worked it at home with my home theatre setup. All I can say that it sounds awesome and better than most corded phones. The base is very nice, and so is the overall dynamics. I've used other headsets before, but this one is the best sounding one. Yes, you do get occasional drop on the frequency if you walk too far (expected), but considering you are within a 10-20 feet radius from the base it sounds perfect! I have heavy duty electronic stuff all over the place at home, but this unit still worked flawlessly without a hiss. Love it!

VThey DON'T hurt your ears!
p153
sg5
VThe only reason I don't rate these 5 star is a previously mentioned issue with falling off your head when you bend over. However, I will take the inconvienence over the alternative.One review mentioned hiss and white noise but I was able to eliminate any with the proper adjustment of the source volume, head phone volume and tuning.  It took some expiermenting and time but with my set I was successful.I also use a set of RCA and ADVENT wireless headphones, the Sennheiser are superior.  The RCA are good quality but excessivly bulky and the Advent hurt my ears after 30 min or so. I have used the Sennheiser well over a year and even the rechargable batteries are still doing great, combined with the ease of the charging method make this a "Best Buy" in my mind.

VI've had these for a few months now, I agree with all the praise in other reviews, great sound, long lasting charge, long range, etc. Having said that, I have a few minor gripes/suggestions for Sennheiser.I would like more ear cover choices, I'd prefer a soft leather instead of the foam. The foam can get a bit hot and itchy. I'd also like the sides to be thinner. I assume a lot of us wear these in bed, and you can't lay sideways with these huge headphones. And lastly, I would have prefered the connection wires to be plug-in instead of hard-wired to the back, that way I could plug it in to a stereo or satellite radio easily.That said, I'm happy with these and would recommend them to anyone.

VThe right headphone speaker goes in and out. The headphones fit poorly; actually drop off my head if I bend over.  There is no red light on the headphones to tell you that they are on.  Neither the distance nor the quality is any better than my old, cheap Panasonic ones. If I go into another room ~30-40 feet away especially if there is a wall between the headphones and the transmitter I begin to get hiss and interference. UPDATE-Lowered Star rating-after time you find the tuner and volume control mechanism start to fail-still using them but it is a royal pain. If someone changes settings then you can spend half an hour trying to re-balance the tuner and volume wheels. The only positive note is that my off the shelf rechargeable batteries work fine.UPDATE: I COULD NOT STAND THEM ANYMORE-I bought new headphone that are working-Audio Unlimited SPK-9110 900MHz Wireless Stereo Headphones (Rechargeable)

VAfter reading other people's reviews I decided that the first thing I am going to do is test the complaints. So certainly, I tested the most popular complaint which is the auto-shut off feature, which turns off the transmitter base and leaves the listener with loud static. First of all, it is not loud static because these headphones DO NOT have the power to blast your ears as some reviewers commented. It does startle you a bit if you've been listening to silence for several minutes. But it does not blast your ears at all. One fact nobody mentioned is that the transmitter will wait for about 3 minutes of silence before it shuts off, which is plenty of time for most situations. Some reviewers made it seem like it would shut off immediately after it detected silence. Obviously, if you're going to be using these headsets with a computer it could be a problem. In that case, I would use a wired headset because when you are browsing the internet on a computer, you could spend a long time without hearing a sound. So think carefully what you're going to be using these headsets for before you buy them.Now for a bit of critique: In 2011, don't you think that technology is advanced enough to have implemented at least an auto-silence feature so that when the transmitter shuts off, it mutes the headphone? I mean FM auto-mute is an 1980's technology that even some car radios had back then to mute the FM static when no signal is being received. But anyway, on to my next item.Along with the auto-shut off feature many people hate (which I find to be no problem at all), some complained that after the transmitter shut off, if you started sending audio to the transmitter base again, the transmitter did not turn back on. This is totally false. If you spend a whole 3 minutes listening to dead air silence and the transmitter shuts off, when the transmitter begins to receive audio again it will turn back on automatically and the headset will receive the audio again. However, what I found disturbing is why doesn't the headset turn off after it stops receiving the signal from the transmitter? I waited a whole 5 minutes after the transmitter shut off listening to FM static and the headset never shut off. If I was a manufacturer of quality products, I would've considered that.Onto more positive things. For most listening occasions, these headsets will deliver crisp, full range audio with punchy bass. I was very pleased with the sound quality. However, if you are a DJ, don't expect these are going to be loud enough for you. I did find that you could easily make the bass distort as the headset itself is not powerful enough for me (I am a DJ). But for most occasions, (watching TV, listening to music in the quiet, etc.) these will do fine, though. What I found is you need to be careful with the audio input to the base. If it is too loud, you may get distortion (which is natural), and if it is not loud enough, you may hear some hissing in the background. So for those of you complaining about hissing, check to make sure your source is loud enough. I am using the headphone output from my home stereo so I can control the audio level going to the base. One nice thing though is that the base will automatically level the sound for you. If the incoming audio is low, the base will automatically amplify the audio level being transmitted to the headset. If you suddenly increase the audio level going to the base, it will automatically level it down to keep the same consistent level for you. Nice feature! I did not find that these feature dampened the dynamic range though, so your audio contrast between loud and soft sounds is nicely maintained.I can't comment much on the battery life as I just got these, but I will probably update on that in the future. But about the signal range, I find it to be very powerful. Very minor static when walking around which is normal for FM communications, but I can go to the backyard without a problem, but why would I need to do that when I can't see my TV from there?Another thing, I find wearing them for a long time to be no problem. They are very comfortable and the open design is not a problem at all. Some people complained about the open design allowing for ambient noise to contaminate the audio experience, but to be honest, once I was listening to something I could not notice any distracting ambient noise.One last thing, I find that the volume control and frequency tuning controls are hard to find by touch while wearing the headset. I guess I might get used to that in the future, but I always find myself struggling looking all around the area where I think they are with my hands until I find them. Same thing with the power switch. Other than that, these are fine headsets that I find most people will be pleased with. Since all I care is sound quality, comfort and durability, the minor flaws of this product is nothing to complain about so I gave it 5 stars. Very good for the price!

VI did a lot of research in headphones before settling for these...after a while the final competitors in my list were grado labs, Bose and Sennheiser...the final parameters which would decide the purchase were Cost, tech specs and cord length.Bose  QuietComfort Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones were the most expensive, good specs but short cord length :(...also I found the design of the headband to be flimsy.Grado labs SR 80 was a good headphone, but then these were too expensive.. compared to the Senn RS120'sThe deal amazon was offering on Sennheisers RS 120 were too appealing. The RS 120's have everything I could as for..crisp sound, amazing blend of bass and treble. (to the audiophiles ...I still prefer the Grado SR 80's, but getting senn's at $ 45 was a steal)So let's re-cap: If your budget minded(Affordability+ wireless freedom + amazing sound ,but want to hear the detail audiophiles prefer from their sound systems, the RS120's are a great headphone buy.If your musical tastes include quite a bit of music with lots of bass + budget isnt constraining, a step up to the BOSE is recommended. And lastly, if you plan on listening carefully to your music and want to hear as much detail as possible from your headphones, the GRADO SR80's fill the bill!

VI've used these 120 wireless headphones for years.  I was interested to see what improvements had been made and I needed another pair so I ordered these. However, rather than improving them the latest model is no comparison to the old one.The tuning is absurd. It is very delicate and is hard to get exactly right. I have got it exactly right and then turned my head, theresult was static in the headphones. Absurd.The old ones I could wear for hours.  The new ones start to hurt the ears after an hour.The old could be adjusted for right/left ear balance. They left this off the new model. Idiots.I will be sending these back. I bet I could get a better pair for a cheaper price from Radio Shack.

VTYPICAL SENNHEISERS
p192
sg5
VExcellent headphones (... not my first Sennheiser's).  Easy instructions, simple setup and then turn on the source and it locks in. The headphones are used in connection with a 32" VIZIO LED LCD TV (E321MV).  Sound quality is awesome, producing clean highs and nice deep lows.  Static problems, are not an issue (static issues are usually caused by other sources on the same electrical circuitry).  The headphones not only work well throughout our two-story house, but also outside in an attached garage. Light weight headphones won't become tiresome; however, they will fall off if you lean forward to pick up something.The Sennheiser headphone 3.5-mm plug adapter, with RCA connectors for cabling, becomes a tight fit on the back side of the Visio when the two RCA male connections are attached.  But watch out for what you replace it with because the Sennheiser receiver is quite sensitive.  I connected Sennheiser's 3.5mm gold-coated jack into an input/output 3.5mm connector (not gold coated) for the TV input (for easier removal) and the Sennheiser worked fine for about 10-minutes and then started failing.  Finally the green light went out all together.  I shut everything down and restated, but still no connection with the TV ... only static on the headset (no green light).  After trouble shooting all connections and finally removing the non-gold coated connector, the problem ceased to exist and it has been working perfectly since.  I have ordered a gold-coated 3.5mm male jack with two female RCA connectors attached at the ends of two 6" wires to replace Sennheiser's adapter.  Not an issue, just a convenience work around for me, but its noteworthy that the Sennheiser is sensitive to cabling changes (resistance).These headphones work the way I hoped they would.

VI own a pair of Sennheiser 170's and they are really excellent headphones but @ over $200 I didn't want to spend as much since major use of these 120's was my bedroom TV. PS, if you're buying a tv these days, be careful to check the back before buying. Most decent size LCDs/plasma's don't have headphone jacks, many do not have RCA audio outputs, and some cheap models don't even have optical outputs. I'm not sure how optical to RCA converters worked, so, I wanted one with RCA audio out in addition to optical, and second choice would be headphone jack. In my humble opinion, RCA-output is the best because there is constant output level and you then control the TV speakers with the mute button on your remote. If you are limited to a headphone jack, the speakers usually are cut out when the phones are plugged in making it necessary to be plugging and unplugging whenever you use the phones and then want to go back to the speakers. Back to the 120's. First of all - sound quality is excellent, tho I don't use them primarily for music, I'd have no hesitation to do so. Unlike the 170 and 180's they don't have features like base boost nor do they have the surround sound simulation that the 170/180's have. PS: this feature on the 170's is really cool and I love using them on my family room tv for action movies. But, back to the 120's: even without these features, the sound is great. Next, reception: unbelievable. I've been all over my house to test them and they work great, even on different floors. Next: comfort. I actually really like the "on the ear" fit for my purposes. Soft pads, no irritation, but haven't yet worn for hours. I can say that, since I have both, there is one advantage of these compared with "over the ear" fit that is a feature of the 170's. With over the ear, if your head is resting on a cushion/pillow such that the cushion/pillow pushes on the earpiece, it causes the earpiece to put pressure on the back of your ear and actually can cause irritation. It's my one complaint (albeit minor) about my 170's. The one problem wiht the "on ear" fit of the 120's is that it is not "secure" - i.e, because they fit lightly and comfortably, if you want to wear them while you're say doing a project that requires bending over, they'll tend to slip off your head/ears. If you're sitting, at your computer, lying down for a nap, no problem. But if you''re going to be active with them - like working in the garage or cleaning the house while wearing them, might consider the more secure fit of over the ear. Since they're not over the ear, they're not as noise isolating, but that can be an advantage if you want to know what's going on around you - like hearing your wife calling you or the doorbell, etc. Finally, as for some of the criticisms of others that I've seen posted on these reviews, here's my take:1. Hiss: non existent. none. I'm using these with RCA outputs on my tv that have constant output and in this mode 0 hiss at any volume even with total silence on the source. If you're using headphone jack output, probably should have the component volume up enough (normal listening level) so you don't have to crank the phones - but I've pushed the volume on these during silence on screen without any hiss!!2. Unable to charge with earpieces extended. Huh? Maybe they've changed the design of base unit, but this is simply NOT true. I've extended them all the way and set on the base to charge. No problemo.3. Volume control on same side as tuning wheel. Please.4. Auto on/off. So far no problem while watching TV.  I suppose if you're pausing dvd's frequently, this could be a minor annoyance, but if you're wearing wireless headphones the need to pause should be minimal, since you can keep listening while you grab a beer in the kitchen or take care of business in the bathroom! Here's the bottom line on this: I TURNED THE TV OFF AND CLOCKED THE TIME-TO-AUTO-SHUTOFF: 3 minutes exactly. So.. how can this be a problem listening to music: suggest if this a problem you are using a headphone jack and the component volume is set incredibly low, turn it up a bit! Oh, yeah, when the base is off, then turn the tv on, the time between tv volume "on" and base unit auto on is virtually instantaneous.  Again if, not getting this performance, suspect it is headphone jack and component volume problem.Overall: this is a great set of wireless headphones at a reasonable price (less than $100 on amazon) and the problems noted by others have either been engineered out of the product over the years (some of the negative reviews are years old), or the folks with problems haven't set them up correctly (using headphone jack with component volume turned too low). For best results, try the rca audio outputs and if you're going to buy a new tv, look for and get a tv that has this feature!

VWhy I almost gave up on these.....
p203
sg5
VThis review is for people who are using an older model t.v., and for those who are interested in using these headphones while running or walking on a treadmill.These headphones almost received a one star review from me but before resorting to that I decided to try one more time to sift through some of the 950+ reviews others had written in hopes of getting to the bottom of and resolving a couple of issues.In no way am I high tech so I will explain what was going on in the simplest of terms.  These were purchased for the sole purpose of using them while running on the treadmill.  Instantly they were awful with loud hissing and 'wind', while cutting out every few minutes, not to mention the random volume fluctuation that I still can't explain; certainly not what I expected based on most of the great reviews.  I tried every channel on the transmitter (receiver) and was always able to tune in with the headphones but it would only last a few minutes before it cut off and left me with just loud hissing.  When I did have it tuned in the hissing and wind in the background was just too much, not at all enjoyable.  I wondered if the treadmill was somehow interfering but decided it wasn't since the hiss was constant, not just when the treadmill was powered up.  I tried the volume on high on my older model t.v. - hoping to outblast the hiss.  No luck.Taking advice from a fellow reviewer I unhooked the sound wires from my t.v. and plugged them instead into my DVD player, then turning the t.v. volume to zero and using only the headphones to control volume.  The difference that made is simply incredible.  Now I have clear, crisp, surround sound that sounds too good to be true.  I keep waiting for the transmitter channel to cut me off again but so far it hasn't.  The difference is like day and night.  I'm so glad I didn't send these back and leave a negative review.  If I could give these 10 stars, I would.  For the price, and with a little effort, they are the best.The other thing is the headphones are too big for my head and fall off while running.  My solution is to wrap a rolled up bandana around the top of the band, tying the ends in a loose knot on the top.  This removes all the slack and I am able to run comfortably with them on for long periods of time.  Not a problem removing the bandana before resting the headphones back on the cradle.  Don't really care what that must look like - it serves the purpose.I blame my simple issues on the lack of adequate instructions and troubleshooting ideas - Sennheiser should have been more thorough, beyond the basic hookup, by sending a more detailed sheet of explanations with their headphones.

VI purchased these headphones after reading a bunch of reviews.  Several of these reviews mentioned the automatic shutoff and static, but most of them talked about the sound quality, range, and how amazing these were.  I should have paid more attention to the warnings.  For what they do, these headphones are great.  The sound quality is good.  They have a good range.  I can walk all around my house, and have minimal sound disruption.  However I will never again purchase anything from this company.  The reason, these wireless headphones.The problem with them is the auto off feature.  If I'm actively listening to music, or watching a video, they're fine.  If I stop listening, then I have to turn the headphones off, every time.  After 1 minute of inactivity, the headphones cut off, and then begin emitting a loud static that immediately grates on the ears.  This means, you cannot continue wearing the headphones, and if you stop listening, you must immediately remove them, or turn them off, or suffer from the static.  If you are looking for a good set of headphones, keep looking.  Find one that just shuts off, and doesn't start loudly broadcasting noise when you go inactive.Edit: I've had these headphones for awhile now, and the auto-off feature just never stops being annoying.  I can't even imagine why they decided to make these so that if audio isn't being broadcast, the headphones should emit loud static, but for whatever reason it was, the effect of this is, that when I eventually replace these, I will certainly not be buying another product from Sennheiser.

VThese headphones have been a pleasure to use overall. They are very comfortable to wear, even for extended periods. The sound is very clear and I can go anywhere on my second floor with no loss in sound quality (I use them in the upstairs bedroom). I have not tried going down to the first floor.The only complaint I have had is that they seem to pick up other faint signals. Sometimes I can hear what sounds like other people's phone conversations. I have managed to keep the extraneous noises at a low level by careful tuning. The sound from the TV show I am watching also drowns out any other noise. Note that there is a three position tuning switch on the transmitter as well as a tuning wheel on the headphones. This gives you some flexability in tuning.Also, take care to turn the on-off switch on the headphones to the off position when you are finished using them. This will avoid running down the rechargable battery. Placing the headphones on their stand recharges the battery.These are very good, very clear sounding headphones at a nice price. I think they would be particularly nice for people with a hearing problem, but my wife and I just use them to let one of us listen to the TV while the other reads. I would give them 4 1/2 stars if that were available.

VGreat Performance -- Sounds Great!
p232
sg5
VI settled on these headphones as the result of reading many online reviews (including on CNET).  My final decision was one of price vs. performance.  These seemed to offer very good performance at a relatively good price.Now that I have these and have tried them out, I can say they work great!  But please note, my application is not for music and these are the first pair of wireless headphones I have used/bought.  I use these for watching TV in bed late at night.  Previously I had trouble hearing the TV well since I had to keep the volume low due to my wife sleeping next to me and our baby in the adjacent room.  These, along with my TiVo are the perfect combination.Some of the pros include the sound quality, AA rechargable batteries, and the comprehensive connectivity options.  For my case I plug them into the RCA outputs on my TiVo, but it is good to know I can also use them for other things as well.  Finally, I can sometimes hear a bit of noise/static, but it is really insignificant and I still love the sound.The only con is having the tuning and volume controls too close together.  Even so, I would still buy these headphones again.

VI simply love these headphones.  So much so, I bought another RD-120 for a family member.  I live in an apartment and didn't want to disturb my neighbors above.  Nothing more annoying than unwanted bass throbbing through the floor boards.  These headphones deliver fine quality and seem to have a huge range.  I've walked some distance down the street and still receive the signal.  By using a radio signal to transmit rather than blue tooth for instance means that walls and obstacles are no problem.  I use them with my computer, my TV and my ipod.  Adapters will fit anything.  I wanted headphones that were comfortable enough to wear for hours.  These do just that.  There is a trade off.  You can't be scrubbing floors or they will fall off.  But the upside is the most comfortable fit I have ever experienced in any set of headphones I've ever tried.  Couple of hours of music followed by a two hour movie are a cinch.  Recharges with ease on its cradle.  To date the charge has never failed me.  If it does, no problem.  I have a spare pair of rechargeable batteries ready to go.  Highly recommended.  These headphones totally filled the bill for me and then some.

VBuyer beware - I ordered these headphones based off the high customer ratings.  When I received the headphones I tried to plug them into my TV as instructed.  Red cable in red audio out put and black (not white) in the white out put.  Or use the head phone jack.I have a Sanyo HD TV I bought last year that I wanted to use with these head phones.  There is only an orange digital audio output and no head phone jack.  I also have a Samsung Plasma TV so I looked at that as well.  Same thing, only an orange out put.I called Sennheiser twice to ask what I needed to do.  Both times I had to leave a voice mail with tech support.  I never received a call back.I went to my local Radio Shack that sells these exact headphones and asked what I needed.  The Manager explained that with new TV's you have to buy a $40 converter and a $10 cable to make the head phones work with new TV's that have digital output.  He said that the head phone companies haven't caught up with the TV's yet.  I am returning the head phones.

VUnreliable--possibly because of the automatic shut-off
p248
sg5
VPerhaps I've just been unlucky, but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable.  I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit--after less than a week they went dead; i.e., the charger continued to work, but no transmission.  I returned the unit and got a replacement.  My only annoyance was that, occasionally, it would simply cut off.  Gradually this became more common and annoying.  I knew it had a 2 year warranty, but didn't realize I had owned it as long as I had.  Finally last month, it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs.  When I checked my warranty & sales slip, I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty.  When I prepared to order another one, I mentioned it to my son.  Turned out, he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and--though he didn't return it--he doesn't use it any more because of the sound cut-off.  I realize that any product can have a lemon, but 3 out of 3?

VJust got my pair in a few days ago, and I love the headphones.  Sounds is totally clear throughout my apartment without any static or fading (the transmitter location was very important, by the way -- too close to my computer speakers and the reception suffered).Frequency response of the unit could be a little better... bass is somewhat bad, actually, so those of you who want to feel your music had better go with another unit, but midrange is excellent, very clear, and high treble is pretty decent, too.Batteries have lasted over 12 hours now without recharging, and still I have great reception.The headphones are fairly comfortable.  I haven't worn them 30+ minutes yet, but the time that I had them on, I didn't mind the feel at all.  Earpads are soft, too.All in all, I'm happy....

VI watch my TV/DVDs and listen to music mainly late at night, and always find it unsatisfactory to do it at low volumes for obavious reasons. Since the listening distance is long (4 meters), I wanted a wireless headphones and the RS 120 does its job well.The setup is a breeze. The fit is comfortable, though it gets a bit warm after 30 minutes (I stay in a tropical country).The souund is comparable to that of HD 497, which is no mean feat.There is no hiss/static at my usual listening position. However, there is a noticiable hiss when I go upstairs to my study to do my computer stuff (no diff if computer is on or off), which I cannot get rid of no matter what I do.Overall, I would say this is an excellent buy.

VThe Sennheiser RS-120 headphones far exceeded my expectations; I could not believe how crisp the sound was for this wireless set and you just cannot beat the price for this type of quality. These headphones have great (perfect to me ears) sound throughout my house/garage with absolutely no noise interference. Have previously purchased 'more expensive' Sony Wireless set and I was very disappointed with quality of headphones and the amount of noise interference. I also liked the design of the headphone base/recharger; sturdy yet small enough to be inconspicous.

VI ordered these headphones from Amazon.  Quick delivery. I have to say I was shocked when I unpacked them. Absolutely cheap plastic junk. I thought because they were of German design the device would be of quality materials. Wrong. I plugged in the 9VDC power supply (very cheap looking) and observed a green led power light.  When I unplugged and plugged the connector back into the unit, no power light. Tried several times. I boxed them up and sent them back the same day. I must say Amazon really takes care of the return shipping in a very hassle-free way. I would order from Amazon again with no reservations.

VGreat Wireless Headphones

VFirst let me say I'm not an audiophile and I use these headphones to listen to music from my stereo.  After breaking them in for a couple days, they sound excellent to my ears.  Since I'm in a college dorm, these headphones only make it about 20-25 feet until the static dominates, but that is good enough for me.  It's true that an equivalently priced corded headphone will sound better, but not having to deal with the cord (and breaking numerous headphones before due to the cord), and being able to move around while listening to music is worth it in my opinion.

VI have had my Sennheiser RS120 headphones for about three weeks now and I really don't know how I have lived without them. From way too much time as a roady in my youth, way too much loud music all my life, and running all sorts of equipment without hearing protection I have a very hard time hearing normal conversations.DVR/DVD watching TV with the Minister of Finance (my charming bride) has become routine in my 59 year old life. Unfortunately no matter how loud I turned up the sound I missed a lot, especially dialog. Cranking it also made the MOF uncomfortable.  She was also very tired of listening to my audio in the other room - that's how loud I had to crank it to hear it.I have a strange AV configuration. The cable is wired both into a BOSE theater system and my BOSE computer speakers. Normal mode is to listen with the computer speakers feeding the cable signal into them.  When the MOF is here we just listen to the sound on the TV.  The BOSE Theater is only used rarely.  Like watching Woodstock on DVD.No matter how much I cranked the TV I couldn't hear Henry VIII whisper sweet whatever's into whichever was the current squeeze. I tried to read lips, but that was a pain.  I looked at lots of options, and chose the Sennheiser RS120 primarily because of the reviews here. I have come to trust them a lot in my shopping decisions.As Amazon usual, there were no problems with ordering/shipping/receiving. Installation was a snap, and they were considerate enough to include a Y plug to turn the RCA jacks into a mini - nice touch and they were useful. Rechargeable batteries were included.Literally plug and play, although I let the batteries charge all night. Perhaps the niftiest design feature is the wire loop cradle for the recharging. With virtual reckless abandon you can drop them on the charger. I have never run out of juice and worn them for hours.The sound is AWESOME.I am hearing things, especially from the TV, that I have never heard. They sound as good as my BOSE acoustic headphones and add the value of being wireless. Ranges is great, base is OUTSANDING.  Be advised these comments are made by someone with real hearing issues - I can't imagine how good they would sound with undamaged ears.The controls on the headset are a little awkward but in time familiarity comes into play. I always turn them on/off in my hands so that's not a problem. The volume is the top right knob and is sensitive to the volume from the device.  The tune knob is the lower nob and when needed, is difficult to use when you lose a signal.I have been more than 150 ft. from the unit and have had no problems. I can use them in the garage, and will be interested to see how much of the three acres of mowing can be done listening with them.  Sound quality does not drop significantly with distance.The only knock I have on the the unit is probably due to the way I have it configured.  On occasion, not frequently, but enough to be annoying, it will drop the signal and provide the screech/squawk of a two-way radio. When this occurs I often have to plug/unplug the cable signal and retune the headphones.  This also occurs, again on occasion while surfing and opening a page in the browser. It would be my guess that if I had a single input source I wouldn't have this problem.I am thrilled that I now get to hear things, and hear them better than I have in years. The Minister of Finance is overjoyed at not having to listen to Iowa Hawkeye radio broadcasts in the other room.  If possible, I would give this product ten stars for the way it has improved the quality of my life. I wish I had a pair years ago. Almost better than sliced bread.

VI purchased these headphones when they were on a "gold box" special - it was an impulse buy.  Here are my impressions:Comfort - the headphones fit comfortably, and are balanced enough in the weight department that they don't feel intrusive when wearing them for extended periods of time.Sound Quality - Sennheiser excels in this department, and these cans are no different - they sound great with a wide response range.  I use them for gaming and streaming my music while I work around the house.  As long as you are not receiving any wireless interference, they sound splendid.Controls - The controls are fine on this unit, although one complaint I have (and I can't think of a better category than controls for this one) is that they "shut off" too quickly when no sound is coming across.  I understand this is to save battery life, but when I'm working on a computer, sometimes it takes a minute or two for me to get into the application I am going to work with.  If no sound comes across, the transmitter shuts off, causing static in your ears.  Not horrible, but annoying.Wireless Reception - Great! I have a large yard (2 acres), and was able to walk the length of it before getting any static.  One caveat, however, is that sometimes turning your head the wrong way, even when in close proximity to the base, will cause some static to occur.  I'm not sure this is indicative of any flaw in the headphones, however, and more likely due to something interfering in the frame of my house.  But, when they do come in, they come in very clear.Fit - The headphones "fit" fine, but if you lower your head to pick something up, they inevitably fall off.  I've had to grab them from the air on their way down several times.  Now, this is kind of a catch-22 for me, because I wouldn't want them to be any tighter on my head, or the extended comfort would suffer.  Not sure what to say here other than if you don't lean over, they fit great.  If you do lean over, be ready to catch them as they fall off your head.Battery Life - I can't honestly say that I've had them run down enough to know how long they would actually last, but this is a non-issue for me, because I've never had them run out on me, even with hours of music playing as I work around the house.  The fact that the base charges them while they are "put away" is enough that the battery life just doesn't become an issue for me.Overall - I do recommend these if you are looking for some great headphones to wear while gaming or listening to music streaming from your computer/stereo.  They have great range, battery life is a non-issue due to the charging base, and they feel great even after wearing them for hours.  A great buy.

VIf you are looking for a headphone set to watch television while you walk on a treadmill, this review is for you.  I have not tested this product with a stereo.I told myself to wait a few weeks before writing this review as I've only used it twice, but I can always update later if the headphones start acting up.  I just bought this on Oct 10th and paid $59.50 for it.  Before the headphones reached my door on Oct 16th Amazon jerked the price up ten bucks.  I probably wouldn't have made the purchase at the new price--the extra ten bucks would have been the difference between the maybe and I don't know I was experiencing when trying to decide about buying it.They need to knock that ten bucks right back off for the simple reason that the product totally lacks basic instructions.  You can go to the manufacturer's website, sennheiser dot com, and look at a PDF file of the actual instructions that come in the box with the product.  What you see is what you get.  It comes in nine different languages in a strip about two inches wide for each language.If you have a newer TV set and/or newer DVD player with multiple RCA output connections you won't have any problems.  (Unfortunately both my TV and DVD player were older models)As Amazon has raised the price of these, if you can find another RF (radio frequency) wireless headphone set at a cheaper price, you'd probably do just as well with those as this particular set.  The key is to get a wireless RF headset and NOT an infrared headset.  Wireless infrared headphones do not work with treadmills.  Treadmills interrupt the infrared frequencies.  So this review is more reporting on how RF headphone products work, indeed this particular product as it is the only one I've tried, but I imagine other RF headphones work equally well.The two times I've used it so far, it has worked fantastic.  I only watch DVDs while I walk on my treadmill so I have the headset's transmitter plugged directly into my DVD player.  (I had to switch out my old player with a newer model from the living room that had multiple RCA outputs)  I can turn down the TV volume to zero and turn up the headphones so loud they will almost knock me off the treadmill! (yeah, I turned it back down some)I think I read a review somewhere online about this product where the reviewer said their television still had to be at about mid volume in order for the product to work--maybe that reviewer had the receiver connected to their television, whereas I have mine connected to my DVD player.  As the manufacturer is silent regarding everything on the product, who knows, I can only tell you that I can turn my TV down to zero and the headphones cannot be at full volume without busting my eardrums.I hope this helped other treadmill headphone shoppers save some of the hours I spent looking for a headphone set.I only gave the product four stars because the manufacturer failed to provide a basic manual with the product and the quality of earphones themselves is a bit on the cheap side.

I selected this product ,,, I am nothing short of overjoyed ,,, in ecstasy with its fine production and reproduction !!!This product wears VERY well !!! No discomfort with eyeglass temples.  --  They are also VERY lightweight ,,, The sound is MOST excellent especially when you consider I'm listening to "vinyl" ,,, Yes ,,, Phonograph Records !!! Sound Great !!! Of course the turntable is Audio-Technica !!! ,,, :-)The 3 controls on the headset are well thought-out. On/off on one side; volume and tune on the other. The recharge "cradle" is ingenious and oh, so convenient when removing and replacing the headset. The "puffy" cushioned ear muffs are fantastic like pillows ,,, especially when you consider I wear eyeglasses ,,, Other headsets are medieval head-screws ,,, squeezing the temples into the side of my head :-( ,,,Bonus: They supply a quality adapter for connection to RCA banana plugs or Headset Out connector.Suggestion: A most excellent gift for one's significant other ,,, like when she wants to watch her soap-operas, chick-flicks ,,, or you want to watch some football or radio or stereo or ,,, etc.

VBig issues:1. Constant hiss. If you are going to buy these to listen to classical music, forget it. The background hiss never goes away. It is quite annoying. Granted I have lots of electronics very close to my desktop that could cause interference, but so does everyone else.2. The DC charger plug-in is impossible. First of all, no one other than a small child has fingers small enough to plug it into the base unit.Then, a small child would not have the strength that I needed to actually push the plug in far enough to get power to the unit.  (I was apprehensive about breaking the unit by pushing so hard on it.) This  plug-in issue is a huge design flaw. Anyone who thought about it for more than 30 seconds should have caught this issue.3. As noted in other reviews, these are NOT over the ear headphones as advertised. They are on the ear, which does not block out all extraneous sound. And they really are not as comfortable as other earphones I have used.I am 90% certain that I will return these, but I will keep trying to eliminate the hum for a few days. If I do, I will update this review.

The headphones are light-weight, comfortable to wear; they sit on a charger which plugs into the wall and into the audio out on the back of the tv.  I thought the Plasma was great sound; these headphones allow me to hear sounds and words I never could before!  BUY THEM.  No sense in paying any more for headphones.  I don't know how these can be topped.

VI spent a lot of time looking for a reasonably priced wireless headphone for late night TV viewing and also my wife likes to walk around the house during the day with it on.  Last year I purchased a Sony at local store and returned due to static and poor reception.  I read several reviews at Amazon, and Sennheiser RS-120 had some of the best reviews for a mid priced wireless head set.  We have a larger home layout, and can go all around the house with this on, downstairs to the lower level, and not static.  Great reception, I would purchase again.

There is a dial right on the headphone to adjust the reception to get clear sound. I can walk all over my house and not lose my music. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is (as another reviewer pointed out) the headphones--although very comfortable---come off my head when looking downward. Overall I am very pleased with these wireless headphones!

VI work in a cubicle in a noisy, open office environment.  When I do creative work, I enjoy putting on wireless headphones to block out the background noise.  I've been using an inexpensive set of headphones from Radio Shack, with lukewarm results.  Limited range, persistent background humming, and uncomfortable headphones were my main complaints.Looking for an upgrade, I bought the Sennheiser RS-120 headphones.  Wow.  What an improvement.  Roaming the cubicle, the sound is clear and consistently background-hum-free.  The headphones are rather large, but very comfortable.  The batteries recharge when you set the headphones on the base unit.I believe these wireless headphones are a good value.  I've had them for only a few days, so I can't comment on long-term reliability...  I give the headphones a big thumbs up!

VA few of the negative reviews from other buyers are so unreasonable.  This product does what it is supposed to do.  Some people do not have the least amount of common sense.  If you use low volume to the input, you end up amplifying the static noise as well.  In order to get the noise floor lowest, you have to have the highest gain thus better Signal to noise ratio.  No static range of the unit is good.  It is so funny that a reviewer complains it is not good for using in her bed room because the unit gets on her way of falling asleep aside.  Didn't she see the picture before purchase?  It is a mistake of her purchase decision.  Ridiculous to see some people blame others for own mistakes!  The quality of the sound is no where close to audiophile quality headphone.  It is not even the same level as Sennheiser Noise canceling headphone PXC300 but that is what I expected anyway.  I paid so little ... less than $70- ... at Amazon clearance price for brand new unit. I did not pay tax or shipping charge. I use this for night time TV viewing in bed.  I am not returning it.  If I will find better one in the future, I will just add not replace. Good product if you do not expect $300 performance for the $100- unit.

VI bought my first one of these to keep my wife from complaining that the television was too loud, late at night, when she was trying to sleep.  And it was too loud, because my hearing nowadays isn't what it was when I was younger.  That was several years ago.  Now my wife is happy, and I'm happy because I can listen to movies on television at a decent volume without worrying about offending my wife's sensitive ears.  I wear these while cooking in the kitchen, on the exercise machine, mowing the lawn outside, in my workshop, basically anywhere in or around the house, and I still get good reception and I can keep up with the television program I was watching.  The headset gets a little loose after a year or so of wear, and it (they) have a tendency to fall off when you lean forward.  I solved the latter problem by making an nearly invisible "loop" out of black nylon fishline that goes behind my head to prevent the headphones from falling off, regardless how far I bend over.  The ear cups are large and well-padded to deaden outside sounds.  Because they're on my head and the television volume is low or off, I just flip the on/off switch to "cut" commercials wherever I am, then flip it back on again when the commercial is over.  Often, I forget about the tv altogether and leave the switch off, and I find the headphones can be used effectively to just deaden ambient noise and isolate me from the environment while reading or when I need to concentrate.  They're that comfortable.  Before long, you don't know you're wearing them.  The best part is that Sennheiser sells (through Amazon) replacement headphones, so you can keep one headphone on the charger while wearing the the second headset, so you always have full power.  Often (like Saturdays) I'll wear the headphones nearly all day, which means I get 8 to 10 hours of continuous use on a charge.  The on/off switch itself is the only problem I found with these headphones.  I've had three (3) headsets.  One died of switch failure well after the warranty period, and a second pair is getting that way after about two years of heavy use.  I recently bought the third headset, so I still have two headsets, but I'm not bummed about the switches weakness because I figure I got my money's worth out of the product as a whole.  In certain areas of the house, there is a little static, but not to an objectionable degree.  The link between the headset and the charger base unit is radio, so static happens in certain places as with all radios, depending on local sources of interference.  I'm really happy with the product after years of using it, so this is a long term product review, rather than one written the day after opening the box.  These hold up very well with hard use over the long term.

VI purchased the RS120 headphone/charger system and a second pair ofSennheiser  HDR120 Supplemental HiFi Wireless Headphones(without a charger) for my wife and I to use in our bedroom so that we could watch a little TV without waking our sleeping toddler across the hall.  We've had them for about two weeks now and have used them on numerous occasions.  They work very well.  Sound quality is fine.  These are not audiophile Sennheisers, they're not priced as if they were.  They are not intended for critical listening, or for reproducing 7.1 theater sound systems.  They are simple stereo wireless headphones.Our bedroom TV is wall mounted (using thisVideoSecu Low Profile TV Wall Mount) and I have all the cables routed inside the wall including the audio cable that connects to the headphone base.  The base itself is located in the room next to our bedroom (my office).  Since the headphones use RF (instead of IR) the signal goes right through the wall.  RF interference has not been a problem either (the house is saturated with wireless signals and the base is located in a room with two or three computers that are running all the time).Range is good.  I haven't tested the limit of the range, but the headphones work everywhere in the house (meaning we can walk downstairs to the kitchen while still listening to the TV).Setup was very simple.  Plug the base in, connect the audio cable to the TV. Charge the headphones.  Turn them on.  Tune them and you have audio.Things the be aware of:1. The base has a 3.5mm (standard mini headphone size) stereo input jack and comes with an stereo RCA-to-3.5mm converter and a fairly long stereo RCA cable (long enough for my needs by far).  Your TV needs to have analog audio outputs.  The base does NOT have digital audio inputs.  The outputs on your TV will be fixed level, or variable-level (or user selectable).  Our Vizio TV has selectable outputs and I selected fixed-level.  This means that the headphones are used to control the volume instead of the TV remote.  For us, this works well as we can each independently adjust the volume without affecting the other listener.  (The downside? The mute button on the TV remote does nothing).2. I have two headphones, but the charging station can only charge one at a time.  This isn't a problem. You just need to be aware that you can only fit one at a time on the charger and manage your charging so you don't end up with a dead battery when you need them.3. I'm still on my first charge cycle and we've used the headphones for at least 5 hours over the last two weeks.  So far no sign of running them out.4. The headphones use standard AAA NiMH batteries (provided).  I'm considering buying a few more just so I have a few charged ready-to-go batteries around in case I do ever forget to charge the headphones (and our baby monitor uses the same).5. I did not mount my base on the wall (it just sits on my desk), but it does have a single keyhole mount slot.  I don't think it would look very good stuck on the wall, but if needed, it'll work.6. This is the only drawback I've found so far, but at this price point I didn't really consider this a negative:  The headphones are not the type that go over your ears.  The lay flat on the ear.  There is no surround.  Some people might find this uncomfortable during a long listening session.  When I first put them on, my initial reaction was: "these are not going to be comfortable".  But after using them for a while now, they really are not too bad.  The comfort isn't great, but not bad either.  The other trait with the lack of a surround is that they do not isolate sound.  You can hear other noises in the room (good for us, we can here the baby monitor), but you can also hear the other person's headphones if they are listening at a loud level (and your trying to read a book, or sleep).  Again, only a problem if the other person is cranking it up.  This hasn't been a problem for us.  I've never heard my wife's headphones while I read or sleep.So I give these 5 stars because they met my expectations in every way.  I was not expecting high-end audio, but I was expecting easy setup and decent sound quality for a reasonable price.  And that's what I got.

VBought this headset a couple of weeks ago for my father-in-law who is loosing his hearing.  These wireless headsets are great for sr. adults needing some help in hearing TV shows.  The concept is that the user can adjust his/her own volume (headset) without having to have the TV volume up as loud as it goes.  The benefits to this are obvious.  My father...age 93...has had a wireless headset for over 2 years now and couldn't watch TV without it!The ONE COMPLAINT I have with this headset (and, it may apply to other sets, too), is that the TV connection is ANALOG (RCA-type) plugs ONLY.  Now, on the surface, you might think this is OK.  However, have you actually looked on the back of your TV??  Yes, you may see the typical RED-WHITE ANALOG jacks, BUT do you know if they are for OUTPUT, or INPUT ONLY?  That's where I ran into problems.  My father-in-law has a new(er) 42" LCD flat-panel TV with LOTS of jacks on the back.  BUT, upon investigation, I found that 95% of the jacks are for INPUT ONLY....and not a single ANALOG AUDIO OUTPUT in the bunch!  As a matter of fact, the only audio output is a DIGITAL (fiber) connection, intended for driving home-theater-style speaker systems.  Now, being the techno-whiz that I am, I figured that a DIGITAL-to-ANALOG audio 'adapter' might exist.  Sure enough, there is such a product BUT, the cost of the 2 or 3 that I found were more than the cost of the wireless headset...probably not a viable option.SOLUTION:  Remembering that my father-in-law had another (smaller) LCD TV in his bedroom, I thought he might be able to use the headsets when he was in bed.  Sure enough, this TV had the required ANALOG OUTPUT jacks and the headset connection plugged in and worked as expected.  Realizing that this headset was 'wireless', I then discovered how he could actually watch the big set in his living room AND use the headset, too.  He simply had to tune the smaller set (where the headset was connected) to the same channel he wanted to watch in the living room.  Yes, it's a little trouble to have to get up and go change the channel on the smaller set everytime you want to watch something different, BUT, it is the best (only) option to allow him to keep the headset.BOTTOM LINE:  The headset is great, and functions in line with expectations.  As long as you have an ANALOG OUTPUT jack to plug in the headset connections, you'll get satisfactory results from them...at least, for this type of requirement.

VI really wish I could give this set a 4 1/2 stars since they are awesome, but two tiny flaws keeps them from being perfect.I want to say that first off, I am NOT an audiophile. With that out of the way, these things sound pretty darn good to my ears. They have been run through their paces with music ranging from thrash metal to opera, movie watching, and are used extensively for gaming. Everything sounds as I would expect except... and here is flaw number 1...It's hard to explain, but having the base station in direct line with the phones creats a sort of whiney static every now and then. Turning my head left or right causes the sound to go away completely. Repeatedly shaking your head as if saying "no" will make the sound come, go, come, go until you stop shaking your head. The sound doesn't happen all the time, but it happens enough to be slightly annoying.The other flaw that I found is the power saving mode. After so many minutes of no signal, the BASE STATION turns off! I don't really see the point in this as the base is plugged into the wall, not really needing to save power nearly as much as the phones would since they're on battery power. When the base turns off *useally when you least expect it to while working on the computer* you are greeted with a sudden jolt loud white noise static in your ears. The headphones themselves have no power saving feature for auto turn off to save the batteries, which just seems a little backwards to me.But, with that said, battery life in these things has been a complete non-issue. I've had this kit for 10 months now and never had to replace the batteries. Using a pair of Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries, putting the headset on the base when finished with them recharges the batteries. Even then, I have litterally used these phones ALL DAY without recharging them and have never had the batteries die on me. Wether this is due to the quality of the batteries of the efficiency of the phones, I don't know, but I'm impressed either way.And for being wireless, the range on these things is incredible. Living in a two story house with an addition on the far side, I was able to walk outside to my car or to the farthest side of the house without nary a change in audio quality. Occasionally there would be a hiss or a tiny bit of static if I got just one step too far out, but really the range is FAR longer than I ever anticipated. I had free roam of the house and part of the outdoors with these babies!Overall they're a really awesome set of headphones for my uses. Good quality audio, NO WIRES to get pulled or tangled, and excellent battery life. Now if only they would add auto-off to the phones themselves, fix the weird straight angle whine, and add a microphone to the mix, they would be the perfect set!

p416
sg5
VThese are very, very good wireless headphones. I have a couple of quibbles about them, but overall, these are well worth the money, and if you're looking for quality sound and some freedom in your movement, I highly recommend you invest in these headphones.PROS:Excellent Audio Quality -- as good or better than many other sets I've used. Maybe not as good as studio monitor headphones, but that's expected for a $70, wireless set. The frequency range is wide and clear, and it's great for virtualized surround sound. I've enjoyed movies, games, and extensive audio editing with these headphones. I listen especially to a lot of classical music, and brass sections are especially clear and crisp. There's also plenty of bass in there for celli and bassi, and the occasional bombshell exploding in Call of Duty.Long-Range Wireless -- I was able to walk from the base connected to my PC, in the back bedroom of my house, out the front door, across the street to my neighbor's driveway, in 40MPH wind, with barely-perceptible interference (a small hiss, but not enough to really detract from the sound). Once I got back to my driveway, the sound was as clear as it had been in my back bedroom.Form -- These headphones fit my head well, and they are curved in such a way that I think all but the smallest heads would be very comfortable wearing these phones for extended periods. Also, the phones themselves are covered in a durable windscreen-type material, in such a way that they encompass your ears enough to hear everything clearly, but they don't surround your ears, so you can still hear when someone nearby asks you a question. Also, these covers come off by turning them at an angle, allowing you to clean them or replace the batteries set in behind them.Charging -- The recharging system is brilliant. Two metal places are exposed in the top of the headphones, set into the foam that touches the top of your head. You simply set the set on top of the metal rack built into the base, and it charges! I've used them several times for 3 to 5 hours at a time, and I haven't had the batteries run out. I simply place the headphones back on the cradle when I'm not using them, and they charge right back up.Controls -- The on/off is on the left ear, the volume and tone controls are on the right. Unlike some, I did not find the right-ear controls inconvenient. As long as you remember that the volume is the bigger, top knob, you won't have any problems.CONS: (My comments regarding cons are much longer than the actual impact of said cons. These are relatively minor issues with a very good product.)Interference -- As with all wireless products, there is at least occasional interference. On rare occasions, I will be using these with my PC and will tilt my head a certain way, and some uncomfortable interference will come across the phones. However, I have the base set behind my 22" monitor, leaving a very narrow vertical gap for the base to transmit.Automatic Shutoff -- When working on my PC, I will sometimes put the headphones around my neck after working on audio editing, and go to my e-mail or something else without sound. Typically, the headphones shut off after about 3-5 minutes, leaving a static hiss. It can be jarring if you still have the headphones on. I try to remember now to flip the switch off when I have no audio playing, so that it doesn't happen. Also, it usually takes about 3 seconds once the audio signal is back for the headphones to start receiving it again. It's beneficial to the batteries, and not a problem, as long as you remember that the energy-saving is perhaps a little too efficient.Charging -- The little red charging light on the base stays on at all times when the headphones are resting on the stand. This leaves you not knowing whether or not they are actually charging or not. I don't mind this, but sometimes the headphones will actually ride up a bit when the phones are extended, to where the terminals don't actually touch. Since the headphones aren't quite touching the stand at this point, the little red light goes off. So then I just push on the top of the headset, and the little red light turns back on. I am still surprised this happens, because the headphones are very sturdy, and I would think the weight would be enough for them to stay firmly on the stand. However, this only happens sometimes when the phones are extended.Packaging -- While everything is very well packaged, it took me a couple of minutes to find everything. The AC adapter and the RCA Y-adapter were kind of hidden in the packaging. Once you find them, though, everything's fine. But it does make me wonder if some people had the same problem and accidentally threw away the RCA Y-splitter that came with the set... It seems several other reviewers were missing one.Final Word:Overall, this is a very good product, and I can highly recommend purchasing it. It's well-priced, and the cons are really minimal, as long as you are aware of them. I am glad I bought this set.

VThe RS120 headphones are pretty nice for what they are.  In my home, you will find my infant son who goes to bed at 7:30.  Meanwhile, daddy likes to stay up late while playing Call Of Duty 4 on Xbox without waking up the little monster.They work well for what I use them for.  They were easy enough to setup out of the box, not much tweaking needed to dial in the best sound.  I personally do not like analog tuners, but this headset does have a tuner dial to help tweak the reception.  I would prefer specific "channels" to put the base and / or headset on, but I can live with the analog dial.  Turning your head or moving around may yield some slight static attenuation.  My primary usage has been about a ten foot distance from the base.Speaking of the base, it is very light.  Much lighter than the headphones, so it has a tendency to tip over when you are placing the headphones on the base.  I would recommend mounting the base on a wall so it is firmly secured.I have worn more comfortable headphones, but these aren't bad for medium to long gaming sessions or movies.  The headphone cups press against the ear and do not fit around the ear.  This is fine for me, as I need to be able to hear my son if he wakes up.  However, if I were looking for total sound isolation and comfort, I would prefer a headphone with complete ear coverage.  Since they press against the ear, they can become uncomfortable after a longer than normal (3+ hour) usage period.Before I made the purchase, my wife questioned the need for headphones.  Now that she has used them as well, she wants me to order a set for her.  Luckily for her, I can order another pair of headphones that will work with this base so we both can enjoy the same audio source.Overall, this is probably one of the best wireless headphone kits you can get for this amount of coin.  The *really* good ones cost 6-8x as much, and only marginally increase sound quality and / or comfort.  To me, that's beyond the point of diminishing returns.  This kit has amazing value.  Plus they are Sennheiser cans, so you know the quality and attention to detail is there.

VI bought this wireless headphone solely for the use of my computer as to not disturb my wife when she's asleep. I use to have a Sony corded headphone and didn't like it for a couple of reasons the cord as it limited my mobility and added weight to the headset and also vinyl cushion for the ear. If you don't take care of the vinyl it will peel and stick to your ears. It did give me a good laugh when my grandnephew put it on and large pieces of the vinyl were just hanging from his ears. I did notice the Sennheiser had a cloth cushion and chose the RS-120 based on buyer's reviews and price.At first, I did encounter alot of problems with the headphones suddenly blasting snow noise or shall we say switching to "sleep mode" after 2 minutes of use. It was really annoying having to unplug and replugging the headphone to get the sound back. I noticed only a few reviewers mentioned this problem so it must something on my part or otherwise the headphones are damaged. I thought maybe because of the recharging base was too close to an electronic device as the instructions warned. What I did was raise the volume on my computer (not the volume wheel on the headphone) and problem was solved. No more "sleep mode" unless I wasn't running any programs involving sound.I read people complaint about a faint sound of snow in the background. I did notice if you adjust the tuning wheel on the headphone, there seems to be a 'noise reduction' section. Yeah, the volume does suddenly drop but the snow does disappear so your choice which you prefer.Couple of things I did find annoying about the headphone is that it sometimes slips off your head if you're not still. Even with my big head, looking up or down would shake the headphones loose. Also the headphone does on occasion to pick up ring-tones or cricket noises. I find it kinda odd even at 3am, but I guess not everyone sleeps early not even the crickets.I haven't fully tested how long the headphones last without having to recharge it but so far it's good for over 4 hours. Sound quality is adequate for me. The range works find at 48 feet and through walls since that's my apartment limit. Oh wow, I'm picking up a phone conversation right now while playing around with the tuner. hahaAt first I didn't like the product, but with the problems solved I'm pretty happy with the it now.

VI've had Sennheiser cordless headphones for years and use them virtually every day.  My older pair gave me great sound with limited range.  These give me superior sound with excellent range.  The 'fit' is easily adjusted and I can wear them for hours with no noticeable fatigue.  The charging 'cradle' is a big improvement over my old pair; those required me to remember to turn the headphones around before placing them in the cradle, being careful to position the charging points so there was solid contact.  The new pair simply requires you to place the headphones 'on' the cradle; charging contact is made automatically.My ONLY complaint with this unit has been mentioned by other reviewers; I have accidentally adjusted the 'tuning' on the right earphone when I was trying to adjust volume, but I've learned not to do that and now it's not a problem.  Speaking of tuning, for those reviewers having problems with signal sound quality, I must presume not everyone has taken the time to 'tune' their headset to the 'receiving' channel (there are three separate channels that are selected on the bottom front of the base).  Without proper 'tuning' there is indeed quite a racket through the earpieces but tuned properly, the signal is clear as a bell and of extremely high quality.  When listening throughout the house it is true that increasing the range from the base will increase noise from atmospheric interference but even at it's worst, these headphones give excellent fidelity from many different listening locations.  I recommend them without qualification.

VI received these after trashing a wireless Sony product that was dissapointing to say the least.The Sennheiser R120 comes with a rechargeable battery and all the cables you need to hook up to your TV or Stereo. Setting the headphones on the charging base is very simple thanks to metal-to-metal contact strips rather than tiny little points that you have to line up. Don't underestimate this feature. If you wear these at night while your spouse is asleep, the last thing you want to be doing is fumbling around in the dark trying to put the headphones back on the charging base. These make it a snap.The sound is very nice. Warm bass and rich treble make movies or music come to life. There is a very light hiss that you hear when you first put the phones on, but once you turn on the audio, you don't notice it at all.I have a 2-story house w/basement and the base unit is on the second floor and I can still get good reception in the basement (excellent!).My only complaint is that if you don't have your source volume turned up enough, the base appears to cut off leaving you with a loud ear full of static. The fix to this appears to be just turning up your source and turning down the headphones. Thus the 4/5 stars.The R120 may be older, and low-end for Sennheiser, but it is really an excellent buy!

Vtldr;The sound quality is quite good when you figure out which audio output to use. To resolve the [quite annoying] hissing, connect the RCA plugs (red/black cable) directly to your cable box as opposed to the TV's "audio out" jack.I purchased the headphones just prior to Black Friday for $93. After charging the device for 18 hours, I connected this device to my parents' Samsung UN55C8000XFXZA (http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN55C8000-55-Inch-1080p-Model/dp/B0036WT4KG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1417276602&sr;=8-1&keywords;=un55c8000xfxza) television and first attempted to use the TV's Digital Audio Output jack, however, I received significant hissing on all 3 channels of the device. I attempted to tune the headphones on all 3 channels, but to no avail.I then played around with the different types of audio connections, and ultimately decided to use their cable box' RCA audio output. Using this connection, I was finally able to successfully remove the "hiss" that many people have reported.The device works as expected and when the television is on mute, the sound quality of the headphones is quite good and my parents now look forward to keeping the peace within the household.

VOrdered this headset on May 6 and thanks to Amazon Prime, they were on my doorstep May 8.Setup was a snap and I'm delighted that Sennheiser included an adaptor for connection to a 3.5 mm headphone socket.  Fits my flatscreen t.v. perfectly.Charged the headphones overnight and put them to the test today for the primary purpose of my purchase: being able to clearly hear my t.v. while using my treadmill - something I've been unable to do because the treadmill is pretty noisy.The headphones fit my head snugly and the sound is excellent.  Took but a moment to tune them to the t.v. and once the tuning and volume are set, there's no need to touch the controls again.They worked flawlessly during my 45 minute workout.  No hiss.  No static.  Thanks to the good fit, they even muffled the sounds of the treadmill.While I was walking, I wondered if I could connect them to my iPad.  Another perfect fit!  Now, that's really terrific since I can listen to my music while outdoors washing the car or maybe even mowing the grass!Great product from Sennheiser and great service (as usual) from Amazon!

VI've purchased two of these headsets.  The first works great, the second not so much.Within a month the second unit would not hold a charge for more than a half hour.  I called Sennheiser service and was told I could either purchase a new set of batteries or send the unit in for warranty service.  Their website states that if they can't fix it the unit would be replaced.  I sent it in.After waiting for two weeks I called to get status.  It had been logged in but was still in the box.I called a week later to get status.  It was still in the box.I called a week later.  It was still in the box.  I asked when would it be repaired or replaced.  The lady replied that they had no parts and no replacement units and she had no idea when they would get any parts or replacements.  I asked her to return the unit so I could return it to Amazon.I got a call an hour later stating the unit had been repaired and would be shipped UPS two day.  That was a week ago.  The unit has not been delivered.I'll call again but hope is fading.Would I recommend this product or anything else from Sennheiser?  Not in this life time.

VI really wanted to give these headphones a higher rating and based solely on performance and price could have easily rated them a solid four, but they are after all made supposedly to fit the human head. There shape, out of the box doesn't resemble the upper hemisphere of any human cranium that I have ever seen. If you remain motionless they will stay in place, but come on Sennheiser these are wireless which would seem to indicate that the wearer can move about with them on. My hat size is 7 3/8" which is far from small and no mater how I adjust them, they will fall off my head if I bend forward even a small amount. Now you can see that this would be a major problem if one forgot to remove them before relieving one's self! I solved the problem by removing the waist band from a pair of jockey shorts and using that around the outside to keep them secure. I think before summer however, I will find a loose fitting sweat band which should work fine and will look better to the neighbors while mowing the lawn. In closing, unless your head is the size of a five gallon bucket, these will not stay on your head without help.

VMaking it work on a Sony Bravia TV
p473
sg5
VBought this wireless headphone set for my wife for a Christmas gift and tried to get it connected up to our Sony Bravia LCD TV today. I connected the base unit to the Audio Out (RCA jacks) on the back of the set, and the audio came through the wireless headphones loud and clear, along with the regular TV speakers. So I pressed the Mute button on my TV remote to quiet the speakers, but it also killed the audio coming from the headphones. The instructions that came with the headphones offered no help or hints about a solution.I studied the Sony TV users guide and discovered that the Audio Out jacks had two modes - Variable and Fixed. Variable means the output varies with the volume control. Fixed means the output is constant - not affected by the volume control or mute. As it turns out, whether the output is variable or fixed is configured by the Sound Settings in the XMB (Xcross Media Bar) accessed via the Home menu on the Sony Bravia remote. Once the Fixed Autio Out setting was selected, the sound on the TV speakers could be Muted, and the wireless headphones worked as expected. Hope this helps

VHas made TV-watching more pleasurable for everyone
p479
sg5
VI am hard of hearing and despite hearing aids needed the volume loud when watching TV.  That's not great for other people, nor ideal when the grandchild is sleeping, etc.  With these, the "out loud" volume can be whatever is right for other listeners, and is separately adjustable on the earphones.  Further, the sound from earphones - at least these - is clearer than room sound, despite some good speakers from a home theater system.This may help some others, though not strictly part of a review:  my home theater receiver has an earphone outlet, but when you use it, that shuts off sound through the speakers.  The only other source of all sound is through HDMI output.  So I purchased a  J-Tech Digital (Registered Us Trademark) Premium Quality Hdmi To Hdmi + 3.5mm Stereo (RCA L/R) Audio Extractor Converter [Electronics] from Amazon.  I put this in the path of the receiver to the TV set.  It extracts the audio from HDMI (as well as pass through all the HDMI signals) and provides it as input to the headphones.  Perfect.

VI hated these as soon as I put them on.  They don't fit well and don't stay in place.  Try making dinner with these on -- you know, bending down to get pots and pans out of the lower cupboards and such...  These things fly right off.  And the ear fatigue is TERRIBLE!!  My ears STILL hurt.  Look at the profile of the ear pieces.  They're completely flat -- big flat panels pressed against your ears.  Really horribly uncomfortable.  No idea how these things got more than 3 stars...  I guess people just use them sitting down for short periods of time.  They still don't feel good, even for short term listening.  (Otherwise they're fine...  the radio works well and they charge and everything.)  But, I'm returning mine.  WAY too uncomfortable.

VWhen shopping around for wireless headphones, one of the biggest complaints was the range of signal. Before I wrote this review I wanted to test that. I walked upstairs, passed brick, wood, tile, a thick glass sliding door and walked all the way to the far corner our double lot property before I heard any static start to ease in. Realistically, I could mow the lawn or shovel snow wearing these and that's not even the reason I bought them! And for 50 bucks!I noticed a bit of static when I first put them on and thought, "Oh, well there's that static everyone's talking about." Then I turned on some music, and nearly blew my eardrums out. The static only exists when the volume is deafening. I ran a test. I turned the headphones to the exact point where the static disappears. When I turned on my music, it was still much louder than I would probably ever listen to it. Just make sure you turn your computer or TV all the way up, and use the volume knob on the headphones to turn it down to minimize any static.The volume and the frequency knobs are right next to each other and feel identical, so unless you've mastered the feel of the headphones, you'll probably have to double check which knob you're touching. It wouldn't have taken much effort, time, or thought to put one of the knobs on the other headphone or make one smaller or different in texture, or just space them farther apart. It's a stupid design flaw, and it wouldn't really matter if it weren't so easy to have fixed. It doesn't change my idea of the headphones. It just makes me think someone dropped the ball at Sennheiser.They are EXTREMELY comfortable. Easily the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. The pads are a soft fuzzy material so you don't get sweaty-leather-ear. They feel like extremely comfortable ear-muffs. They're just heavy enough to feel nice and sturdy on your head. The earphones themselves are large and flat against your ear, but they don't squeeze against your ears and make them sore, even after 10 hours of use. If there is any complaint about the form of them, sometimes I feel like they could fall off. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with these, and I plan on linking everyone at work to this amazon page.UPDATE:After using the headphones for a few days at work, I have run into some problems. First and most importantly, these do not keep the sound in at all. I was listening to an audiobook at a reasonable volume and the coworkers around me could hear it clearly. This is a huge problem if you're a person who doesn't want to disturb others. Listening to music with distinct sounds, like hi-hats or high-pitched instruments can be heard by those around you very clearly.Secondly, there is an issue with the auto-off feature. If no sound enters the headphones for about a minute or two, the signal is cut off and static fills the headphones. The solution is to develop a couple habits. Whenever you are not listening to audio, shut the headphones off. And if you forget and the headphones auto-shut off, you must turn them off until you plan on listening to audio again. If you just turn the audio back on when the static is playing, the headphones will take a second turn on. It's annoying, and a maddeningly stupid design choice, but not entirely debilitating.Thirdly, they do not keep sound out at all. Unless I blare my music, everything in the office can be heard as clearly as if nothing was on my ears at all. This may be a selling point for some people who dislike being deaf to outside sound. Nobody will have to try to get your attention twice. You'll hear them the first time.I changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars during this update.UPDATE: 10.20.2011The volume knob grows more annoying as time goes on. Once you're used to the headphones, you want to notice them less, and just hear the audio, but when you have to take your right hand off of the mouse in order to change the volume, this grows annoying, I often reach up with my left hand to change the volume just because it would feel so much more natural that way. Left handers have nothing to worry about. Another, easily fixed, stupid design choice by Sennheiser.The problem with the headphones being loose and falling off has proved to be more of a factor than I originally thought. I often have to hold onto the headphones when picking something up or if I plan to move quickly. It seems more and more like these headphones were not made with computer use in mind. Watching movies is a more stationary activity and would probably be better suited to these headphones.During this update I have changed my rating from 4 to 3 stars.UPDATE: 11.23.2011This will be my final update, because I am replacing these headphones with a usable pair. The sound blasts outward from the headphones louder than they do inside them. I literally cannot listen to them at work at even 10% volume without workmates asking me to turn them down. On the sides of the headphones, it looks as if there are actual speakers projecting out. This, coupled with the fact that they do not cancel a single decibel of sound, makes them useless as a pair of headphones. They might as well be a set of desktop speakers that you wear on your head.I have lowered my rating to 2 stars this update.

VSennheiser Wireless Headset GREAT--NOT A TOY
p509
sg5
VThe Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headset is simply AWESOME.Not 100% perfect though because I too find fault with the "loose fitting" crappy headset design. However, the reason I bought them was to be able to hear TV dialog ------- and I sure as heck can hear once again!My onlycomplaint is: The headsets are loosely fitted to the head and tend to move when one moves their head abruptly, the ear pads are not very comfortable---- but did I mentiom that I bought this item so I can hear TV????? Well I can hear my TV once again, mission accomplished.My background: I am 72 year old retired Air Force AirCrew member and have been wearing good quality Phonex brand hearing aids for the past 6 or 7 years. As I age my hearing is getting worse. It seems to me that the somewhat "tinny" sound that you get from the hearing aids coupled with the increased volume of the TV causes a "Mish Mash" of over amplified audio that actually was obscuring the dialog making it hard to understand. ------------ NO PROBLEM NOW!!I connected the wireless transmitter to the TV analog audio output, charged up the headset batteries , turned the headset on, tuned it up and WOW! WHAT I HAVE BEEN MISSING!I now hear the TV dialog --loud and clear--- with bass sounding very good---- NO tinny sounds----- and perhaps the best news of all is that!  All is well in my den with no more "turn the TV down" requests/demands from my wife of 50 years. The audio volume level that I set in my headset is independent of the level that she sets on the TV speakers! GREAT!I do not have a hint of static or hiss when there is an audio signal present. Normally I am seated about 18 feet from my PLASMA tv (with no interference at all from the Plasma TV set as other reviewers stated might occur)To test this device out I moved throughout my home with the headset on and have not experenced any static interference, no volume drop outs or anything less than a rock solid audio signal. While in the house I was up to 60 feet from the transmitter, and was receiving the signal through up to 4 sheet rocked walls!I then moved outside my house and was able to receive a 100% perfect signal at my back yard fence that is approximately 120 feet from the TV set/Sennheiser transmitter unit.AMAZING--- THIS IS NOT A TOY as are the other solutions such as "TV sound Enhancers, TV amplifiers, TV E-rs, and other Sound amplifiers offerings that I have tried in the past!Oh yes (as a hint to other hearing aid wearers) I found that if I REMOVED my hearing aids when using the Sennheiser headset the QUALITY of the sound the tone, and bass etc. of the music, speech and all sounds in general was MUCH improved over using the hearing aids in conjunction with the Stennheiser headset!Also, contrary to other reviews, the recharging function is simple and works great for me, I just place the headset on the transmitter base as suggested and it charges all the time/every time with no problem at all.Am I pleased with this purchase? I am and will be buying another set for my bedroom soon.Based upon my experience I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SENNHEISER Wireless headset model HDR/RS 120 !!!!!!My best wishes and I wish you all good hearing!

VI have had good experience with Sennheiser and several other brands' earphones/headphones for my various electronic devices.  But the RS120 is a major disappointment.  As others have reported, the flat foam earpieces allow the headphones to slip off with the slightest motion of your head.  Worse, the wireless reception is poor, requiring very specific positioning & tuning to avoid buzzing/hissing noise.  The noise returns with any change of head position.  I have returned the product as "unsatisfactory".  I should have given more consideration to previous reviewers' comments on these same issues.Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle

VSennheiser makes the best headphones bar non. The sound quality is excellent. Sounds like sorround sound. Deminimus (less than minimal, almost to little to even mention) interference. Range is outstanding. My daughter uses them on her desktop and can walk around anywhere in the apartment and not loose sound. She has gone to the laundry room (1 floor down and about 50 feet away) and not lost sound quality. The charging is quick and easy. Just place them in the stand when not in use and you have hours of use time. If only Sennheiser make a wireless headset with microphone. They'ed rule the world.

VTop-notch product, like Sennheiser products usually are. Extremely sensitive to other nearby electronic objects and wireless devices(when they are operating. Examples: TV, Xbox, DVD Player, laptop with wireless Internet). The sound quality makes up for it though, and plus you can't expect perfection with wireless headphones. If you do not like sitting close to your TV and need a pair of affordable headphones, I would recommend these. Of course these are some of the lower priced headphones from Sennheiser. If you've got the extra money I'd suggest you increase your price range beyond these.

VI love these Sennheiser heaphones.  They sound great, wireless improved my outlook on life, and the price is sweet.  The heaphones recover their charge while resting on the wireless base station.  On the negative side, static sometimes intrudes when I'm wandering around my apartment (and trust me, it's a tiny apt!).  The other REALLY ANNOYING issue is that a few minutes after the music stops LOUD STATIC erupts from the headphones, prompting immediate removal.  This is extremely annoying and preventable.  Also, the foam ear pieces do not block out outside noise very well.

VWe bought our first pair about 10 years ago when our kids were little. My husband has a moderate hearing loss and these have been perfect for him to fully enjoy watching tv without me having to repeat information or needing to turn up the volume. We have never had any problems and loved the one set so much that we bought an additional pair for me a few years later. They have also been great as the kids have grown and the adults like to enjoy movies or shows that we don't want them to overhear, due to violence or language (though our pause button is well worn!). That goes the other way too: we don't have to hear those annoying cartoons, either! They're also great when someone is using the tv in our loft, which has no walls to contain sound, so there is no competing for volume. We can use them with or without the tv sound on, depending on who's watching tv. Having said all that, notice that we purchased our first pair about 10 years ago. They still work. Same battery, countless falls to the floor. One of the best entertainment purchases we ever made.

VWhatever good qualities this product has are absolutely erased by the fact that these headphones will turn themselves off automatically when the music is too low, which means that any song that even attempts something interesting will trigger the effect.Here is how the experience goes down, which is almost like getting an electric shock that you know is coming:- you're playing your music and it has some subtle, low parts (soundtracks, classical, ambient, etc.)- there is a brief moment when the sound in the headphones cuts out, which isn't too bad.- there follows a transition to harsh static at the top volume of the headphone, which is like an ice pick to your brain.This design, which apparently was created to save power, is completely idiotic since they didn't need to play anything at all if power savings was the objective.  The end result is a horrible experience where you just wait for the shock throughout the music.  Do not buy these.

Otherwise, no complaints.  I would love to return this headset for one that would remain in place when I am moving around.  How about it, Sennheiser?

VI had to return these headphones because the ear padding is so thin that it feels like a piece of hard flat plastic pressing upon the ears.I do like that the batteries are easily replaced if/when needed and the signal quality is just fine.  Also is the range for the wireless is more than enough for use around the house.

VGreat for the hearing impaired
p630
sg5
VThese headphones work very well for me. I have severe hearing loss and to hear the TV I have to turn it up to where everyone else is being blasted into their own form of deafness. I watch TV with the CC on all the time because I cannot understand what is being said but the CC is far from perfect, in fact on most devices it is very poor and you can't get a good read on what the actors are talking about. So I got an idea and thought, with all the technology we have today, there has got to be a set of bluetooth headphones out there that don't require wires strung across the room. So my search turned these up. I ordered. My Stereo sound system was already connected to the TV Audio Out. So I could have the TV audio controlled separately on the Sound System from the TV. This gave the ability for me to plug the HDR120 phones into the sound system, thereby giving me separate control of the volume to the headphones and my wife control of the volume to the normal TV. Now I can hear every freaking word that is spoken on the TV shows without blowing my wife out of the room. She can control the TV volume for the room and she's happy, I'm happy and I bet the neighbors are happy too.Now about the headphones themselves.They work very well. I don't notice any hissing except on some mp4's and other Movie files but that is the problem of the file quality. Normal TV doesn't have noise, but keep in mind, I have severe hearing loss and noise is in the higher frequencies and I may not be able to hear the noise anyway. This review is more for the hard of hearing. I can go anywhere in the house (two story) and never lose the sound or quality, which is nice because I don't have to pause the program I am watching or the song I am listening to. Music with these phones is fantastic. The only problem I have with these phones is the earpieces are flat, not cupping your ears, so if you are doing something that requires you to bend over, they are not tight enough to hold on and will slip off your head. Cupped earpieces would stop this.All in all, for the hearing impaired they are fantastic for watching TV and listening to music. It was the best idea I ever had for watching TV.

VReview of Sennheiser 120 headphone wireless system
p636
sg5
VI bought these elsewhere about 6 weeks ago.I am a 76 old with not great hearing.  Both my wife and myself had found it necessary to use closed captioning for most of our tv watching. That is true even though we do have an older but fairly decent 5.1 sound system. Also, our personal schedules are such that I like to watch tv (including netflix) in bed until far later than she does. Thus, the tv's sound being on bothered her.The Sennheiser 120s leak a little sound, but not enough to bother my wife.  Their use dramatically improved my enjoyment of TV.  I now watch it without captions and only spasmodically lose a few words of dialogue.  I don't why the improvement is so dramatic, but I can flat out say it is.My hookup may be a little different than most.  We have a new lg plasma tv that only has one sound output and that is optical digital (toslink).  The tv does have 3 hdmi inputs.  My older amp/receiver only has an 2 optical and one coax digital inputs.  It has no digital outputs nor hdmi inputs or outputs.  Thus my hookup consists of:  1.  A roku box for netflix, a BD player, and a uverse receiver are all hooked up to the tv via hdmi cables. I could have used only two  hdmi inputs because the BD player is a smart wireless player that also provides netflix.  I just already had the roku and prefer  using it.  2.  The lone tv optical output is hooked up to the amp/receiver optical input via an optical cable.  3.  The Sennheiser transmitter is set up as otherwise instructed as to power and then plugged into the headphone jack on front of the  amp using the transmitter's cable and the supplied 1/4" adapter plug.  4.  The amp sound volume is set at or slightly above my normal listening level and then adjusted using the Senn's volume control.The result is my amp automatically puts out excellent 2 channel stereo sound for whichever hdmi output I am currently using on the tv.  The sound system speakers are automatically turned off.  The TV speakers can be on so my wife can listen or they can be muted. If they are on, I have no sound sync issues.The Sennheiser's sound did definitely improve some after break in.  The bass became at least noticeable and dialogue became a little clearer.My cons would be that to my taste the bass is just a little too weak.  Also, for some reason, the backup music and sounds you hardly notice without headphones can at times become loud enough to almost intrude on the listening experience.I really like these headphones.  They have done an amazing job of making our tv watching experience much more enjoyable.  However, I do wonder if a quality wired set, although less convenient, might improve the experience even more.  Therefore, I did just order the Audio Technica ATH-M50s phones plus a 15' foot 1/4" extension cable from Amazon.  If the M50s are an improvement I'll move the Senn 120s into the living room.  Otherwise I'll use them in the computer room.

VNearly perfect solution to apartment living
p641
sg5
VSo here's my story: my house burned down in September and I was forced to live in an apartment for the first time in many years.  I had to buy a new TV and sound bar system which immediately got me into trouble with my neighbors, even after I tried cranking the volume way down and moving the subwoofer around.  Here's the thing: I enjoy watching movies but I'm hard of hearing and I like my sound jacked up, so I needed a solution.  Enter the Sennheiser RS120 wirless headphones.  They have proven to be the nearly perfect solution to my problem.  I followed the directions and charged them up for the initial 24 hours and they now work flawlessly.  I am again able to watch my movies at any volume I choose without bothering my neighbors.  The sound quality is very good for what are relatively inexpensive wireless headphones.  I did check out the Sennheiser RS180 headphones at my local Best Buy and the RS180's certainly have a much richer overall sound quality, but at more than $200 more I simply could not justify the price difference.  I can't say that the RS120s are the best there is for the price because that would obviously entail trying out and comparing every wireless headphone on the market, but I can absolutely say that the the RS120s are a fantastic bargain for the price.  But there are some caveats that you need to be aware of.  I've listed a few of the Pros and Cons here:Pros:(1) Decent quality sound; bear in mind these are not $200+ headphones, but they certainly rival many headphones costing much more; I have had no static issues that I'm aware of, but as I said, I am hard of hearing (but primarily in upper range frequencies)(2) Good range--I can walk all over my place and never have any problem losing signal.(3) They just work and work well!(4) Comfortable (but see #1 below)Cons:(1) Tend to slip off of my head if I bend my head too far forward; it's not a huge deal, but they don't really hug my ears as well as I would like; still, they're very comfortable(2) You do have to be careful when you lose signal; you will get some loud static; the solution is to make sure to turn the volume down. Just to be fair: this is going to be a problem inherent in virtually ANY wireless system.  Signal loss goes with the territory.(3)  This is the big one:  the analog connection is for component ONLY. You can either plug it straight into the red/white RCA jacks or use one of the included adapters for various headphone jacks or other ANALOG outputs, but since my TV does not have analog component outputs, the only way I can watch regular TV with these is through an optical coax to analog converter (which will set you back another $40).  I AM able to plug the red/white component jacks into the back of my Blue Ray player with no problem, but I am unable to use them with just straight TV without the converter.  This is really a significant drawback because otherwise, these are really nice headphones.The bottom line here is that in spite of the Cons listed above, I am still very satisfied with the RS120's sound quality, performance and price.  I can highly recommend them to many users.  Just keep in mind some of the caveats listed here, primarily Con #3 above (analog only hookup).

VPROBLEM? SWITCH RADIOS!!! Excellent headsets!!!
p647
sg5
V4-24-13I now have 3 of these headsets and love them!  Got my last one in January 2013.If your earphones don't work properly SWITCH radios!!!  I have two ratherexpensive radios of the same brand. When I got my second headset (my first is onmy TV) I connected it to one of my radios and it would not work properly.  Itried everything and nothing worked.  The headset would work for about 5 minutesand then cut out and nothing I could do would get it working again.I was about ready to send this headset back but decided I would try it on myother radio (remember, same brand).  It worked GREAT and I have not had aproblem with it since (it has been several months since I switched radios).  Iuse the headset when I am out in the yard or doing housework going from room toroom.So, before you think the headset is defective, try it on another radio and youmight find that the headset works fine.  That the problem was that the radiojack on the first radio just did not properly accept the headset connection.Also, remember that the headset is designed to turn itself off if there is noradio sound for a period of time in order to save batteries.----------prior review--------I have tried several different brands of headphones and these are by far thebest.  In fact, when I got mine I connected them to receive my radio and was soimpressed that immediately ordered a second set so I could connect them to mytelevision.  The headphones are so light that I put them on and just leave themon as I work inside and outside the house.  The sound is excellent (I listen totalk radio), very smooth - not irritating as with some headphones.  I wanted twosets so when I switched from listening to a tv program to a radio program, I donot have to reconnect them.  It takes about 5 minutes to connect them.  Let theheadphones charge for 24 hours and then enjoy!!!  When you put the earphonesback on the charging stand they immediately make the connection and startcharging.  There is no fumbling around with trying to get them to connect to thecharging stand as when you place the headset on the stand it automatically slipsonto the connection.  Do not let the lights on the charging stand fake youout...they seem to light up when they want to.  When you put the headset on thestand the red light will come on.  The green light seems to do whatever it wantsbut it works.  When you first connect the charging stand to the electricity thegreen light may or may not come on but it is ready to charge the headset.  Wantto thank the person whose recommendation said he could do his neighbors yardacross the street and hear his program as I wanted a set that would let me do myyard work and I have a big yard.  I can even walk around my block and hear myprogram through the headset all the way.  Can''t recommend highly enough!!!!

Vi saw 2000 reviews and a rating on nearly 5 - so ignored all the one star reviews - got this plugged on after a hassle and after listening for just 5 minutes decided to return - i just finished packing the item and am writing this reviewPros:-----------1. looks nice with a wall mountCons:----------------0. Too PRICEY for what it has to offer1. The power plug to the transmitter is in such a narrow place that u need to struggle to plug it in - not a huge deal - did that2. connected it to my Desktop output - the manual says, the green light has to come up as soon as you connect the power - did not happen - after doing a permutation and combination of steps - checking my desktop output, the power cable - securing all cords - nothing happened- also tried to charge the headset with the batteries - no green light. If u get stuck in this, try to keep the transmitter on a flat surface and make sure to do all this and by luck you will see the green light - phew - finally the green light3. started listening to a song - huge hiss noise - common until we tune (that's what i thought) - did all types of tuning - reduce computer volume, reduce head set volume, use the "tune" on the headset, used different channels - tried to move it away from my desktop and any other nearby electronic device - same result - loud crackling sounds - hiss in between - music interruption4. OK next tried to check the range - went to the kitchen with the transmitter in the living room - started to hear huge crackling sounds - its true whatt one reviewer said - u might loose your hearing if u don't keep the sound low5. Headphones are not ergonomically designed - they do not cover the ear - no noise reduction from the outside (if u r a gamer forget it)6. Headphones keep falling down even if a move just a bit7. Sound quality is terrible - my old Microsoft Life-chat corded headphone sounds much much better - i think i am going to stick with it8. Bad user manual - i typically don't look at manuals - but this one i had to - there are many things missing - like what does the small switch named channel doesMy biggest complaint is the cost - i don't expect the headphone to rival "Bose headphones" - but for 67.64$ at least give out good sound with no static ? is that too much to expect for 67 bucks? - if these were around 25 to 30 then it would do some justicei didn't read the reviews and now i have to pay for the re-stocking fee and return shipping - what a waste - totally my faultif you are looking for even an average wireless headphone, i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this oneSave yourself the trouble, try it out first in a shopping center or if ur friend has one before buying

VI'm an older retired person and my wife keeps yelling at me about the TV being too loud.  These were a perfect solution!  Had TV Ears before and the IR reception was a giant setback (couldn't even sit back in my recliner without losing reception), But with the Sennheiser 120, I can laydown or go to any room in my house and still get excellent reception.  I use them for TV, CD's, Pandora and have nothing but praise for the quality of sound.  Whats amazing to me is that I can have the volume on the headset turned down low and hear with crystal clarity.  Now I not only hear but understand what people are saying in a movie, even when they are whispering and even young girls when they are talking so fast and quiet.  I now hear movies better than I do people sitting across the table from me.  Truly the answer to all my problems!  I can now sit up all night and watch what I want while my wife sleeps like a baby, and the best part is I don't get yelled at or have to listen to the wife any more! I can turn them up a little bit and drown her out in the daytime or I can turn them lower and still hear if the bad man is trying to break in the house, all the time hearing my shows perfectly.  Range is wonderful, I can sit on the porch, go out in the garage or go to the mail box and hear my music with ease.  I live on a 1/3 acre lot and no where on my property have I lost the signal.  So if your older, get these and preserve your marriage!**5 Month Update**: After having used these headphones for 5 months, My right channel is coming and going. Playing with the tuner is tedious. I have replaced the batteries and tried switching channels to see if that helps, to no avail.  I use it exclusively for TV. If I put the TV on a music channel and turn the volume up high it tunes in fine and then I switch back to the TV (which is in stereo)it works great for 8 to 10 minutes and then the right channel goes staticky again. The point is it worked perfect for 5 months. I do not think it is some sort of new interference because it does it on all 3 of the headphone channels.

VHorrible Programming
p665
sg5
VThese headphones are excellent in some respects. The charging system is terrific, the battery life is excellent, and they are very comfortable. That being said the audio quality is awful. And the programming going on in these headphones is simply atrocious.I imagined that there would be some static, as there is with most wireless devices, and that with some careful fiddling I could make it disappear; this is not the case. There is literally always audible white noise being pumped into my ears when I use these. It's not entirely intolerable, but the fact of the matter is that it will never go away.The other major issue I have with these phones is the apparent "automatic volume adjustment". Although not mentioned in the advertisement you'll notice if you turn up the volume on your audio device the volume will not change in your headphones. When tuning these headphones you're either on the channel or not. There is no middle ground, no "fine tuning". It seems good on paper, no hassle, easy to tune in to the appropriate wireless channel. However, in practice this just makes the phones automatically "enhance" the static they already produce and effectively prevent you from ever being able to fix the problem. The control is taken away from the user and entrusted to a poorly designed computer.My final issue is that if you don't provide any sort of audio input for ~3 minutes the transmitter shuts off and the headphones Blast static at whatever volume it should of been at before the programmed volume adjustment. This is really fun if you've left them on your head.Also, It sounds like I've blown out my speakers whenever I try to play loud bass. I don't believe they are blown out, but there is a distinct rattle. I don't recommend these if you like to listen to loud music, you will be disappointed.I truly believe this would be an excellent product if they simply let me do all the volume adjustments and tuning manually.

V10-6-2010 UpdateWell these just died so they are going back to Amazon. They worked great for about 3 days then I came into work this morning and the power was off on the base unit. I tried changing surge protectors, etc. but I guess the power supply in the base died or shorted out. Bummer - not bad wireless can for the $$. I never completely got rid of the static and interference so I will probably not order a new set.  I loved the wireless aspect, but I was not expecting to hear a lot of analog hiss and occasional buzzing.Anyone know of a pair that doesn't have these issues?----These are my first ever wireless headphones. I ordered these for my home AV system but tried them out at work on my laptop listening to my iTunes library. I was so impressed I am considering keeping them at work and buying a second pair for home. Setup is dead simple, unpack it, plug in the power and plug in the audio cables to whatever source you want to listen to.Included is a dual rca to mini jack, very handy - this allows you to plug them into just about any device from a full AV system to a laptop or ipod. Charging is a breeze, you set them on the base, allowing the metal contacts to touch and a light comes on telling you they are charging. How cool is that? Now I can reduce the wires and clutter on my desk and I can use these on my laptop or iphone at work. Sound quality seems very good. I compared them to my tried and true Grado SR60's and dang it if they don't sound almost or just as good. Consider that cost about that same that's pretty fantastic.Only downside is occasional static pops. I have the base 3 feet away so it can't be a range issue. I will continue to adjust the tuning and see. So far the drops & static aren't enough to worry about. I had to play with the channels and tuning a little bit, the headphones were freaking out every time some called the phone here at the office - weird.A note to classical music fans, these are basically analog headphones - so there is some background "hiss" or noise - you will never notice it with the average pop, rock, jazz tune but with some classical music that have very quiet, subtle passages, you will hear a little ssssssss in the background using these. I was able to turn down the volume on the cans and minimize it mostly. Just a note. At first I was really put off by this but I think it's manageable.

VSet-up Makes or Breaks Your Experience
p677
sg5
VI've had the headphones for about 3 weeks now, primarily for TV watching. Once I got the set-up right (more on that later), I couldn't believe the clarity on these. I have a hearing problem and always used closed-caption to help. Now I don't need it. They are crystal clear, with no pops or crackling sounds.  My kids agreed the dialog was much clearer than just listening to the tv speakers.SET-UP ISSUES: My only knock is the lack of set-up help in the instructions. It shows a small picture and mentions using RCA jacks to hook up to an output source.  However, the front of my TV has only input jacks and an HPJ hole (Head Phone Jack). The back of my TV was inaccessible without moving some of the wall unit, so I tried with the front HPJ first. I plugged the two RCA jacks into the smaller adapter and placed it into the hole. Well, the headphones worked, but the tv speakers automatically shut off. Also, not only did I hear the dreaded pops and cracks  as well as the beeping for a lost signal sometimes, but the sound would shut off every 3 minutes for about 3 seconds, causing me to rewind (luckily I have a DVR) each time.  I used it like this for 2 weeks before I decided to call Sennhieser and Panasonic (TV).They basically said I should try to find the outputs on the back of my TV. After I finally got back there, I saw tons of wires. Some going to a VCR, some to my Cable box/dvr some going to my stereo. The only two output jacks were being used to go into the back of the cable box. I unplugged one of the inputs and put one of the headphone inputs in. I was now able to hear one side of the tv speakers and one side of the headphones. Not what I wanted.  I figured out that a splitter might work and went to radioshack.I bought one splitter (single male with two females) for the red input and same for the black input (about $4.50 each).  I plugged the male end from the tv into one of the female ends of the splitter. I then plugged the male end from the headphone base into the other female. Then I plugged the single male from the splitter into the female of the cable box. Then did the same for the other side.  Now, the TV AND the headphones both worked at the same time and all the crackling, pops and lost signal went away!  Then I had to go to the audio set-up of my TV and saw there were two options that shut down the TV speakers. When I choose either one, it allows the sound to come from the headphones only (which I use at night when no-one is in the room).  When I want to listen to the headphones with the TV (family watching together), I just change the setting to speakers on and they can hear the tv and I can independently change the volume on my headphones.Bottom line for me is that these worked beyond my expectations, once I had the set-up correct. Highly recommended as long as you set it up the right way.

VNot great audio quality, but decent for low-cost wireless
p682
sg5
VFirst, the faults: These are not studio or "audiophile" quality headphones. If your expectation is immaculate sound reproduction, these are not for you. They have trouble reproducing heavy bass without distortion, and even in close proximity to the transmitter the headphones typically have a very slight hiss, which is (to my ears) not noticeable while music is playing, but is faintly audible between tracks. A rabid audiophile would be horrified, but I rarely notice it. Also, if you plan to listen while moving about a great deal, you may notice occasional moments of louder hiss or static, as the orientation of the headphones with respect to the transmitter changes, much the way a change in the orientation of old "rabbit ears" television antennas could cause reception to fade.Now the good part: Despite the faults, I find these headphones to be quite usable, and in fact, I use them often. This is partly a matter of expectation and experience: I know their limitations, and have learned either to prevent or accept their flaws without expecting more than they're capable of, in return for the benefits they give me. The primary benefit of any wireless headphones, as I see it, is the freedom of not having to be in the same room as the music source I'm listening to. I can get comfortable and enjoy the music anywhere in the house, without having to put it on speakers that might disturb others (especially late at night). I occasionally use them while up and active (as while cooking in the kitchen), and I'm willing to tolerate an occasional second or so of slight static during a song if I turn to a different position, or a bit of signal loss if I stand in front of the refrigerator (which partially blocks the signal). During times when it would be bothersome to others if I had open speakers playing (thus disturbing someone's TV watching, or sleep), I can recline in a chair and enjoy my music very well. I still use wired headphones when it's convenient to get comfortable in the same room as the music source, and good wired phones do sound better than wireless. But the convenience factor, for me, more than outweighs the (relatively minor) aural defects of these headphones.Some tips for those who want to use these wireless headphones:- I find that I can minimize the background static (i.e. make it inaudible during the music and barely noticeable between tracks) if I set the volume on the source to maximum, ensuring a good signal to the transmitter, and then adjust the listening volume with the control on the headphones themselves.- When you first get them, it may take a little time experimenting with different transmission channels and fine-tuning to find the best signal quality for your environment. Like any wireless device these headphones are subject to interference. Try each channel (there are three) on the transmitter, and then carefully adjust the tuning on the headphones to get the best signal, then move to different areas of your house to see how the quality may be affected. It took me perhaps an hour of trial-and-error to find the tuning that works best for me.- Turn down the bass a little at your music source. As mentioned above, heavy bass will distort in the phones; feeding less bass to the transmitter will make a big difference in the overall sound quality. And with the smaller speakers pressed directly to your ears, you'll need less bass than you get from a big, thumping subwoofer anyway.If the low cost of these wireless headphones and the convenience of using them anywhere outweighs your desire for perfect audio quality, these should do the job. But if you simply cannot abide any loss of fidelity for any reason, under any circumstances, I wouldn't recommend them; stick with high-quality wired phones.

VI have two beautiful children, a 1 and 2 year old, which, as anyone with kids know, there's simply no time to watch TV (or much else) while they are awake.  So we record our favorite shows on our AT&T; Uverse system and watch them when our little ones go to sleep.  Of course, we try to keep the volume down so not to disturb them (NEVER WAKE A SLEEPPING BABY), but we're always rewinding the recording or asking each other "what did he say?".  So I decided to research for wireless headphone that would solve our problem and found the Sennheiser line to be very popular and reliable amongst reviewers.  I took the plunge, but not before debating over what model to buy.  At first I thought that the pricier models might be better, but then figured I'd take the chance with the Sennheiser RS120 and hope for the best.  I was soooo pleasantly surprised with these cans.  They are crystal clear, the sound quality was amazing, and the comfort level was definitely up there.  Although my ears did get a little fatigued after about 2 hours of use, nothing extreme though...very tolerable.  The range is great as well.  My wife sometimes gets up to get a snack and she can hear everything perfectly from the kitchen which is about 40-50 feet from the source.  I read on other reviews of hissing and noise problems, so I was prepared for some myself, especially with all the wireless toys I have (wireless internet, wireless surround sound, wireless telephone - all of which have been one at the same time while using the RS 120).  But through it all, the sound quality remained perfect.  Even when there's no sound (i.e. pausing or muting the program), I still don't hear any noise.  I have no regrets buying this model.  You'll enjoy them too!

VThese lay right on top of your ears, which would be terrible, but the worst part is that they sit very lightly on your head so that they fall off with any sort of movement. So it's the worst of both worlds. I never even got to the part of plugging them in and listening to them before I boxed them back up for a return.

VI bought these headphones so I could study in peace while my boyfriend watches TV or plays video games.  I got them from Amazon for $69.99 and they are WONDERFUL (and a relationship-saver)!This is our second set of wireless headphones -- the first set was made by RCA and purchased without any research.  We didn't use the first set much because it had terrible reception and the batteries died frequently, so when it stopped working altogether, I did a lot of research and considered much pricier models before settling on the Sennheiser RS 120.We are incredibly happy with these headphones.  I can't even imagine how the more expensive Sennheiser models could perform better (I'm sure they do), but we are completely satisfied with this set.  The sound is great and we think the charging station is pretty neat looking.Note to other purchasers - we initially had problems with low but constant static/hissing, but this was resolved when we plugged the audio cables into the red and white RCA jacks instead of the socket labeled "headphone" on the  back of the TV.  The sound is absolutely CRYSTAL CLEAR now.  I'm glad we played around with it for awhile and figured out a solution.We live in an area with lots of potential interference (we live in midtown Manhattan, only 1 block from the Empire State building and our charging station is placed squarely next to a whole mess of electronics, including our cable box, TV, PS3, XBOX360, laptops, wireless internet router, cell phones, etc) but we have not experienced any static or hissing.  These headphones have exceeded all my expectations -- I would highly recommend them without any reservations.  All the positive reviews are well justified.

VGood wireless headset
p710
sg5
VI purchased a pair of these headsets for watching TV after the kids go to bed. They have excellent sound quality, battery seems to last quite long, considering 2-3 hours of use each night. Maybe charge them once a week.Loves:1. They are RF. Goodbye IR wireless headphones that only work infront of the transmitter. Now I can wander into the kitchen and still hear what's going on.2. Rechargable with 2 AAA batteries. If they are absolutely dead, I can grab batteries out of storage and fire them back up.Problems:1. The smallest setting for the headband is still not that small. My oldest (6yo) can wear the headphones, but they fall off if she moves around. Considering she wears a hat 2 sizes larger, they are designed for a much larger head.2. Their is no indicator light to show that they are on, or if the battery is charged. You have to physically look at the switch to see if they are on. Charged? Well, do you hear sound, try fiddling with them and make sure they didn't change tuning.3. The last month or so, a neighbor has started using his shortwave radio. In certain places of the house, I can pickup his conversation over his CB. Not quite as entertaining as the TV.. I've changed the tuner options on the headphones the other day and haven't heard from him again.4. Can only charge them on that gianormous base. If you plan to use them with your entertainment center, plan on making space for that large transmitter base, that is accessible so that you can charge them. Putting it behind the TV creates a bit of electrical interference (buzz). Maybe on top the EC cabinet? :)

VHave been using Sennheiser wireless headphones for more than ten years. They are great for TV, our house is very peaceful! The earlier models (mostly plastic) suffered from difficult controls and brittle plastic causing premature breakage of the headarches. Fortunately, I dealt with the Good Guys (now defunct), who honored my purchased extended warranties without a hitch four times. Maybe that partially explains why they went out of business! The rechargeable batteries on my RS-45's finally died of old age, so I carefully studied Sennheiser's latest and finally selected the RS-120's. Best phones I ever got for the money. No problems whatsoever with installation and operation. Mine hiss only if I move too far away. I honestly do not understand what the low-rating cry babies are complaining about. Congratulations, Sennheiser!Here's a quick follow-up on the above:We are now in late May, 2011 and I had to replace the 3 RS120's due to old age. Got 2 new ones and clearly there have been significant improvements since 2006. These have a much better snug fit on the head; The control buttons seem to be slightly larger, making operation easier than before. I detect no hiss whatsoever, even if I move from the living room to the kitchen or office.Now the sad part: I sent Sennheiser an email several days ago, offering them my 3 old units at no charge for recycling or refurbishing. No response whatsoever! It seems like so many other manufacturers Sennheiser is only interested in maximizing profits and to hell with environmental considerations. Oh well.

VExcellent set - Good News, No more "HiSS", follow my trick
p722
sg5
VHi,Brief:i bought this set last week with the charging cradle bent/leaning  towards right and i had lot of Hiss even though i turned the set in many configurations. Great news for all previous and future buyers is that i was able to troubleshoot the "HiSS" issue. When you connect left and right pins into your source (in my case, it's a computer), everything looked fine , i see green light on the base unit but i was getting frequent 'communication gaps/ "HiSS" / noises' etc...Issue:Problem here is you don't see the actual communication gaps because the Green light on base unit lights and misleading even if you loose connection on one of the the left or right pins.Solution:To get avoid this, use the 2 to 1 pin they supplied and plug it into head phones socket of the source and i guarantee that you never will see any communication gap anymore. I tested this set 9 homes left to right of my home, back yard, basement and eveywhere without a "HiSS".Summary:I used this set for few weeks and i am revising my review. This is a great set but i have a little comment, headphones are too big and the really don't sit on my head. I read people saying they used these headphone for lawn mowing etc but i don't think i can do that because the head phones are not snug fit to the ears. You can use these phones for other activities in the garden, basement or enywhere without any problem.I hope this will help the Amazon customers who use these headphones.ThanksSen120

VI bought wireless headphones mainly for the convenience - I prefer to be able to get up and walk around without being tethered to my computer. These headphones are as good as many wired 'phones and better than my old, wired pair. The sound sparkles - no complaints in the bass, mid, or high ranges. The base/charger looks sharp and the charging method is ingenious. I can walk upstairs, downstairs, and outside and find very little interference. While I lack the experience with many other wireless sets, I can give the RS-120 a solid recommendation.

p733

VAfter reading mostly good reviews on this, I decided to buy it. Well, it does not disappoint.  On the first day of using it, there was this loud hissing noise whenever I moved my head fast.  After playing with the tuner a bit, that went away.  Somebody mentioned that he was getting interference from a treadmill.  That made me worry a bit because that was the main reason I bought this.  This never happened to me (so far). I think it has to do with the type of motor used.  I would not be surprised if a hair dryer or a vacuum cleaner causes interference.I am quite happy with the sound quality.  I am getting more high and low frequencies compared to what I hear from the TV's main speakers.  I am sure it would be even better if I connect it to my home theater system.  For $70, I am totally satisfied with its sound quality.  I am just waiting to see how long this quality lasts and how soon the batteries will go bad (stop taking charge).  Although, these standard AAA batteries are a big plus, because they are cheaper to replace.A minor complain I have is charging the headphones. You'd really have to pay attention when placing the headphones on the base unit to make sure the contacts are touching and the charge light is lit.  Or you'd run of juice before you know it.  I also wish it a little smaller and lighter.

VGreat for my Grandfather
p739
sg5
VI bought these headphones for my grandfather because his hearing is poor and we don't want him to blow his TV speakers out, plus we want to be able to hear. He has had many different sets of headphones and all of them are collecting dust in a box somewhere. This set is different for a few reasons. First of all, they was a lot easier to plug in to his DVR then some of the others have been, of course those ones were from many years ago and technology has come a long way. The next point he liked was the charging dock and how easy it is to use since he doesn't have to plug them in or anything like that. The tuning is easy and the sound quality is fantastic. He can actually hear his TV and they aren't turned all the way up and that is really a plus for all of us. He also likes that they just sit on top of his ear because the ones that encapsulate his ears just do not fit. The only complaint that he has is that they do not have a volume adjustment for each ear individually. His right ear is worse than this left and so what is good for the right is a little to loud for the left. That is why I give this product a 4 star because that might one day be enough to get him to stop using them. However, these are currently a hit with him and that is important to me. I think they are a good product and a good purchase.

VI bought this to save my marriage, lol. My husband couldn't hear the TV with our rambunctious 2-year old around without cranking up the volume to headache-level and constant rewinding. I got him these wireless headphones for watching TV and they have been great for us. There is no hiss or interference, and the sound is really good. He can set his volume on the headphones and I can have my own volume on the TV (or I can mute it). They are easy to recharge (just throw them on the hanger). I do have to look before I adjust the volume since the control is located on the ear, but it's no big deal -- I mean, where else could you put the control on a wireless headset? The controls are very easy to use. The only drawback is that lying on your side (vegging on the couch a la "jabba the hut") can be uncomfortable if you rest your head on a pillow or couch arm because of the size (but I knew that when I bought them- it's not like they're earbuds). It took my husband about five minutes to hook this up. So now my husband can watch all the sci-fi he wants and he's free to help me run after the little guy (hooray for wireless!). And I don't get headaches. These things are great for our purposes!! We have no complaints.

VPros:+Long battery life: Place headphones on the base stand and it will recharge the batteries everytime!+Good sound quality with little to no RF interference.+Long wireless range (about four average houses down)+Very rugged (a little bulky, though)Cons:_Base auto-shutoff feature will create an unpleasant sound in the headphones until base receives a audio signal again. NOTE: Headphones don't auto-shutoff._No Line-out on headphones. (for wireless communications to other audio devices)_NOT recommended for those who like it loud._No headphone onboard balance and mono controls._The sound will bleed from the headphones at medium volume which can be heard from across a quiet room. (not recommended if partner is asleep while music volume is set to medium)Overall: It's worth the price.Wishlist:*I wish Sennheiser design a unit the size of a cellphone with a beltclip that uses Koss earbudphones instead of headphones with the mentioned features.*I wish it can "signal" headphones to MUTE while base goes into standby.

VPower Supply?
p768
sg5
VPower supply seems to shut off...headphones work for about 30 minutes, then just shut down while sound should be coming through...it is connected to my TV and there is no "dead silence" on the television...lights on the charger go out...I unplug it, plug it in again and they come back on, and earphones will transmit for about another 10 minutes, maybe...then shuts down again.  Often when earphones are being worn, everything shuts down and I get nothing but static...could it be that my power supply (I live in a rural area in the mountains of AZ) is not up to snuff?  Could it be that I live in a manufactured home (not a mobile home or trailer) and there is an abundance of metal used in the construction of such a structure?  Could it be that I got the only bad set of earphones in the bunch? Maybe the equipment would work somewhere else...it just doesn't work here where I am.  Great disappointment.  And, by the way, I paid more for this item on Newegg than is advertised here, but they are going back today!

This is good since I felt so bad he couldn't hear what he wanted and it sort of embarrassed him that I had repeat things.Only problem is when he turns them up I can hear the sound coming out of them and that defeats the purpose a bit.  However, it's only a slight sound and not one that will make me need an ativan by midmorning.I can watch the same show with him and he can have the headphones on as loud as he likes and I can have the volume where I want and everyone is happy.He sleeps with them on all night as he can't sleep without hearing the tv and they stay charged a long time.I'd buy them again.

VAnalog transmitter, Noise due to AGC
p785
sg5
VThe wireless transmitter for these is analog! You're basically wearing an FM radio on your head. This means no error correction on the received signal, which, combined with the aggressive AGC (automatic gain control) results in constant background noise. I was shocked to find this to be the case; it's like a design from the 90's. But the worst thing about these headphones is this: after a certain duration of inactivity (about a minute or two), the transmitter turns off. I have no idea why it does this, the transmitter is not the thing running on batteries. Once the transmitter turns off, the AGC in the headphones flips out and boosts the only thing left--the noise. So you're sitting there, nothing is playing for a minute, and then all of a sudden: HISSSSSSS. Fantastic design Sennheiser, now I get anxious every time nothing is playing. I either have to turn the headphones off or get an earful of static. Needless to say, I'm returning this 1990's throwback.

This wheel is annoying and easily accidentally disturbed.- Slight background hiss in the headphones, can't tune it out.- Sometimes moving around can generate short bursts of static. You might be able to tune it out depending on how much interference there is in the area you're using them.- The charging light stays lit red even if the batteries are full.

VThis is a terrific product!I have hearing issues which drive my wife nuts.  I turn the volume way up, and still frequently can't make out the speech in whatever I'm watching.  The problem worsens if characters have accents.With these headphones, I can hear every single word quite clearly.  And with our house being a very open plan, being able to listen to one thing while my wife is watching something else upstairs means neither of us hears what the other one is listening to.I haven't found the limits to the distance on these, but I can leave and go into adjacent rooms and still hear just as well as if I was sitting in front of the TV.  Very convenient when you want to grab a snack!I'm going to have to discuss this with my audiologist, who told me the type of hearing problems I have wouldn't be helped with a hearing aid.  If these headphones can give me this type of sound clarity, I think it's obvious he's wrong!

The next day I plugged the base into a vcr I use as a TV tuner using the included RCA plugs (phono and 3.5mm also included) turned it on and listened to a TV show while using a treadmill.  Absolutely clear sound with no interferring noise.  I have added earmuff like covers to protect the headset from sweat while working out.  The headset is light and comfortable and is recommended for the workout room as well as sitting.

VI was really pleased with these headphones but as many others have stated, they do make your ears sweat. Simple solution though. Change these to around the ear phones using these.... beyerdynamic EDT 250 V..... sold on amazon, just do a search. Although they are made to fit Sony MDR V-6 phones they will fit on these nicely.  Remove each side of the RS120 pads by twisting a little to the left on each side. Remove all the foam pieces until all you have left is the plastic grids for each side. In the beyerdynamic kit there are two fiber like oval washers, throw em away.Just lay the black, round foam piece on top of the plastic grid and install the earpads by stretching the lip over the plastic grids. This will hold the round, black foam piece in. WOW, HEAVEN !! So much more comfortable. I would have given these headphones 5 stars if I wouldn't have had to do the modification.

VI bought my first pair of Sennheiser cordless headphones about 3 years ago, as a gift for my husband.  I quickly began to borrow them more and more frequently until it got to the point we needed to buy a second pair.  We use these on our computer, laptop, TV or stereo.  They're fabulous if you're working outside, or working in the kitchen and want to hear your audio above the sound of running water, stove vent or sizzling stir fry.  I watch last-night's TV online while I buzz about the house doing laundry, floors and all sorts of chores. Also great when you want to watch a movie with your kids nearby but don't want them to hear the language. You can easily operate multiple pairs of headphones-- either tune them all to the same frequency so you can share the experience, or tune them separately so you can each enjoy your entertainment separately.  Best piece of technology we own!

VIn this world of never-ending technology it is hard to keep up with what works with what. Such was the case with the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless Headphones which I recently purchased. They were intended to provide private listening to my new LG HDTV. Unfortunately, that was NOT to be the case for me.My new digital TV does have the usual RCA, HDMI, & DMI connections on the back, but not a headphone jack. The Sennheiser comes with the two-wire cord fastened to the transmitter. This cord ends with the standard red and black (not white) RCA-style connectors, but also provide RCA to Phone Jack adapters. This allows you to connect the transmitter to either the Left/Right RCA Audio Out connection on the back of your TV, or plug it into the headphone jack on TV, Computer, etc.What I did not know was that the RCA connectors on my TV are Audio In, not Audio Out (they say only AUDIO). Therefore, when the headphones were connected, they did not work because they were receiving no signal. But, when plugged into the headphone jack of my computer, they worked fine so I knew the headphone and transmitter were OK.After contacting LG, they said my TV had only an Optical Audio Out connection. In order to use the headphones, I would need to purchase an Optical to RCA adapter, about $25-$50 dollars here at Amazon. And, unless you get even more expensive adapters ($80+), your Optical to RCA converter will not work if you have Dolby surround sound active. To get the cheaper adapters to work, you must first turn off the Dolby.My caution is this: Before buying the Sennheiser headphones, check your TV to make sure the RCA plugs (two of them, one red and one white marked with an R (right) and a L(left) on the rear of your TV is Audio Out.Or, that your TV has a headphone jack.If you first read the forum here regarding these headphones (which I didn't), you will see this is pretty common problem.I will give the headphones four stars because they seem to work quite well with my computer, but not with my TV. Now I'm a bit shy of getting an adapter because there is no way of knowing whether it will give satisfactory sound since I do have Dolby sound on my TV. Round and round it goes...

VHeadphones sound great, wireless range is great, and owning two of these products makes it good for my wife and I to watch programming such as horror films or movies with lots of bad language when the kids are asleep.My only quirks are sometimes the reception can have slight crackles in it and if there is no sound for a few minutes, the headphone base shuts itself off giving you loud static in your ears.I own two of these- one base goes in the computer room, the other in the living room. When on the computer at night, I tune the headphones to the computer's base headphone. When watching a movie, we tune the headphones to that base.I can wear these headphones longer than I can wear most other types. Great job in the comfort area!These would definitely make a great gift to others or yourself.

p855
sg5
VFour years ago I had a car battery explode next to me, inside a garage.  I now have 10% hearing in my right ear and 50% in my left.  What I do hear is garbled and hard to understand.  I needed the TV to be so loud that my wife could not hear her TV in the next room.  I have tried several other inexpensive ear plug type devices in the past with poor results.A neighbor told me about the Sennheiser RS120 so I decided to give it a try.It was easy to hook up, and when I turned it on I couldn't believe how well it worked.  Now I can turn the sound all the way down on the TV (to my wife's pleasure) and hear perfectly.  I can mow the lawn and still hear the game or the news.  It will slip off my bald head if I bend over.  I plan to get a sweat band and then attach the set to it.  A very small problem for something that works so well.

VThis is my second time purchasing the Sennheiser RS120.  First headphones lasted 2 years and would have lasted much longer had I not dropped them off my head in a puddle of water outside during a driving rainstorm.  Why would I be outside in a rainstorm, you might ask?  Well, I was under an umbrella and I did not expect them to fall off as I went out to check my mailbox.  The deal is that I love these headphones so much that I wear them nearly all day long as I go about my daily routine.  Indoors and outdoors.  They work so well that I forget I am wearing them.  I am getting hard of hearing so I rely on them to hear TV or music without blasting every one out of the house.  Mine work anywhere I am at:  inside my house or outside on my property ( one acre ).  I would be lost without these headphones.  Great Product!!!

p867

VBought this because my wife is hearing impaired and cannot hear the TV.  Much to my astonishment we could get ZERO reception from ANY distance of our TV.  After reading the instructions I found a footnote that says electronics can cause interference, especially TVs and you should put the base unit as far from them as possible.YES YOU READ CORRECTLY.  The manufacturer states that electronics (especially TV's) can be incompatible with these headphones.Please note you have about 3 foot of cord to get the base unit away from electronics... this was not far enough to make any difference for us.  We will be testing this on other TV's but my advice is that you can't afford to take the risk that this won't work on your TV.  (Yes our TV headphone jack works on other headphones).My advice is to keep looking.

VUnfortunately the one that I've bought doesn't properly work. I mean in wooden and cardboard isolated houses it might run smooth and operate from distances it has indicated in the manual but in the apartments like mine, where there's concrete and brick walls It works horribly. I don't know maybe It's particularly the one that I've got that can't even handle even 3-3.5 feet away from the receiver without making terrible distortion noise... Anyways I personally wouldn't recommend this model, Sennheiser in general is known world wide for it's hi quality products bit this particular model doesn't seem to live even to the minimal expectations one might have. I'd definitely recommend either a different brand or Sennheiser with bigger range and with much stronger receiver that handles the signal transmission well

VPerfect for night movies while the family is sleeping....
p879
sg5
VWell, first I'd like to say I waited over a year of using these headphones to finally write this review.  I work overnight 12 hour shifts, so I have many nights off at home where I stay awake while the rest of my family (wife, very young daughter) are sleeping.  I also really love watching movies.When I came across these headphones I really wanted a wireless headphone that wasn't super expensive.  I used to use an extension cable hooked into my headphone jack, stringing wires all over my living room and causing me to have to remove the headphones any time I got up (bathroom break, grabbing snacks).  I'd like to say the wireless range on these are pretty good and very convenient.  I've even taken out the trash while wearing these headphones, hearing perfectly the whole time.As far as sound quality goes, I hear absolutely no difference as wearing regular headphones.  If for some reason these ever fail, I WILL try out the next class up, but these are good enough I see no reason to upgrade.  The battery life is also really good.  I don't remember one time where the battery has died while using them (with the originally rechargeable batteries they came with!).In fact the only downfall I can think of is laying down with the headphones on is not very comfortable.  But isn't that what is expected with over the ear headphones.Overall I say this is a great buy.  When I purchased these I could not find any store that had them as cheap as Amazon did.  As I said before, I WILL buy these again (if I ever need to of course).

Vgift for picky dad
p885
sg5
VI got this for my dad who is very picky about everything.  He has a slight high-frequency hearing loss and uses hearing aids, but his low pitch hearing is better than most people's.  The problem with him listening to TV before was that if my mom was doing stuff in the next room like unloading the dishwasher, the noise from that was annoying to him when he was watching TV and wearing his hearing aids.  With the Sennheiser RS120, he doesn't hear any hiss, and he doesn't have to wear his hearing aids which he likes.  He doesn't have to hear my mom clattering around in the kitchen either which means she can do what she wants and not worry about annoying him (picky butt).  So it's a win-win for everyone.  He's impossible to buy anything for, and I'm just really happy that he likes this so much.

VI bought these because of the high rating on amazon.  I thought wireless headphones would be great.  I could dance around or get things done with them on.  Not so.  The reception is dreadful.  I get hissing and if I move any more than 10 feet from my receiver the sound is horrid. I'd also like to point out that the speaker itself it just a flat squared off  piece that is supposed to sit on your ear.  There is no cushion around the speaker to help keep it on.  I have never seen anything like this.  They hardly stay on...  maybe just maybe if you want these to watch t.v. quietly they might be alright but for music, not a good idea.  I would've return them but I had moved shortly after I bought them and they were sitting in a box for a great deal of time.  I would not recommend these at all.

VTurns off while in use. Flawed design
p897
sg5
VI was very excited to order a pair of these headsets for viewing TV quietly. They were great at first and had good sound quality. On the first day, the base station (transmitter) turned off in the middle of a program. I thought the unit was defective so I tried the other one since we ordered a pair of them. The result was the same, within an hour the (new) base station shut itself off in the middle of viewing again. I gave it a few more days and several more tries with similar results.If you don't mind the sound cutting off and getting static in the ear suddenly while not being able to turn the base station back on for 1-10 minutes at a time, then this might be an acceptable product for you. I returned both of mine for a refund as it's just too annoying to deal with.

VA Few Connection Hints
p903
sg5
VThese headphones are everything the 5-star ratings say they are - crisp and clear and every bit a match for the visual quality of HD TV.There is one snag - they must have an analog signal.  So if you are planning to use them with a recent LCD or LED TV, check the TV for the type of "Audio Out" signal it can provide.  If "Digital Out" is your only choice, then, in addition to the headphones, you will need an optical cable and a digital-to-analog converter.I ordered a "3 FT Digital Audio Optical TOSLink Cable" and a "FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DAC" from Amazon (The FiiO needs its own 120V outlet for power.).  After connecting the DAC to the headphone charger, and charging the headphones, everything worked great.

I am reasonably happy with sound quality.My problem with them is reliability. The first set I received was deader than a wedge right out of the box.  I sent those back and received a replacement set.  It worked immediately.  We have used this set perhaps a dozen times in the approximately two months we have had them.  Now this set is dying, working only intermittently.I am not impressed with the quality control of these units.....the failure rate of those delivered to me has been 100%.  I cannot recommend them.

The first few days they worked fine except the would occasionally pop, which was disconcerting.  After the first week they began to pop and hiss and I could not tune out the interference.  Another day passed and all I could get was the hissing noise, no audio.  Either I got a bad set of them or there is a circuit defect.  I bought them based on the reviews of customers who had bought them from the Amazon site.  I hope the reviewers are careful in their reviews, people really do read them carefully and spend their hard to come by money based on what they read.

VThese are decent enough headphones.  They sound good although I detect a slight hiss.  I didn't find them uncomfortable at all although they can slip off when I tilt my head too far forward.  However, I can't use them at work at all.  There is a constant rhythmic clicking even when no audio signal is present.  I have tried to track down the source of interference but to no avail.  It is not my computer, monitor or telephone as I have tried powering all these down.  I tried tuning on all three channels.  The online FAQ is of no help.  As work is where I intended to use them, they are useless to me.  Bottom line: they work acceptably well some places but not everywhere.  Be forewarned that they may not work at all where you need them.  The Sony headphones, also 900 mHz, do not have this problem although the reception is not as good.

He can, and does, wear them and can adjust the sound level to suit him without affecting anyone else in the room.  The batteries have an excellent life before requiring a recharge.

When I turn them on, the volume is fine, but after ten minutes I have to increase it, after an hour I have to increase it again. Basically these are not usable after a year. I'm very disappointed.

I would prefer a supple and better fitting leather pad which would be longer lasting and a more secure positing.. If money is not critical, look to them for upscale models having better ear pads.

VI have had these headphones for 3 years now. A year ago I would get a lot of popping and static when adjusting the volume. I cleaned the head piece with a can of compressed air and this reduced the problem by 80-90%.Recently the problem returned with the left earpiece cutting in and out when I adjusted the volume. I cleaned the contacts on the volume and tuning dials with  WD-40, and the headphones are working like new again! The sound is much better than my Sony MDRRF985RK.

VMy wife and daughter have been after me to buy some wireless headphones for quite awhile because I generally stay up later than then and they are tired of hearing the TV at night.  I did some research and checked out all of my options..these seemed to be the best value for the money....Sennheiser well known for wired and wireless headphones....Well, I am QUITE happy with my purchase...it did take me a little bit to figure the tuning...to get it just right, but the sound is clear, the base is great and I can turn the volume on the TV all the way down and still listen...Highly recommend these!UPDATE 2008: I've now had these headphones for three years.  I am still loving them.  The sound is great and it has great range.  I can walk all over my house and still hear fine though when I get to the outer fringes of the range I'll hear bursts of static from time to time.

In two weeks they leaked too and headphones stopped working completely. After several months we bought exactly the same model again. It worked for 6 months and then we got EXACTLY the same problem with leaking batteries. This time I bought 2 year warranty.sent headphones back to manufacturer for repairing.

Vgood wireless headphones
p1064
sg5
VThese headphones are very good. They've started shipping adapters with the headphones, so fear no more if you have a CD player that has only a headphone jack. This should really be 4 and a half stars, because I get a constant, very soft static, but that's probably because my transmitter is right next to my wireless phone and my cell phone, along with my TV... the bass is brilliant (better than my JBL speaker system on my stereo, in fact), and the sound is generally clear. If you walk around alot, you tend to hit static spots, but those are rare and small. I strongly suggest these headphones if you want wireless; if you can use corded headphones, though, I'd suggest a set of Sennheiser corded headphones (no static).

VI'd say these are better suited to classical music than hip-hop. And that suits me just fine. Great clarity. If you want to blow out your eardrums, get a Dr Dre or something. One star subtracted for annoying hiss when input source stops, and another for having to carefully tune it, and for constant low background hiss. I guess I'm saying I wish they were bluetooth. Still, these are my main cans.

VAfter buying atleast half a dozen Sennheiser products I am convinced that the company does not know how to manufacture a bad product. Even if they tried, they will end up making a very good product at the least . This is my second TV headphones and I couldn't not buy them after seeing how many people bought this product on Amazon and gave them such a high rating.When I first unboxed it and connected it to my TV, it took me around 3 minutes from the second I opened the box until the device was fully functioning. I cannot believe how easy it is to use this product. I read some 1 or 2 star reviews and my only explanation is that 1. you received a defective product. 2. you are incompetent when it comes to technology. I am so happy I bought this product by Sennheiser and there products will always be first choice from now on cause the Germans know a thing or two about making an excellent product!Will all the praise I give this product there, nothing is perfect so I will list next the pros and cons of these headphonesPros:- headphone base doubles up as charger as well as holder, just make sure you buy rechargeable batteries (main reason I bought this product)- they fit very snug on your ear- excellent sound- batteries will never run out unless you use them for 24 hours non stopCons:- placements of tuner and volume dial in very bad location. Tuning can easily change if you are laying back on a pillow and move around alittle.- you will start feeling discomfort after an hour of wearing those headphones- static starts to appear when  you are using headphones while using your phoneIn conclusion I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for something affordable. You will not be satisfied if you buy a cheaper product. I did that and I wasted 50 bucks. If you have a much higher budget then go for the higher models.

VGreat Headphones! Beware "Auto-Shutoff" Feature
p1150
sg5
VThe Good: Great Sound, Long Range, Wireless ChargeThe Bad: Auto Shut-off, A Little BulkyI have never reviewed anything before, but these headphones are definitely worth a few words. They have some great features and some unfortunate ones, but overall, they do exactly what they are designed to do, if you set them up right and understand how to use them properly.The base station is lightweight and sleek, and acts as a wireless charger for the actual headphones. This is a great feature, and really well designed. The two metal contact points on the headphones sit gently on the metal rest of the base station. Nothing plugs into the headphones, ever, and they never need batteries replaced. All you need to do to charge them is put them back where they go. A red light on the front of the base station lets you know that they're charging.The base station itself connects to a traditional power source via a small adaptor that, nevertheless, takes up two slots on a standard surge protector. If you have a lot of devices, you'll need to put it at the end ;) The audio runs via a male rca cable, from the base station to your audio source. That is extremely convenient, since it is the standard for most consumer audio products. With an rca to stereo mini adaptor, you can use these cans for pretty much anything.I purchased them as a gift for my grandmother, who is elderly and hard of hearing. I wanted her to be able to enjoy movies and television again without having to crank the volume or risk missing out on things. When I was there to set everything up for her, they worked like a charm.I have to admit, I was shocked myself at how clear the audio signal was. The bass is full and heavy, mids are solid, and the highs are crisp and clear. They work equally well for music, movies, and live television. They get LOUD. Louder than I expected. Loud enough for my grandmother. There is a frequency and volume control on the right side ear of the headphones, so you can make adjustments on the fly. On the left ear is a power switch. Simple, convenient, and user friendly.These are not Bluetooth. The base station broadcasts the signal from your audio device via radio transmission, directly to the receiver on the headphones. You can select a channel from a switch on the front of the base station. As long as the headphones are properly tuned into the broadcast from the base station, and within the very generous range (300ft), the sound is surprisingly good.  Get a snack, go to the bathroom, get the mail...you won't miss a beat. Keep the base station away from lights, power cables, and speakers, and there is very little interference at normal volume levels.I was able to use the output from my parents' television and set it up so that the headphones received an audio signal, even if the volume on the tv itself was turned all the way down. Eureka! Nana could watch a movie with the rest of the family or on her own without disturbing anyone else. I also thought they'd be great for watching tv while on the treadmill, but, alas, they're a little too bulky, and slip off soon after you start running.The biggest drawback of the Sennheiser RS120's is their Auto-Shut off feature. It is a confusing and frustrating experience if you are not well-informed about how it works. THIS IS IMPORTANT, and may be a deal breaker for a lot of people: if the headphones don't detect an audio signal after just a few minutes, they will stop sending a broadcast signal, and you will be greeted by a rush of loud static in both ears. It's an unpleasant surprise, but something that can be avoided altogether with minimal effort.After my mother called to complain that the headphones were no longer working, I took them home to see what was was happening. I hooked them up to my guitar amp to test them out. At first it was amazing. I could practice at night without waking my wife and son. I was able to play anywhere in the room, free from another tether to the amp! After a short break in playing, though, I lost contact with the base station and got the static full force.It was obnoxious and baffling to think that such a stupid feature would be included in something so well-designed in every other aspect. Why? WHY?? From what I've read in other reviews and online forums, it is for compliance with FCC broadcast regulations. Well, ok, then. Moving on...Other reviewers have offered up suggestions for dealing with the issue, and I want to make it clear that it has nothing to do with where it is plugged in or how it is powered. It is just designed this this way. One reviewer's suggestion for dealing with the problem was to crank the source audio, effectively tricking the base station into thinking it is receiving signal when nothing is actually playing. It works, but is not always practical for every situation, and it forces you to listen to the extra gain under your sound track.For me, the auto-shut off is not a deal breaker. Everything else works so well that I've learned to deal with it. A green light glows on the base station when you are broadcasting sound. When it is off, you'll get only static through the headphones. If you know this, you can proceed accordingly. When you pause your movie to go to the bathroom, you simply switch off the headphones before you lose the signal. When you come back, press play, and wait for the green light before switching them back on. After using them regularly, you'll do it automatically.It was the Auto-Shutoff that compelled me to write a review of this product to begin with. It makes them too complicated for my parents (let alone my grandmother) to use, unassisted. I get a lot of use out of them myself, and when we know that Nana is coming over, I'll bring them and set them up for her. In the meantime, I'm happy to finally be able to watch movies late at night when I get home from work. I'm thrilled to be able to play guitar at night without having to hunch in the corner like a troll.Unfortunately, now I owe my grandmother a new gift. She's so difficult to shop for.

VDated Product Doesn't Compete With Modern Technology
p1155
sg5
VAfter getting these set up and tuned in as static-free as possible, I ran a side-by side with my $16 no-name gaming headset. The cheapo gaming headset had better bass, clearer audio, and less sound leakage.There are some serious technical limitations that I think are dating these headphones.  The most obvious is that the base requires a 3.5mm to RCA adaptor, which is included. IT NEEDS AN RCA ADAPTER? really? Does Sennheiser know what decade we're in? Also, there's A F#$king Tuning dial. I'm 34 years old, so I at least know what one of those is but the last time I needed one I wasn't yet old enough to rent a car. We have digital technology now, devices can find signals on their own now, and can do a better job. These headphones, in spite of costing $80, are way out of date. There's some serious sound leakage because the pads are made out of 90's era foam. It's the vintage stuff that breaks down really quickly and sucks in general. Even brandless headsets use better materials in this decade. If you plan on using these in a room with another person, that person will likely be stuck listening to whatever you've got playing. I didn't bother to take these apart, but I would suspect that the internal components are just as low end and dated.Anyway, I'm not much of an audiophile, but I use a lot of headphones for work and gaming. These are some of the worst I've ever used. They're significantly inferior to $<20 studio monitors and are so crappy that there's no point in even comparing them to anything decent.EDIT:After examining the reviews more closely, it's pretty clear that these ARE dinosaur headphones. The most useful 3-star review is almost a decade old. Shame on Amazon... they should crop old reviews after a few years!

p1161
sg5
VThe short:An enjoyable pair of headphones, with good battery life, good audio, and a decent fit. Mine stopped working after roughly two years.Build:Almost the entirety of the headphones are hard plastic, with the exception of the earpads, and the two pads along the top of the headset for comfort. There are two metal contacts next to the pads on the top as well. It feels solidly constructed, and after two years of wear, shows little to no signs of tear. The cables associated with the base transmitter show no sign of damage, fraying, stiffening, etc.Fit:These headphones have no cups, and are just flat. That said, for an hour or two, the headphones feel just fine. After a good number of hours wearing them though, it's really a relief to take them off, as they press against your ears without cups. This is a double edged sword, as I've had cup headphones that aren't big enough, causing the same effect. The length of the side components are adjustable - not too resistant, and not too easily adjusted either. They slide onto the cradle nicely and easily, as only those two large contacts have to touch.Audio: Audiophiles would probably avoid these headphones, but the average joe would probably find these to produce satisfactory audio. The transmitter has three settings for frequency, in case there is interference on any given band (frequency). Along with this, the headphones have two potentiometers - 1 to tune to a set frequency (I assume the reason it is not a three way switch is so that minor variances in the transmitters frequencies do not create poor reception), and the other to control volume. I have occasionally mixed these up, but generally it has been on a non-issue. Overall, when the frequencies were well calibrated, I enjoyed noise free audio, with little to no interference, clipping, etc. Audio quality was similar to what I might enjoy from a pair of mid-tier earbuds.Transmission:I am actually surprised by the range on these headphones. I was able to leave my apartment room, go to the shared laundry room, and change my laundry, with only a slight amount of interference. My building is made mostly of concrete, having roughly three walls between my headphone's cradle and the laundry machines. All and all, the total distance was probably 40-50 feet from the transmitter. I only had to worry about interference due to the chosen frequency channel on the cradle once or twice in my time owning them.Battery life:I don't think I ever ran this thing dead. I could spend a long day gaming, with no fear of it dying, which could constitute up to 8 hours. I left it on the cradle when not in use, and never had an issue with the battery dying. Rechargeable batteries were definitely a beautiful invention.Death:As my headphones were dying, static and almost a 'flickering' in sound was observed. This occurred for a few weeks, and finally one day, my headphones just stopped working. However, the headphones can still create static noise, which leads me to believe that one of the components in the transmitter failed. This was after about two years.Overall:I give this product 3 stars. It seems to have good build quality in the headphones, although perhaps the materials could be superior. The audio was not super great, but I enjoyed many hours of good quality audio, in music, movies, TV shows, games, etc. I deduct two stars because of my failing product, and because of the uncomfortableness of wearing after a good number of hours (think upwards of three hours). I've heard great things about the Sennheiser company, and these appear to be some of their lower tier items, so I would not be surprised if my device's failure was an anomaly - but still a weighting factor on my opinion. Taking this failure out of the picture - I would recommend these headphones to any person who spends a few hours at a time utilizing their headphones at a desk, but who also wants to have a bit of mobility. Extended use is not a recommendation, due to the cupless design of the headphones. Those who are looking for superior audio quality would also probably be not interested in these headphones.

The other was to watch TV and be free of the varying clicks, pops, and hisses that I have dealt with for years with my otherwise excellent Sony headphones.From a reception and sound quality point of view, the 120s far surpass the Sony wireless phones. No noise at all when watching TV and excellent sound. Excellent sound when using the computer to enjoy Sirius as well. No interference anywhere in the apartment.The downside, which could prove to be significant, is fit and comfort. The headband is adjustable, but I have yet to find a position or adjustment I could really call "comfortable," and they tend to slip around. The Sony's were far more comfortable and stable on the head -- if you could stand the unpredictable clicks, pops, and hissing. In the end, sound is the key feature and the Sennheisers have been great in that respect for three weeks. I hope to get used to the comfort and stability issues.I found them extremely easy to hook up to a Samsung TV.At first it can be a little tricky to get the headphones to sit correctly on the recharging stand so that recharging occurs, but that passed quickly. Probably due to the excessive simplicity of the headband, it can't detect whether they are on a head or not, so you have to turn the unit on/off manually with a switch on the left ear cup. Another minor annoyance.Another plus over the Sonys is tuning and reception. Unlike the Sony, there are no transmitter switch positions to set on the Sennheiser base, and no corresponding switch positions to set on the headset. All the tuning is done on the headset with a simple dial that works well. But since it's adjacent to a similar dial for volume, your finger will need to learn to remember which is which. If you can't hear anything or if volume is low, it can be either because the volume is turned down (obvious) or because the tuning needs adjustment (not as obvious).In some respects this should be a 3-star review because of the level of fit and comfort. But all of the performance aspects linked to sound are so good that it would be cheating the unit not to give it a 4-star rating.

VI am a huge fan of wireless headphones, and we have used a pair for our desktop computer for years. Since we live in a 2-floor condo, we really need something that has a strong range, which definitely rules out IR. We tried a couple different models of Bluetooth headphones, but again the range usually couldn't make it across floors. We have previously purchased RF headphones from Radioshack, and when the last pair died after years of faithful service we went with this pair of Sennheiser RS120.PROs:- the signal was strong and clear both in and outside the house, and across both floors.- Batteries are easily accessible- Headset charging stand was easy and surprisingly well designed (you can basically toss the headphones on the wire arms and it starts charging - not picky on placement at all)- Decently comfortableCONs:- Auto-shut off --> this was our deal breaker, BIG TIME. I have a difficult time typing and listening to music or videos at the same time, so I will often pause media when I need to type. After a few minutes, the headphone base would shut off automatically, sending BLASTING static into my ears. Not wanting to give up so easily, I tried to get into the habit of shutting off the headphones when paused. However, the base would have a hard time "waking up" from its shut-off state, and the signal would often not start broadcasting until media was playing for 5-10 seconds. After two weeks of use, I starting getting auto shut-off (and the blasting static that accompanies it) when a video WAS STILL PLAYING, even after trying to tweak the balance between the headphone volume and the system volume.I found I was starting to get apprehensive wearing the headphones. You have a click and about a 1/2 sec between the auto shut-off and blasting static, and I was anxiously awaiting that signal. I felt I really gave them a good try, but sent them back to Amazon for a refund. I'm truly disappointed though, since I have been extremely impressed with Sennheister microphones and receivers. I think these headphones would be excellent if they have a toggle on/off switch or the ability to shut off the auto shut-off. As they stand now, I find them unusable.

VPositives:Well these are defined as over the ear headphones, one can still pick up other outside sounds and voices due to the porosity of the ear foam pads (e.g. your wife commenting negatively on the TV show you are watching and being over the ear they allow you to pretend you cant hear....a great advantage).Once I found the appropriate analog audio output and that manual tuning is required (see negatives) setup up was quick.I like the convenience of the volume knob in the earpad.The audio was crisp and clear and there was plenty of dynamic range, in other words I could adjust the volume to an uncomfortably high level well above my normal TV watching volume.It comes with a couple of audio adapters but not a universal set, e.g. no RCA adapters..Negatives:This unit only accepts analog audio inputs (right and left) which are becoming scarce on 21st century electronics so make sure you have those available for your application.There are 3 RF channels to choose from to deal with RF interference and those are manually selected and then manually tuned to with a dial on the earphones like an old AM radio.  They us FM modulation, circa 60s.  This manual nature of the RF interfaces surprised me and is not something I would expect in even 25 year old electronics.After 3 minutes of no audio input (e.g. turn off TV) a loud hiss/static commences on the headphones.  This means if you leave the headphone off the cradle and turn off the TV the headphone will hiss loudly until the battery dies.  The headphone should turn off as well....poor design.The charging cradle is a bit awkward to use in that if the earpieces are not set for equal length, then the headphone will tilt to one side and the conductors in the headset band will not sit flat on metal bars (you can see the bars in the picture) and the batteries will not charge.The ear pad foam is very light duty and I would not expect them to last 12 months with normal use and wear and tear.There are no RCA adapters included.The charging light stays lit even after charging is complete!Its awkward to plug in the power adapter.  You almost need to used needle nose pliers as there is no room for fingers.On occasion the tuner would detune and I would have to readjust the turning.

VFor a significant amount of time, my elderly father has been increasingly turning up the volume on the television, but refusing to see a hearing specialist. Because this is so disruptive to the household and my mother, I had mentioned he should pick up some headphones or look into something. Being a typical guy, a year went by and the volume just got turned louder and louder.Cue a home visit, where I simply had enough of the screeching. Pulled out the laptop and headed here to Amazon. After reading a significant number of reviews and the questions, settled on Sennheiser RS120. Within 48 hours it was at the house. Within 12 hours it was charged. And within 12 minutes it was hooked up. Because they have a new TV that doesn't have the old red/white audio ports, I had to plug it into the TIVO box, which is actually preferable because it's easier to get there than behind the wall-mounted television. You can mute the TV so only the headphone-wearer hears sound, or you can adjust the volume of the headphones and the TV speaker output independently, such that each listener gets his or her own volume control. The earpads are substantial and soft, and everything about the product - from its packaging in the box to its design and instruction manual - is well made and easy to understand. At first it took a few minutes to tune to the right frequency so there wasn't any static, but after several weeks of use, the sound is crystal clear and additional tuning has very seldom been needed.As an absolute curmudgeonly cynic, my father was bound and determined to find something wrong with this. A month later, and his only complaint it that it fits a bit loosely, which is probably a deliberate design choice so the wearer doesn't get a tension headache. So while he can't bend and do toe-touches while wearing the earphones, he can putz around, grab treats from the fridge, pet the dog - all while leaving the rest of us in quiet peace. In other words, it's completely worth the price tag.

VI've had my Sennheiser headphones about 6 years and been completely satisfied with them. Just now, after much use, the plastic headband has cracked and I'm looking for replacements. Guess what I'm going to buy......you guessed it, another of the same make and model.I've found them to be extremely comfortable to wear, even when watching long movies on TV (my primary use). I use them particularly to watch TV shows in which I need help with hearing high frequencies, particularly women's voices. High frequency hearing deficiency is common with older folks like myself. These headphones have been a lifesaver in that respect.I also use them when watching high-quality musical programs. The outstanding music reproduction and stereo/surround quality of these headphones is amazing. Frequency response seems well balanced and doesn't have the high boom-boom bass of many modern headphones targeted to kids.Another use is that my wife likes to watch TV at low sound volume. I prefer higher volume. With the headphones we can each have it our way.I also like the fact that I can be watching a TV program and be able to get up and get a snack or take a bathroom break in the middle of a show and not miss any dialog. Yes, the further you get away from the sending unit, the more likely that the signal will break up but that's to be expected.In the 6 years I've owned them, I've only replaced the rechargeable batteries once, and that was simply a preventative measure, not a necessary one. I don't know how much useage is possible on a single charge because I've never had them expire. I normally use them two or three times and then put them back on the charger.I'm buying another pair and look forward to another 6 years or more of use.

VThe Cause of Interference is not the Headphones Problem
p1195
sg5
VI bought the Sennheiser Wireless Headphones despite the very negative reviews because of the stated bad hiss, pops, buzz, and hums in the head phones. I come to find out, it is not the headphones. When I brought them home to test I first charged them properly for 24 hours as the manual requests. I then hooked them up to my TV cable box in the master bedroom and immediately got very bad hiss - pops - buzzes and hideous noise on the head phones. I thought to myself I should have listened to the bad reviews and was ready to take them back. I tried all three frequency positions on the transmitter and on each setting moved the "tuning" wheel on the head phones back and forth to try and get rid of the constant noise. But no luck all three frequencies were really bad couldn't hear the TV program. I then took the entire system and hooked it up to the TV cable box into the kitchen. AND VEOLIA!!! PERFECT AUDIO! No hiss - no buzzes - no pops - no hums - no noise. Nothing but a perfectly CLEAN audio from the TV.The problem all of the bad reviews were experiencing was their TV or cable box or something in that room where they were hooking the headphones up were experiencing interference from their TV or a wireless phone or dirty power or something that was causing the bad audio. IT IS NOT THE HEAD PHONES FOLKS.I then took them over to my Mom's house,(who I bought them for)and hooked them up and PERFECT CLEAN AUDIO AGAIN. No problems.  I bought these head phones for my 93 year old Mom who lives with my sister and is hard of hearing. She would watch TV in her room and not turn up the audio on the TV for fear it would bother my sister. So she would watch the TV in dead silence. You should have seen her face the first time I put the head phones on her. It was like a deaf person that could hear for the first time.So folks .... these head phones WORK PERFECTLY. If you experience noise on them when you hook them up, then you have a problem in your house. Hook them up somewhere else and test them again. The problem is NOT the headphones. Thank you SENNHEISER!My Mom is enjoying TV again and is ecstatic. Oh by the way .... I first bought the JBL Wireless Headphones for my Mom but the volume could not be turned up past normal hearing levels. My Mom needed them a little louder and the Sennheizers did provide that and room to spare.

VFor the price this system works well.  Very easy to install but make sure that your tv or cable/satellite box has an audio out.A couple notes if you buy this.  First when you plug it in it says that the green light is supposed to come on.  My set didn't and I kept retrying to insert the power plug.  I finally thought that the light might be faulty so I went ahead and set it up.  As soon as I plugged in the RCA jack for audio the green light came on.  Another problem I had was that I couldn't get anything but static through the headphones.  I mean really bad static that varied when I moved my head.  Once again tried relocating the base unit to no avail.  There are three switches/thumbwheels on the headset.  One of them is marked Tuning.  I thought that meant bass/treble.  Nope, just like an old FM portable radio you have to rotate the tuning wheel until you get a clear signal.  I wear glasses and I notice a little discomfort wearing headphones.  The earpads are fairly soft but I think the design could be a little better.  For me, ear buds would definitely be better.So if you consider this remember you need an audio out and when everything is plugged up on the transmitter just tune the headset to a good signal and you will be good to go.UPDATE:  I have had these headphones a few days now and they seem to be just getting better and better.  The sound is amazing, no hiss that I have heard others describe. I got an optical audio cable that has rca plugs and am using that instead of the regular rca output. Makes a big difference. I suppose there may be something out there that sounds better than these but I doubt I could tell the difference.  I don't think anyone would regret buying these headphones.  I changed my rating to 5 stars!

VI bought this unit and two additional headsets from Amazon in 2009. They units have been in use since then and continue to work well. We use them in our home gym to provide TV sound while exercising.The sound is superior to TV speakers. Without them, there is a tendency to increase TV volume when more than one person is exercising, which results in a noisier environment and makes casual talking more difficult. The louder a TV is played the poorer the sound quality is going to be. These headphones eliminate all these issues. Volume is individually controlled, its easier to understand the TV and comments from others and the lower noise level is a plus for everyone involved.There has never been a problem with battery life that we've encountered. We have added small number labels to keep track of which one we are using and each person puts his on the charger after use. There is no formal program in place, just an effort to get them all a turn on the charger. Usage and charging can be sporadic but we have yet to have a battery problem.The only maintenance we do is to occasionally remove the pads and rinse them under the faucet. After rinsing, press them together to squeeze out most of the water and leave them to dry for the next session. We don't scrub or rub these as they are a thin open celled foam and probably would not respond well to rough or aggressive treatment. The frequency of cleaning would depend on your on preference. The pads are really easy to remove and to reattach.The headphones tend to move or slip when doing exercises where your arms may contact them or where the the head moves a lot or changes orientation. Examples of this are some aerobic dancing moves or reclining on a bench to lift weights. They are best suited for things like treadmill, elliptical and stationary bike. To me those are the most boring and where I need them the most.These are well made, good quality units. They are dependable and easy to use. In my opinion they provide good value for the money spent.

VI, like many others here, certainly do not understand the 5-star ratings.  Maybe those reviewers are not used to good sound or just don't appreciate great headphones or great music.  I spent a lot of time hoping to find wireless headphones at least nearly as good as wired, and am certainly disappointed.  I went with Sennheiser because I had their wired ones a number of years ago and remember them as pretty good.  First, they are NOT "over ear" as I define that; i.e. they rest "on" the ear and do not surround your ear, fitting against your head like other "over ear" headphones I've had.  Therefore, they slip off my ears due to the weight when bending over even a little bit.  Also this gives no blocking of external room sounds.  Second, I had to seriously tweak my equalizer to get any acceptable frequency balance when listening to music.  The response is very unlike my other speakers and headphones around the house, so I only use these with one laptop to not have to change my equalizers back and forth when going from speaker to headphones.  Thirdly, the auto volume leveling just about destroys music that has a variety of volume levels that do a lot to make the music what it is.  Every time I'm expecting the nice punch from one level to another, like after a soft intro to a metal or symphonic number with great base and drums, the equalizer kicks in almost instantaneously and flattens it out to where it sounds like it's coming out of a cheap low powered radio.  The auto-off feature, combined with the auto level control is absolutely teeth -grindingly annoying.  I often listen to news features while walking around doing random chores and if the sound goes off after what seems like no time at all, it cuts in with loud static.  I had wanted to try wireless for a long time, but was wary because of reviews that say they're just nothing like wired.  They are very very handy for listening to the non-music things like news, etc while doing things all over the house.  The range is excellent, even out on the front/back porch or out to the garage, with little or no cutting out or fading.  But for sound (music) quality, they're not even close to as good as a cheap pair I have for use with my Android music player, which I now exclusively use for music as these do not cut if for music.  Having tried them for about 5 weeks, I guess  I'll keep them for use with the laptop for news/videos/tutorials/etc. which I do a lot and is just not practical wired.  But the disappointment in sound quality for music, the irritating auto-off and auto-level control with no options to turn them off, the not very solid fit on my head or around my ears make these a 2-star at best.

VGreat for TV Listening - My Wife Loves It!
p1218
sg5
VSITUATION:  My wife is hard of hearing in both ears and has a problem comprehending some TV dialogue, especially whispers.  She does not like to wear her hearing aids while watching TV.  She needed a comfortable and affordable amplified listening device that would last up to five hours without the need to be recharged.  Using TV Ears initially met her audio needs but, even with new battery packs, TV Ears batteries quit after three hours or less of headset use.  After carefully comparing the wireless headset products available, the Sennheiser RS120 was chosen to replace TV Ears.  There were concerns: the 106 db RS120 ratting might not produce enough volume (TV Ears puts out up to 125 db) and some users did report  problems with the RS120.  But the RS120 seemed to be the best solution overall for a moderate price.INSTALLATION & SETUP:  It took only a few minutes to replace TV Ears with the Sennheiser RS120 system.  The RS120 audio cable was plugged into the audio output of an LED LCD TV. (The various audio adapters provided were not needed but Sennheiser is commended for trying to minimizing trips to RadioShack in search of the right adapter.)  The RS120 power supply was plugged into the wall and connected to the unit.  The AAA 600mAh batteries furnished with the RS120 were replaced with fully-charged NiMH 800mAh batteries to insure maximum headset operating time between charges.  The TV was fired up, headset turned on and tuned (just once), and the volume was adjusted to a comfortable level.RESULTS:  The RS120 exceeded all expectations.  My wife was very happy with the RS120.  The sound quality was far superior to TV Ears.  Battery life easily met the five hour requirement.  No pops or clicks have been detected while using the headset.  Yes, the RS120 transmitter shuts off after five minutes without sound input but it has never shutoff while a TV program was running and it restarts almost instantly when audio is present.  Unlike TV Ears, there is no hiss during normal operation.  There is a noticeable headset hiss when the transmitter shuts off but it is not loud and has not been a problem.  If the RS120 has automatic gain control (AGC), it is a blessing in this application as it makes low level dialogue easier to understand and prevents loud sounds from blasting through the headset.  The available headset volume is more than adequate.  Headset tuning is simple and stable.  The headset is very comfortable to wear.  The transmitter readily charges the headset without requiring more than placing the headset on the cradle.  (TV Ears headsets had to be wiggled in the transmitter slot to ensure charging.)  The RS120 wireless RF feature is a bonus.  My wife can get up and move around, even to another room, and continue to hear the TV well.RECOMMENDATION:  I recommend the Sennheiser RS120 to anyone who wants to hear hassle-free TV audio through headphones including those with mild hearing loss.

VBest long range wireless headphones for home
p1224
sg5
VI purchased the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones in 2009 to use for work. My job involves listening to and evaluating the speaking skills of students. I work from home and move around a lot in my home while I'm doing my job. So, as you can imagine, I had high demands for this product. Overall, I have found that they are durable, dependable, and offer the best range of wireless headphones like these. In fact, I just purchased a replacement pair.PROS: Best range of any consumer wireless headphones, even at a higher price point.CONS: Big and unsightly and can get a little uncomfortable after long-term wear (i.e. 40 hours per week). (I wish this same technology could be adapted for ear buds but I'm not sure if that's possible.)A little about me and my headphones ... I used (and abused) these babies for 8 hours/day M-F for about 2 years. My using involved listening to audio files for work. When I wasn't working, I also used the to stream TV and audio books for pleasure, while walking around the house, doing chores, light exercise, cooking, etc. I had them serviced twice during the warranty period, which was a relatively hassle-free process. (In fact, they have an old school repair shop and you can actually talk to the repair guys on the phone.) I'm sad to say that after 2.5 years, they stopped working. I'm not entirely surprised as I'm hard on these babies and knock them around a lot. I recently purchased a replacement pair (same make/model).My favorite aspect is the range of coverage. I have tried other models, some that those that use infrared (line of sight) technology, Bluetooth, and also headphones that claim to have a similar range (i.e. Sony's 900MHZ Analog RF Wireless Headphones and others by JVC and RadioShack). NONE of the others could even begin to compete with the range of this particular model by Sennheiser.When using the Sennheiser RS 120's, I can walk from room to room in my 1200 square foot apartment, down 2 floors, and even a couple hundred feet outside (to take out the garbage, etc.) with good sound. If you just wanted to watch TV, i.e. be in the same room, another type of headphones would be fine (and might work better as they'd be "lower profile.") But if you need to move to another room, the Sennheiser RS 120 is the only model that will actually maintain audio quality through walls, in my experience.

VI've only had these wireless headphones a little over a week, but I already like them!The sound quality for TV and movies is very good--you'll pick up stuff you'd otherwise have missed! The mid-range and base are decent for a product in this price range.The transmitter/receiver range is outstanding--I can hear the program anywhere in the house!Comfort-wise, they are a bit roomy, and a snugger fit would be welcome.They are not feather-weight, but they're not overly heavy either. I can easily sit through a movie wearing these.As to the design, I would have put the volume control towards the bottom of the ear cup, and the tuner control higher up--just backwards of the way they're set up. I also would have made the volume control knob larger than the tuner control knob, because you're likely to fiddle with the volume far more often than the tuner. But this is minor stuff.Recharging is simple and convenient--simply hang the headphones up on the transmitter's charging stand, and forget about them until they've recharged.If your TV doesn't have a headphone jack, and you use the audio out jacks for the signal to the transmitter, you will need to have some volume turned up on the TV, which can then be further amplified with the headphone's volume control. But this is no big deal, as the TV can be at the lowest murmur, and you can amp up the sound plenty loud in these headphones!Installation and set up is simple, but the instructions are brief, to say the least. If you're a newbe to this kind of thing, you may have questions that aren't addressed in the instructions, but just take your time and you'll figure it out. There's only three connections to make--power, and the left and right audio out jacks. A handy converter is included for TVs with a headphone jack, should you want to use it.I ordered an extra headphone to go with the original transmitter/headphone, to accommodate an occasional guest, and as a back-up, should the batteries in one headset lose their charge. Note that one transmitter can service multiple headsets.In all, this is a very neat set up and it's got the look and feel of quality merchandise.PROVery good performance at a great price!Great transmitter/receiver range!Obvious quality--especially for the price!Simple installation--includes everything you need!CONErgonomics--somewhat loose fit and control locations could be better.Not overly heavy--but you won't forget you're wearing them.Vague instruction manual for newbe consumers.SUMMARYI really enjoy being able to watch anything, anytime, without worrying about disturbing other people in the house! Some movies and shows just need to be loud!Overall, yes, we'd recommend these Sennheiser wireless headphones!R&J;, Wisconsin

VUse your cable box to transmit!
p1236
sg5
VI was so excited to get these headphones--I use them while walking on the treadmill so I don't have to turn the TV up loud.  I took everything out of the box and hooked it all up.  While I'm generally very tech-savvy, I could not get the TV audio to transmit through the headphones.  I kept going over the piss-poor instructions that are included, but I was stumped.  Everything seemed to be hooked up right--the base cords were plugged in to the headphone outlet in the back of my flat-screen TV, the headphones had charged overnight, and the transmit indicator button was lit up.  But nevertheless, nothing would transmit except static.  I was very frustrated and was ready to ship them back to Amazon.  But as a last resort I jumped online and read through the Amazon reviews and discussion boards.  The trick is NOT to plug the base cords into your TV ports.  Instead (assuming you have a cable box hooked up to your TV), run it to the audio ports on your cable box.  Any modern digital cable boxes (ours has a DVR) should have multiple ports in the back.  That was the magic fix!  So easy, but it doesn't say this anywhere in the instructions.  Once I got it transmitting, it worked great and so far I haven't had any problems.  Another trick is to do the same thing with your DVD player.  If you run the base cord directly to the audio port on your DVD player you will be able to transmit the DVD player sound.  But note, no sound will come from the TV so the headphone wearer is the only one who can hear a DVD that is playing.  This only happens with the DVD player, not the TV.  There's probably a way around this, but it's not that important to me to figure it out.  Finally, the headphones stay on my head just fine, even while power walking.  I haven't tried to run with them on, but I still think they would stay on.

His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with our current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.UPDATE - 3/17/15 -  I must say, after 4 1/2 years of almost daily use, 2-3 hours at a time, on the same batteries supplied I might add, all I can say is I would give these headphones a 10* if possible!!! They work from one end of the house to the other 65' long -  they work great outside for yard work with all windows closed. They work fine all the way to the end of my driveway about 200' long. On almost 3/4 acre, I haven't found anywhere they don't pick up the signal strong and clear. I have recommended these to several people who have bought them and are pleased. If they ever fail, I will buy another pair just like them. The only negative thing I have found is what others mentioned in that they can fall loose when leaning forward. Knowing that, I just slide the top band a little further back when I will be bending over and problem solved. So to me, there is nothing negative that can't be fixed with little effort.  A+, 10* and great headphones. I am VERY happy and that happens very seldom with purchases these days.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone.

VSennheiser RS120...Don't waste your money even at 50% off
p1248
sg5
VI'd been in the market for a set of wireless headphones for over a year; I researched the product; I read other reviews. When I saw the 50% off sales price on this Sennheiser unit I told myself, "wow; I can finally afford a pair of these things."I ordered.  They were delivered promptly, in a new, never before opened package.  Here's what I found and how I rate the product:Instruction materials:  Very Poorly done.  For example, on the battery charger, transmitter unit, there is a switch on the bottom of the front of the unit.  The switch has a barely visible left, center and right toggle for apparently opting for 1 of 3 positions.  However, nowhere in the instructions is there either a picture of the switch nor any information about what the switch is for.  Is this an on-off switch?  Is this a channel choice switch?  Is this a transmission frequency switch?  Is this just a play switch that really does nothing except...?Battery Charging Cradle:  Very Poorly created.  One must position the unit with extreme precision and ensure the charging unit/transmitter rests on a flat, level platform where even the slightest vibration say from footsteps of a passer-by won't jostle the units off center thus aborting the charge operation.Sound Quality:  Fair to Good, but only when and while the transmission of the sound was in fact working.Transmission: Very Poor.  These are wireless units that, when properly installed (easy to do following the booklet from the TV company, not so following the Sennheiser literature)and working allowed me to listen to tv programming.  Problem is...sound continued to be delivered sporadically...intermittently.  For no reason I could ever identify, transmission was start/stop seemingly without cause.  Then, again without cause...silence!Over several days, I tried using the headphones.  I was never able to listen to more than a few lines of dialog of a program before the units shut off and went silent.  A few times, the silence was preceded by nearly ear-drum bursting screeching sounds.I thought at one time all of this might have been a result of the failure of the batteries to properly recharge so I went out and bought new batteries.  The fully charged, new batteries made no difference in performance.

VI bought these wireless headphones to replace an Acoustics Research setthat conked out.  These Sennheisers have good sound in all ranges,easy recharging, and good TV compatibility for their moderate price.The only thing that prevented me from rating these headphones 5-starsis that the design and comfort leaves much to be desired.  I knew whenI purchased them that they were "on-the-ear" type and that's not theproblem; the on-ear part is very comfortable and can even be replacedif necessary for a small charge.  The annoying, uncomfortable part isthe headphone band that goes across the top of the head.  It doeshave some foam/velour padding, but the way they're designed makes thempress on the top of the head regardless of how you adjust them.  Afteran hour or so, I have to re-adjust them so my head doesn't hurt.I can live with this, but the most infuriating thing is that whenmoving around the house while wearing them, if you just bend forwardslightly they fall off and hit the floor regardless of how they areon your head.  The only way I got around this was to position theheadband far back, behind the crown of my head.  This works if you onlybend forward slightly, but if you bend way down to pick somethingup, they still fall off.  If you're standing on a hard floor, thiscould cause them to break.  I wish the designers would test theseproducts on human beings with various head sizes and moving aroundlike you're supposed to be able to.  That's the idea of wirelessheadphones, right?  I honestly think they tested these on ahoneydew melon.  Otherwise, for the price, I think these are a goodsounding, good range wireless set.  They just need a design upgradethat's more comfortable and effective.

VWorks for Watching TV at Night
p1260

VI struggled with which headphones to buy to watch TV at night so my spouse can sleep. Every time I read reviews I got overwhelmed and gave up. I'm happy that I finally settled on these Sennheisers, because they do just what I needed them to do at reasonable price.I'm very satisfied with these headphones.They fit okay. Although they are not what I'd classify as "comfortable", I don't wear them for more than a couple of hours a night, so they are acceptable. They do get hot on my ears when it's warm in the room. I tried a pair of TV Ears before and they are painful to wear, so these are MUCH more wearable than those were. I wish these had cup design so that they wouldn't slip around so much on my head when I move, the smooth ear covers can slip and slide.These headphones are extremely easy to put on the charging stand.The only time I hear hissing or static is when I first put them on and I haven't started the TV yet. If the TV is on pause when I first put the headphones on, there is static. After I start watching TV, I can pause without any noise. If there is static once I start to watch, all I need to do is turn the lower dial and tune in the headphones and no more problem.I have a little trouble with the way the dials are set up, because it's easy to turn the wrong one. When I want volume, I might accidentally tune the headphones in the wrong direction and lose my clear sound. Easy to fix, but I'd rather not have to think about it. I also would like an easy on off switch. This one is tiny and a little hard to move.I completely recommend these headphones to people who want to watch TV without disturbing others. I can hear most other sounds in the room even with the headphones in use. There is some sound leakage but it doesn't bother my spouse at all. (I use these with a 52" Sony Bravia LCD TV. I turn off the separate sound system to use the headphones.)

VMy husband has extensive hearing loss, & even with his hearing aids, he has to 'blast' the TV to even hear it.  My ears would be 'ringing' when the volume was so loud.  Even then, he would continue to miss words here & there & was always saying, "What did they say?"  It got to the point that I didn't even want to be in the same room when he was watching TV.  Well, after watching TV the evening before & going to bed with a splitting headache from the piercing volume, I decided I needed to do something to resolve this problem.  I got online, looked at a number of similar products, & somewhat reluctanty, ordered this set. The price was reasonable & they appeared to be a quality product. Those earphones have been a Godsend!  In fact now, when my husband is using them, he has the external volume so low that I have to ask him to turn up the volume for me. I was concerned the headphones might be 'heavy' but they really are light & comfortable.  On top of everything else, my husband has ADD.  He cannot sit through a TV program without getting up to go do something at any given moment.  When he'd come back in the room, he'd want to know what had happened on the program while he was elsewhere.  It used to be a huge bone of contention.  Well, wherever he wanders to now, he has his headphones on, inside or out, and he never misses the program because he can hear it wherever he is...even outside.  I have put a 'squash' on him listening to a program & being on the computer at the same time! I love, love, love these headphones, as does my husband...plus the fact that they have a charger where they rest when not in use.  I just ordered a second set for our bedroom.  I can't recommend these headphone enough!  They've made my life blissful!

VTo much white-noice or shutdowns
p1272
sg5
VThe product is well packaged, looks very professional, and the charging system is unique and has worked well.The set was connected to a Sony 50" rear-projection set in a location with no heavy wiring or metal objects, cement walls or ceiling and I'm not happy with the reception since the sound can be distorted with some static or hum depending on whether I'm watching a VCR tape or TV program 10-15' away. The headphone acoustics isn't all that good in my opinion. I'm really dissatisfied that one spot right in the middle of my lazy-boy that causes the sound to become distorted,  with a lot of white noise -- just a tilt or movement of the head either left or right. The height of the transmitter or moving it away from the TV location does not make any difference as does resetting to one of the other two channels on the transmitter.An apparent problem is when the input signal to its transmitter is too low, you mute the TV, pause the VCR, or a scenes is being shown that has a long silence, the base unit will shut down and a very loud static will blast your eardrums and that really hurts. This could be a big drawback if it depend on the TV volume alone since the purpose of using them in the first place is to turn the volume down. It does shut down on occasion for no apparent reason.On occasions, as with many wireless products, there is occasionalinterference and I have received the next door neighbor talking on their phone which is a cordless but I don't know their frequency. Our 800mh phone does not interfere and there is no other wireless items round except garage door opener devices.The headset fits pretty well and is comfortable for extended wear but is slightly larger than I like for my head size 7. It certainly tends to slip around to much or fall off when nodding your head. They could have improve the ear pieces by cupping them so they fit around the ears instead of the fitted flat covers used.Too much interference for a $70 device in my opinion.Update 10/18/09: Had to use the manufacturer warranty on 9/21/09 since the charging system failed. Just received today a confirmation that the unit is being replaced and that Seenheiser is mailing a new replacement.First edit: Everything above still stands after receiving my replacement. But, the reception and sound tracking is really, really better than the first set. I took the covers and foam rubber off the ear pieces and cut out a circle from the foam rubber so that the phone pieces more or less fit around the ears. After replacing the covers and the foam rubber circles the headset fits a lot better and doesn't fall off to often. Now why couldn't they think of that.Update 5/30/12: The two paragraphs above with stood the time until today when the receiver base GREEN light no longer lights when attached to its source nor is there any sound in the headphones other than white noise. Checking every single thing to see if there was a connection problem of some sort I found nothing had changed and unplugging and re-plugging didn't help. Still no reception so guess the RS120 is shot. Lasted just over three years before failing with absolutely no abuse.

VSound quality good, not superb. Does the job for TV listening.
p1277
sg5
VSetup tip: turn up the TV volume to about 70%, then adjust headset volume to suit. If you keep the TV volume down, then crank up the headset volume, you're gonna get alot of noise.I am using the RS120 with a cheap color TV and DirecTV standard def box. The base station plugs into a headphone port on the TV. See comment above on setting the volume levels, before you conclude that the headphones are noisy.I did have to charge overnight before the headphones were usable out of the box. Once charged, I used them very successfully for the first time last nite.  The sound quality is good, with a very light hiss of background noise. The background noise is not annoying and is way down in level, but is good since it tells you that you the headphones are on and it's the TV program that might be silent for the momentThe comfort is nice, but if you're sitting in bed with your head against a pillow, then you may find that the pillow sort of pushes the headphone cups away from  your ears. So it takes a bit of pillow punching to get everything squared away, but this unit perfectly accomplished my mission, which is: to watch TV at night without waking the spouse up.Charging seems pretty automatic - just place the headset on the chargers hanging rack, and the red light indicates charging is going on. You don't have to be accurate about positioning.Highly recommended. I did not give the full 5 stars just because at times I felt I heard some distortion in actors voices now and then... like a sample error of some sort... it was minor but noticeable. Not sure it wasn't the satellite downlink, but I never heard this through the TV speakers. I would recommend this unit to anybody, you will definitely be happy... I am nitpicking on holding back that 5th star.

VEDIT: 2012: This become unusable at work when I got stuck in a 4-up cube. Just too much interference.I brought this home and gave it to my son - who insists on having his study desk next to the home theater. I can't blame him per-se - but he's been on the edge of eviction to his own room due to two-way noise conflicts.He hooked these up put them on and wouldn't let me touch them. He gets good noise isolation (almost too much - doesn't hear the intercom) and it's got the quietness and good range as advertised.So I recommend these - just with the caveat that they may not work well in a work cube type environment.Original follows:This is for RS120 and RS130 - and I eventually bought the RS130.I work for a computer company and bought this for my cube. A key characteristic is lots of RF noise - nearly every adjacent cube has a laptop and a deskside (or two if doubled up).Essentially all reviews were for home use. I was fortunate to borrow an RS-120 and an RS-130 at work - same floor even) I used the RS-120 for half hour and the RS-130 all day.From overall performance, I found RS-120 and RS-130 comparable as far as susceptibility to interference. I preferred the around the ear of the RS-130 over the RS-120 and my colleage with the RS-120 indicated his ears need a break from the RS-120 after several hours.The surround sound and auto tuning of the RS-130 were plusses but I bought the RS-130 mostly for the around the ear comfort and fit.Overall I really like these - but I do have some comments - and those tie back to other comments - "the hiss in the background".Some posters commented on "the hiss in the background". My RS-130s (and the one I borrowed) had this - but as Bruce Campbell said "it's a trick - get an axe".OK, they're not tricking you - but there is a workaround.The hiss seems to come from their on-headphone amplifier. You can make that go away by1) setting the on-headphone volume very low. Essentially dial it down until the hiss just goes away. Or a little more if you want to adjust volume more from headphone than computer.2) Crank up the drive to the base unit. I've got my computer Wave and Volume controls set very much higher than I used with my corded headphones. And now I get great volume out of the headphones. And I get it without any perceptible clipping or degradation.The bottom line - the base unit likes and is fine with driving it relatively hard - and by doing that not using much of the headset amp you sill not have a hiss problem.My last point is interference. In this very noise (ambient RF) environment at work I occasionally have a "pfft" as I turn my head or move about. Occasionally. Even with base 3 feet away. But so far, I've found no headset better and these are otherwise really sweet. [I otherwise can't say how these do with 900mhz phones]Overall - 4 stars and in particular prime for office use.

VOriginal review below. Now it is 2012 and these quit working about 9 months after I bought them!!!!!! Took them in for repair (costly, too!), but they could not be fixed where they would work decently with any TV we have. They just would not hold a charge. Started out OK for an hour or 2, but got worse and worse, down to 15 minutes by the time I threw them away!!!! Maybe I had a dud set, but I would not want to purchase this brand again.Old review:Wow, this headset is wonderful compared to what I was expecting! Last time I used a wireless headset from Radio Shack many years ago, I got so frustrated with the static, reception cutting in and out and poor overall sound quality. I love to watch TV in bed, but hubby can't sleep so I decided to try wireless again. These are amazing. Was originally going for some Sonys at $59.00, but read and compared reviews and opted to spend a few more bucks and see if the Sennheisers were as good as promised. You won't be disappointed in either the quality of the sound or the distance you can hear clearly away from the base unit. I can walk all over the house, indoors and out on the patio, and can hear every word. The headset is a bit big, but not uncomfortable, and is fine lolling in bed or a recliner and not having to move about much. Controls are a little tricky to manage without taking off the headset (as I had read in a review) but once set, I can forget about them. Nice long viewing time between charges. I also love that I can set the TV for me to hear, let my Mom use the earphones as loud as she wishes and we don't bother each other by her not being able to hear and me not being able to tolerate the loud volume she needs. Really glad I got these!!!!

VBetter with add-on ear pads
p1317
sg5
VThese sound great for older user's hearing as someone else had posted but I've not compared the audio to any other headphone but Sony MDR-RF970R. To be fair to the Sony, I used them back when the frequency spectrum had 900MHz overcrowded. Now that spectrum is ideal for wireless headphones; range and interference ate not a problem for 90% of house and yard in my suburban area that has 2.4GHz spectrum overcrowded, killing my Wi-Fi at that frequency (I use 5GHz 802.11AC with little interference and food coverage for Wi-Fi. I didn't like the fit of either headset until I took the ear pads off the Sony and placed them on the Sennheiser headset. Now they sound and feel much better and don't fall off when I lean forward. I had to order replacement ear pads because the old Sony ones were cracked and peeling, leaving black vinyl dots stuck to me ear. The lead times are long, coming from China but the photo shows a simple slip on modification to the existing Sennheiser twist lock ear cover with existing foam cover still attached. The reviews for the add-on ear pad were filled with complaints with replacements not fitting well, too small. I carefully slipped these on with a thin nail file; it's important not to stretch weak material do it stays. Initially, with the original pads, I want lining up the twist locks and I had the problem of the pads popping off until I aligned and locked them in. I don't have the problem other complained of with pad not staying on once locked properly. But you can see, I almost ran out of material but no adhesives required. Here's an Amazon link to replacement pads ordered:https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00LGEO1W2/ref=yo_ii_img

VMy husband recently bought me a treadmill.  I though that I could walk while watching my favorite shows.  I was sadly mistaken.  The treadmill was to loud to hear the t.v. over.  That is when I asked y husband if they made headphones that hook-up to the t.v. He went on the search for me.  He did a lot of research and settled on these.  They cost a little more than some, but well worth it.Not only am I able to walk on the treadmill and hear my t.v. shows, but also around the house and outside.  What is the point you ask?  Well I put the t.v. on music and clean without bothering anyone with the volume.  However sometimes I start singing and since they can't hear my music, it is awful!The sound produced by these headphones is exceptional!  It is really clear.  There is a tuning wheel on the side that helps you get the signal from the base perfect no matter the distance.  I am sure that there is a certian distance that these will no longer work, but I have yet to find it in my 1.5 arce of land and house.  I just mess with the tuning wheel when it gets a little fuzzy and the sound is crisp and clear.They fit nicely on my head too.  They are padded for extra comfort, this helps.  They also fit my husband comfortly.  The base charger is also sleek and easy on the eyes.  We have it set up right next to the t.v. in the master and it blends in.  Charge time is super short and it seems they stay charged forever!  I have used them for 7 days for 4 hours a day without charging. (kept forgeting to take them to the bedroom till I needed them again.)  I have had this product for a few months no with absolutly no complaints!~ Happy Shopping ~

Vhow to setup sennheiser 120 with Tivo
p1335
sg5
VI agree with the good reviews but have somethings to add.Documentation was worse than terrible. at least for neophytes like me. I think all I really knew to do from the documentation was to install batteries in the headset and charge.Thank goodness for the web because at first, all I got was a whole lot of static.Turns out because my TV is connected via HDMI to my Tivo box, my only option (that I know of that works) is to connect the sennheiser to my Tivo box, not to my TV (even though there were definitely appropriate audio plugs on my samsung hdtv).Once I removed cablesfrom the TV and reconnected cables to the Tivo audio ports - things worked great with no other installation problems other than to do some tuning and volume control. I used the red and black connectors from the cable supplied in the sennheiser box, things worked amazingly well.I like that whoever is wearing the headsets, all they need to do is turn down the audio on the tv using standard procedures. Results is that others in the room without the headset don't hear the tv but if the wearer of the headset adjusts the volume on the headset itself, they can hear everything very well.  If I'm on my computer 6 or 8 ft away, I can't hear a thing.Most importantly, they don't need to be plugging and replugging the headset.Though because of the connection directly to the TIVO, this means that if we ever get a DVD player, we will need to disconnect sennheiser from TIVO and connect to the DVD player.  It seems the sennheiser for it to be functional needs to be able to be plugged into whatever box has the "active" or "in use" HDMI connection to the TV.

p1347

VI bought 2 pairs of these headphones for myself and my parents in 2010. Both have lasted about 2 - 3 years before the headsets gave way.I've had some issues with these headsets over the years, primarily the volume controls stop working and need to be cleaned up some rubbing alcohol.After about 3 years the earphones stop working, the clarity is shot in one set and in other set one earphone has stopped working completely.PRO's:Very sturdy, well built feels solidEasy to charge, put it on top and leave itGood sound clarity - very clear sound, it's not a Bose, but for everyday TV use it's perfectGood battery life, lasts for a very very long time on a single charge (more than 10 hours)Easy to setup, and works with a variety of stereo TV connectorsYou can add more headset by buying them and selecting the right tuning frequency - EASY as a pie (I bought 2 more headsets HDR 120 for my wife and mom)They use radio technology not infrared, so I can pretty sit anywhere in the room (or house, I roam, e.g. getting dinner or a phone call etc) and it's crystal clear.CON's:My Sony headphone lasted me longer (5 years and still running strong), the earphones tend to die in about 2 yearsExpensive! - I paid 63 bucks for it in 2010 and now I see its 100 bucks, kinda funny how the pricing is going up for a model that's almost a decade oldIt's radio tech - if you have heavy radio interference in your area it can sometimes interfere with the sound (happened at my parents house), but usually changing the radio frequency works.

p1359

VI love these headphones. I ordered them to use with my electronic Yamaha piano. In researching headphones, I could never find a review for use with a piano (or even a keyboard). First, I purchased heaphones with a plug-in cord, but that just was not practical. Next I tried a less expensive one that was wireless. It was infared and light weight, but there was a great deal of distortion in the upper keyboard range. Finally I found the Sennheiser brand that advertised clarity. I debated about the size as well as the radio-wave versus infared (fearful that it would go through to the wireless telephones in the house or to the neighbor's house- hasn't been a problem). When the headphones arrived, I wasn't sure that I wanted to keep them just because of the size, but once I put them on and tuned them in...wow. It was wonderful. They are not heavy like they look like they would be. There's no distortion in the upper range, and how simple could it be to just lift them off the charging cradle and flip the little switch (the cradle fits perfectly out of site behind the music rest on the piano and I never have to worry about charging them). The sound is just like I'm in a concert hall. It's wonderful. It's also been great for my husband to use to practice on his banjo. The open sound enables him to play along with an instructional backup cd and still hear himself play. It's great for us both. It'd be nice if they were just a little smaller, but once they're on your head you don't really notice that. Overall, I think they're fantastic.

p1365
sg5
VThe sound quality on these is fantastic & it sounds like I'm in the theater when watching movies. As long as I sit very still, the headphones are fine; but if I turn my head or lean forward, they slip right off my head. I've come to the conclusion that they were designed for a man... or a woman with big hair. I'm an average-sized 55 y/o woman and these are totally too big. But they keep my husband happy since he can now lower the tv volume to a more humane level. I also appreciate being able to leave the room & still being able to hear the tv (holding the headphones securely to my head, of course).Overall, I love the sound quality, the small footprint of the base & the fact that it serves as a charger/storage stand. The sudden, loud hissing sound when the signal is dropped still makes me jump right out of my skin. The volume control dial is just above the tuning dial & this is a bad design flaw. Fortunately I can rewind live tv & catch what I just missed when trying to turn up the volume with the wrong dial. I'm thinking about securing the headphones to my head with a headband or a hat. Maybe Sennheiser could make these in a smaller size or make the width adjustable rather than just the length of the side pieces. Anyway, I've had these for about 6 months and am very pleased... except for the slipping off my head part. For that reason, I'm looking for something more my size with the same great sound. P.S. Come to think of it, I've noticed my husband keeping them on his head with a watch cap - so it's not just me.

VI bought these about six years ago and loved them but have had an ongoing problem--there seems to be a short in the wiring in the right ear, and I had to turn the volume up high in order to get any sound in that ear at all.  Eventually I resorted to sticking a folded piece of paper into the volume knob to angle it to one side, and then I could get sound.  Last night that finally stopped working, so I am now looking for a replacement.I tend to use these at night when the children are in bed and I don't want to wake anyone up, or when hubby is playing on his computer and doesn't want to be disturbed by the t.v. sound.Pros: wonderful sound, much better than t.v. speakers; long range (I could go upstairs into my master bathroom or into the kitchen to wash dishes and still hear the t.v. loud and clear); good reception and no interference in my experience; when the rechargeable batteries wore out (after about five years of use) I was able to replace them with regular rechargeables (AA) and they worked with the Sennheiser charger.Cons: problems with the right ear; they are large and tend to fall off when I move around, especially when trying to lie down on the couch at night; the charger/transmitter really looks nice but does take up space on the t.v. standOverall, though, I would say that I got many years of use, and in spite of the wonky right ear problem, really loved them.  I may try a different brand this time around, though, in search of more comfort in terms of wear.

VA fine wireless headset
p1377
sg5
VThis is a very good wireless headset.  I bought it to use with my iMac computer, and it does a very good job, supplying high-fidelity audio, much better than through the speakers.  The wearing comfort is pretty good; I didn't give it five stars partly because the on-the-ear design is a bit less comfortable than an over-the-ear setup.  The battery life is very long and the wireless range is phenomenal.Also, there is one odd foible, applicable with computer audio that may have long silences: if there is silence (no signal) for three minutes, the base station turns off its carrier broadcast, which results in a blast of static in the headphones.  You have to make the computer beep to turn the carrier back on.  This is not a problem for listening to music or the typical video, but it is, say, for a NASA video stream, which may have minutes of silence.  Or just general computer operations with occasional audio.  A definite but minor annoyance.I may buy another one for the TV/hi-fi so my daughter can watch movies without having to throttle the volume too severely.  Luckily, these operate on three different frequencies.  I'm also intrigued by the notion of getting an extra headset (HDR-120) so two people can use them at once from the same base station, to listen to the same thing.Overall, I am very happy with these 'phones.  They are quite superior to the Sony IR wireless 'phones that they replaced.  And it's great to wander around the house without losing whatever I'm listening to from the computer!

VI bought these headphones a few months ago so I could watch tv or play video games while my girlfriend studies in the same room. Which makes me sound like an idiot but I promise you I am very well-read. In any case, these headphones are perfect for the job. I put them on, mute the tv and the crisp sound comes through on the headphones. I wasn't expecting them to have such high quality sound, but they sure blow the tv speakers out of the water. I've never noticed hissing except when I need to adjust the tuner. Also, I can't believe how easy these were to install and set up. All you have to do is plug in the audio jack to your tv, plug in the charging station, charge the headphones/batteries for a little bit (they say overnight) and you're ready to go!They're comfortable enough to wear for a couple of hours, but would be better if they were more like my other Sennheisers, with extra cushioning around the ear rather than just one flat pad. I don't have large or protruding ears, but there is definitely an indentation where my ears meet the padding after I wear these for a while. And my ears turn super red. But they don't give me a headache or feel "uncomfortable," per se.I'm very happy with this purchase, as is my girlfriend. If you have roommates who watch tv all the time and you want some peace and quiet, these would be a great idea. Also for people who can't hear well, they can use these to boost the tv's sound just for them rather than turning the tv up to top volume.

VNeeded to set the TV audio output to FIXED
p1394
sg5
VWe almost sent them back, but now they now work fine.  The issue is the output from our TV was controlled by the TV Volume and Mute.  After researching the web site, I discovered that I could set the audio output to "Fixed".  I give it only 4 stars because I shouldn't have needed to view a video to learn this, it could have been in the included doc...it may also fix the problems of the folks who have hissing issues and distance issues.Explanation:  The earphone controller turns on when it senses the TV sound is ON.  This is a good feature, but if the sound is weak the earphone controller shuts off.  When attached it to an output jack that is controlled by the TV volume, the device sometimes senses the signal and sometimes doesn't.  Cranking up the volume doesn't seem to help...although that is describe as a "fix".  In my Sony TV (and I assume others) the "HOME" menu allows a setting of the audio output to "fixed" .  This provides a consistent signal and the controller doesn't shut off.  Once I set this to "fixed" the control unit turns on immediately when the TV comes on, the distance is much longer and there is no hiss.Bottom line, look for a setting in your TV setup that sets the audio output to "fixed" thus bypassing the TV's volume controls, you may find these headphones much more to you liking.. audio out (RCA jack on back of TV) can be driven through the TV amplifier or provide a  on newere TV's allows

VI love headphones because my husband complains about the volume of the TV all the time. This headset has a pretty good sound quality and it allows for you to tune it until you find the setting that works for you. The volume control is quite good and I like how light weight it is and that is not squeezing your ears. Also, great battery life. I can use it from 9 in the morning till 1 o'clock am and no problem. the battery is holding strong and there's no decrease in sound qualityWhat I don't like is the fact that is too big for my head. I have a pretty average head size and I know that because I've had many headphones in the past and never had this problem. It constantly slides off and I have to readjust it all the time. If I bend over to pick up the remote I have to hold it in place or it will fall for sure. I cannot turn my head sideways comfortably because it will slide off as well. Also, when the TV goes mute for 3 min while I look for a new show, it goes into static mode and it annoys the heck out of my ears. And me! Not cool. No other headphone I ever owned did this so is quite irritating.Delivery was almost on time and I like the fact that it was cheaper than at the store and easy to install.If You have a big head and have trouble finding a headphone that wont give you a headache, THIS is the one for you. My husband head is huge and it fits him quite comfortably. If your head is small or even average size, avoid getting this headset 'cause you won't like it.

VMy daughter and I are on a regular dayshift schedule while our roommate works a graveyard shift.  The roommate's bedroom also happens to be immediately adjacent to the family room where the entertainment center is, complete with a television and video game system.  The sound of either one penetrates the hollow interior doors constantly waking our friend throughout the day.But not any more...When the headphones arrived, I immediately put the supplied batteries into the headphones and plugged the unit into an outlet to start charging.  This is accomplished by setting the headphones onto the base.  No need for "snapping" anything in or trying to align charging points.  SO easy!  Connecting the transmitter base to the TV involved 2 colored plugs.  So easy a caveman could do it?Yesterday, the rugrat spent a good chunk of the day watching movies and utilizing the headphones, even walking across the house to her bedroom with the headphones.  No hissing and no loss of signal.  When our friend awoke, she hadn't been bothered one bit and finally got restful sleep.  She's VERY appreciative of the purchase as are we.  No more are we straining to hear the television as it's turned way down so the roommate isn't disturbed.  Note: The volume on our TV can be muted or have the volume turned up and the headphones function regardless - no issues at all.)The only thing left to do is buy another set of headphones so my daughter and I can listen at the same time.

VI bought this set after doing a little research. Decent price for high end headphones. Amazon was the cheapest anywhere for new ones, and free shipping. I got these for my Father, who is hard of hearing, and misses most plots of tv movies because he just can't hear everything. He has a particular problem with background noise.To my great satisfaction, he loves these headphones. He doesn't complain about comfort, and says they're the best thing that's happened to him in a long time. He can finally hear the movies again! His gal likes them too, since she doesn't have to hear his TV at full blast any more.She can play the tv at whatever volume she wants, or muted, while he plays the headphones at whatever level he wants. I tried walking thru my entire house with them, and they were clear as a bell everywhere in the house. They run off AAA rechargeables, so battery replacement is no concern, and they seem to not run the batterys down fast. Just the same, I went ahead and bought him some Duracell rechargeables and charger for them, so he has spares just in case they die in the middle of a movie or something. I was really impressed with how well they work.I read reviews from others that grumbled about some small details like volume knob placement and all, but I don't see anything about these that isn't very liveable. Once they're on your head and set, you don't have to mess with anything else anyway. In short, I highly recommend these!

VTuning these headphones can be compared to sending out a radio signal into outer space and expecting some sort of intelligent alien civilization to contact you back, and then be promptly disappointed as to the incessant hissing, mediocre sound quality, and the fact that it interferes with your once-amazing cell phone reception.If your computer doesn't play some kind of sound for maybe 5 or 10 minutes while these headphones are turned on, it will lose its connection and you have to turn it off and on again, re-tune it and then maybe-- just maybe-- you can watch that 7-second clip of a cat jumping from couch to couch. Once you establish a connection, make sure to replicate the precision of a Navy Seal veteran because if you're not careful, instead of changing the volume, you'll tune the thing out. A simple convenient fix would have been to just put the tuner on one side and the volume on another. Maybe even just change the texture of one of the knobs if keeping them separate is too blasphemous.I have to be missing something here. I'm not technologically inept. I've had these headphones for about a week, and it's a struggle. Maybe I'm ignorant, or maybe I'm in denial by admitting I'm ignorant, but why couldn't these headphones have just been USB connectable? Is it expensive to produce? Am I wrong or does a contact-charging wireless radio-transmitting headphone booth sound like more of an expense, more of a hassle?

VIt took me awhile to decide to get a wireless headset for TV and DVD viewing. I have had cheap ones before, and the experience was not a good one.  However, my wife likes to come up to the bedroom to read and I had to turn off the TV :(.  The Sennheiser Wireless RS120 RF wireless headphone system is the answer.  I can Mute the surround sound and still get full TV/DVD volume on my Sennheiser headset.  I can watch and she can read. What a concept.The sound quality is phenomenal.  I can even get great reception downstairs with the TV upstairs.  So if I go down for a snack or drink to bring up, I know exactly what is going on during my absence and can rewind if necessary.  I also love the convenience of the recharging stand on the Transmitter Assembly.  I strongly recommend you do NOT SETTLE for the non-rechargeable model (you have to change batteries) or any headset that is NOT RF - don't do the IR - your range and quality are very limited.  The Sennheiser is by far the best sound quality and its light weight is makes long TV viewing a breeze.  It also has 3 RF transmitter frequencies to overcome any interference.  I had no problems right our of the box.  Be sure to use the tuning wheel on the headset for the best stereo sound reception from your TV/DVD sound system.  Strongly recommend this unit.  I would not buy anything else.Happy Sennheiser user in Clarkston, MI (4 inches of snow and 15 F right now...)

VGood But Not Perfect
p1446
sg5
VWe have used many different FM and Infrared wireless earphone sets for watching TV for 20 years or so. The Sennheiser is near the top of the list but for us old folks they could still be improved. Our biggest complaint is lack of a comfortable fit. Check out Sony's design of surrounding the earphone with a pillowy cushion that feels good when put on and still feels comfortable three or four hours later. Second  complaint with the Sennheiser has to do with the tuning and volume controls. When your finger tips start losing their sensitivity, it gets difficult to find the small controls in the dark. When I want to change the volume, I always end up turning the tuning control. Then I have to fumble around getting it tuned again and then change the volume while I lose track of what happened on the screen. Once adjusted the sound quality is good even for our poor hearing. We gave up on our old Sonys because they had a special NiMH rechargeable battery that is no longer available. Planned obsolesence I  guess! Our new Sennheisers use standard NiMH rechargeable AAA batteries and so far they have held their charge for longer than we can listen at one time. I also like their recharging unit which depends on metal to  metal contact unlike the Sonys. We'll keep using and enjoying our new units even though they aren't the most comfortable but never losing hope that the perfect  wireless earphones are out there somewhere.

VI purchased these wireless headphones for my spouse to replace an aging Sony wireless unit. The RS-120 meets and exceeds all her expectations. Sound is clear and has a nice balance of amplification in all the decibel ranges. The base charger is a strong feature as well. The headphones slip onto the base with virtually no effort. Also, the usage time alloted for a full charge is amazing. She can literally listen to her evening TV programs for several days without recharging. Controls are well placed and easy to navigate. These headphones are comfortable, according to her. They are a bit loose, but she prefers it that way, as the light fit avoids creating headaches. I found no noticable sound distortation when the headphones are in operation within about 50 feet of the TV, even when having to penetrate room walls. No background hiss is evident. I have purchased two additional headsets since the original order...one for our beach home for permanent installtion and use and another to have available when traveling. That should speak with authortity as to my complete satisfaction with the RS-120. One cannot beat the value at $75 per unit, free of taxes and free shipping included. This is an excellent product for those who do not require the advanced features of other more expensive Sennheiser wireless headphones. Hope this review helps when making your purchasing decision.

VSix out of five stars for these headphones
p1464
sg5
VEvery now and again you find a product that makes you wonder how you lived without it. This is definitely one of those. I live in a condo with walls made of cardboard. I can hear my neighbor sneezing downstairs! I enjoy watching/listening to rock concerts on DVD but I've always had to keep the sound and bass down.... especially on a summer night when I like to keep the doors and windows open. I don't have to worry about that anymore. Now, I am by no means an audiophile. I would probably be happy listening to music in a tin can so I am not touting this as the finest apparatus if you are used to listening to music on a $10,000 state of the art stereo system. This is for listening to sounds you would normally hear on a TV without bothering the neighbors. But I can hear instruments and voices on the headphones more clearly than I have been able to with the volume on the TV turned down. I guess I am getting to be a little hard of hearing and often watch TV shows with subtitles so I can catch every word. With the earphones I'm also able to hear the soundtrack on TV shows more clearly than without them and I don't need the subtitles as much. I wander all over the house, upstairs and downstairs with no problems. Oh, and they are incredibly comfortable... I don't even know I am wearing them which is highly unusual for me. I give these headphones six stars!

VI bought these for my wife so she could watch TV while I'm trying to sleep, and they seem to work just fine.The set-up was very simple with my Sony flatscreen TV and VZIO soundbar. I have it all set up so the TV sound is muted and the volume is controlled by the soundbar. When the headphones were plugged into the TV it all just worked. Turn off the soundbar - headphones working and TV muted.The phones themselves just required a set of AAA batteries (supplied) be installed and the base station be plugged into a power supply and the TV headphone output terminal.The RCA plugs were a bit of a surprise, but the phones came with a mini-jack converter. I guess that the standard is RCA plugs for headphones in Germany, or maybe they envisaged them being used on the AUX OUT terminals of a receiver. I dunno.Eventually I'll have to replace the plug-type adaptor with a cable-style one as the fat plug needed to accommodate two RCA plugs blocks off the last remaining HDMI input for my TV, but that won't be a problem.The phones worked out of the box but my wife managed to knock them out of tune by fiddling with the controls at random instead of looking for an on/off switch. I showed her how to tune them back in. Once I'd explained it was like tuning an old transistor radio she got the knack.

VComparison - 260 vrs. 130
p1482
sg5
VHaving earlier purchased the Sennheiser RS 130 wireless headset, I wanted to purchase a wireless unit for our exercise room.  Since we only use our treadmill a few times a week, I thought that rather than spend the extra money on the RS 130, I would downgrade to the RS 120.  After having used the new headset a few times now, here is my assessment.The RS 120 works well when playing back from a Sony TV (use the monitor output rather than the standard audio output since that gave me more static and needed the TV volume to be up).  I think, however, that the RS 130 has some different circuitry and has less static, but the RS 120 was certainly acceptable.  The 130 feel more secure on your head, and has ear pieces that surround your ears rather than just cover the ear as the 120 does.  As other reviews mentioned, the 120 is much looser on your head and doesn't feel as substantial as the 130, but it doesn't slide off me even when moving on the exercise equipment.  Charging seems about the same, but I haven't had to recharge yet.The conclusion - I would rather have the RS 130, but for the $40+ difference in price, you should certainly consider the RS 120, especially if you are not using it for prolonged periods or strenuous movement.  If that is an issue, spring for the additional dollars.

VDick Morrison's review of Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones
p1488
sg5
VI love them.  What I like best is the engioneering genius that whet into the design.  There are no batteries to replace. Since it recharges while sitting in it's storage cradle, there are no plugs to plug in.  When you are finished using them, you simply replace them in their storage cradle, and the storage cradle doubles as the transmission antenna.  The sound is good, although I don't demand or are able to detect perfect sound. I'm happy with the sound quality.  The earpieces are a bit hard, made of firm foam rubber, and become uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them. Sometimes I will use them for 8 to 10 hours straight without the two AAA size rechargable batteries become weak.  After that I put them on their cradle and go to bed.  You don't have to worry about over charging them, so you can just leave them on the recharging cradle until you are ready to use them again.  Because of the brilliant design I have no idea how long one can go without recharging them.While they advertise around 250 feet transmission distance, I start picking up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter. The tacktic of changing between the three transmission frequiences doesn't make any difference on that, all three frequencies pick up static when more than 100 feet from the transmitter.

VReally great headphones with an obvious limitation
p1494
sg5
VFor the price they're awesome. They're loud and pretty clear and can go, apparently, very far. I wouldn't know because we live in a condo and I never bothered wearing them while walking to the laundry room. They're reasonably comfortable. Your ears won't over heat BUT keep them on for more than a couple of ours and the tension of the headphones on your ears will make your cartilage begin to feel sore. They sit on TOP of your ears, they do not cup them. Base is on all of the time which is great. Easy convenience. I've tried them in 2 different condos and both times they behaved them same. Now, I WILL NOT give them a lower score because of the "hiss" and "pops" you hear with these things. It's the nature of the beast. They use FM Modulation. I'm surprised they actually sound as good as they do using this technology. So going into it I knew I would have some trouble with them but it actually wasn't bad at all. Not noticeable UNLESS you're sitting in a very quite part of a movie or show OR if your head is in a certain position that they don't like. It can get quite annoying and almost not tolerable. But again, if this bothers you move up to the next model that uses 2.4Ghz Kleer Technology. If you need something cheap that can go a long distance these are your best bet.

VProof that long-term quality still exists
p1500
sg5
VMy husband got these for me when I was pregnant with our youngest kiddo so I would be able to watch/listen to TV or music as I nursed repeatedly in the middle of the night for those first brutal months. Over six years later, that kid prefers mac n cheese and long, sleepless nights are distant in my memory - but the headphones still work like new.They are the one piece of "baby" equipment that still gets used. As a night owl, I can be up half the night watching whatever and not keep the rest of the house awake. Sound quality is rich and I have yet to blow it out - I wish my car's speakers were as good. They are also great for gaming, allowing for one of our kids to play while another tries to get homework done. Even on my son's kid-sized noggin, the headphones usually stay put as he jumps around. (That surprised me, because they are a bit on the heavy side, but not unusually so for wireless.)Installation was easy and straight-forward. I invested in some inexpensive splitters so I could plug them in to more than one source, with only slight degradation. (The small amount of occasional wireless hiss makes more difference than the split.)With most electronics having a life span of a couple of years anymore, I am fairly over the moon about these.

p1505
sg5
VI've only had these a few days so cannot judge how they hold up in the long run but I can tell you I think they are wonderful! I spent considerable time in a session reviewing wireless headphones. I trust Amazon reviews at least ninety seven percent, I know that there are people who are overly critical about almost everything, those that are brand loyal and aim to please and those that fall between the two. I do not ignore that three percent. I believe there is pertinent information there. Back to the Senheiser Headphones,....Even though they were cheaper than some other good brands and ! had never heard of them I decided to take a chance. Sooo glad I did! I have the Bose Solo system and worried they would not be compatible.... not to worry, My Bose does not even have to be on in order to use these or it can be on with the volume turned down for people with normal hearing. unbelievable stereo effect from these! with a channel tuner instead of a switch on the headphones and a switch on the cradle. they use AAA NiMh rechargeable batteries that are charged just by being placed on the cradle! No plugging in! Thank you Amazon reviewers that steered me towards these. I am completely happy and Thank you Amazon for delivering them on time and safely and expertly packaged.

VLow quality. Unit was dead on arrival. Completely dead! Couldnt even get a power light. After testing, i determined the power adapter is defective. How absolutely lazy and cheap do you have to be to not test the power adapter before packaging.Gave this as a birthday present. Happy Birthday. Now all you have to do is print a return label, repackage everything, drop off the bad unit and wait another week. Enjoy!!!!Besides the abysmal quality control, the unit feels C-H-E-A-P... The foam ear piece coverings look like they will rot and deteriorate quickly and whats up with the tuning knob? Did you know you have to TUNE the headphones to the transmitter like you did with AM radios in the 30s?News flash. Welcome to the 21st century. I expect these units to automatically digitally lock on to the correct frequency just like my cheap $10 bluetooth headphones.And if that wasnt enough. Turn the headphones on with the base station off and instead of getting complete and total silence (because there is no signal), you get your ears blown out with white noise.If you long for the "good ole days" of Jack Benny, short wave radio, swing time music, and ears throbbing from loud white noise, this unit is for you!!!

p1517

VSo far, so good.  I bought these for my Mom so she could hear the TV without deafening everyone else in the room.  It replaced a broken similar Rocketfish set of earphones.  The documentation for these headphones was awful.  I called customer service for help and they were great.  The earphones come with a red and black cable to plug in.  Problem 1:  although the documentatiion doesnt say so, the black plug goes into the white  hole.  Problem 2:  the documentation said to plug them into the TV, the tech said to plug them into the cable box.  With that done, the device works fine.  It is much easier to recharge these headphones than the rocketfish ones.  You just hang them on the charger.  You don't have to jiggle them around.  Also the rocketfish had slide type switchs that were difficult to operate for my Mom.  They had very little feedback and were kind of hard to push.  On these headphones, the on/off swith is very firm and obvious.  The one problem with these headphones (the Sennheiser) is that the tuning switch is a  thumb wheel that is placed so that it can be easily moved when you grasp the headphones to put them on so you need to retune all the time which is hard for my Mom. I can't say anything about reliability yet as we have only had these for a week.

VExceeded My Expectations
p1523
sg5
VI have had these headphones for slightly longer than a month.  I wanted them because my family can get pretty loud sometimes and it became irritating to not be able to hear what was being said in television shows and movies.  This was the perfect solution.  They can plug directly into the DVR/Cable Box and also into our Sony Playstation 3 for watching films on Blu-ray.  The Playstation required an inexpensive adapter to achieve connection, but it works very well.  You can listen to TV at a louder volume than the rest of the family or you can turn down the sound levels on your surround sound system to completely inaudible levels or even mute and it does not effect the head phones, as their volume level is independent of the rest of the system.  I have found the sound quality to be so impressive that I often use the headphones when no one else is around simply because the sound is superior to the surround sound system.  The controls are easy to use and the charging cradle is very convenient.  I take them off the charger in the morning and replace it before going to bed.  I have even skipped a day and the batteries have never failed.  It is not often that I have been so pleased with a product that I would take the time to offer a review.  Truely exceptional.

p1529

VLike most buyers, I was most concerned about the sound of these, since I'm using them at work where the building is blanketed with wireless signals of all frequencies. I'm happy to report that these are the best sounding earphones I've ever bought.But the first thing I noticed when I took these out of the box was the construction isn't what I'd expect from top of the line earphones. It's nice that they are light, but the telescoping size adjuster thingies on the sides are not completely tight so they can jiggle. They also just look cheep and plastic-y. The base station could could be a couple ounces heavier too.Also, when there's no signal from the computer and the headphones are still on my head I get terrible noises like aliens trying to communicate with me. It doesn't happen right away so it's as if the base station is doing the right thing and outputting silence for a little while, then falling asleep to save power. Either way, it's a bad experience for people like me who listen to an album or a TV show and then let it go to silence for a while.I'm happy with my purchase because the sound is good, but I shouldn't have to think about the differences between wireless and wired except for fewer spilled drinks.

VToo heavy, too tight, and other design flaws
p1535
sg5
VThis model displayed on almost every page when I was looking for wireless headphones for TV. It got good ratings and the price seemed reasonable so I ordered it. Unfortunately, I do not like it and have sent it back. I was baffled as to why it rated so highly and why it was shown with such prevalence on the Amazon website. My guess is that there must be a higher profit margin for Amazon on this product. Ok, here are my issues.1. These are not "light weight" headphones although that is part of the description. They are actually quite heavy.2. They do not "cup" the ears well. Even in the picture it showes the part which goes over the ears is flat and there is minimal cushion.3. There is a "tuning" dial right next to the volume dial. If you reach up to change the volume and you move the tuning dial by mistake, it takes a while to get it back in tune again. There is no way to lock the tuning. This was been a problem for me, but I'm sure that over time one would get accustom to it.4. Too tight. The headphones fit very tightly on my head and there is no way to reduce the pressure. In addition to being uncomfortable, this also  prevents the wearer from hearing anything else, for example the doorbell.

p1541

VI really liked almost everything about this unit. The sound is terrific. I needed this because of a hearing loss and my wife was tired of the high volume I needed to hear the TV, and sometimes I watch when she is in bed.  I was able to hear things I had clearly been missing before. Top quality sound. The recharging is so easy, just put it on the cradle and it recharges the nimh batteries, no memory, AA, very good and replaceable.  And great range. Worked all over the house and even into my yard.  I really liked almost everything about it--except it wouldn't stay on my head. If I got up it fell off. If I changed my position on my chair it fell off.  After the umteenth time I tried to save it from going on the floor and split my lip in the process.  If only it would stay on.  I want to get a better one from this manufacturer because of all the good things about it. Maybe a different model has a better ear piece, maybe that fits around the ear instead of a flat piece of foam that fits on the ear and slides off all too easily.  Hard to return, but it has to be useful, and this just wasn't. I would quit using it because of this.  Sorry, I hope the model up is better because I want it for all the great qualities, except for the ear piece.

VThis is the second pair I have in my home. Easy to set up and to use. The sound in great and my wife can use the regular TV sound as she wants without interference. If you need to leave the TV to go to another room just keep the head phones on as you will not lose the sound although this may not work in a larger home. The second pair is used in the back bedroom and does not get inerference from the other one in he living room  although you may need to selecct a separate channel (there are 3 to select from).The sound volume is very easy to use but the tone selector may cause problems until you get used to using it. The headphone is easily adjustable to fit your head and are comfortable but do feel a little heavy. When you are done using them be sure to turn the headphone off and fully extend the headphone adjustment before placing them on the charging cradle otherwise you will not get a good contact and the charging lite does not come on. I have had no issues with either set but I did want to ask a question from their techical service through their emai line and got a fast respone. I  highly recommend this wireless headphone anad the cost is reasonable but do shop around for the lowest costs as there is variation among the vendors.

VI was surprised how easy the Sennheiser RS120 headphones were to set up. Simply plugged the cable from the charging cradle into the RCA jacks on the back of the TV and then plugged in the adapter to an electrical outlet. The headsets worked. I had to fine tune the frequency dial and adjust the volume and I was ready to listen. The clarity on the headphones is really good. I can hear things in programs and parts of commercials that I have never heard before without the headphones. The stereo is really good and I can hear soft stereo sounds I have never heard before from the TV. The range for the Sennheiser RS120 headset is outstanding. I can wear the headphones anywhere in the house and even outside as far as 300 feet away from the TV and still not miss any of the audio on a program or a movie. One problem while watching TV was that we could get the sound from the TV loud enough but could still not hear the dialogue over the background music and sounds. Last night my wife used the headsets to listen to the audio on a movie we were watching.  With the headphones on she could hear everything. The dialogue seemed to stand out from the background. I ordered her a Sennheiser headphone to go with mine last night. Great product.

VAfter researching all brands of wireless headphones I decided on the Sennheiser RS-120's. What a great investment for $69.95 plus shipping! I also ordered the extra pair, an "Additional Headphone for RS120 Wireless Headphone System" at; $39.03 plus shipping. I ordered both through Amazon.com.The clarity is great in every room! I bought this pair for my dad who is in his 80's and with hearing loss. With the volume of the television turned down to a tolerable level I'll be able to visit and watch the Boston Red Sox, movies and other broadcasts this year without the headache of volume hangover the next morning!!! I tried them on myself while setting them up (which was very easy), and found them to be comfortable and very nice sounding. The Sennheiser RS120 has a nice rich stereo sound and I found no problem with walking around his home with them on. They stay on nicely w/out being too tight and w/out the pressure on the ears or head. The light on the transmitter is a good reminder to shut them off after use, and the charger light shows that the batteries are charging. If you're serious about finding a great wireless headphone set then I promise that your search is over!!!Thank-you Sennheiser~

p1564

VThe  headphones are just plain excellent. I have nothing to add to other reviews.I am writing this hoping to help someone that has a tv like mine that has only a single audio output (no headphone jack either).Because I am a night owl I need headphones so I had to buy a  DAC digital to analog converter to get the headphones to work (just search Amazon for this item).My headphones come with two RCA plugs., A black and a red for left and right stereo sound. Nothing new about that.What is different is that one will need a digital audio cable with two male plugs (yes, Amazon has them, too).One end will plug into the digital out on the tv and the other to the digital connector on the converter.Then it is just a matter of plugging the heaphones into the converter and following the advise of all the other folks in the myriad of reviews to set it up. It has a decent little setup manual also.I had been using the DAC converter for about a year using the mini jack for wired headphones and it has become unreliable. I would advise using the RCA plugs for a snugger and more reliable fit.Hope this was helpful to somebody and good luck to you all. - giggy

VFrom a technical standpoint these headphones seem fine.  The sound quality is good, the build quality is solid, packaging was very thoughtful. The issue that I have is that the earpads are flat and feel hard when pressed against my ears.  Since I wear glasses, after a couple of hours of wearing the headphones and the glasses on the pressure of earpads against my glasses makes my head hurt to the point that I need to take the headphones off.  My wife said the same thing.  Even if you do not wear the glasses, the earpads still feel flat, hard and you can sense the pressure on your ears, something that I did not experience with my prior set from another brand.  I will be returning this set and pay more attention to the shape of the earpads on the replacement set.An update. After more research I decided to go with Sony MDR-IF245RK which is very similar to what we used to have. What I like about this Sony model is that they are very light and I did not have the problem of the ear cups pushing against my ears and my glasses. Since we will be using it for the bedroom TV watching only, it does not bother me that the cradle needs to be in the direct view.

VAfter visiting with my dad for two days and yelling over the tv, I decided to look for headphones. My dad has had the tv so freaking loud for at least 4 yrs. This past visit almost put me over the edge. I researched/Google cordless headphones and decided on these. FANTASTIC choice!!! It is so quiet watching any program now. NO fights, yelling, screaming, headaches, words under my breath, etc...Its actually a very pleasant experience watching tv with my dad anymore.  He is soooo happy AND so is everyone in the house and on the block! It took literally 2 minutes or less for me to hook them up and get them working perfectly. It took longer to open the box. My dad walks around like king chit from room to room not missing a word. You can adjust the volume on the headset to your preference.  The tv itself can be on low, high, or mute and he can still hear it according to his headset volume. My mom wishes someone/anyone would have purchased these yrs ago. It would have saved a lot of headaches and nights of fustration! He is taking them to my house when he comes down to visit. They are THAT easy to install. This is in the top 5 products I have purchased on amazon.  UPDATE as of 11/30/15...The product is STILL fantastic!  My problem is the price dropped $10 in less than a month which does not make me happy!!

VSennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones
p1582
sg5
VYears of rock bands and machine gunning leave me damned near deaf. For the past 3-4 years I turned to TV Ears (3 different sets at $100+) so I can understand what's being said in British movies. TV Ears are among the most poorly engineered products I've encountered. They are overpriced, uber uncomfortable  with ear pads that keep falling off,  and not easily replaced;  have a battery life between recharges measured in hours, and are line-of-sight so don't go to the bathroom during a movie.When the last pair's expensive to replace proprietary battery died, I went shopping for something else. Someone suggested Sennheiser. There are a zillion models; I went with medium cheap (about $79). It's only been a month, and so far I love them. The stereo sound is crisp. I can run after the dog outside and never lose the signal. They're comfortable; and the batteries are great. I will,  five out of seven nights, fall asleep wearing them.  When I wake up they're still working, and I'm still using the same AA rechargeable batteries that came with it.  I've dropped them on the (wood) floor a few times; nothing broke. What else it there?  I endorse them for President.

p1588

VI got these headphones on sale and I am very pleased with them. They have weird problems though. The fit is lousy. They fall off if you lean forward even a little. I use a stretchy headband to keep mine on. The volume dial and the tune dial are on the same side and it is really easy to use the wrong dial when adjusting the volume. The headphones lose the signal but it isn't very difficult to get it back. It's just annoying. I tried using regular alkaline batteries and they work great. I wear my headphones for seven or eight hours at a time. The alkalines lasted three days before I decided to switch back to rechargeables. I prefer to use rechargeable batteries, but I take them out of the headphones and charge them separately. The headphones don't fit on the charging stand all that well and the charging indicator light always stays on. Better to be safe than sorry! The range on these things is fabulous. The sound quality is excellent. The headphones come with lousy written instructions. You need an internet connection so you can go online and see how to set everything up. I love these headphones though and plan to buy another set in the near future.

p1599
sg5
VWhen these headphones work, they're alright but not great. Sound quality is middling at best, but there is little to no bass and they tend to be quiet. Unfortunately, the convenience of wireless headphones is counterbalanced by the serious problems with the product. If you live in any area with other people and other wireless signals, you will experience a large amount of interference, and that interference is LOUD. More than once I've been left with headphones on the other side of the room and two ringing ears. Also, when no signal is sent to the headphones for around 60 seconds, the headphones will automatically turn off. Instead of silence, however, the headphones will play the LOUDEST static I've ever heard. I can hear from across the house when I've forgotten to turn the headset off.If you can constantly put a sound source into the headphones and avoid the extremely sensitive interference, they're good for the price. Unfortunately, having to deal with an incredibly loud burst of static every 30 seconds due to either interference or the automatic shutoff of the base cancel any kind of long time enjoyment to be found.

p1604

VAfter the sixth pair of headphones died from a broken cord I figured I would go with a wireless solution. So far, these have been wonderful (about a month) great battery life and good quality sound.Pros: I can walk away from my PC and do stuff while listening to a podcast.  No Cord to break or bind.  Decently priced for quality delivered.Cons: Easily slip off if bending over just slightly (and I have a giant head)  Sound is better, with less interference, 20 feet away as opposed to 1-3 feet away.  Volume and Tuning are right in line with each other and easily hit (Tuning should be on the side with the power switch IMO)TICU (Things I can't understand): WHY when there is no sound for X minutes does the base turn off? This is aggravating and completely backwards to what it should  do.  The effect of having a video or sound clip end, and as you sit there listening to nothing SUDDEN STATIC BLASTING YOUR EARS. As far as I can tell this would actually decrease the battery life of the headphones as static uses more power than silence. The headphones should have a timer NOT the base.

VI own a set of RS180s - of course, they have less issues, but look at the cost. I use these primarily in my office at a short distance. Unlike the RS180, this set will not go through walls well or cover a great distance without having dropout and distortion issues. And every issue I had with the RS180 AGC is intensified here (oh well, I expected it).But... on a positive note, the controls are simple (unlike RS180) and I think I got what I paid for. It does a good job short range - say, 10-15'. If you try to go through walls, you will hear a kind a "swish" as it loses the base signal. Without a wall in between the line of sight, you might manage 30' or so.This would be a great set for short distance without walls, and the sound quality is good, comfort good, operation simple. I recommend it highly to my brother-in-law who watches TV in his bedroom after his wife has gone to bed.A note: when you connect them to a power source, the ON/OFF LED won't illuminate until you feed it an audio signal. Shame the brief manual included does not mention that. The documentation is actually quite poor and lacking in details.

VSaved My Marriage
p1616

VYou won't mistake these for audiophile headphones, but they just may have saved my marriage. My wife has bouts of insomnia and will watch TV in the middle of the night. I can't sleep when the TV is on. We tried a pair of TV Ears, and they felt very uncomfortable. Additionally the TV ears operate by an IR beam which is line of sight. If you turn away from the TV the beam is broken and the sound cuts out. The Sennheisers operate on RF and you can still hear even if you go to another room. The range seems to be about 30-40 feet. The rechargeable batteries provide about 8 hours of operation. To charge simply place the headphones on the cradle, but you have to make sure they are facing the right direction and making contact (the charging light will go on). We bought extra rechargeable batteries (It uses AAA size) and a charger so we always have a set ready to go, even if we forget to place the headphones on the cradle. The sound quality is very good, but not audiophile quality. It's perfectly adequate for watching TV and occasional music, but if you're serious about music you may be disappointed with these.

VI waited for over 2 weeks to post this review. I wanted to give ample time to adequately test the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones. I had concerns before ordering this product. Setup was very easy. Concern #1: I expected to receive cheap foam pads. I was grateful for the fabric covering that hopefully will last for a few years. Concern #2: I have a smaller head, and when I sit still, it's OK. I can wear my Kangol and the headset fits much better. Concern #3: Hiss. I make sure the headset is fully charged. The hiss is either hardly noticeable, or nonexistent. Concern #4: Tuning and volume dials. After I tuned them into my widescreen, I used a small piece of duct tape to cover the tune button. That way I don't accidentally disturb the tuning. Concern #5: Range.  Range is good. I can go 30 feet away through walls, and still receive. The frequency response is very good. Bass is good. Highs are good. I have watched a variety of shows and movies, and enjoy hearing the enhanced listening experience. Overall, I am very pleased with this product. They are definitely worth the price. Enjoy! 5 stars!

p1628
sg5
VI have tried several different pair, and compared to them, this one has earned 5 star quality. In the first place I am nearly deaf. I have to have good ones to keep from disturbing other tenants. I use to own 2 pair of Sony which were great as long as they lasted, about three years.  These are comparable to them. I can watch TV in my living room or bedroom with one pair. In the bathroom too.As I said I've tried several different pair and these are tops. They deserve the 5 star rating. They are not unreasonably priced. Try over $200 for the under the chin where it hurt my ears to plug them in. No thank you. These are comfortable, have great sound and I can go from room to room just as they said I could. As a person that is quite nearly deaf, they are a life saver. I hope everyone tries them. They are great for the price and I have no complaints at all. I bought these from Amazon and the delivery was fast and good. They are as advertised.I give them a 5 star rating because they deserve it, and I should know since I've tried several different brands and these were tops. Thanks...

VI'll make this review quick and easy.  I've been wanting a wireless headphone for a long time. It's definitely line of sight.  But that's ok with me.  I watch TV in bed and the tv is on the other side of the room.  The reception is clear.  The headphone isn't too bulky.  It's rechargeable.  I think I've used it 2 or 3 nights in a row (1 hour each night) and it's kept it's charge.  There are only 2 things that I would say negative about the product.1) the headphone doesn't quite fit on the charger perfectly.  You have to set it just right in order for it to recharge.  I just put a weight (I use our remote) on it and it gives it enough pressure so it's pressing down on the charger2) if you have the tv on pause (dvr) for 30 seconds and come back, the wireless headphones drops it's signal.  I have to rewind the dvr for about a minute and let it play for a while before the green signal light comes.  The green signal indicates that it's transmitting the audio.  When it goes out, the headphone doesn't work.  It doesn't happen often but the 1-2 minute wait is a little annoying.

VI bought this set for my 73 year old mother as a Christmas gift, and let me say that she just loves them to death.  Her hearing was so bad that she would blast the tv at physically painful levels, and she still couldn't make out what was being said.  Now she can hear everything clearly, even dialogues where the people are whispering, and the headset volume only needs to be at a normal level.  She finds them very comfortable...she even fell asleep in them the first time she wore them.  When she woke up, she kept the headset on, and I didn't notice any ear rubbing or redness when she took them off to go to bed.  When I woke up the next morning, she was already wearing them to watch the news.I also tested the headset before giving them to her, keeping in mind the complaints from other reviewers, and this is what I found:These phones may not be a good choice for hardcore audiophiles, but for your average, run-of-the-mill consumer this is an excellent headset for the price.  The sound quality is good with television viewing, and I only noticed hisses/pops when the headset wasn't receiving a signal.  I'm not sure what the issue was with some of the other reviewers' setups, but I can mute the television, or lower the volume to 0 and still maintain a good signal.  (I did need to increase the headset volume a little when I went to 0 on the tv, but muted doesn't affect the signal at all.)Neither of us have put the 150 foot range to the test, but my mom claims that she can still hear the tv from the back of her 60 foot trailer (the charger's in the front), and when she goes outside to get the paper.  The power cord for the charger is more than long enough for my purposes, and the headset settles into its cradle almost by itself with the earmuffs contracted.  If you keep the muffs extended, you will need to do a jiggle here or there to set it in place.  The phones are very comfortable with a lot of cushioning and a loose grip.  This may not be good for people with small heads or who will be active while wearing them, but for me, I tend to get headaches with high-tension muffs, so I like them.

It's almost as if you are in the same room as the characters on the program you are watching.  Also, (and more to the point), I am enjoying my solitude once again.  No door/cabinet/drawer slamming or dog barking.It is of course, not a perfect solution to the noise problem.  Ideally, the neighbor's silence would be best.  But alas, as that's not likely to happen any time soon, this is a superb resolution and a Godsend!For anyone else in this same predicament, I also recommendFlents Quiet Time Soft Comfort Ear Plugs  50 PairandHoward Leight 1030110 Sync Noise-Blocking Stereo Earmuff.

VGood Sound & Comfortable
p1664
sg5
VThe Sennheiser RS120 headphones are great.  I'm a bit hard of hearing, so I turn the TV up too loud.  The volume level bothers my wife, who has good hearing.  Now she can listen to the TV (through the stereo speakers) at a comfortable volume, while I adjust the volume through the headphones for my listening needs.Because the sound from the headphones is so clear, plus they cut out much of the ambient noise, I can now listen to the TV at a much lower volume and still understand every word.The only problem with the headphones is when the input volume to its transmitter is low, the base unit will shut down and very loud static comes through the headphones.  This will jolt you right out of your chair.  I read about this problem in other reviews.How I solved the problem was to buy a headphone amplifier and place it between the 'Line Out' of my stereo, and the headphone transmitter.  My wife can now lower the output volume from the stereo so low that you can hardly hear it, and the headphone transmitter never shuts down.Life is now good.

VJust What I Wanted
p1669
sg5
VI've got severe hearing loss and for years I've tried various headsets in order to keep the TV volume from blasting everyone from the room.  Most of these headsets have allowed me to hear the TV audio OK while the TV volume is turned down. However, even with the headset volume turned all the way up, most speech and music was difficult to understand. It took a lot of effort to try to hear what was being said or played.While shopping the web, I came across the Sennheiser RS120 wireless unit and noticed many good reviews about it and, out of frustration, decided to pay the $84 and take a chance. It was worth it. It's like I've regained my hearing: now I can easily and clearly hear any voice or music; crisp, clear, without straining and with plenty of volume to spare. Up until I started using the Sennheiser RS120, I didn't know that "Family Guy" was in stereo.Totally satisfied with this set and I'm gonna buy another set to give to my brother.  I know he too is going to be amazed at the sound quality that he's been missing for years.

VI got these headphones for Christmas just a few days ago.  Thankfully the set up is easy becuase the manual is not at all helpful.  They are surprisingly light considering you have 2 batteries in your right ear.  They sound decent, but I was definately expecting better after seeing some of the reviews and considering the "original" price.My biggest beef with these headphones is that they are totally uncomfortable.  I can't see wearing these for longer than 20 minutes.  They do not form to your ears at all.  The ear cups are completely flat and hard.As with other reviewers I notice a hissing sound in the background even when they are completely tuned.  I also found out that if anyone in the room is using a cell phone (and probably any other wireless device) the interference created is enough to block the usage of the headphones.  You'll know by the horrible loud noise filling your ears.  Not pleasent!Overall, if you are looking for a quality headphone, these are NOT it.  But for the price, they are not bad.

VBest Money You'll Ever Spend on Personal Electronics
p1686
sg5
VPurchased these for my father-in-law after he came to live with us. An honorably-discharged Korean-era USAF veteran and retired factory worker, his hearing has seen better days. For the sake of domestic tranquility, I shopped around for a reasonably-priced, lightweight and easy-to-use pair of wireless headphones for him to use while watching television. Among several candidates, the Sennheiser RS-120's jumped off the page. The price was right, and thousands of positive reviews couldn't be wrong. Without question, for the price, these are simply outstanding. I ditched the no-name AAA rechargeable batteries that came in the box and replaced them with four higher-endurance batts. Rather than replace the phones on the charger stand each night, I keep a fresh pair in a wall outlet charger and swap them out every couple days. The batts are super easy to change (no tools required; just a simple twist-off of one of the ear pads). Bottom line: This is the best money I've ever spent for any electronic product EVER.

VI purchased the Sennheiser RS120 Wireless headphones about two months ago. The main use for these headphones were to not disturb my children while I play video games.Pros:Adequate padding on the ears and scalpBattery compartment is easy to accessDesign is visually pleasingCharges quickly and stays charged for hours*Good signal rangeVolume setting allows for ear bleeding listening or whisper quietCons:Feels cheaply made compared to more expensive models*Battery that comes with it doesn't hold a charge very longSound quality is okay at bestOverall, your getting what you pay for. If you want wireless headphones that have superb sound quality and are more durable you'll need to spend more money. But these are great wireless headphones for casual use.*I replaced the provided battery with an Energizer rechargeable battery. It charges quicker and holds a charge longer. So far, I have had no issues using the Energizer rechargeable battery with the Sennheiser charging cradle.

VEven beyond the wireless, these are good headphones. Not quite in the same class as my AKG K240, but crisp, clean, good bass, and comfortable as well. About the same weight as the AKG, and without the bother of the cord pulling here and there.About that wireless thing. Some tricks there, sure. Since I use them while working on the computer, there is a lot of potential electronic interference very close by. For the most part these things handle it OK if I drive max volume into them and then use the headphone volume knob as my main control. I do occasionally feel the need to fiddle with the tuning knob (couldn't they have made this crystal controlled??). When tuned they are reasonably noiseless. The farther I get from the base station, the more there are soft spots in the reception, I would not probably use them more than one - two rooms from the base station.So, since I am using them for casual, quality, listening, and not studio work, they suit my needs quite well, thus the rating of 4. YMMV.

VPros:- Easy to set up and get working- Good rangeCons:- Slight hiss on quiet sections (apparently this is a thing with wireless headphones though)- Will fall off if you bop around too hard, but otherwise comfortable.Sound Quality:For me this was the most important part and ultimately what led me to return these. The sound was very clear. My dad put them on and remarked on how amazing the bass was. However I seem to have been spoiled by my regular earphones, the dirt cheap  Panasonic RP-HT2 Stereo Headphones. The bass on those is incredibly rich and powerful. The Sennheiser phones in comparison felt sort of weak and less full. I kept finding myself turning the volume up to compensate, but of course it didn\u2019t make the sound any richer, just louder.So if you\u2019re not terribly worried about sound experience they\u2019re perfect. If you\u2019re concerned about sound quality, especially bass, then depending on your tastes they may be not quite right.

VI'll tell you all a secret that I have kept from my family.There is a TV in the living room that only my children use. I used to have to yell at them to turn it down all the time. It was always blaring incredibly annoying cartoons and other awful things my kids for some reason enjoy watching.One weekend when everybody was gone, I removed the back panel of the living room TV, and unplugged the wires that go to the built in speakers.My children came back home, and of course the TV immediately got turned on. Silence. After a few minutes of them messing around with the volume, and mute, they came to the conclusion that the speakers were broken. I pretended to show concern, and gave a good show of trying to "fix" it all the while evilly laughing to myself.I told them I would fix the sound by ordering some headphones. Now my children can watch their horrible shows and turn it up as loud as they want while I sit back, smile, and enjoy the silence.

VIt didn't take for things to go wrong.  The headphones themselves are heavy and hot, but there seems to be a short in the wiring that connects the unit to the television.  It works for a few minutes and then it stops working altogether.  It's not a satisfactory item in the slightest.Purchased for television viewing, when it shorts out, loud snow noise blasts the ears.  You will then have to fiddle with the jack and audio wires at the tv to stop it.Update, same date.  Went out and started reading reviews of other unhappy folks.  I guess our issue is the auto off switch in addition to a short in the audio wires, which cause a loud hum when you touch them.  Tonight was the final straw.  Husband was watching a drama.  Lots of quiet parts.  You know...suspense mixed with drama?  Knowing about this now will not take this item out of the trash bin.Like myself, I suggest you keep looking because this item isn't it if you watch tv with silence to add suspense or drama written into the script.

VI bought these headphones a couple years ago and used them for watching TV just before going to sleep while trying not to bother my wife. Comments: 1) There is a lot of sound that leaks from these headphones...they are 'on ear' so beware of the real difference in sound leakage between on ear or 'over ear' - it is substantial 2) They are not comfortable, don't fit well and if you get up and bend over will literally fall off your head. I tried every adjustment to get them to fit with no luck - was always annoying 3) After two and a bit years they stopped taking a charge. I replaced the batteries but no go. I have just replaced the headphones. So, overall not good marks for the RS 120's from my experience....you get what you pay for and in this case do some homework....upgrade to Sennheiser 165 or above, or, for real value for less money I strongly recommend looking at the Sony MDRRF985RK, which are cheaper, far more comfortable and sound (in my opinion) equally as good as the RS 120's.

VOk..I have to put my two cents in about these headphones.  First of all, I made the mistake of overthinking the installation.  This was so easy it's almost embarrassing how much thought I had put into it. Sheesh!  Anyway, setup was easy-peasy, sound is great and the headphones are very comfortable. I got these for my husband who is hard of hearing (he wears hearing aids) and has trouble hearing the talk over the music in movies. These work wonderful for him and he is one happy camper now.  I set the headphones up to be used with or without the TV volume. The plugs on the stand/charger were black and red (not red and white as they should have been) and these should be plugged into the AUDIO OUT on your TV, or if not available on your TV, plug them into the back of your cable box (in my case, red into red AUDIO OUT, black into white AUDIO OUT). There is a VOLUME and TONE control on one side of the headphones and ON/OFF switch on the other.  This was a very good investment.

VWe bought the headphones because my wife and I live in a one bedroom apartment and it's nice to be able to do two different things without disturbing one another. The headphones have great sound but I don't love that the radio dial is not digital and that it's on the same side of the headset as the volume. Sometimes I want to turn the volume up and I hit the radio dial which changes the station and the noise is not pleasant. They are comfortable to wear but if worn for the length of an entire movie my ears feel really hot like I have ear muff's on in the summer.On the plus side it was very easy to set up once we realized we needed to plug them into the computer and not the surround sound or tv. Daily access is so convenient because you don't have to unplug them from anything in order to use them. They just sit there, charging right on the metal stand, until you are ready to use them. I am  happy with the product overall but I look forward to updated models.

VOverall this is just what I needed, something so that my girlfriend and I could watch TV without bothering the other if they're studying or trying to sleep. Sound is what you'd expect for the price, it's decent but the bass and treble are a little flat. Easy to charge and great battery life so far.A side note: the headphones are literally "over the ear" the whole ear pad is the same depth, so it doesn't "envelop" your ears so much as rest on it, it'd prefer the former, but I've adjusted sufficiently.Two minor things:- I really wish there was a switch to control connectivity to the audio-in. If it's plugged into the TV, the TV will only output to the headphones, i.e. there's a lot of fumbling around the back of the TV when I want to use/stop using the headphones- I wish the fit was a little snugger; when bending over the unit will sometimes slide off my head, and I enjoy cleaning my apartment when listening to music/watching TVOverall, would recommend.

VI purchased two pairs of the Sennheiser RS120 926MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle.  The headphones are used for television viewing so I cannot say how well they work when leaving the living room.  They were purchased for my father and my husband.  My husband often wakes up in the wee hours of the morning and watches television.  The headphones are a blessing because they allow him to view and hear the televison without disrupting the rest of the sleeping household.  My father had trouble hearing the televison clearly and the headphones allow him to adjust the volume to his personal needs without having the T.V. volume too loud for everyone else in the room.  The headphones are adjustable and comfortable.  The sound quality is clear. They were easy to set up and use right out of the box (right after I charged the batteries). The sets came with rechargeable batteries and the charging cradle. It's a wonderful product and I would purchase it again.

VI can concur with the majority of reviews which heavily influenced me in buying these phones. I had previously used wireless RCA and Sony. These R120's are easily the best I've owned and tremendous value, PROVIDING you don't move your head, as they too easily shift and fall off your bonce (London lingo for head...).I was aware this may be a problem, but having a head as big as mine, I thought that would not affect me, but it does! These phones are very comfortable and ideal for sitting or relaxing listening to your sound. But forget doing housework or washing up (the dishes to you yanks!!:).They should have made these to at least have fitted your head so you can move around. So to summarise; if you want great sound, go for these great performing phones, if you want to move your head, forget it! I don't have the hiss problem by the way some people have complained of.I'm still pleased I bought them, the performance is brilliant considering the price.

VWorks okay for FM headphones, with a single exception:  the unit doesn't transmit unless it detects audio, and the headphones will blast static at full volume if the unit isn't transmitting.  I'm sure they'd be great for watching TV in an apartment or other continuous use, but I planned to use them as wireless headphones for my computer.  When I'm watching or listening to something, they work fine.  When the movie, tv show, or song ends, however, I get treated to a blast of static in my ears unless I immediately start playing something else.These headphones are meant to be plugged into a line-level source (not a headphone jack unless you turn the volume on the source up to full).  There's a very low-level hiss that the FM transmission adds to the audio, and using low level audio as a source makes it much more pronounced.  Source volume should be as loud as possible without clipping, and then turned back down on the headset to avoid the hissing.

VAwesome Sound, Easy Setup
p1766
sg5
VBiggest problem I had is my bedroom tv is so far away from my bed.  The wife was upset cause I would need to turn it up too loud and it was keeping her awake.  Bought these after reading several reviews on this and other products.  Do not pass these up just because they cost $10-$20 more than others that claim to do the same thing.  You'll be happy you spent the extra money.Setup is very simple.  I have a newer tv so there's a rca audio out. Plugged right into that, plugged them in and put the headset on.  You'll need to tweak the bottom dial on the right ear to get the audio, but once it's tuned in you're set.  I've only needed to dial it in 1 other time, but that's only because someone else messed with the dial.Avg watch time is around 1-2hr. I'll leave it off the charging stand for a couple days and they still have plenty of juice.  Recharging is so simple...just put the headphones on the cradle.  The cradle does mount to the wall.

p1772
sg5
VWhat else is there left to say. ;)I bought a these off of Amazon a year ago. Fast shipping (BTW).The sound is good. Not as good as My Koss Pro4AA, nor as good as my Sony in-ears.But, they don't have a cord which makes them perfect for guitar practice. ( one cord to the guitar is plenty to keep up with.)  So Here's the rub.  The Auto Gain Control in the transmitter is constantly riding the gain up and down to compensate for loud and soft passages in music, which is fine for many styles of music that have few dynamic changes, but is very bad for Progressive rock and Classical. One way around the AGC issue is to keep the input volume low enough for the AGC to go to max gain, but the side effect is more hiss during the quieter sections of music.The good: Very Nice Hz response, Light weight, good for tv (the AGC reduces the commercial volume), good for FM radio which used a lot of gain riding already.The bad: No AGC disable switch

p1778
sg5
VAfter TONS of researching, I purchased this wireless headset for listening to the TV in another room (while cooking, cleaning, etc) while not having to blast the volume.  I've been very happy with the unit for a year now. The range is great and sound quality (for a wireless) is very good. Battery life has never been a problem.Minor problems: After wearing it for an hour or two, it can get uncomfortable.  Also, when my house phone rings, there is a loud static sound coming from the earphones during each "ring".  Every once in a while, there will be a constant stream of static - try turning toggling the ON/OFF switch on the earphones or pull the jack out & reinsert into your TV/receiver/stereo.TIP: when placing on the recharging cradle (which I actually keep behind the TV, out of sight) make sure both sides of the earphones are extended to the same length. The charging light will not go on unless both sides are equally balanced.

VFor Hearing Loss/ Depending on Purpose
p1784
sg5
VFor what you get, it's an excllent vaue. I purchased the 120 for my partner who has significant hearing loss, so that I wasn't subjected to inordinately loud volume when he watches TV and I am in another room trying to listen to music.  Achievement of my aim to have liitle or no sound coming from the TV was only partly realized since the TV out rca jacks must have a reasonable volume for the transmitter to work. Too low TV volume and the headphones need too much gain which introduces extraneous noise. With the TV at a normal listening level, that all disappears and the sound is quite acceptable, and he is quite pleased with the result.  So if your aim is to reduce excessive volume in the room, they work quite effectively, However the headphones do not work with the TV on mute, so for my purpose a different setup may have been better. If your partner has hearing loss and you watch TV together, it's an excellent solution.

VI purchased these for my 93-year-old father in a nursing home.  He is nearly deaf even with a hearing aid.  The only way he was able to watch TV in the nursing home is with the sound turned down and closed-captioning turned on.  But with these, he can finally hear the TV again.  We had to purchase a digital to analog converter so it would work with his TV which only had digital optical output.  The sound on the TV itself can be turned all the way down so as not to bother the other residents.  The only drawback is the rechargeable batteries.  Since he is bedridden, he has to remember to give the headphones to a nurse to put on the charging dock.  However, since the batteries are replaceable, I always remember to bring an extra set of charged batteries when I visit.  I was even thinking of getting a set for our home.  The sound quality on the headphones is very good; in fact, they are better than the speakers on our TV.

p1795
sg5
VAs of this writing, this ad labels the RS 120 ii "Over Ear" (in the title) and "over the ears" (in Product Features). This is incorrect, as a quick look at the currently accurate pic will show.The cups of these headphones have no cavity for your ear. Their foam rests directly on the ear, which is why this style is usually referred to as "on ear." Sennheiser's website is consistently clear about this, including in their Technical Data sheet where they use the term, "supra-aural"... 'supra,' loosely translated from the Latin, meaning 'on top of.'Look for the RS 160, RS 170, RS 180, RS 165, RS 175, RS 185 and RS 195 systems and the MM 550-X, the MOMENTUM WIRELESS, and the URBANITE XL WIRELESS for Sennheiser's wireless, "over ear" (AKA "full cup" or "circumaural") headphones, with cups that contact your head 'around' your ears.

VI bought these for my husband, to replace the third set of wireless headphones he has owned over a 10 year span.  Being used to the benefits of the rechargable wireless headphones, this review is all about quality and superiority.He normally has had to have the volume turned up high for the signals to get through without reverting to static.  Not with this model.  This picks up the signal easily and from room to room.He's able to hear the Sunday morning 'talking heads', with the voices all clear and separated.  Even hears the stage background noises (is that good??).  Even the commercials are distinctly heard.I'm sure he'll get a thrill from the NFL games, even if his team sucks.  As for me, I'm glad I don't have to listen to the announcers!Overall, the quality & the looks are great!  I recommend rechargeable wireless headphones in general, and the Sennheiser RS120 926 in particular!

VI purchased these headphones because my husband is an early riser and likes the volume up loud on the tv. We have a home theatre setup with a subwoofer, sound bar and blu-ray player. All the audio outs were either taken or were not the right connections so wouldn't work with the transmitter. We have a Directv HR24 receiver so I plugged the transmitter into that. It had the correct connections so no need to buy any other cables or converters etc. The headphones worked immediately and the sound quality is quite good. Another person in the room can also listen to the tv if desired by using the regular audio system, or leave the audio system turned off and have the sound on the headphones only, which is perfect for early morning or late night tv watching in a small house such as ours. It's easy to tell when they are charging correctly since there's a light to indicate it. Very pleased with this purchase!

VI had these but didn't use them because I could turn my tv sound up loud enough to hear by. Then one day my neighbor said that my TV was so loud they had trouble sleeping. So I started using these and what a world of difference they made! I have hearing aids, but with these I don't have to wear them because the sound is adjustable loud enough for me.For those who say it is not loud:There are two dials on the left earphone. The top one is Volume, the bottom one is Tuning. Turn the "tuning" dial until you get a loud clear signal, then the headset WILL be loud enough for you. If it is not tuned in exactly, you WILL hear it, but the volume will not be anything like it could be and you might not even get stereo. So, take the time to tune the bottom dial first. If you think it is not working on your set, Tune the bottom dial first to get a signal, then decide if it works or not.I love these!!

VWhen I first set out to buy a set of wireless headphones for my viewing pleasure, I wasn't concerned with such notions as crystal clarity, purity of sound, or the complete absence of background white noise.Neither was Sennheiser when they engineered this particular product.But they have concerned themselves with providing a low cost solution for viewers wanting to turn on their television without having spouses and other family members screaming at them to turn down that racket while they busy themselves with such noiseless activities as banging together pots and pans, orchestrating impromptu choirs in your kitchen, or detonating small explosives in the family room.For the price, I feel the quality is fair. If you are concerned with top rate quality of sound without the tedium of constantly adjusting the tuning frequency to just the right notch, you might want to give these a pass.

VI can't complain about the build quality at all: they are light and comfortable but still very solidly built, both the phones and charger.  Unfortunately, they fail at their primary purpose, which is audio.  When the transmission is clean, the audio quality is great, but it rarely ever is clean.  Then, not only do they pop, crackle, and oh yes, hiss, but occasionally when signal cuts out entirely due to interference, you're treated to an eardrum-shattering blast of static at full volume.  I understand that some peoples homes have worse interference than others, but then I expect them to go silent, not blast my ears with full-volume noise.I own three sets of Sennheiser wired headphones and they're simply awesome, so I hate giving such a poor review to one of their products, but I simply can't recommend these to anyone that wants to keep their sanity or hearing.

VI just received the Sennheiser RS120 Headphones yesterday and I must say I am very impressed.  This is an outstanding value for the $65 I paid on Amazon.I was concerned about static as I use them for watching TV but the static is minimal particularly if you turn the volume on the TV up and keep the volume on the headphones low.  Even then you may only hear static when there is a silent passage in the program.They sound very good, nice bass and good tone quality.  They sound great for music too.The RS120 is very comfortable to wear and the range covers my whole house easily.I agree with comments that the tuning adjustment and the volume adjustment shouldn't be so close together but that is a minor point I can live with.My recommendation is to buy them.  I don't think you will be disappointed, particularly considering the price.  These are a great value!

VThe quality of the sound was more than adequate for my needs. I could go 20 feet outside and still have a strong signal. Upstairs or downstairs, they work great. I think they are a great value.I returned them for one reason only. I prefer a cupped-style earphone and the open-style foam earpiece just didn't cut it. I wear wireless headphones because I am usually walking around or doing some light activity somewhere else in the house. Every time I bent down, the headphones fell off my head. You can't adjust the tension in the headphones, so I couldn't live with that.Before I sent them back I did some checking and it looks like the earphones I need are at least $100 more than these. I guess I need to re-evaluate my listening needs. Maybe I should just get a pair of lightweight infrared earphones for watching TV and a good corded headset for listening to music.

I can't believe how far I can go and still hear it crystal clear.My dad has a set and I have a set, and we each use a different channel. Then if he wants to watch something with me he just tunes his headset to my channel and boom, we are both listening to my tv. It's awesome.I do not like the positioning of the tuning dial... I would rather it NOT be on the same side as the volume dial (so there is less of a chance of bumping the tuning dial when adjusting the volume).The headset is a reasonable weight considering the size and that it contains batteries.Overall a great product and worth the price. It has completely changed my tv and gaming experience.

I expected this a little, and i'm not incredibly concerned about it, as i think my hair interferes with it, but at times it gets static when i'm 10 feet away from the transceiver.  I don't need to adjust the channel knob very often - once its tuned properly the static will come and go.  Most of the time its faint and you'll barely notice it.  Be aware that its not flawless, and you will experience some static reception, otherwise sound quality is great, and it serves its purpose well!This product is rechargeable when mounted on its base which is great as well.

VI've been looking for a set of wireless headphones for awhile and after finding these and reading reviews, decided to purchase them.I was pleasantly surprised by them, the set up easy and they are easy to use. The sound quality is very good and range seems to be good. We live in a small apartment so don't need a lot of range, but I'll find out when we move into our new place.They are comfortable to wear, although I don't wear for long periods. I wouldn't recommend them for strenuous activities, but are nice to wear.If I were to recommend one thing, is that to make the base unit powered by either battery or adapter. I use it for my XM radio and also with my laptop and ipod, so I'd like to move it around and being corded not the most convenient, but that is a small thing.Glad I bought the headphones and look forward to many years of use.

VThey have great sound quality, no need to tune it to find the right frequency. There is no hum or high pitch tone that I had with old model, unless there is no audio signal of course.I love these headphones and if forced to talk about minor problems they would be a) if wearing the headphone and you attempt to change the volume you may change the frequency instead, both control wheels are on the same side. B) The head phones charge by placing them on the main unit, this is great, but initial charge the connection was hard to maintain and I had to put a book on the head phones to maintain the connection. As I used them over the next few days it occurred less and less, and now I place the headphones on the charger and there is no problem. It seems the padding was getting in the way and after some use the padding was compressed enough to be a non-issue.

I can wear them all day with no battery issues, no earlobe pain, no sweaty ears, and no need to continuously adjust the fit. I put them on, I turn them on, I tune out the world for hours. The recharge base is super easy to use -- just set the headphones on it. No plugging in each time or changing batteries. I set mine behind my monitor so I don't have to see it or have it in the way. I'm not an audiophile, so I can't comment on the finer points of audio quality, but for your average techy geek who likes electronics and wants something that sounds good (like me) these fit the bill. Haven't had any interference in the signal. Haven't had any issues whatsoever. Very pleased.

VThe Sennheiser RS-120 headphones work great.  I am actually using them with my Sirius satellite radio boombox.  When tuned in properly I have no problems using them while mowing my yard on a riding lawn mower.  The yard is over two acres so I get a decent distance away from the boombox which I set up outside and only occasionally will I get some static when I get far away from the radio, which is expected.  It is great to be able to listen to my Sirius while mowing.  I was using a set of Radio Shack AM/FM headphones, but got annoyed with all of the commercials on regular radio and the static from the stations since I live out in the country.  This option was cheaper than buying the S50 Sirius radio, plus I get to listen to live programming.  If you turn up the volume on the boombox, like other reviewers have mentioned, I have no problem getting enough volume to hear the music over the sound of the mower.  Don't expect to get Bose quality music out of the headphones, but the quality is still very good combined with the distance you are able to get from the transmitter.The only reason I gave these four stars was because no matter how far they reach, you always want it to be farther.  That and they could be a little smaller.  Those are the only complaints I have.I would recommend them to anyone.

V1 Star?
p1874
sg5
VI always read reviews here prior to moving ahead.  I did read some pretty bad ones on this product, however, another thing I consider is the number of 3 or less star reviews compared to 4 and 5.  So I took a chance and must say these headphones are working very well for me.  The range is awesome with hardly any interference, the battery lasts long enough and the cycle of pleasing is sufficient.Yes the volume and tuning wheels are close, but not too close so long as you're careful.  Only thing for me is the light weight, overall this is a merry thing, except when I need to tie my shoes or swing my head around wildly (which I often do when reviewing here).  All in all the price, comfort, function and sound quality are awesome, and that's a word I use way too much, just like most you all.  Enkoy these, you will not regret a day in at all.

p1880

VSo I have used this for a while now and I have to say I am very disappointed with them. First of all, because you have to manually scan the channel of your music playing, you often get that old-radio-style white noise in the background, so sometimes the quality can be pour. Overall, the sound is OK but for the price range, you can get way better.Also, the Auto turn-off feature is not a feature, it's an issue: if you don't play audio for about 5 minutes, the transmitter will turn off which results in your headphones rushing you with full volume white noise! You can't turn this feature off.You are better off buying bluetooth/wired headphones. This type of headphone will probably not satisfy you at all. I do not recommend.If I didn't persuade you, this review certainly will: http://www.tassile.com/2011/02/01/bad-design/

VI am a bit hard of hearing LOL.  This happens as we get older.  My husband is still working and needs to get up quite early in the morning.  Because I am a night owl I watch TV while I'm knitting or crocheting for charity.  Even through a bedroom door and down a hallway, he could still hear the TV because I had the volume turned up so loud.  That's all changed since I purchased this product.  I can put the TV on a very low setting or even turn it to mute and they still work.  I can walk all over the entire house and have perfect hearing for whatever program/movie I'm watching.My only complaint is that I can't seem to adjust these to fit my head - so - I can't bend my head down without holding on to the headphones else they would slip off.  Either I have a small head or the headphones are made for the guys.  HMMM  that could be.

VMostly Work As Advertised; One Major Problem
p1891
sg5
VI won't go over too many details, since there are over 1000 reviews and I mostly agree with them.  However, I just wanted to weigh in on one flaw:  the "auto-off" feature on the base causes these headphones to periodically blast the wearer with loud static if they stop listening to audio but continue to wear the headphones for a few minutes.  I find that I do this fairly often without really thinking about it, so this flaw is really annoying, even though it could have been very easily fixed in several different cost-efficient ways.Also, I don't think they fit especially well.  They're comfortable, but the parts that cover the wearer's ears are completely flat and can easily slide off if I tilt my head down.  No adjustments seem to fix this (as far as I know, I have a normal, non-mutant head, so this probably applies to others, too).

VI could not be happier with these headphones. I had purchased a set of more inexpensive Sony mdr-if240rk headphones earlier that had an unbearable amount of noise when using them on my 50" Panasonic plasma flat screen. When I tried the Sony headphones on my 46" Vizio lcd, they worked just fine. Having had such a good experience with Amazon in the past, I knew that if I ordered the Sennheiser headphones for my Panasonic and had the same problems with noise that they would take them back. Even though the Sennheiser's cost a bit more than the Sony's I went ahead and ordered them. The sound quality and separation is amazing. Watching the World Series on the 50" is just like being there. You can literally hear the people on either side of you as if you were there. Sennheiser has a great product and Amazon as always is a super merchant!

VThe headphones' base station is connected to my satellite dish receiver and is behind closed cabinet doors out of sight.  It was easy to select the appropriate channel to get reception without any interference.  I wear hearing aids and the TV placement does not let me enjoy the surround sound produced by many of the stations without increasing the volume to a level too loud for the rest of the family. The headphones fit over the ears without removing the hearing aids and I can experience the surround sound without changing the TV volume. The reception is good enough to let me walk around the house and onto the porch outside without missing any of the dialog. In addition, the quality of the sound is quite good. While wearing the headphones, the open air design allows me to hear when someone in the room speaks to me.

VIf you cannot find instructions on how to hook up this device don't bother.  there are none. Just a few pictures and a few troubleshooting lines.  If your wondering why the power light does not come on when you plug in the base its because you have to turn on the headphones too.  If you have no sound there is a tiny 3 position switch on the base.  slide it to a new position.  for the best results plug this into the headphone jack on your stereo system (adapter supplied) and not into the TV's audio output.  this will mute the sound and only allow to channel to the headphones.  It is light weight and comfortable.  sound is just fine for music and tv.  the headphones do not block out outside noises (doorbell, vacuum, people talking) if you just want to listen to tv-music without bothering others this is the way to go.

VI had the headsets up and running withing about 4 minutes after opening the box.  It was an easy set up, BUT I did find that having both the volume adjustment and the fine tuning knob, a little troublesome, being on the same ear muff.  It takes a little adjusting to...but that's easily overcome with use....other than that....I was surprised on the way that the "muff" seals out the external noise but doesn't crimp your ear....nice concept (the stand being the recharger for the batteries).  I found the sound to be quite accurate in replication....bass had good response.  I checked it using STAR WARS EPISODE 1 and the fight scenes of the lasers were true as well as the rumbling of the "tanks".  I really like this headset....it sits on your head very lightly.  NICE JOB SENNHEISER!!  I recommend them with NO hesitation.

VGreat Wireless Headphones - Last A Long Time
p1920
sg5
VI bought a pair of these headphones to replace another identical set purchased over a decade ago.  The only reason the prior set failed was because the insulation on the audio cable became brittle, and flaked off, and shorted out within the unit.  I've got plenty of vinyl coated audio and power cords that have had the same troubles after a decade or two.  So I've got no complaints about the longevity of the product.The headphone quality and response is quite good, and like all non-bluetooth headphones, there's no lag.  So these are great for watching TV.The only downside to these is that they tend to fall off if one's head tilts too far forward.  A closed ear headphone solves the problem, but I find my ears get too hot in closed ear headphones.  As a result, I'm quite happy with these!

p1926

VThe sound from the unit is excellent. The headphones are comfortable.  But no matter where I place the receiver it cuts out every 3-5 minutes for 2-30 seconds at a time.  It's tolerable so I'm going to keep it and maybe try some more locations.The unit also has inconvenient, poorly designed power and input connections.  The power wire is fixed in the unit.  When I want to move the unit I have to unplug the power wire from the source, pull it out from my cabinet and rerun it back to the power source rather than just unplugging it from the unit and reconnecting the power wire at the new receiver location.  The input wire is very difficult to plug into the unit and to remove it.  I had to use needle nose plier to get it out.  I wonder if the people who makes these ever use them themselves.

VUPDATE: Back to 4 stars. My original (below) report is / was correct....however, after using these for a week or so, some issues have come up. [1] NOT comfortable for long term use. The ear pieces are too flat, uncomfortably smashing the ears (particularly when glasses are worn).They should be recessed in the center for better ear clearance. [2] The ear pieces aren't allowed to swivel sufficiently for good fit and comfort. [3] In spite of smashing one's ears, they fall off if one bends over, their hefty weight exacerbating this problem. My el-cheapo wireless headsets are WAAAY more comfortable. Yeah-the ones that DON'T WORK. Sadly thse COULD be a home run if redesigned for more comfort.  I will continue to use them as the range is truly incredible. Of the 4 or 5 wireless headsets this is the only one with the range to which I allude in my initial critique. The only other issue I now have after using them for many hours, is the weak high frequency response. Very good headset that could be better. With their range, I'd say go for them.>>>>>>>>>>Fantastic headphones!  Ever since my Advent wireless phones went South, I've been looking for a replacement. After several abvortive attempts with lower priced units, I finally gave in to spend the $USD on these. Range?  Absolutely unbelievable. And I thought my Advents were good. My house is in the center of a 1 acre lot, and these Sennheiser 'phones have no drop-outs ANYWHERE on my property, includiing in the three outbuildings. Needless to say, I can't lose them in the house. I can probably use these rather than my Peltor hearing protection while mowing, and listen to music to boot. Fidelity? Superb! As close to wired headphones as one could get. I hope they continue to work this well as they age. I'm blown away . TV? Wow! Now I can get to the kitchen or other areas and not lose the TV audio.

VI got these almost 2 years ago, and have been using them ever since, at least 3 to 4 hours or more nearly every day.  They still perform perfectly and I have no complaints.  The small issue that they fall off if you bend over is true, but not really bothersome.  I wish there were a way for me to continue to use them with my new audio equipment, but it has no headphone jack or rca stereo output jacks.  I have tried using the optical audio out jack with an adapter to rca analog stereo jacks, but have had no luck with the results.  Is there a solution out there?  Probably, but I haven't found it yet. I still would recommend these, as they have never failed in the nearly two years that I have used them, and I will still search for a way to connect them successfully to my newer equipment.

Sennheiser makes a fine product and the price makes it even sweeter.  Thanks both of you.  I sure enjoy my new ears.Allow me to add this bit of info.  If you're a cable user or satellite like us, plug these into the audio out RCA ports.  Much better sound and you won't have to take the TV off the wall like I did.  Learn from my mistakes.  We'll be taking these to NC in a couple months and will do the same there.  These are good for hearing impaired folks like me.  Go for them.

VMy own fault for not jumping right on the return wagon, but really thought it was my lack of knowledge in hooking them up. Which seemed relatively easy. I should've known when I first plugged them in and tried to rest the earphones on the charging dock and the red charging light did not illuminate properly that something was wrong, but again doubted myself. Then plugging them into the tv, reading all the instructions on how to connect through Visio audio, still they do not work. The audio connect light oddly lights up briefly when the tv turns on, but no audio is heard through the headphones at any time. Eventually the green audio connect light just shuts off and I'm left with static.I'm very unhappy that I only had 30 days to decide how to work these things.

VThese have pretty good sound considering the price BUT since they sit on the ear, not over the ear, they are very uncomfortable if you're trying to deal with glasses and/or hearing aids. Also, they can't be used in the same area with some of the other Sennheiser (RS 130 for one) because although each headset was connected to a different computer, we could not each listen to different things due to bleedthrough? (whatever you want to call it). I was trying to listen to music, hubby a product review, and we both heard the other's sound in the background. This was coming though the headsets, not because either one of us had the volume up. Changing the channel on the heaphones and bases did not correct this. One set of headphones' transmitter was set on '1' and one on '3'.

VGift Headphones
p1974

VThis review really pertains to the Amazon exchange policy.  RS120 headphones were purchased as a gift to be given on 11/16; the return option expired on 11/18.  I made the mistake of ordering them in advance and not setting them up as soon as I received them.  After exchanging several emails with the manufacturer it was determined on 11/30 that the product should be returned due to a probable faulty connection.  The headphone set could not be tuned to eliminate the static though they did work fine for about 2 days.  A friend of mine has the same model and they work beautifully.  The receiver was connected to two different TV sets for testing.  The slightest move of the head brought on static and eliminated any reception there might have been.  If the Amazon exchange policy were more gift-friendly I'm sure I'd be writing a more positive review.  However, the product that I received was not in working condition.  Therefore, I rate it poorly for out-of-the-box performance and I am disappointed with Amazon's lack of flexibility for customer support.  Also, I am unable to access Amazon's feedback section - I get a Thanks screen which also states 'You currently have no more feedback to leave.'

VI have used cheaper (~$30-$40) RF wireless headphones in the past. They always were popping and littered with static, no matter what I did. Reposition the transmitter, turning off other wireless devices, input signal manipulation. Nothing worked.My wife and I got fed up, but were hesitant to spend 2 to 3 times the price on this set.This has been worth every penny I paid for it. No more static, no more popping. Setup was a snap, and the sound quality is fantastic (for RF wireless, anyway).I would highly recommend these.The one downside is that there is no battery life indicator. The headphones don't gradually get quieter when the batteries die. You get about 10 seconds where the volume goes down, then they just shut off.

VI have been using the headphones for about 2 months and I have found them to be the best I've had. They were easy to set up and I found them to very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is excellent and I have had no problem with interference. They are advertised as being effective within 300 feet and while I have not tested them at that distance I have tested them all over my house and the reception is consistently excellent. The only suggestion I have for improving the operation of the headphones is to increase the separation between the volume control and the tuner. Both these controls are on one side of the headphones and it is easy to inadvertantly move the tuner wheel and thereby detune the signal when you meant to move the volume control wheel.

They are also very loose and will fall off my head if I lean forward at all.  I was willing to put up with the looseness but now they cannot be used at all.later: they started working again and I'm pleased with the sound but they are still very loose.  Don't know what to do about that.It's now 2013 and I'm still using these so I guess I did get my money's worth BUT there seems to be a short in them.  They are either on (very loud) or off, nothing in between.  I'm not looking to upgrade and confused about what to buy.

The range is great - we can go upstairs and listen to our music or TV the entire time, or even out in the back yard. Hook-up was easy and this is one of the top brand names. I've used them a lot also for watching late night TV while everyone else is asleep and they haven't disappointed me at all. They're comfortable and easy to use. I've had experiences with both Sony and AR sets before and these are better. One thing - when you put the phones back in the cradle, make sure they're facing the right way around or they won't charge. There's a light to show if they're charging.

VI received Sony headphones as a gift purchased from Amazon.  It produced static when connected a plasma TV.  Rather than returning them I use the Sony upstairs on another TV.  They work fine.After reading numerous reviews I purchased the Sennheiser RS120 from Amazon.  Directly out of the box the headphones worked beautifully on a Panasonic plasma TV.There's a tiny frequency selector switch on the face of the transmitter/battery charger.  Just find a suitable frequency and you're good to go.The downside which prevented me from giving the Sennheiser five stars.  Unless you reverse the phones on your head they will easily slide off.  That's a nuisance.  I also wish they had used metal instead of plastic on size adjustment.

VHi,I've been searching around the internet and am able to find these headphones starting around $59 (not including shipping).I am almost ready to purchase, and last monday Amazon's price was $59.something.  I had everything in the cart and ready to buy, when the price jumped to $79.  I then stopped my order and checked froogle.com for prices elsewhere.  It is true that other stores sell them for less.  So, why the amazon price jump?I've notified amazon that their price is higher than others and will wait a few days to see if they lower it again back to what it originally was.Just a warning about the price.Sincerely,me

VThese Sennheiser RS120s are great!
p2033
sg5
VI just had to try out my Christmas present before Christmas.  And I'm glad I did.  These Sennheiser RS120s are great!  Holds the signal well, without the loss and recapture typically associated with 823-920MhZ phones.  Doesn't  interfere with my router and wifi!  Clear tones with great separation.  Super easy charging rack.  Comfortable ear pads.  Most background hiss between recordings is greatly diminished.  I'm listening to reel to reel I recorded over 50 years ago and CDs.  Both are sounding great!  Great signal strength too.  I can't imagine the performance from their $200 upscale units.  For the average audiophile, these are top notch.  Asked my wife to just wrap the empty box to put under the tree.  I want to listen to my old recordings.

VThese Wireless Headphones were Terrible!
p2039
sg5
VI purchased two of these to replace two old ones I had.  I thought I'd upgrade with modern headphones.  It was a big mistake.  These were really bad.  There was static and background noise.  When I turned my head, the signal was lost.  I tried without success to make them work.  Further, they didn't fit well. The ear pieces are flat and press on the ear, rather than cupping or enclosing the ear.  There is uncomfortable pressure on the ear and if you bend over, they slip off. I went back to using my old headphones that work perfectly.  They are much better than these, even though they are approximately 10 years old and were inexpensive.  I was, however, impressed with Amazon by the way they handled these returns.  They make returns quite easy.

VI am about to purchase my second pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones. If you are hearing impaired and often miss out on words or phrases that take away from the joy of a good movie or program, I highly recommend these headphones. I previously had to turn the volume up so loud that it deafened everyone else in the house. The only static I encounter is when there is no transmission of sound (as at the end of a movie). My second purchase is for use with another device in another area of my home. Since purchasing these headphones, I am thoroughly enjoying my hobby....a lover of movies! And, I no longer miss a word!!!I have recommended these to family members who have purchased multiples also.For the price, there is no better deal.

VGreat product!  We\u2019ve been using Sennheiser wireless headphones for many years.  We have sets in the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the office, \u2026..what\u2019s that?  Four sets?  They\u2019ve all functioned perfectly until the last set we bought about a year ago.  This headset started to suffer frequency drift and became directional to the point that if I moved my head left or right, the signal varied.I contacted Sennheiser and reported the problem.  Sennheiser said \u201csend them to us with a description of the problem\u201d.  Did that!  Two weeks later (today), and much to my surprise, I received a package from Sennheiser with NEW headphones.  Now that\u2019s a company standing behind its product.We\u2019ll stick with Sennheiser.

VI live in an apartment and work 3rd shift, so frequently watch TV at about 7am on weekdays and don't want to wake my neighbors. Also, I tend to watch movies at 2-5am on weekends and that would surely wake my neighbors. So, I bought these.After a little trouble honing in on the signal due to very touch controls, I achieved very good sound. There's still static when I turn them on but as soon as they pair with the base station (when the TV show or movie makes its first sound) then they sound great.My only problem is a minor one: Because the recharge station and antenna are one, the headphones are required to be near the TV when not in use. I don't mind it but it's a (minor) constraint on your TV room's design.

p2068

VThey work great and sound great! If you adjust the sound and tune them right there is no static or other noise noticeable like other people say. I love them for watching tv when my room mates are asleep. Great sound, great confort, no problems. There does have to be sound streaming to them in order for the base to power on, which i did not know previously and got me confused when the base power light was not on when plugged into the wall. Great product other than that slight bit of confusion. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good quality set of wireless headphones. The range is just fine and can easily penetrate walls. The farthest away i have tested is about 10 yards, but i dont need to get too far from the tv.

VBought these as a gift for my father who is slightly hard of hearing.  We've gone through a few sets in the past that worked OK, but wore out after a while, but being in a new house and once again killing everyone with the TV volume, we went looking for a new set.These have turned out to be fantastic.  Audio quality is great, range is fantastic, set up is simple and the recharging feature of the transmitter is very convenient.  The only downside is that my father reported that the headphones were a bit warm after a few hours of use.  In a typical evening, this likely wouldn't be an issue, but during the holidays and all-day football watching, the traditional non-vented cup design can become warm on the ears.

Only problem I had was plugging into the audio jack on my TV.  I plugged into wrong one initially.  (There are two separate and distinct jacks on my TV for audio output.)  In a review that I had read, the person said connect direct to TV so you can take advantage of playing dvd's, or instant from Netflix or Amazon, good advice. The unit works flawlessly and I have recommended these to my other hard of hearing friends.

VI purchased these headphones for my brother-in-law who lives with us.  He is severely hearing impaired and was blasting the family out of the room when we watch TV.  He likes these headphones so so much.  He wears them everyday to watch TV or to listen to the cable music channel.  He can go out into the backyard and has no problem with reception.  The volume is adjustable on the phones themselves and is plenty loud for him.  I have it hooked into the cable box so that the TV volume has no effect on them.  The rechargeing is great and they seem to keep there charge for at least 6 to 8 hours.  They are comfortable too, he falls asleep in them sometimes.  I am going to purchase another pair for my dad today!

VNew TV's have digital optical audio output (TOSLINK). The Sennheiser RS 120 only accepts analog. You must buy a TOSLINK to analog converter if you have one of the newer TV. They go for $20-$40. I bought FiiO D3 digital to analog audio converter. You can view the one I bought at:FiiO D3 Digital to Analog Audio Converter With Micca 6ft Optical Toslink Cable - 192kHz/24bit Optical and Coaxial DACThe wireless headphones are great for the price. Now the wife doesn't yell at me for having the TV too loud. I just put on the headset and everybody is happy.I recommend this product to anyone wanting wireless headphones at a great price (and peace at home).

I unpacked the box, put the batteries in the headphones, plugged the yellow cord into the back of the grey stand which plugs into the wall or power cord, plugged the black and red cords from the grey box into the output on the back of the TV and they worked just fine. You may have to adjust the volume or tune them in from the headset itself. Simple to use. Just put your TV on mute and you don't have to worry about bothering others while listening to the TV. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. I'm happy with them.

VPurchased these wireless headphones for my husband who is hearing impaired.  Even though he wears hearing aids, he would still miss about 75% of the dialog during TV shows and DVDs.  He can now hear everything clear as a bell.  He does not miss any dialog and also can hear the background music and sound effects. His face just lit up the first time he watched his favorite movie!  He is telling all of his friends that wear hearing aids about theses headphones.  The headphones were easy to set up, easy to adjust the sound and volume.  The sound quality is excellent. This product is fantastic for folks who have difficulty hearing their favorite shows and movies and well worth the price.

Have had to tape over the tuning knob, as Dad could not adjust the volume with out reseting the tuner -- then because of his hearing loss, someone else had to reset the tuner for him.Also, the batteries that were supplied were the absolute cheapest rechargables on the market, 600ma.  Didn't want to hold a charge past 4 hrs.  Have replaced them with 1200ma batteries ($5) that last as long as Dad wants to wear them.  Recharging cradle is brilliant.

We use these every day and it also keeps me from having to hear my husbands loud shows that I don't necessarily want to watch. Very clear sounding, like being at the movies with surround sound.  Only once in a while will you hear static, and we can even walk to the other side of the house or outside and still hear it perfectly.  I don't know what we would do without them.

Just static through the headphones.I then unplugged the transmitter for 30 seconds, removed the batteries, reinserted them as the troubleshooting instructions say to do and still nothing. Turning the tuning wheel and switching to any of the three channels on the transmitter base didn't seem to help, either.Needless to say, this product is going back.

The necessary contact is so small and the space for pushing the components together so limited, that it is a frustrating and clearly temporary setup. They even have a silly illustration of how to push the contacts together, so this must be a known problem. I'm not sure how to accomplish return of a defective product, but will definitely pursue this!

Have glasses on your ears and these hard, flat headphones on makes it un-usable in my opinion.I have a pair of Bose for when I travel; so I know what a food headphone feels like.

Maybe it's for costs saving (they avoid using a more complex and precise tuning circuitry). It's annoying to have the signal lost by accident when you're trying to turn down the volume...

So, whenever my husband has the headphones on, he can hear my entire conversation. I'm not sure if it's because of my frequency of my particular phone.  The convenience of not changing the battery every week and a half is a plus.  I bought a Kensington Headphones from Walmart prior to the Sennheiser and it broke within 3 weeks.  So, spend the extra $50 to get the Sennheiser.  It's worth the money and the hassle of changing batteries.  Aloha!

VI will be returning these.  After all the positive reviews these seemed like a bargain, but they were incredibly disappointing.  My biggest complaint is that these are very uncomfortable.  Unlike other large headphones which use a soft rubber ring around the earpieces, these are just flat with a scratchy soft material covering them.  I cannot imagine wearing these through an entire movie.  They are hot on your head and make your ears hurt after 10 minutes or so.  The sound is mediocre at best with a fairly noticeable hiss. I really wouldn't recommend these to anyone.  Save your money and buy something better.

It is a fine product.The big difference is that the old headphones fit around the ears, not on them like these replacements.  This has not noticeably affected the sound quality, but it makes them very easy to fall off if you walk around with them and lean over.Sennheiser may still make an around the ears model.  If they do, get those.

VI purchased these headphones for my late night tv watching husband.  I was very tired of the volume changes waking me up.  This was the best thing I have purchased.  He & I love them.  He can listen to TV all night and it doesn't bother me at all.  It is very comfortable & has wonderful sound.  This would also be great for those who have to have the tv louder then the others would like.  I like that you can also watch TV at a volume that you are comfortable with or it can be put on mute.  We have this set up in our bedroom upstairs and are able to go downstairs and still get reception.

VJust What Was Needed
p2213
sg5
VSince my wife can no longer adequately hear the TV without the volume to at least 11, hearing aids or headphones were the only options.  After dismissing hearing aids, we wanted wireless headphones with decent sound and range that didn't require a battery change every few uses.  These headphones fit the bill.  The rechargeable batteries  recharge on the stand when not in use, you can walk around the house without a loss of the strong clear signal and they sound great.  They do require some initial tuning to get the best signal and sound quality, but after that. . . you're good to go!

VTo bulky, if I look at my feet they will fall off. Lots of static and interference. The transmitter is about 10 feet away. They sit on a cradle when charging and when they form to your head when you do go to charge them they may or may not charge or charge intermeditly due to the poor charging design. I would not recommend these to friends or family. For the price you can find better quality and ones that fit, charge and sound better with much less interference and static. I read mixed reviews and was hoping most of the negative ones where from picky people but that wasn't the case.

VHaving been using these headphones for about 1 month.  The sound is great and so far no static.  I can turn the tv volumn totally down and my husband cannot hear the tv thru the headphones.  I live in a mobile home and can walk to the opposite end and still hear the tv.  I think they're great.  They are my first wireless headphones so I have nothing else to compare them to.  The charging cradle works great.  The only con that I've found so far is that I have a narrow head and if I lean forward, they will fall off. They are not adjustable at all. Works better on more rounded heads.

p2231

VWe got these in 2005 and three years later they are holding up pretty well.They still hold a charge well and the sound is fine.  The only issue is that the metal area at the top of the headphones that comes in contact with the charging stand gets extremely corroded over time.  It gets harder and harder to get the red light to come on indicating that it is recharging.  Scraping off the corrosion seems to help, but it would be better if the charger connected differently so this didn't happen.They are surprisingly durable and have survived numerous drops on a hard floor.

VI have some hearing deficit that makes me miss some dialogue and hate being tethered to a TV with wires. Looked at big box double letter stores and was suprised they did not stock much in wireless headphones. I read a lot of reviews like this and settled on the Sennheiser RS-120 (mostly because it was $78 (half of retail stores). For my use (sitting in a Lazy-boy) watching TV, they are perfect. They are comfortable, great sound and have experienced no hissing sounds when tuned properly. The cradle for recharging batteries works just fine. Great pair of headphones for the money.

I had purchased him several different brands over the years.  I recently purchased him the Sennheiser 120 and there is absolutely no comparison in the sound quality and comfort!  They are so amazing I purchased a pair for myself for the bedroom TV and my daughter and granddaughter for Christmas.The product was delivered when promised and in great condition!  Thank you Amazon.

The smile on my very hard of hearing dads face when he put the phones on for the the first time was priceless.  We can listen to a program at a nice comfortable level while he gets to do the same with the headphones on.  The TV and Phones have totally seperate volume control.

VI like these and they've probably saved my marriage. The sound is good and they have a long range. The cons are that they can feel warm on your head and they certainly aren't feather weight. The other problem that could have been easily avoided is the fine tuning wheel being directly under the volume wheel, it's so easy to hit the wrong wheel and have to retune the whole thing. It happens so often that I'm thinking of getting it exactly where I want it and than taping it. It would have been better to have the fine tuning on the side with the on and off switch.

VMy dad has the habit of falling asleep while watching TV downstairs. I think he's also going deaf because he turns the volume extremely loud yet still manages to snore through it all.I have a job but I can't afford to pay rent on top of all my other bills, so I did the next best thing and spent 70 dollars on a pair of magical headphones to keep my father entertained while watching Harry Potter movies so I can fall asleep and get to work on time.These are a must buy for any man that is going deaf. If you are completely deaf, these will do you no good.

VIMO, headphones costing close to a hundred dollars ought to last for more than a year.  The price made me think it was higher quality than it was.  That attitude made me a sucker, because my headphones died after several months.  The wiring inside it has such a small diameter, it wears out in no time. My headphones short-circuited one day, ceased to charge up, quit picking up any sound, and finally went dead. An examination of the wiring showed me it was little better than filament wire. Can't they afford to beef up the wiring so the device will last awhile?

VThe ultimate solution for hard of hearing or courteous people who don't want to overwhelm their neighbors with loud noise from their TVs. One person can use the wireless headphones while the other person can control the sound from the TV for him or herself independently of the volume the headphone wearer selects. There is an impressive listening range. We even tested them out by going upstairs and still hearing our TV downstairs. Read that you can have more than one set in use and it's an option we may choose in the future by purchasing an additional set.

These would be great if you are trying not to disturb someone in a different room, but if you plan to use them in the same room with someone else in there, you will definitely get complaints. Sorry, but I am using Amazon's great return policy to send these back.

When he used the headphones, we could listen to a normal volume, yet he could also hear clearly.  I immediately ordered a set when we returned home.  When I received the headphones I did have a difficult time figuring out where to connect them until I realized I needed to connect them to the cable box.  Problem solved and happiness ensued!

VThese headphones are perfect. I share a room with a person who also has a television and this allows us both to watch our shows at the same time. Not to mention it keeps my television from waking her when I decide to watch BBC at midnight. The only downside is that they don't cover my ears. Like there is no "cup" action. So the noise cancelation isnt all that great but I pretend that it is when my roommate talks. All in all, I'd definitely say these headphones ARE worth the buy. The recharging Stand and the auto shutoff are great features.

They are comfortable for her and she is very happy with them.  Although Sony is also a great brand, the price on Amazon and reputation of Sennheiser caused me to make the right decision.  We are very pleased with these wireless headphones.

VI am deaf in one ear and wear a hearing aid on the other and TV had become a problem. Could hear sound but not distinguish words the RS120 has been a blessing.  The sound quality is as good as the TV and can go from room to room and outside and not miss a thing. The headset is a little large but the quality of the product is worth this small objection.  Was plug and play in seconds and has great range of volume.  Would recommend to anyone especially if you have a hearing problem.  I do not have to wear the hearing aid when using the RS120.

VI have used these headphones for the past two months and am endlessly pleased with them.  They took a few days to get just right--you can change the channel as well as tune them within a channel, so make sure to get the  settings right.  The sound quality on cable TV, DVD's, audio and so on is first rate...not quite as good as wired headphones, but close.  The range is excellent--sometimes I go outside and wash the car while listening to something (sports) that doesn't require every minute in front of the picture.  Great product.

VAfter several failed sets of junky TV Ears, I finally switched over to RF headphones.  They phones have a great range, I tested them at 100' away and the signal was just as clear and crisp as if I was still standing in front of the transmitter. Battery life is excellent, as I only have to charge them about once a week.  The only downside to these is that they are a little bit heavy, and don't fit as tightly on my head as I would like them to.  Since I don't really move around a lot with them on, that isn't a major drawback.

Other than that, I am satisfied with the headphones and I can now enjoy watching t.v. while exercising without having to turn the volume way up on the t.v.

VVery disappointed with this product.  I had high hopes.  One side works great.  If you "balance" the two sides, it's quieter than without the headphones which defeats the purpose of buying them.  If you tune the right side so it's clear and you can easily hear it, the left side has a constant buzzing noise that is very annoying.  I emailed the company for technical advice on what I might be able to do to fix the situation but never heard from them.  So the technical support is equally as good as the product.

VGreat sound and true quality built into these headphones.Little disappointed in the comfort. They tend to want to "SQUEEZE" your ears, resulting in a painful feeling. Advertised as ear-cups. But ear-cups fit over and completely around the ear, never actually touching or pressing on the ears. These have a cup in the middle, but it's way too small to fit around your ear. The result is after a few hours of wearing these headphones, you want to take them off and give your ears a rest.

Contrary to some reviews of these and other wireless headphones, I found no problems with sound quality, no background noise and a range of at least 40 feet with no signal distortion. I like the fact that the phones use standard rechargeable AA batteries that are easily replaced. I also found the recharging cradle convenient and easy to use. All in all I and very pleased with these headphones.

VInitially I was concerned about some of the negative reviews.  I've purchased this product over a month ago and it has exceeded my expectations.  I am by no means an audiophile, but the sound quality is great and no noise (or interference) I can detect.I use it in the bedroom, which is on the second level of my house.  I positioned the transmitter base at the top of armoire (TV cabinet).  I can receive reception outside the house as far away as my mailbox (about 40 ft).

VThe only thing I found was that the headphones have a loose fitting on smaller heads. There is no way to really adjust the width; only the height of a person's head. The earlier model had a tighter it and would not slide off if you happen to lower your head. That is the only complaint. The fact that the batteries do not have a memory is terrific. My last set barely lasted 2 hours. The sound is also very good. I strongly recommend the headphones but they may wear lose on some.

The wireless range is amazing--I easily go out, go down from my third floor apartment and about 100 or so feet away to throw away the trash and I can still hear my music/TV with little interference at that distance! This is a great product well worth the money if you want wireless headphones.

p2445

VThis Sennheiser headset's tuning is controlled with a "continuously variable potentiometer" which must be set "very carefully" in order to hear the audio clearly; worse, it must be re-adjusted annoyingly frequently.Other RF headsets like both the Sony TMR-RF985 and the JVC HA-W600RF have "channel switches" which are either in the right position or not.  Their audios are not perfect, but there is no re-tuning, once the channel is set.

VThese are the worst headphones I've ever heard.  The hiss is overwhelming.  My Living Presence CDs mastered in the 1950s have far less hiss than these.  I gave up less than a minute into Prokofiev's first symphony.  I was only a few feet away from the transmitter.  When I turned my head there was a loud swishing noise.  Considering all the positive reviews, maybe these work for hip-hop or something like that, but for classical music they're a complete failure.

The range from the base is also great,as they still work 200' from my house, and that is with the base in my basement! The charging cradle is a no brainer- just replace phones and walk away. The only problem I found is phones tend to slide off my head during workouts,but the great sound makes up for this slight annoyance.

I tried everything from unplugging it to retuning the frequency with no success. Then the next day, it worked all of a sudden. So, it is going back to Amazon today.

VThese Sennheiser wireless headphones are nice mid-range choice when considering headphones for everyday listening of TVs or computers. They do not have noise-canceling circuitry and the cups sit on rather than surrounding the ear. Some folks might find that uncomfortable after extended wearing. But once the headphones are set up and the best frequency has been found, these Sennheisers do exactly what they promise - transmit sound clearly to the listener.

The sound is so clear & crisp, works even in the next room (concrete walls),  charging station is simple to use, the only fault I can find is that the ear parts do not really "envelope" the ears.

VBest wireless headphones I've ever had
p2514
sg5
VThis is my 3rd pair of wireless headphones.  Had Sony RF-930s and some RCAs before that.  Both broke in short order and although these Sennheiser's may do the same down the road, they work MUCH better than either of my previous two pairs.  Can move around the house with no static.  No constantly adjusting the signal.  It's amazing.  They actually work.  For the 40% off deal amazon has going on these, they're a steal.OK, they don't come with a headphone adapter.  I happened to have a RCA to phono plug adapter around and used it.  Suppose it would be nice if Sennheiser had included this, especially considering the list price.  And the "manual" is pretty much non-existent.  They could have done a better job with that.Long term we'll have to see how they hold up.  Short term though, if you have *realistic* expectations (they are wireless headphones, after all) you should be pleased.

Vbe sure to have the tv volume set high to provide a strong enough signal for the headset
p2520
sg5
VWorks fine. However had problems at first. I found the trick is to adjust the volume on the TV to near maximum BEFORE using the headset controls. Then use the volume control on the headset to reduce the volume. If you have the TV volume set too low, and try to raise the volume with the headset control, you will get only static. The headset needs the TV volume set high in order to provide a strong enough signal for the headset to function.

VThese are great! Set-up with my TV was a breeze. Sound quality is excellent. No buzz or hum. Range is good. Comfortable to wear. Been using for a few months and no complaints at all. Truly, these have saved my marriage. I am a late night binge TV watcher, and even watching in another room the noise was keeping my wife awake. Now: blissful silence and marital peace! Why did I wait so long?

VI purchased this to play with my Bass off my stereo and Rocksmith 2014.  Unfortunately, the frequency must be similar to the bass itself and the frequency of the TV.  Seems like if I move in one direction or another during any moment, the volume goes out.  This would be much better if they provided a digital signal over the analog signal.I will have to keep trying.

p2643
sg5
VIn the beginning it's all good. You can put these on without disturbing those around you. After about a year, the volume dial would cause one or both sides to go silent or at uneven levels. You have to start moving the dial in a certain way to get both sides to even out. This is going to take some practice because it happens every time you turn on the headphone.

Vthis is the second set of wireless headphones that I tried and these are really great.  Sound quality is very good for wireless, just a bit of a hiss.  Anoying static when the base unit decides to turn off, but it comes back on again immedately when the computer makes another sound.  The dial tuning is a great feature, and the battery usage is not too bad.  They are very comfortable, but a bit heavy.A bit more expensive than the lower end models, but now I know why.  I won't go back.

VGood wireless headphones with great sound. The replaceable ear pads can be both good and bad. Since they are flat they do not surround the ear and therefore tend to slip off your head with any movement.

We put the second base next to the tv in our finished basement so my dad could use them in his bedroom or the basement. You can tune them to whichever base you want so two people can use them in the same room if needed or can be used at the same time on different tv's, we were concerned about that but as I said you can tune them easily. They get great range as well, in case you need to run into the kitchen to grab more popcorn but don't want to pause the show. Now that we have two pairs in the house these get used by everyone.

VThese were for my mother in an assisted living facility. She did not like turning up her television so loudas to bother her neighbors and these headphones work perfectly. She can also hear the phone ringor someone knocking on the door while wearing them which is a huge plus.

p2919
sg5
VI waited to write a review after I had a chance to fully test my new Sennheiser wireless headphones. After several weeks of using them, I must say, I am extremely happy with all aspects of this product! I mainly use them at night, after my fiance goes to bed, so I don't wake her when I watch a movie or play a video game. I am using the headphone adapter to plug the base into the headphone jack of my stereo receiver, which is where I have all audio routed to (TV, CD, PS3, Record Player, Computer, etc...).First off, the headphones sound GREAT, in my opinion! The audio is very clear, and it has a good balance of bass and treble. Neither are overpowering, much like a decent pair of studio headphones...pretty even across the spectrum. I do not notice any "hiss" or feedback when there is audio present, but there is a little hiss when your audio source is silent (like during loading screens for games, or dvd menus). This goes away once audio is playing. I watched a couple of action movies the other night, and the balance between the music, dialog and sound effects was perfect. Also, when playing games, the audio was crisp and balanced. In fact, I could hear a lot of background sounds in the movies/games that I wouldn't have noticed when listening to them without the headphones on.The headphones have a power switch on them, as well as a volume control and a channel tuner. The channel tuner is used for "tuning-in" the reception from the base, in case you are getting static (not for tuning in radio stations, etc...). The volume control works great, and can be used even if the volume on your audio source is turned down low. I have read a few reviews from people who mentioned the volume being adjusted accidentally, when they would lay down on a pillow or something. I have not had this happen yet, but also have not totally tried wearing them while lying down...I have only rested my head against a pillow while on the couch, and have not had any issues like that. The only negative mark I could give it would be that after a couple of hours or more of having them on, the headphones do start to become uncomfortable on your ear. There isn't a lot of padding on them, and they do not fit over the entire ear. But, it isn't so bad for me that I would deduct a star from the review.The range of the signal seems to be very good, and works great for my situation. My front room is fairly large, and I have been able to walk around in it, and into the kitchen without any issues. I would say it is at least 30 feet away from where the base is located, and even when the signal would be passing through a wall. So far, so good. Occasionally, I will get a quick "hit" in the signal when I turn my head a certain way, but it goes away almost instantly. This has happened when I was sitting 5 feet from the base as well, so I'm not sure if it is quick interference from another device, or actually coming from the base. It is definitely not something that is horrible, though, and shouldn't worry anyone thinking about purchasing it, in my opinion.Ultimately, I couldn't be happier with this purchase! The price is definitely right for what you get, especially when compared to other similar products. Plus, being in the video production industry, I have always relied on Sennheiser to deliver quality audio products, and this is no exception. Good clean and balanced audio, high volume, great range, and easy charging make this a great buy.

VGood, but flawed.
p2925
sg5
VThis is the 4th pair of wireless headphones I've owned for watching TV and my first Sennheiser.The good:  The audio quality is the best I have experienced yet.  It is significantly clearer than any other pair I have had and there is no hiss.  I like the ability to tune.  The range on these things is by far the best I have ever seen.  I wore them outside could still hear the TV while I was standing across the street.  Any other headset I have had gave-out a couple feet outside the front door.  There is zero audible hiss (I am looking at you Sony - WORST HISS EVER, ugh.)The not-so-good:  These headphones also fall off your head the easiest of any headset I have ever had.  The part that goes over your ears is flat and doesn't cup your ears like, for example, Sony's headset does.  This means it will fall off your head and fall onto the floor far easier and potentially break.  This actually may be a fatal flaw and it is the reason I only gave them 3 stars.  I have young kids.  I am not always going to think to take them off before saving my toddler from some new mischief and these things fall off very easily if you aren't sitting completely still.  Barely tip your head forward?  They are gonna fall off.  If you have hard wood or tile floors, they are going to break after enough of this.If you like to do housework while you wear these headphones like I do, these might not be for you.  I'm not even sure if washing the dishes while wearing these is doable.  If the ear padding was shaped slightly differently, this product would be so much better.  The ear padding is also that soft and fragile foam that you only see nowadays on the cheapest earbuds.  Maybe they were going for something that would make your ears less warm than the leathery plastic ear padding Sony uses, but, in my experience, the leathery plastic works way better.

VSennheiser RS 120
p2931
sg5
VI bought this headset to listen to television while walking on our treadmill so I don't have to turn the volume of the TV up and make everyone in the house listen to my show.  I connected the supplied wires, installed the two supplied AAA rechargeable batteries, turned the earphones on and the sound began to play immediately without any channel changes or fine tuning.  The RCA style connectors are hardwired to the base with a 7 foot long cable, but Sennheiser supplies an RCA to 3.5 mm adapter and a 3.5 mm to 1/4 inch adapter.  Using the RCA connectors plus the mini jack plus the phono adapter would be a 5" long, rigid assembly.  I have not had any interference or hiss inside our standard bi-level house but the sound does start breaking up when I go outside.  This headset has an open earpiece that sits on the ears and is replacing an Auvio unit with closed earpieces that surrounded my ears.  One advantage to the open design is that you will be able to hear questions from other people and respond without removing the headset.  The pressure on my ears starts to become uncomfortable around the hour mark.  The sound is comparable to the speakers in my 42" Sony flat screen TV.  I suspect the headset would fall off anyone working on their hands and knees, but has not been a problem for my wife (petite head) or for me (larger head) while putting on shoes or walking upright.  The headset may be a little tight if you are a 250 pound man.  The charging/transmission base is 3 inches wide by 5 inches deep by 9 inches high.  The width increases to 8 inches when the headset is placed on the base.  The charging base is not especially stylish.  I bought the Sennheiser RS120 because it operates at 900 MHz.  Higher frequency units pick up static from my treadmill.  Placing the headset on the wire charging loops is not a problem.  The headset has a power switch, a volume control dial, and a fine tuning dial.  The fine tuning and volume dials are located close to each other.  If you can't remember to turn the top dial or don't have sufficient physical dexterity, you can accidently move the fine tuning dial and lose your sound.  I have never had that problem, but I suppose it could be a consideration.  The base does not have a power switch.  It turns itself off a couple minutes after the TV is turned off and turns on when the TV comes on.  I have never had the base turn off while watching TV or while I am searching for a recorded show from my DVD to watch.  The ear pieces drop down 1 1/2" on each side, pivot about 20 degrees around one axis only and are permanently rotated a little around the vertical axis to match the human head.  The rotation promotes comfort while increasing the tendency for the headset to slide off the head, especially while leaning forward.  The Sennheiser  does not control the sound from the TV, that is a function of the TV design.  For example, my Sony can be set to mute the TV when a headset is plugged it or leave the sound alone.

VHorrible experience--intermittent hiss, unforgiving static, mediocre range
p2937
sg5
VI was super excited for these, because I've heard nothing but good things about Sennheiser. I expected the audio quality to be top notch.Unfortunately, these headphones were a significant disappointment. I have since returned them.I will say that the audio WAS good--deep bass, full sound, etc--they felt like "studio" headphones.However, the overall experience was terrible, due to several factors:1. They have an awful "power saving" feature that forces the base (but not the headphones!) off, every five minutes. If you are watching a video and put it on pause, you had better remember to turn off the headphones, or you risk hurting your ears with the loud and obnoxious static that appears when the base is off.* Also, you had better make sure there is some audio playing BEFORE you turn the headset on, or you will be subjected to the same horrible static.2. There is an intermittent "hiss", as if it is cycling through frequencies and continually hitting a noisy range. No amount of channel switching or playing with the slider can get rid of this.3. The range is meager. Unlike the Logitech headset that I bought as a replacement, these have trouble reaching through a door. Depending on how I sit, the hissing can become worse.4. The headset was heavy, and a little too tight, making them uncomfortable to wear for long periods.5. They don't have separate microphone and headphone adapters, so it is impossible to use them with standard computer jacks without an additional purchase.I would strongly recommend against purchasing these headphones, unless these five issues are not important to you.* Seriously, who's great idea was it to turn the BASE off, but not the headphones? How does that even save power? There's no battery in the base! The battery's in the headphones! All this useless feature does is train you to constantly second-guess yourself, "Hm...should I turn them off, or will I have audio going in time? Better safe than sorry, I guess..." Ugh.

VWow, great headphones!  I had previously purchased a Bluetooth adapter and some less than spectacular headset so I could listen to my TV solo but the result was me back again looking for another solution.  I did a bit of research (ok, now I did a LOT more research) and I came across these headsets.  Seemed like it was everything I would need and then some.  Easy to work, easy to recharge, long range, no direct line of site needed and I could add multiple headphones if so desired.Out of the box they couldn't be easier to setup.  After an extremely impatient wait for the headphones to fully charge (I had to say that last part, do you think I really waited for them to charge?) I popped them on, tuned the dial and wallah, perfect sound!  The sound really is much better with the headphones.  I had read a review where someone said they would wear the headphones even if they didn't have to and I now understand why.  The stereo interaction, for someone who just has TV speakers, is amazing.  The sound is rich and full, it doesn't chop off highs or lows and there's no issue controlling the volume from a whisper to a roar (last solution's problem in a nutshell, only roar, no whisper).About the range.  No worries!  I'm halfway across my house and I'm still picking up static free sound. I'm not sure who has a living room so large that they need headsets with this kind of range but it has it.  99% of the time I'm within 20 feet of my TV but it's nice to know when I have to run for something on the other side of the house and I forget I'm wearing the headset I can still listen to commercials!Oh, and I love the charging stand.  Just drop them on and they're charging no plugs to hook up and no base that you have to wiggle them around to make proper contact (yes, I'm talking about you my Sony IR headphones!).Lastly, how they feel.  Extremely comfortable.  They have soft padding on the top and the ear cushions don't push my ears flat.  I can wear them all night and not even notice.  That being said, they're not exactly small.  (Don't look at yourself in the mirror unless you need a laugh!)  Neither my wife or I have had any issues wearing them except if she wants to lean the side of her head up against the couch.  But then again, not what they were designed for exactly.I love this headset, I use it all the time and would definitely recommend these to anyone who needs such a solution.

VI bought this model years ago and while I loved the sound, I moaned and groaned constantly because they wouldn't stay on my head.  I needed another pair for my boom box and after much research, I decided I'd buy these again because the sound is incredible for the price.  Once set up, I'd simply try to figure out the falling off problem.  Well, they have been in constant use since I set them up and I'm a happy camper.  It seems they have been tightened up so that they fit better plus I'm just more cautious now.When considering how long I owned the first pair and considering they fell off hundreds of times and one ear pad had to finally be taped back on, etc. these ear phones obviously held up really well. And I just couldn't part with the sound and to be fair I'm guessing most if not all other models would fall as well.  After all, they are not clamped on LOL and if they were imagine how that would feel after a while!  Plus, after all those years of use, I only had to replace the rechargeable batteries once!I had also ordered a new pair for the TV which I connected today.  So the old pair finally bit the dust but what a long ride it was even considering all those tumbles.  They just kept on keeping on.  I doubt they can be beat for the sound one gets for this price point.  So, then, I've gone from moaning and groaning to coming to terms with the one little short coming (which has been improved) and relish all the good qualities of these headphones.  In fact, since I need volume adjustment, I may end up getting a third set of this model for the computer.  Since they are wireless and self-charging, they have to be left plugged into whatever object they are plugged into.  Hence, I'll ultimately have a pair connected to any sound producing electrical object in the house!Highly recommend these for the sound quality.  I doubt one can get any better sound or quality at this price point.

p2955
sg5
VI\u2019ve used these for about 2 months in the office at my computer. I alternate between using them on my laptop and my Galaxy SII and have the same experience with both. The sound is pretty good, nothing spectacular. They are pretty comfortable, although somewhat heavy/ bulky compared to my Koss PortaPros (obviously). I love the wireless feature. Very easy to hang up at the end of the day for overnight charge. Never had them fail after 9 hrs of straight listening. UPDATE: This occurs only while plugged into my computer, not on my phone- They do have FREQUENT little sounds- pops, fizzes, some random faint white noises that you don\u2019t notice all the time during regular pop songs, but I listen to a lot of quiet music (classical) and you hear it a lot during the quiet parts. It\u2019s not a deal breaker, but it is noticeable. I\u2019ve learned to tune it out. I would still buy and use them because I think the convenience of wireless is a greater benefit (moving around my work space without worrying about a cord). One other negative is that when you\u2019re starting the music up, it can take the transmitter some time to detect and start the transmission, between 3 \u2013 20 seconds, about 5 seconds on average. If your computer/ phone is playing too quiet, you need to turn it up a little to get the transmitter to detect it (a little green light will show \u201con,\u201d which is very helpful).The Basics: plug into wall. Male RCA jacks come out of a ~3\u2019 cord which plug into the (supplied) Y-adapter male that takes you to a single 1/8\u201d (3.5mm) to plug into your phone or computer output/ headphone jack. Lift the headset off the charging stand, flip the button to \u201con,\u201d hit play on your device, wait 5 seconds, the transmitter will light up \u201con,\u201d and you\u2019ll hear your music/ movie. You can adjust the volume right on the headset. The first time, you\u2019ll need to try out the 3 settings on the front of the transmitter that take you to different frequencies to see what works best. You tune in on each of the settings with a small dial on the headphones like tuning a radio. You don\u2019t need to remove/ look at the headphones to turn them on/off or adjust the volume or tuner/ frequency, so it\u2019s pretty easy to use. Once it\u2019s set, you won\u2019t need to ever mess with the frequency. Basic day to day operation is just lift them off charger, put on head, turn on, and press play. When done, turn off and hang up.

VVery good TV headphones for the money (got them on a Christmas deal). I had a junk pair from the Sharper Image before, but these are 10 times better. I actually enjoy watching TV more with these on than without, as I pick up a lot of sounds I wouldn't hear otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, these are not studio quality headphones, but compared to built in TV speakers or junk you might buy for $30, these are very good. Great sound reproduction, decent bass and great stereo separation (music sounds very good!). I bought two sets, so I have to transmitters and two headphones, and changing a headphone to the other transmitter is a piece of cake. Just move the tuning wheel on the headphones to dial in the other transmitter. And the fact that they charge while on the base is really nice, and they turn off and on automatically with the TV (it senses the audio). Excellent range as well (I can roam around my house with no issues), and no static. Lastly, perfect audio timing, as there is no visible delay in the sound in my ears and the lip movement on the TV. Perfectly in sync. Very nice product.The only criticism I have is the fit. And it's a pro and a con. They are not super snug on the head (I think I have an average sized head). They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time while sitting on the couch. But if you move around too much or tilt your head to far forward or backward, I find they will slide around a bit and sometimes fall off if I'm not careful. I wonder how they would do taking a 6 foot drop to a wood floor from the top of my head if I was walking around. Let's not find out. But again, since they aren't super tight, they are nice to wear as they don't cause discomfort. They're snug, just not tight like the claw feel of some cheaper stuff out there.

VExplaination of problems and their possible fixes
p2966
sg5
VI have had this since 2007/8 and it works very well.  The first set had some problems and Sennheiser replaced the entire unit without any problem.  Second set has worked very well.  Sound quality is very good without any hissing noise.  Sound (voices and music) is better (easier to distinguish) than that from the TV itself.  In fact, I set the volume on the headphones to a lower level than what I would on the TV if I was not using the headphones.  I use it daily for at least three hours, often six or more.  I've replaced batteries once.  For those who have problems getting the headphones to recharge, just make sure the red charging light on the charging station lights up when placing the headphones on it.  Some complain that the charging station LED won't light up.  This is probably due to the headphone not being placed correctly on the charger. It is easy to set the headphones on the charger in the correct location to start charging.  It is very  important to note that the charger/transmitter won't send a signal to the headphones if the incoming volume to the charger/transmitter from the TV, etc., is not high enough for the unit to recognize/accept it.  I had the same situation until I increased the volume on my TV so the yellowish/white LED light came on.  This is the bottom light on the charger that is labeled Surround Sound Input Level. Set the TV volume high enough for the LED light to stay lighted without it flickering.  Of course, I mute the TV volume and then adjust the volume on my head set to that desired.  In my case, if I didn't mute the TV volume it would be too loud for anyone else to enjoy.  The top light on the charger is the on/off LED light.  It shows a green light when you turn on the headphones.  Yes, if the TV goes silent for over a couple of minutes there will either be no sound or some static.  Static is not very loud if one has not been listening to a program with overly high volume on the headphones.  Remember, this is an RF ear phone unit.  If radio frequency is lost, something must be done to reacquire it.  Wired headphones don't have this problem.  When the TV sound resumes, my headset beeps a couple of times and resumes good quality sound.  Read the instructions for what each set of beeps mean.  On very rare occasions (unknown what causes this), what I call a reset might be needed.  For instance, no sound at all - just unplug charger, remove batteries from headphones for several minutes (15 to 30) and then plug charger back in to power and replace batteries.  Sound returns.  This is some type of reset according to Sennheiser.  Also, if the signal is not coming in clear, one can press the button above the on-off button on the headset for several seconds to reset signal reception and the sound returns.  Yes, the head set can be somewhat loose.  If it was tighter, it would be unbearable to wear and hurt the ears, especially it you wear glasses as I do.  This set basically rests on the top of the head and not tight on the ears.  The ear pad foam has never deteriorated.  It is somewhat dirty but is still very useful.  I will replace the pads at some future time.  My ear pad does cover my ear and keeps out quite a bit of outside noise.  I can however, hear my wife talk to me as needed.  The set is not made to prevent all outside sounds from being heard.  As long as this set works well, I won't replace it.

p2971
sg5
VI got these because I wanted wireless headphones but didn't want to rely on Bluetooth.  I was wary of the loss of audio quality with Bluetooth, and for my office audio setup I have multiple sources going into a receiver, which does not stream Bluetooth.  Even though I never sit more than a few feet away from the transmitter/charging station I always hear a noticeable hiss when I have the headphones on, and as I move around I'll get little bursts of louder hiss.  I suspect this is caused by some electronic interference from all the other electronics in my office, or perhaps from another radio frequency user located nearby.  Switching channels does not mitigate this issue.  Hiss not withstanding, the sound is pretty good and has a nice dynamic range.  The biggest issue, which is a deal-breaker for me, is that if you pause your audio source for more than three minutes or so the headphones will suddenly erupt in static noise, which can be quite startling.  In the user manual this seems to be described as a feature: "If the headphone output volume is set too low, the transmitter automatically switches off".  This would be okay if it meant the headphones went silent.  I often need to pause my music playback momentarily, and I work with sparse audio sources on my computers, so this is a constant issue.  I have to remember to turn the headphones off before I let them go silent for too long.  I can't imagine how this design flaw made it through Sennheiser's quality control.  If these headphones had not been a gift, I would have returned them.  For now I'm looking into Bluetooth transmitters for my receiver, and hoping that someone will invent Apple Airplay-enabled headphones...Pro's:Good build qualityComfortableCharging station is convenient and functionalGood sound compared to BluetoothCon's:Easily affected by radio interference, often resulting in noticeable hissExtremely loud static noise when audio source goes silent for too long.

VAs a new owner I have had only a few hours enjoying these headphones. First I will give you my pro list followed by my con list and finish with my overall opinion.Pros: The range of these is great I have walked all over my house and yard without going out of range, only a couple of times did I get any hiss or static.I have not ran out of battery power yet and I am not using the charger other then to fully charge them once. So far I have used them over 5 hrs no sign of running out of power at all.Sound is good not great but decent.I would recommend to a friend without any reservationsCons: These fall off your head very easily, if you use these in your yard and bend down they will fall off.The charger does't allow you to turn off the charging mode so you have to put them down unless you wish to create a memory problem with the rechargeable batteries.Sound doesn't have the bass that I have read often in the reviews. An average ear bud has a lot more bass then these. My old AKG's have better sound overall and they are over 25 yrs old.Charge light does not go off or change to let you know they are chargedI really would love it if they put a switch on the cradle so you don't always charge when you don't wan't to.Overall: Good product for the money as I have had a wireless headphones before which seemed very good but had so much noise that I couldn't stand them. TThese have no problems with the transmitter at all. The range is great and the overall sound is good enough for most people.Don't get me wrong about the bass it's there, just not as prominent as I expected. I love deep bass so for me it's slightly low.One more item is Amazon has this exact pair of headphones for two different prices with over a hundred dollar difference so beware.

VWe have owned this wireless headset system for nearly five years.  I am not an audiophile but the sound they produce is really nice.  Even with a TV that is plenty loud, I still use these headphones because you can pick up many sounds that you don't hear from your TV speakers, like footsteps or a creaking wooden staircase in a movie scene.  They are comfortable with easy to adjust volume and tuning controls.  The cradle looks stylish and acts as a charging station when the headphones are not in use (and also acts as the transmitter when they are in use).  The headphones work even through walls, but not that far.  Maybe 30 feet before you start to notice a degradation of sound quality.  It is good enough to be cooking in the kitchen, bbq on the patio or work in the garage without much interference.  The batteries are your typical rechargeable AA batteries that can be found in most big box or electronics stores and are easily accessible when it is time to change them.  In nearly five years, we are still using the original rechargeables.  We liked this system so much we bought another early on, so we have two sets of the headphones and two transmitters/charging stations.  Each transmitter allows you to choose one of three frequencies.  This allows both my wife and I to watch two different programs (on two different TVs) or if we want to watch the same thing, we can tune the headphones to pick up the other frequency, which allows a great deal of flexibility for TV watching.  If I could change one thing about them, I would change the auto-shutoff feature.  This feature automatically shuts down the transmitter after a few minutes of inactivity.  This is normally a good idea, but I sometimes fall asleep watching Netflix, so when the show ends and the transmitter shuts off, I am left with static in the headphones which always wakes me up.  Aside from that little oddity, this system is great.  I couldn't imagine our entertainment system without these headphones!

VI got these from my 4-yr-old as a father's day present a few years back. I thought they were the best father's day present possible, so I bought some for my mom for *mother's* day so she could give them to my dad. My mom never stopped thanking me because now she isn't being blasted out of the room when my hard-of-hearing father is watching TV. Another set was purchased for an uncle for his birthday. We liked them that much.They aren't full-isolation high-def headphones, nor are they supposed to be. I use them to put a low level of TV sound right next to my ear. The sound level is high enough such that I can focus on the dialogue instead of background noise, but low enough such that I can still hear when someone is talking to me. These headphones are more than perfect for this purpose.Problems reported by others: - Keep slipping off head: This one is true, IF you are trying to wear them while doing other things. So these aren't good headphones if your intent is to listen to music while doing chores or going outside. The fit is loose and they fall off when you bend over. But if your goal is to sit and watch TV they are perfect. - Tuning wheel is too close to the volume wheel: This is also true, but solvable. After I kept hitting the tuning wheel when trying to adjust the volume I put a little piece of black electrical tape over it. It is questionable as to why, exactly, it even has an exposed tuning wheel. It should be either pre-tuned or else the adjustment should be out of the way. In the battery compartment, for example. - Audible Hiss: Sort-of. Again, I keep the volume really low, so I don't really notice the hiss. But these aren't supposed to be studio-quality, and they are wireless. - Auto turn-off is useless: I agree. The auto-turnoff does turn off the transmitter (which is plugged into the wall), but the headphones (powered by battery) are left on and blaring a loud hiss. This is pointless. The headphones should be what turn off to save battery life.So all-in-all a great purchase. If I had reviewed this back when I bought it I would have given 5 stars. But not now. About a year ago, the volume wheel started messing up on mine. When turning the wheel in one direction the volume would shoot up, cut out completely in the left ear, go to static, and come back on. At my preferred low listening level the left ear was silent. Both ears worked at a much louder level, so I took to wearing them with the phones back off my ear slightly to attenuate the loudness. It was a hassle to minutely turn the wheel to get it set even to those levels. But I'd had it for a few years by this point, and I didn't use them all the time, so I just dealt with ti.And then my mom called to say the ones they have stopped working altogether. My dad sets the TV volume to "earthquake", so she desperately wants a new set.Today I was looking at getting a replacement set of phones (the transmitter is still good), only to discover a) the price has nearly doubled to $100, and b) the cost of a replacement set of headphones is exactly the same as a new starter set (headphones and transmitter). I guess the transmitter is free??At this point I see no use in getting replacement headphones when the complete set is the same price. And if I'm getting a complete new set, I see no reason to stick with this brand and model. Two examples of this model didn't last very long, so maybe I'll give another manufacturer a shot. As for this pair, they functioned for a while and are still semi-functional. And while they worked they were quite excellent. So 3 stars for functionality, but $100 headphones should not break in such a short amount of time. So 2 stars.

VThis is actually the second RS120 wireless headphone set that I bought from amazon.  The first one was 3 years ago and it is still working flawlessly. In fact, I loved the first set so much that I ended up buying a second headphone to use with the base. I bought this second set to use for my bedroom TV.  So now I have 2 bases and 3 headphones.  What I love about this set-up is that each person in my house can wear a headphone and then simply adjust the tune dial on the side to choose to listen to the living room TV or the bedroom TV.  You can use both at the same time without interference by just making sure your bases are on separate channels.After using the RS120 for 3 years, I have no complaints about the function at all.  The headphones have great range. I can be in the basement - or any other room of the house - and not lose any signal.  I can go outside on the deck or driveway and still hear the TV inside.  Once in a while walking outside or from room to room you may hear a small bit of static as you move about. Usually if I hit a dead spot with static, all I have to do is move ever so slightly and get full signal again.  In other words, the dead spots are so small it is very easy to avoid them. In fact, you have to try very hard to find a bad spot and stay in the exact place where your signal is dead. This, of course, is putting it to a very hard test because most people will use them sitting on a couch or chair in the same room as the TV and none of this will be a factor at all anyway.The only thing I would change if I could about this set is that the headphones are rather large and a bit heavy.  I'm sure this is due to the batteries and wireless receiver they have to put inside the headphones, but perhaps the newer updated models have a lighter, smaller feel to them.  But the weight is definately not enough of an issue to keep anyone I've showed them too from wearing them and enjoying how great they sound.  They really enhance my TV viewing and allow you to hear much of the subtle audio and background music much more clear.  I really don't watch my TV (especially movies) without them anymore.One last note... the batteries that come with these headphones have been amazing so far.  After 3 years, they are still going strong.  They hold a charge for at least 4 hours of continuous use. I can't exactly tell you how long it takes to fully charge them, because I just store them on the charging base when I'm not using them anyway.  If you do this, they will always be ready to go when you want to use them.  I have never had them die on me while using them unless I had left them off the base for a couple days and did not charge them between use.

VThis is actually the second set I bought so you know I like the product. I wanted something for my TV, because I was having trouble distinguishing conversation from background sounds. This helped a lot, enhances the sound (even if you aren't having a problem), plus you can turn off or mute the sound from the TV (although neither is necessary). It works great with and comes with all the necessary plugs for the TV, radio, stereo or computer.It has a very clear and excellent sound although for serious music buffs, I would think a more expensive headphone would be a better option. It has a wider range (100') than the usual 30' that many headphones advertised. It worked great as I walked around my condo - no static or interference.I personally have no issue with the fabric covering on the earpiece and have worn them for several hours without a problem. I do however slip them off when a commercial comes on to "mute" the sound, but you can just switch them of as well.There have been a couple of negative comments on the fit and yes there is a small issue with that, but the head band is designed to sit further back on the head than normal (look at the headphones from the side). Properly placing them on the head and adjusting the extension on either side fixed most issues I had with the fit.I bought the second set because my partner wanted a set of headphones as well. You can buy the headphones separately without the transmitter/ charger but it seemed silly for the little cost difference because you would need to keep switching the headphones to keep them charged. Then I found a bonus - with two transmitters two people can listen to two different audio sources at the same time by using two different channels (switch on front of transmitter) and, if necessary, adjusting the tune wheel on the headphone. The volume on each headphone can be adjusted independently to your personal preference. These are not noise cancelling headphones so you can hear the phone ring or talk to the person next to you in a normal voice even if both are wearing headphones. You can only hear sound coming from the headphone if you are wearing them or if the volume is turned way up.A negative - volume and tune controls are too close together but that is a very small issue. For the price this is a great set of headphones.

VMediocre Performance
p3005
sg5
VOther reviewers have cited my own annoyances with these RF headphones:1) Static - Short bursts of static at irregular intervals, roughly once every minute or two, just barely too long to be considered a "click." These pops are annoying as heck when listening to music, but less so when watching TV where the storyline and action soundtrack are distraction enough that I don't notice the pops.2) Loose headband - The loose headband makes them really comfortable, but only when sitting or standing upright. Be ready to hold them onto your head if you have to over to pick up a dropped remote control.3) Auto power-off - This is really annoying if I have to pause a movie for a couple minutes and leave the headset on, because after a couple minutes the base unit will auto-off and the headphones will start blaring static into my ears. Why on earth does the AC-powered base unit auto-off an not the battery powered headphones?4) Distortion - Even when run from a line-level output, the low end distorts if you turn them up. They're nice and clear at normal listening volume but if you crank them up, they'll break up.5) Annoying low frequency gating - If your listening source contains percussive low frequencies, i.e. explosions, crashes, pumping bass, etc., these phones will attempt to mask their abysmal low frequency performance by automatically cutting the output volume when those sounds are present, resulting in a sound that subtlety phases in and out. This is most annoying when listening to music, but easy to ignore when watching TV.Still, considering that top-of-the line wireless headphones are running $400+, maybe these are reasonable compromises. I do really enjoy listening to movies through these headphones, they have a much longer range and will get quite a bit louder than my Bluetooth headphones and, for my non-Bluetooth equipment (TV/Stereo), RF phones are my only choice. Since I don't know that I'd get better performance from anything else in this price range, I'll keep them for TV watching, and use my better-sounding Bluetooth headphones for listening to music on my computer and mobile devices.

VI like these headphones: in most respects they are a step above my previous Phillips brand: the easy charging system, great sound, long long range.I like the way they sound - music is great with them. They also get plenty loud enough for me (office environment).The charger is awesome - I just place them on the cradle overnight every few days, and they are always charged. I think I have run them down once. And if they die, I can throw in a couple of AAAs to get through the rest of the day. The battery life is way better than my old set.The range on this is at least twice my old pair. I can walk all over our office with them and still hear.There are a couple of things I don't like about them tho:1) They aren't as comfortable as the Phillips. My head is on the larger size, and I wear glasses, so YMMV. But they can hurt if I wear them all day. I guess I don't like On Ear headphones.2) If I look down, they tend to fall off my head. Since I use them at work where I'm pretty much always looking straight ahead at a computer screen this isn't a big deal for me, but they have come off a few times when I bend over to pick something up.3) The tuning dial is in a terrible location. I accidentally bump it a lot. It is right next to the volume control, and is just as exposed. I can easily bump it when I'm picking the headphones up, which lowers the volume and sound quality (if it even still works).Overall, I'm pleased with them, but I have to deduct stars for the tuning dial placement (Hello Sennheiser! Move it or cover it or something.) and for the issues I have with the fit.If they made these in an over the ear configuration and fixed the tuning dial, they'd be pretty close to perfect.

VThis is the third brand of headphones I have purchased in rapid succession. I was on a mission. I am in an apartment for the first time in over 20 years. It is not a great experience. The people upstairs live their lives out loud. Boots, 50 lb. dog, and a new baby. I needed relief. I needed to be able to enjoy my media and music, I just plain needed to block the madness out! This Sennheiser set is the best for my price range.First of all there is not a big variety of this product. The specifics that I was looking for was quality of sound, able to walk around and not have interruption in reception. I a single woman, reasonably intelligent, electronics is not my forte.However, if I have decent instructions, I have found I can do just about everything. Some days you get tired of doing just about everything.Sony is easy to plug in and work. Vizio TV (had to purchase in KS) sets up a complication with only an audio/optical plug in. They were easy to use, great reception, quality, Heavy as can be and may neck was killing me in 5 days. Next TV Ears. Suggestion of a friend. The ear buds are hard and my ears were killing me in less than 48 hours.I did not use them more than 6 hours in that time span. They are not soft, they are hard. I needed a work around if I wanted to not hear my tv in the background of everything. I have TV, Roku, Blu Ray DVD, and computer all going through my tv with cable. Frustrated, even bought an audio out box, but was too tired to tackle it. Woke up and said isn't there a headphone that qualifies here that I can just plug in? With another day of research - I found Sennheiser. They include a plug that makes the set compatible with RCA optical/audio out. Their work around is an easy to use double ended plug. Yeah! The volume is touchy, the quality is good, not as good as Sony. They are lighter. More money might make a difference here. Weight, controls, the easy out of the box installation less than 5 minutes, and of course quality of sound are deal breakers.

VGood headphones but not 5 stars
p3021
sg5
VThe good:The sound quality is excellent, especially when close to the transmitter.  Plenty of bass response.Charging them up is super easy, just toss them on the the cradle.  Sometimes I need to move them around a bit until they start charging but usually it's not too much fuss.  I've never once run down the batteries even after hours and hours of use.  And this is with the El Cheapo NiMH batteries they give you.  Put some Sanyo Eneloops in there and I'm sure you could use them all day long on a single charge.The range is truly impressive as far as wireless headphones go.  I have 6 acres to mow and I can pick up a signal a surprisingly good distance away from the house.  Getting a bit more height on the transmitter would help.  It would be better if they had a jack for an external antenna rather than having to toss the entire transmitter up in the attic.  I like that these are analog;  I'd rather deal with a lot of static than have them completely cut out with low signal like digital ones would.The bad:I am now on my second set.  The tuner on my first set went bad after I wore them outside in a _very_ light sprinkling rain.  After that I could tune them in but every few seconds I'd get static as if the frequency was drifting.  Buying a replacement set of headphones (receiver only) wasn't much cheaper than the entire kit.  You can call me an idiot for not using them in a perfectly dry environment (and you're probably right), but I still think they should have held up a bit better than that.The automatic gain control on these is terribly annoying.  During quiet passages the headphones will boost the gain and you hear HISSSSSS.  Likewise, loud volume input gets automatically quieted.They are comfortable at first but after several hours the on-ear design causes my ears to get a bit sore.  I definitely would not want to wear these for 8 hours straight.  The head band is comfortable enough though.If you're doing some yard work which requires bending down, like digging a grave or picking up cow droppings, the headphones have a tendency to slip right off your head.  Without even realizing it, over time I learned to walk around perfectly erect like Joe Friday.  Needless to say, this slows down the work.  I wouldn't even think about using them for exercise.  You could try wearing a baseball cap _over_ the headphones if you want to attempt it.I looked everywhere for a set of compatible speakers to go with this transmitter.  I didn't want to have to deal with 2 different devices hooked up to my audio source at all times or switching back and forth.  Having a set of speakers in the bathroom would be handy for catching the morning news.  Unfortunately, I never did find any.  I did not try calling Sennheiser as it wasn't _that_ important.  (If anyone knows of an inexpensive compatible set please leave a comment here.)I have since stopped using these headphones altogether.  Here's a better setup:For about the same cost, you can get a0.5 W Fail-Safe Long Range FM Transmitterwhich will go _much_ farther.  Use an inexpensive set of FM headphones for the receiver.  And for mowing/trimming, use a 5 dollar pocket radio and earbuds underneath shooting earmuffs.  That makes way more sense hearing-wise than cranking the Sennheiser headphones up loud enough to overcome mower noise.  Best of all, that setup works with the radio you might already have in your kitchen/bathroom/etc.

VThey work just fine but I still have questions
p3027
sg5
VFirst of all let me start by saying I know very little about electronics and how to hook things up. After having these in the box for a couple of weeks and several unsuccessful attempts at installation a friend finally helped me out. He did manage to get them working. Keep in mind I have never used wireless ear phones before just top quality ear bubs. I use these in my 38' 5th wheel trailer. The flat screen HD TV is mounted on an adjustable base in a cabinet. It's hooked up to a Harmon Kardon surround system. The base for the ear phones is in the cabinet behind the TV which doesn't seen to interfere with it's reception.Here is my short review.THE PRO'S:  I have NO hiss whatsoever. The sound is clear. The mids and high range are very good. The charging unit is very easy to use and seems to be doing a great job. They are comfortable to wear and don't make my ears hot. My wife can sleep with no TV noise coming from the living room. (BIG BONUS).THE CON'S: You do pick up back ground noise such as the portable heater fan working in the background. They fit loose and tend to come off easy. The piece of foam that sits on top of your head could be thicker and more comfortable. I don't find them all that light weight but I wouldn't consider them heavy either. In my opinion the base sound is week and could be stronger.MY QUESTION:The phones work fine except when I switch the TV to surround sound. Then the signal gets jumbled, the sound then becomes fractured. For a couple of seconds it's fantastic but then breaks up. If I take it off surround the phones are very clear but lack the depth of the surround sound. If these worked with my surround sound I would be over the moon. Any helpful comments on this would be welcomed.

VI bought these so I could listen to the TV in our bedroom while my wife was sleeping.  So out of the box, I couldn't get them to work and the meager instructions that come with them are near useless.  I kept fiddling with the tuning and did get to hear some neighbor phone calls, but not my TV.  Fortunately, there is a fair amount of technical information in these reviews so I learned that I had to crank the sound up on the TV really high and they would work better.  Indeed, this helped tremendously.  I could now hear the TV sound with only an occasional crackle of static.  But the problem of maintaining the connection persisted.  Every 5-10 minutes the connection would drop.  This required me to turn down the TV sound, get up and pull the headphone jack out, plug it back in, and then crank up the sound again.  Not very convenient.  Also, I had to be sure to turn down the TV sound and unplug the headphones before I went to sleep or my wife would blast her ears off when she turned on the set in the morning.  Another peeve: the connectors have red and black RCA plugs and the instructions say to be sure to connect the red plug to the red output from your TV.  Wrong!  The red goes to the white and the black goes to the red.  Some past reviews have complained that a stereo plug is not included but my set had one.  One other item: the headphones would not sit correctly and charge when I initially put them on the cradle.  I spread the cradle a bit and that fixed it.I'm trying to decide whether to keep them or not.  Maybe some more fiddling will improve the dropped connection problem.  Does anyone out there have a solution?UPDATE (3/22/13)  Procrastination led to me keeping the headphones. Too lazy to remember to send them back.  So I tried them again and they seemed much better.  They stopped dropping the connection.  I found that I had to sit up higher in bed for them to work well.  If I slouched down close to a sleeping position, the connection was dropped.  If I sat up it was good.  There is still an occasional crackle of static but other than that they did the job.  I still have to crank the TV to maximum volume for the headphones to work well, with the associated problems that creates.  But I can now watch TV late at night while my wife sleeps.  I'm still having some problems getting them to sit correctly on the cradle so that they charge.  Also, a comment I forgot last time is that the ear cups are pretty cheap -- actually there are no cups, just a flat cloth covered surface.  Not particularly comfortable.  I'd now give the headphones 3 stars -- they work but they are far from perfect.

VPoor Reception
p3038
sg5
VThese headphones use a wireless transmitter and have rechargeable batteries.  The batteries are charged by placing the headphones on a cradle that is attached to the AC power supply. I installed the headphones according to instructions and let the rechargeable batteries charge overnight. Prior to purchasing these headphones, I had always used hard-wired headphones to listen to music. I have had very good experiences with other Sennheiser-brand hard-wired headphones and so I purchased this wireless set based on my previous positive experiences with the Sennheiser brand.For me, these wireless headphones performed very poorly.  The primary problem was poor reception that manifested itself as a loud hiss would come and go as my head changed orientation while wearing the headphones. The unit is equipped with a tuning dial that I was able use to the tune signal in clearly - but by simply turning my head or moving a short distance around my living room, the loud hiss would reappear and completely wipe out the audio.  For these tests, the stereo, the headphone transmitter and the headphones were all located in the same room. The kind of hiss I am describing is similar to the kind of hiss I have experienced while listening to an FM radio station on my car radio as I was driving through the mountains of upstate New York, right at the edge of the station's range.  Even under the best situation, where I got the headphone signal tuned in clearly, there was still a slight hiss in the background that was always present when listening to music on the headphones.  I have gotten accustomed to the perfect sound reproduction of a hard-wired set of Sennheiser headphones that has no hiss at all. For me, these headphones did not work out and I returned them.

VGreat Wireless Headset
p3044
sg5
VI'll try to keep this simple and to the point.I was looking to replace an old Audio Logic wireless headset, mostly because there was zero bass response, otherwise they worked fine.So I receive these, connected them to my receiver and started watching some movies (Inception, Dark Knight).Overall sound is very crisp and clear, there is no lisp or hissing on spoken words. Bass is not up to par with other wired headsets, it is light but you can notice it. The bass is pleasant enough. You should note that you cannot adjust bass through headset, so you better make sure you have a receiver that can adjust bass, or some other form to adjust it, otherwise you're stuck with whatever comes through the source.These are very comfortable and fit me snug. I honestly can't say I agree with other users complaining about their headsets falling off, you must have EXTREMELY TINY heads. The headset is adjustable and has comfortable padding. For me personally, the lack of cuffs on the ear pads is good because I have never had any success with ear cuffs NOT making your ears hurt after an extended period of use.A couple of flaws might be intermittent periods of silence and hissing (hissing part is very, very rare as long as you tune to the best reception). What you should always do with any headset is make sure the volume on the source (in my case, receiver) is set all the way up. If you don't do this, your headset is stuck with a very low incoming volume and instead has to compensate for it, resulting in hissing/static.I used these to watch the Breaking Bad Season 5 mid-finale, and I noticed during some conversations where you can only hear crickets in the audio stream, the headset sort of "shuts off" in a manner of speaking, you lose audio but immediately gain it back whenever the volume picks up, or someone speaks, you DO NOT lose any audio in the stream, it simply goes silent during very silent periods.People complain about the tuning and volume knob being close together, but it's all about muscle memory with this. It will take you no less than a day, or a couple of uses to know where each knob is. No complaints here.I give this 5 stars for the price, quality and convenience.

VI bought this headphones as a gift for my father so he can listen freely while moving around the house. Before giving it to him, i decided to try it in my house first. Plus, I new that they have to be charged for 24 hours (or 12 hours, I can't remember) before the first use, so I figured it will be better to give it as a gift when they are ready to go!First, I was very very disappointed. No matter what I did, I heard loud static noise, which was very periodic, and sounded like knocking (~ 60 knocks/sec). I tried all three channels on the base, I turned off my PC, router, every possible source of noise. I went to the basement, connected it to PC...and noise was still there. It was unbearable. Then, I realized that it could be the baby monitor. I have a child and the base of the monitor is always turned ON and it turned out that it always transmits, no matter whether the monitor itself is ON. The moment I turned off the base, the noise was gone and the sound in headphones was loud and clear. For me, this headphones would not work. I need the baby monitor. I cannot unplug it to listen to the music. However, if I did not use it, the headphones were great!I gave it to my father, and I was glad to learn that neither his house, nor his neighbors, have a noise source that interfere with his headphones. He is extremely happy. He wears them for many hours every day, around his apartment, lays down on the couch, cook with them, you name it. Today, he went to the gym in his building, which is 2 stores down from him (but right under), and could hear very well (even while traveling in the elevator). Even though he claims that he does not hear any static, it is possible that due to his hearing, he may not pick up all the noise..but who knows...The bottom line - it could be a waist of money if you have a wireless device in your home that just happen to work on the same frequency as the headphone (in my case it was a particular model of the baby monitor), or it can be a treasure, and let you truly disconnect and go around and enjoy you music, even outside of your apartment in the gym, like in the case of my father, all noise free! You have to give it a try and see.

VI have owned these now for almost two years and they are still working well.  They get daily use of 2 hours on average and show no signs of wear.  I have used them upwards of 6 hours straight without issue.Hiss: Incorrectly tuned on my part.  After some fine tuning, I have no more Hiss.Distance:  Still Great.Comfort: Better.  Either the ear pads have soften from use or my ears now have calluses. :-)Clipping:  The clipping happens after several minutes of no audio connection.  Example is if I turn off the TV and leave the headphones on.  Still I am aware this will happen and adjust for it.  **IMPORTANT** It Does Not Do This While Watching TV/DVD/Streaming.  ONLY if NO Audio is Played for Several Minutes.***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***I read many of the positive and negative reviews before purchasing this product and wanted to address some of the negatives.  I've based my review knowing I purchased an entry to mid level product (on sale) and not the most expensive available.  I use these primarily for TV/DVD/Streaming.Hiss:  There is a hiss when no sound is being supplied to the headphones, but I find it is only during long silences between the primary show and commercials or during the blocked commercials while streaming.  It is not loud and I expected it from the reviews.  It is an acceptable and non-obtrusive hiss.Distance:  I have no troubles walking anywhere in my house (two stories) and find no diminishing of the quality of sound.Comfort:  They are comfortable and light weight.  I do find after an hour or more you can feel them against your ears more and it can be slightly distracting.  However, considering the convience of being able to watch a movie loudly without disturbing the household, it is a small price to pay.Clipping:  I haven't tried to determine why they do this, but at some point it does occasionally make a clipping noise.  It is slightly annoying, but not so loud as to injure.  IMPORTANT- it doesn't do this during the show.  Only during dead space.Base:  Easy to set up and easy to use.  No problems.This is all I currently have.  I have only had these for two weeks, but use them regularly.  I would recommend purchasing one at the reduced price.  Don't know if I would pay retail for them. I am considering a second one.Hope this helps.

VI had been looking for a wireless alternative to my speakers connected to my pc, to avoid wasting my time wearing it on and off every time I give a break. I decided on wireless headphones over bluetooth earphones for comfort, durability and higher sound quality. I preferred this particular model over the advanced ones (RS130-170); because there is a HUGE price gap inbetween ($50 to over $150). Here are my reflections on RS120:PROS-Sound quality: Sound is crisp and powerful, it is more than enough to satisfy your needs for everyday use.-Battery life: I have not tested it thoroughly; but I was never out of battery after 5-6 hours of use.-Charger/Transmitter: This is one of the aspects that I admired in this model. Transmitter acts as a charger, it makes your life A LOT easier when you wear on and off your headphones.-Design: It looks really elegant on your table if you have black/grey color scheme in your PC setup.-Comfort: I had 'barely noticeable' pain in my ears after hours of usage; but it is barely noticeable and not bothering me at all.-Price: In 50 bucks range, price is unbeatable for what you get.CONS-Hissing: I had to play really carefully with transmission channel settings to get a sound with tolerable interference. Still, there is a hissing in the background that you can notice when the volume is low. It is not intolerable, but it DOES exist as other reviewers also point out. I'm not sure if this is still an issue in more expensive models which use 2.4Ghz transmission.-Range: In fact, the range is pretty good, I could even walk to my mailbox and still get the signal, but the quality with range decreases REALLY FAST. If you're intending to use it >10ft range you may be disappointed. I'm using it in my living room; hence this is not bothering me at all. Again, you may want to check out the range/sound quality trade-off in the expensive models if you're intending to go for something better.-Auto turn-off: I've found this feature really annoying. If the transmitter keeps silent for 1-2 minutes it turns off, and you instantly hear a loud, annoying noise that can make you jump off your chair if you're at the max volume.-Wall interference: The interference increases significantly when I switch rooms. If you're intending to use the headphones in a different room than the transmitter you may again be disappointed.OVERALLThese speakers are worth the $50 you pay for. For everyday use it does its job and gives you the wireless freedom you need. However, interference can be annoying sometimes particularly in range and across the rooms. I recommend these headphones if you are planning to use it not-too-far-away from the transmitter. 4 out of 5 stars.

VI bought the Sennheiser RS120 headphones about a year ago for our main TV.  We liked them so much, we bought another set for the kitchen TV, and then we bought a third set for our TV in the exercise room in the basement.  We have three sets of headphones, and each headphone can tune to any one of the TV's.  I love it in the kitchen, because even if I am doing something noisy like frying or sauteeing, I can still hear the TV.  Also, since our kitchen and living room are nearby, we can use the headphones and not worry about sound transferring into the other room.We bought a cradle and an extra set of headphones for my inlaws about six months ago -- my father-in-law is hard of hearing, and they absolutely love them.  My father, who is nearly deaf, is visiting me now, and he tried a headset with his hearing aids on, and he says he can hear the TV quite well, so I am now going to order one for him.I have not noticed any hiss -- I can walk to several different rooms in the house and still hear the TV.  I can even go outside and grill.The only thing you have to be careful about is the hookups to your audio source.  Some TV's do not come with audio-out (analog) RCA plugs -- these are the red/black or white/black plugs on the back.  If you have only an optical-out (digital) plug, you have to buy a digital-to-analog converter and a toslink cable, and the converter is expensive.TV's also work differently with regard to the audio-out.  Some TV's will mute the audio-out when you mute the TV -- if you want to mute the speakers without muting the headphones, you have to go into the audio menu to do it.  The best setup is a TV that will mute the speakers without muting the audio-out connection.Anyway, I highly recommend these headphones for this kind of use.

VI have been through two pairs of wired Sennheiser headphones.  I have a pair of EH150s that I absolutely love, except for the cord.  So when I wanted wireless headphones, I immediately looked at Sennheisers.  I use these exclusively for TV and video games.  I don't listen to music with them.  I'm also not moving around a whole lot.  For me, the point of these is to play video games and watch TV at night and not have a wire running from the TV to the couch.  And for that, they do the job perfectly for the price.As other reviewers have mentioned, the base station automatically detects when there is and isn't a signal and turns on and off accordingly.  Some people have said that the signal randomly cuts out during when what they're listening to is very quiet.  I have not had any issues with this for video games, even in very quiet parts of the game.  The auto-turnoff time with no signal is 3 minutes, which is very reasonable.  So I suppose if you're watching TV and you mute it during a really long commercial break, then yes, the headphones will turn off.  "Don't do that."Other people have mentioned hiss.  This was a problem for me when I initially set up the headphones, but it's easy to work around.  First, play with the tuning knob on the headphones until the signal is at its clearest.  Then, mute whatever you're listening to, and slowly turn down the volume on the headphones until you can no longer (or just barely) hear a hiss.  Then unmute your source, and turn its volume up until it's at the level you want.  Problem solved, no more miss.  I think people who complain about the hiss are turning the volume on the headphones way up instead of turning up whatever is plugged in to the headphones.There are two things prevent me from giving it 5 stars:- the connectors are RCA.  They include an RCA-> 1/8" stereo adapter, and a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter, which is great, but is rather bulky sticking out of my receiver.  I'd rather have a 1/4" plug, and adapters for 1/8" and RCA.- the headphones are not as comfortable as I'd like.  Don't get me wrong, they're great for what they are, but compared to me Sennheiser EH150, they're noticeably less comfortable.  I can wear the EH150s for hours and not feel like I have anything on my head at all.  It's not the weight or bulk of the wireless headphones, it's that the earpieces and covering fit less well and are less comfortable.  (And the EH150s were $20 headphones, so it's not like they were luxury items or anything)Overall though, for the price, they're great and the best choice among similar brands in this price point.

VMy Accurate Review
p3079
sg5
VJust got these yesterday. Read instructions, put batteries in and let it charge for the full 24hrs before I used it.The good on power:I have had no issues with charging so if any review complaining of that is experiencing this later in the product ownership there is nothing actually preventing you from charging it. Yes if you move it a little off etc it stops charging but if you just sit it on and leave it there with the charging confirmation LED you are fine. It works as intended and is very convenient. Also a plus is the ac adapter which apparently is designed to consume less power than needed.The bad on power: It said in the instructions you must charge the batteries for 18hrs subsequently after use. I have no idea why they say this or if it's even true but this was misleading to me. I only throw it on the charger when i'm done with it and use it when I need to. As for battery length I have been using it for almost 8hrs straight so far with no problems I will update how long it takes until it dies out following the 24hr initial charge cycle. It sucks that there is no option to charge a separate set of batteries while you are using the headset off the charger because once they die, what then? It's a wise investment to get the best/right battery upgrade with independent charger. Make sure you never use anything except rechargeable tripe a's as per the instructions.The good on comfort/design: This set seems sturdy and has a very acceptable build quality. They are more aesthetically pleasing than the other models in my opinion. They are also very comfortable which is great for extended use.The bad on comfort/design: The trade off for comfort is that these do not clam onto your head at All. They are built "wide" and are just really bad at staying fit. Any jarring or thrusts in any direction, especially if you have a head of hair will uncomfortably shift them forward and back off your head. This was very inconvenient and also prevents using the wireless benefits in a lot of situations such as on a tread mill where you would need it to hang on. This was a loss in star alone. I understand it's a trade off but I would have settled for a more snug fit and sweaty ears then such a loose fit. Some may have a fatter head to put it bluntly and not experience this as much or come to appreciate the design in that case but I have a nice size normal head and it was just not good enough. Others have commented on this.More: The biggest fail on the design that equaled another star for me is how amazingly loud the open ear design is. It was the very first thing I noticed. If you blast these or literally have them on any sound level they are COMPLETELY audible to anyone in around you or in passing distance! This is terrible to me. Even the cheapest pair of headphones can contain the sound to a personal distance. I do not see the purpose either. It's not like you can hear anyone with them on a fair volume level anyway, so why not make them like enclosed cans? This is just unacceptable to me.The good on reception: I have went a pretty far about 150ft on the 1st floor with the transmitter on the 2nd and have had great clarity with these. I enjoyed that a lot. I always get it in the middle of the "beginning and end" of the loud part of the tuning knob and that works best.The bad on reception: This was another star off. The reception can be very finicky. What I seem to experience is the further I am away from the transmitter the Better it is! I cannot explain this. There is absolutely no interference as I turned off everything except the WiFi (which could be the issue) and you would think being closer would be better but I guess it's like a WiFi network where too close is bad. I am within 5-8ft of it and cannot make it farther because the cabling provided will not allow for that. I am just really disappointed with the clarity. I mean the slightest shift in movement or turning your head is accompanied by distortion and crackling or static. Mainly static. I have tried every one of the 3 channels to no avail. I find myself having to find a spot and staying fairly still.The reviewers claiming a hissing are absolutely correct. I have the audio sources on max and the headphones on medium and when a track comes to an end there is a definite hissing sound as you would hear in your car while on max but much more audible. It's not quite obnoxious but definitely noticeable. I find it unappealing and being someone who has always wanted to try Sennheiser products this certainly was a sad experience in that regard.I will be returning these and chalk it up to wireless headsets being an unrefined technology. I will be testing the more expensive ones before I rest my case, specifically the 130s and the 180s. I am hoping I will have a better experience with the 130s. These 120s seem more or less just entry level. I wouldn't even touch anything less than this model. I really wanted these to work because I had every intention of keeping them before I tried them. I cannot say enough about the freedom from wires. I am so tired of tripping and yanking the laptop about while catching myself. It doesn't happen that often but that benefit plus not having wires all over me is very liberating and I believe most reviews are based on this luxury and not the clarity/quality which must come first. I'd much rather have a wired set that was clear and loud than one that ever ever crackled or hissed or had static more than once per 30seconds to a minute depending on how much I move.*I must admit I experienced a ton of clipping when blasting music and more than lacking bass and sound quality but this is 95% unlikely to be the fault of the headphones since I was using it with a Vostro 1510 with on board sound; i.e. my system didn't have the necessary power to drive the hardware. I would really enjoy a wireless usb headset from Sennheiser since it would by pass the on board chip. I don't know if that's an available option or not.Final words: I remember reading about auto-tuning adjustment or something regarding volume on these I believe. I have noticed how songs shift in volume during the beginning or end of a song on occasion. It is irritating to have it essentially override my volume setting and it's not very intelligent. If someone can shed more light on this that would be nice. It doesn't happen too often but I don't like it and would like to turn it off somehow.*UPDATE: I have since tried the headset while watching an online TV show and am happy to report a great majority of the distortion and reception issues weren't present. This indicates that my on board sound processor is in fact the cause of much of the crappy sound. It just doesn't have the power to push music files hard enough to drive what these headphones can handle. I am assuming media files require much more power especially for .FLAC compared to a simple video audio stream. I am going to test it with a movie tonight and report on that but I experienced only 1-5% of the static issues when moving around while watching and I had to purposely try to. Before I had experienced 50-70% occurrence of static when moving even a little. Moving the transmitter off the floor and onto a table also helped a lot. Mounting it to the wall is convenient and recommended, it has the recessed hook built in just no hardware.P.S. I have raised the rating to 3 stars to reflect this development.

VI bought this headphones as I need to listen to my TV without disturbing my wife who studies in the hall.The packaging arrived in sturdy condition, only for me to open it and see one of the ear cushions half opened. I thought it was broken and being that I hate returns, I cursed my luck - only to find that the earpads were detachable. *whew*!(i) CONS: The setup is easy, though the included manual isn't really the best. I had it connected via digital-to-audio Gefen converter to my HDTV.I wasn't really sure when the green light on the transmitter is supposed to come 'on', and even now I am not completely certain. This is why I am not pleased with the manual. My setup had a faulty Toslink cable and the green light wouldn't light up - because of which I thought there was something wrong with the transmitter. Trial and error nailed down the problem to the faulty Toslink cable, which I have since replaced and everything is working as it should be. A little more clarity in the manual (instead of printing it in 25 languages, half of which no one would really care about) would have been appreciated.(ii) The included batteries are rechargeable (NiMH) no name 600mAh AAA batteries - are you kidding me ?! 600mAh ?! I would hard pressed to find 600mAh batteries fron any acceptable brand right now in the market. I don't expect them to last too long so I have gone ahead and purchased a set of 1000mAh batteries from Tenergy(iii) Which design wiz decided to place the volume control and the tuning control next to each other on the right earpad ?! I mean a little user testing would have shown up this glaring error! I am having a headache thinking of the number of times I will use one of these controls mistaking it for the other....(iii) PROS: The audio quality across the entire range - from bass to mids to high, is definitely good - not audiophile quality mind you but then I wouldn't expect that at this price range. It does what it is supposed to do and does a very good job of it. Directional audio is well captured - useful while gaming or for immersion in video(I dont know if this is a TV parameter or a headphone parameter but I am mentioning it just in case..)(iv)I live in a small condo so I do not walk around much using this but whatever little walking I did do, didn't produce any interference - barring the one instance when I could hear someone's phone conversation!! No kidding! It was some lady in the same apartment complex as I live in. I quickly tuned away but it was unnerving to say the least.Overall, I am pleased with the final product, if not with some of the finer issues.

VIt works fine for me. I came to Amazon's website looking for a wireless headphones and this came up in my search and a few others. For some strange reason I settled on this one despite it being a little more expensive than others. I started reading the reviews before purchasing. Most were positive and some were very negative. I took both into consideration and thought to myself the problems people were talking about seem to be isolated. So I made the plunge. I am happy to say all is good so far. I used Amazon Prime, ordered it on Thursay and got it on Friday. It charges fine. I fell asleep with it on last night and it was still working fine when I got up. The volume is loud, which was the one thing I was worried about and from some of the reviews that gave me concern because if I had trouble hearing then I was sending it back. I am hearing impaired and can only hear from one ear so if the sound was too low then it wouldn't be worth it to keep it. But the volume is just fine. I haven't walked around my house to see the range I get yet, but that is not why I bought it. I just need it to listen to the tv late at night while my Aunt sleeps over in the next bedroom. I initally hooked it up to the Audio out ports but I didn't get anything when I did that. So I used the headphone adapter that was included and plugged it into my headphone port on the TV and used the Channels and tunning button and I got reception and everything is working fine. I recall someone writing a review saying that everytime they turn it off they have to retune to get reception again. Taht only happened to me once. When I turn it off I put it on the cradle but I don't let the metal connect. I let the headphones rest on the cushion while on the cradle. I leave the headphone adapter connected to the tv. Then when I want to use them. I plug the cradle back into the power outlet and move the headphones so it gets a momentary charge (meaning I let the metal touch the cradle) then I turn them on and Voila I don't have to retune it. Whatever is on the TV I immediately hear it. I would suggest that for those of you experiencing that problem. I have even suggested my mom get a pair.Edit 5/18/2011: I have been using it some time now and it does work wonderfully. I just went downstairs to the kitchen and I never lost the connection it was as loud as when I am in the same room as the receiver which was upstairs.

VI bought a similarly priced set of wireless headphones when my first child was born, to allow us to watch TV at a realistic volume and not wake up our little light sleeper.  They were problematic, hurt your ears so much that we needed to take a break while watching anything longer than a sitcom, static abounded, and eventually neither of us could stand them anymore.  After lots of research, I settled on this offering from Sennheiser, having decent reviews and being not terribly expensive.  Now 3 years later, I still love them just as much, and have had no issues at all.  Here are my observations, and also addressing some "cons" listed by other reviewers:1) Status/hissing noise. This seems to be a problem when the headphone volume is turned up high.  We were irritated with inconsistent static at first, until we discovered that if we turned our stereo/amp up to the max, the headphone volume doesn't need to be up very high at all, and have experienced no static or hissing noise under these circumstances.  Some static will also be present when the battery is running low, but as long as you keep them in the charging station when not in use, that really shouldn't be a problem.2) Range seems pretty good.  I have even gone into the next room to my kitchen to wash dishes or make a snack during a commercial, and been able to listen the whole time without cutting out.  A trip to our garage for laundry, however, cuts in and out with some static.3) Sound quality.  I am not an expert, but I'd rate these as being "very good".  Not the same as our home stereo system, but I'd say on par with sound from your TV.4) Design.  These phones are VERY comfortable.  I have a small head, and these adjust fine without falling off.  My husband has had friends over for gaming who have large noggins, and all say these are very comfortable, even after hours of wear.  They sit on your ears, and are not what I would call "sound-isolating" headphones.  You can hear ambient noises, but I prefer that.  You could still hear a baby crying, and can detect when someone is trying to talk to you, though may not be able to hear the conversation until you remove the headphones.  If you truly want to be in your own world and not hear ANYTHING else, these are not the headphones for you.5) Durability.  As I've said, we're past 3 years and still never had a problem.  We're not abusive or rough with them, but they've been sat on, dropped, etc, with no issues.6) Charging station.  The charging unit is pretty big, and fits two headphones if you're careful.  I cannot believe the negative comments I've read about these being so difficult to charge.  There are grooves on the headphone so you know exactly where they are supposed to rest - it's not rocket science.  We have a second pair, and getting the 2nd headphone on correctly so that both charge takes SLIGHTLY more work, basically just making sure they are both touching, which often just involves pushing back slightly when you put the 2nd one on.  If you expect to just toss them on the charger as if you're playing horseshoes, then, yes, you will have problems.  But if you walk up to the charger and place them on, you'll be fine.Ultimately, VERY pleased with these headphones.  Highly recommend!

VI have had 3 or 4 pairs of wireless headphones in my life so I think that fact counts as important.I've been using a wireless pair of SONY MDR-RF970RK for television only. The SONY are excellent and are "over Ear" type. But they had an unusual battery charging system (induction)and when the special batteries that came with the SONY set wore out, I tried to buy new ones but I made a mistake with my address and the batteries went to the wrong address and it looked like I was never going to get them.So, being irritable about the battery problem and not knowing it was my mistake, I decided to get these Sennheiser RS120. They came just a few days ago and I just sent them right back; returned them. They are fairly well made in the general sense and the sound was fine; my TV is a new HD flat panel 40" SONY BRAVIA. BUT, BUT, BUT!!!These Sennheiser do not cover the ears and are too loose. I mean they do not cup the ears, just fit "on" the ears.So you lose sound escaping at the ears and my ears became sore from the direct contact with the ears. Also, because they do not cup the ears, and perhaps because of other poor design (maybe weak spring system tension)they shift on your head with the slightest movement of your body or head. With the SONY, I could move around the house, do kitchen stuff, etc., or other little jobs while listening to news, etc. and the phone would not fall off my head.So I thought I would just go back to using the SONY and would go with regular rechargeable batteries which as I said you can't recharge on the phone cradle in the SONY because it's only for induction type batteries.That's a bit of a nuisance but better than the negatives I just described for the Sennheiser we are discussing. But I finally did get the batteries (my mistake)for(Batteryclerk.com). But you can use AAA regular batteries if you have to and replace them regularly or use rechargeable as I said.I bought the SONY pair which are excellent, May of 2008 for $100.00 and you can buy them here on Amazon. As I said, you can buy the unusual battery for those now if the original one "burns" out as mine did in 3 year.You can also buy a Sennheiser pair here which cup the ears but I don't think they are on a chargeable base and have not seen them personally; check those out.Bottom line: Buy the SONY pair I recommended above if can spend that much and want a good fitting, wireless, rechargeable pair. You can alway go to a store to buy phones to try them on for comfort. And ask about the battery type. Radio Frequency is best for me; it's a strong signal and you can walk around your house, garage, driveway, etc., and still get the signal.Good luck. The Amazon buying and shipping and returning process is excellent but I just can't recommend the pair these Sennheiser headphones.

VThe best thing for late night television since sliced bread?!?
p3108
sg5
VThis is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anybody out there looking for a way to enjoy television without disturbing the ones you love.  We bought these over 6 months ago because my wife and I enjoyed watching TV together in the living room after our kids went to sleep at night but our daughters room and the living room are separated only by a non-insulated interior wall and she is a light sleeper so we had to keep the volume at such a low level that we could barely hear any of the dialogue.  Once I started looking for wireless headphones, I clicked over to amazon.com (as I usually do) and started my search.  Instantly, I was drawn to these because of the great reviews, good name brand recognition, ease of charging, expandability, etc and I must say I'm glad I picked them up.  We got two sets with the charging cradles as we keep one of the cradles/transmitters in the living room and one in our bedroom since each can use separate frequencies.  Sound quality and range are both very good in my opinion, but I wasn't looking for any thing with crystal clear sound.  In sound quality, these can't compare to my wired noise-cancelling head phones, but they do their job exceedingly well.  If I try hard enough, I can usually pick up a very faint hisss typically associated with wireless devices such as these and on occasion I'll experience a short burst of static (less than a second), potentially due to the countless other wireless devices in my home but it's never bothered me enough to look into it.  Despite the fact that most audiophiles probably wont be satisfied with the sound quality (not saying it's bad by any means, but it is wireless afterall) I would still HIGHLY recommend these headphones to anybody in the market for them.5 starts because these were exactly what I was looking for and do the exact job I expected them to do.

VUnbelievable reception and quality
p3114
sg5
VI work the night shift on the floor of a manufacturing facility where I amsurrounded by modern machinery, electric panels, computers, a wi-fi network,rows of fluorescent lighting and concrete block walls,so I was hesitant to try a wireless headset.My main listening interests are sports talk, ballgames, news programs, and talk shows.The headphones are hooked into my satellite radio boom-box via the headphone jack(with the volume on the boom-box turned up all the way).Well let me tell you, I receive great reception and qualityat 90 yards (and that is with about 50 machines between myself andthe transmitter).  Only the slightest crackling and minor hissing can be heard at that distance.Being about 60 yards away from the transmitter with a concrete block wall and 30 machinesbetween, the audio is sufficient enough with some crackling, hissing and breakup.While in my main work area (about 2000 sq. ft) and in direct line of the transmitter,the audio is spot on with absolutely no crackling, no hiss and no interference.I cannot "accurately" comment on the music quality b/c I do not have "an ear" for it,but it's as good as any 'wired' headset or ear buds that I have owned.The placement of the dials do not present a problem for me.I have no difficulty adjusting the volume, tuner or on-off switch,even with work gloves on.  These headphones are worn daily for aminimum of 8 hrs. a day, and don't lose a charge.  You can tellwhen the batteries are dying when the audio quality starts to diminish.They are plenty comfortable (even w/ safety glasses on) with ample padding.My only complaint (and it may be genuine to me) is the fit.I have a good sized melon (7 5/8) and these seem to wiggle abit while I am working.  I do some lifting and reaching at workand while doing so, I sometimes have to try to keep my head level so the headphonesdon't slide down or back.  Again, this may be unique to me as I may havestretched these beyond their capacity. =)I highly recommend these headphones and would have giventhem a 5-Star review had I just used them in an "idle" position.

VI bought these to replace a very old set of RCA wireless headphones that were literally falling apart from years of use.  This Sennheiser set works fine.  No wireless headphones are going to provide the perfect sound you'd get from very expensive wired headphones, but these come close.  Set-up was easy and they provide several adaptors in the box which should allow connection to just about any kind of audio out (except optical digital).  The headphones fit comfortably, though the are a little tight against the ear, probably because they are still new and I have a big head, but on the plus side, that keeps them in place -- they don't fall off or shift position when you move your head or bend over to pick something up.  And the speakers stay close to the ear.  My old RCA headphones had a cushioned cup that surrounded the ear.  These have a flat padded earpiece that simply presses against the outside of the ear.  They're still comfortable, and that design should minimize "sweaty ear syndrome."  Recharging is easy -- just place the headphones on the base station cradle -- nothing to plug into the headphones as there was on my old RCA set.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't notice any hiss on these, but I use them more for TV than for music.  Also, the reported problem of their shutting off if the sound source is quiet (e.g., a very silent part of a movie or TV show, or very soft music) was also common with my previous RCA set, so it doesn't really bother me.  As has been noted in another review, if that starts to happen with a particular show, turn up the volume on the sound source and turn down the volume (as needed) on the headphones.  Reception was fine -- no interference, static, etc.  So far, I'm very pleased with the product.

VAll Hail Cordless Headphone Freedom
p3126

VPros: Light weight; great aural frequency response; quality sound reproduction; easy set-up.Cons: Some RF interference from other accessories on my desktop.Bottom-Line: If you are in need of quality wireless headphones you could do a lot worse than the Sennheiser RS-120.As I stated in my Logitech MX3200 Cordless Desktop review, I dislike clutter.  And my desk at work is configured such that the keyboard, mouse and headphone cords run across the desktop and not only create an eyesore, but also get in the way of work.  So I had to find a solution.  I decided to go wireless; i.e. wireless keyboard, mouse and headphones.  The first device I purchased was the aforementioned Logitech Cordless Desktop MX-3200, which mates a wireless keyboard with a wireless MX-600 laser mouse.  The second purchase was a set of Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless (stereo) Headphones.The Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones are designed for use with Hi-Fi audio, television, or computer.  The open air RF (radio Frequency) German-made headphones are designed to provide a rich palate of aural sound (frequency response rated at 22Hz - 19500Hz) through walls as well as ceilings allowing one to roam throughout the house while listening to your tunes.Power to the headphones is provided by a set of NiMH (size AAA) batteries.  These batteries are in turn recharged by putting the headphones on their transmitter base; said base can be mounted to a wall. The entire system--transmitter base and headphones weigh in at just 8.1 ounces, but the headphones are rather large; large but comfortable.The transmitter can be set to three different channels, while a rotary dial is provided on the headphone to fine tune the pair.  An on/off switch and volume control can also be found on the headphones.Set-up & UseI bought the Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones to use on my computer at work to replace my bulky speakers, but I tested the unit at home first on my home stereo system.  It took me less than five minute to set the system up.  The transmitter base is fitted with two LED's: a yellow On/Off and red Charge lights.  Once the transmitter and plugged into an audio source and detects current the On/Off LED will illuminate.  Once I installed the batteries in the headphones I was ready for wireless listening.In and around my house the sound quality from the Sennheiser RS-120 was outstanding!  I was able to roam throughout the house without experiencing and signal degradation or interference.  Frequency response was suburb, and the overall sound was crisp and enjoyable.  It helps that there is no frequency overlap in my house; i.e. my cordless phone operate at 5.8GHz and my wireless LAN operates at 2.4GHz.  The Sennheiser RS-120 operate on a radio frequency of 926MHzWork is a different story altogether.  The Sennheiser RS-120's still work for the most part but there is some interference from my other wireless accessories, including my cordless keyboard and mouse and cordless Plantronics headset.  I am able to change the channel and fine tune the frequency when needed however, and for the most part I am able to listen to music and or radio interference free.The range inside my standard office building setting is outstanding through doors and walls.  I can roam a considerable distance before static degrades the signal; very impressive.ConclusionI like my new Sennheiser RS-120 Wireless Headphones, so much so that I am planning on purchasing a set for my home stereo.  Yes, there is some interference in my work setting with other devices, but I expected that and systems ability to allow for fine tuning is a definite plus.  If you are in need of quality wireless headphones you could do a lot worse than the Sennheiser RS-120.

VVery Good Wireless Headphones
p3132

VMy last wireless headphones were Sennheiser RS-130. The over the head plastic started cracking so I knew it was time to replace them. I remember shopping around before buying the RS-130's and found Sennheiser way ahead of the competition on frequency response, range, quality, and easy of use. I found the RS-120's and decided to give them a try since the RS-130's were much more expensive.PROS :  1. Reasonably priced.  2. Great wireless range. Held signal through underground parking garage  from a 3rd floor apartment. Held signal is different than full fidelity  but 85% of fidelity at that range with obstacles is impressive!  3. Lighter weight headset than RS-130.  4. Good wireless channel fine tuning.CONS :  1. Have to switch channels at base on RS-120 versus on headset on RS-130.  2. Less bass range than RS-130.  3. Ears are not covered by earpieces making it easier to have headphones fall off  when bending over to pick things up. Also requires slightly higher volume to  cover up other noises from the outside.  A small bit of bass loss is worth the lower price tag. I'm amazed at the wireless range.  I like the sound quality of the RS-120 which does lack some of the bass of the RS-130's. The RS-130's had surround sound which isn't on the RS-120's but I don't think surround sound is critical for my use, which is listening to TV when out of the room.  The fit of the headphones is different between the RS-130's and the RS-120's.  The RS-130's ear pieces actually fit over the ear surrounding it. Perhaps this, or the surround sound, resulted in the RS-130's have better bass. I believe the frequency spec on the RS-130 actually went down to 20Hz. I didn't check the RS-120 spec but am sure, from use, that it is slightly higher.  The RS-130's wrapped over the head slightly better than the RS-120 allowing for more looking down range without the headphones starting to slide off of the head. The RS-130's were slightly heavier which makes the RS-120's more comfortable when moving the head around or wearing for longer periods of time.  All in all I'm very happy with the RS-120's.

p3138

VI tried it for a few days, but returned today.First, the positive:1) great sound quality when watching TV2) range was pretty acceptable. Could go to the kitchen or bedroom and still get a very decent signal from the living room.3) very comfortable in general. Your ears will get a bit too hot after extended periods, but hey, it's headphone! (of course leather would be better than cloth, but it'd be >$200 like the Bose). If you wear glasses it'll require a bit of adjustment so it doesn't put too much pressure on your glasses over the ears.4) Battery seems to last enough. I used for several hours and still going strong. My Xbox batteries gave up much before the headset.The reason I gave it 3-stars and the reasons for my return are:1) It DOES HAVE a constant hiss in the background. Differently than most other reviews I found it quite noticeable, especially on interviews and dialogs, or  when your music has frequent level changes like classic music, jazz, etc. I'm using to play RPG games on my Xbox, so your mileage may vary. As RPG games have lots of dialogs and parts with subtle music mixed with high intensity action, any small interference gets *very* annoying after a few hours.2) Also noticed there's an audible high pitch noise when the xbox is loading something from the DVD. Again, it's only noticeable during silent parts, but when you're playing Mass Effect 2 that's pretty much the entire time. I tried moving away the xbox and using shielded cables but no improvement. Also tried adjusting the frequency on the headphone and changing the station without luck.In summary, when watching regular TV or other source with constant high sound the automatic gain control will work fine and you can barely notice the hiss. If you're planning to play videogames (specially RPGs) or other sources with long pauses and subtle music, maybe you should look for something else.

VI bought these headphones two years ago for use at work.  Most of my day is spent tied to the keyboard, and I was tired of having to move the headphone wires around the keyboard / mouse, or worst of all, forgetting I had them plugged in when standing up - yank!I will give these headphones excellent marks overall, with only one real criticism.  I should note that I have not tried any other brands, so I have no comparison except to rather poor quality corded phones.Sound quality is amazing, range is far longer than I need (do I really need to wear them to get copies, coffee, or go to the bathroom - no, but I can, so good enough), and the battery life is longer than most workdays.  The charging system is inspired - effective, easy, and almost fashionable.  The headphones are much more comfortable than my previous walkman style mini's, though their size is considerable - I feel like the guy in Empire Strikes Back - discrete they are not.As other reviewers have noted, the system works best when you have your computer/player volume cranked, and use the on-headphone volume adjustment.  Working this way, I rarely have any hiss or static.  This does expose the one weakness of the system - the frequency tuner and the volume control are close to each other and use the same size and texture of adjusting wheel.  If one wishes to adjust the volume while still wearing the headphones (which one most certainly will), it is all too easy to inadvertently hit the tuner instead - insert loud squeal of static, then two minutes of having to find the right channel again...  It would have been a simple matter to make one of the wheels differently textured, or sized, or something.  But no.But, I would buy them again, especially now that they are cheaper.

p3149

VI use this to listen to music at my desk while my wife watches TV in the open-plan living room nearby.  I'll also use it for TV viewing when the kids are sleeping.I had some trouble with line interference (high-pitched buzzes) when I started using these, but figured out it was another component I'm using.  When I plug it in directly to my PC headphone jack, the sound is excellent.  The range seems fine within at least 70-80 feet; I haven't tested the actual range limit.Sound is *very* good.  Be careful to listen to a good quality source.  I played a couple of poor-quality MP3s through it and was doubtful until I realised it was just reproducing the poor input.  With high quality input it's fine.PROS:+ Excellent sound reproduction - great range, pleasing balance+ minimal (i.e. practically none) noise if you tune it in correctly (very slight hiss in almost silent music passages)+ decent volume+ battery life (rechargeables come with it) is fine+ recharging stand is easy to use (no hunting for contacts, etc)+ no noticeable interference from wifi, cellphone signals, etc.+ excellent feeling that you don't have to worry about cords when you stand up+ 'open' headphone cup style allows you to hear attackers creeping up on you from behind.CONS:- susceptible to line noise if any of your sound components are unshielded (you must either remove the component or shield it to get rid of the hisses and hums)- looks really dumb when you stand up (but who cares really?!)- 'open' headphone style forces you to hear wife watching Grey's anatomy if TV's in the same room. (Maybe a second set for her?? Aha!)- there is a slight tendency to distort loud sounds; try turning down the input volume and turning up the headphones volume.  There may be an upper limit to the input volume it can handle.  It's plenty loud though.

VNot as Bad as a few feel - In fact Very Good
p3155

VLets revisit some of the issues others have discussed:  1.  Hiss - yest there is hiss, BUT only when I get almost out of range.  I have not found it necessary to hold my head rigid or in strange positions.  Hiss is not really a problem for me or the wife.  (Note: you will get lots of hiss if the input level is too low.  Try using line out instead of audio out)  2.  Volume control too close to the tuner.  Well, since I can shift and clutch while chewing gum, I have not yet found this to be a real problem.  Takes almost no practice to get it right - just start high and work down for the volume.  3.  Range - I lost the signal completely at about 300 feet thru walls and trees.  Sound quality began to deteriorate and hiss increased at around 250 feet.  Even had to face the "right" direction and hold my head in funny positions to get good sound past 250 feet.  Working in the garage or most of the yard, I had really good sound.  Since some of my yard is well beyond 300 feet - I could not get good reception at all times and places - not at all a deal breaker for me.  4.  Sound quality.  These are NOT as good as listening to a recording with a high quality sound system or thru my Bose home Theater System.  They are intended to provide very good sound quality with complete freedom of movement.WAIT - Solved some of the negative reviews.  These headphones work great in my house.  I actually purchased them for my mother - she lives in an assisted living center.  When I tried to install them in her room, I found out that the wireless phones used by 90% of the residents interfere with the system.  There is no way to tune the headphone system with all of this interference around.  I use a newer cordless phone that operates on different frequencies, but your phones may be the problem.  Electronic interference is probably the reason for the hisssssss problems.  5.  Headphone comfort and fit.  Not as comfortable as some other headphones I have used and/or owned.  Quick moves can cause the headphones to slip off your head.  Maybe it is just me, but this can cause some problems and could be fixed.  Not a deal breaker, but get used to wearing them before you move around a lot.  I would not wear them if I were going jogging.  Overall I would still recommend these headphones.  I feel that there are enough good things to offset the fit.

VEverything has been said in 922 previous reviews . I found a headphone jack 3.5 mm jack for the computer and a set of RCA audio jacks in my package . I have Fibro and severe chronic pain . Zero quality of life until I put these on WOW . I own a acre and a third with a house at one far end . I walked to every point on my property after closing the door to the house and setting these up on the wall 3 feet above my computer and had no problems until I ducked behind a old Wells cargo trailor 400 feet away . Otherwise I did get some crackle but it was no worse then old vinyl scratches . My garage is behind the house I walked in with closed the doors and there was a van between me and the house and I heard everyting fine . The charging cradle is fine . Its easy to change the batteries and it came with rechargeables . Bottom line it works well . Sounds were crisp within reason for the crackles and pops . It scared me to think the radio waves were everywhere . I thought the bass was great . I like the position of the dials its not confusing . There is a adjustment on the base that helped me lock in a signal everywhere . Now the bad .These headphones are for people sitting or walking easy . When I tried to bend over with them they fell off . I didnt get on my lawn mower but it would be about as far as I would push activity with them . They feel clumsy and akward for me and I imagine most people . I wore them as small as they would go and I am a 7 5/8 hat size . Maybe my ears are high on my head I dont know . Compared to the technology I knew these are a 6 but take two off for a 4 on a 5 point scale . Definitely worth the money but dont expect to do work in them you will have to find another model . I would love to hear what people are using for that . The range for me was unbelievable compared to what I expected . I never believed the claims . Now you do have to tune them in and adjust a little . My base was hung on a simple paneling nail on the wall above the computer with a light switch a foot away , air conditioner running , monitors , tv and a wireless phone system . No problems . The volume turns up just high enough to be pleasant yet safe . A very good purchase . These replaced a nice set of RCA's which sadly were lost before the package was even openned . I couldnt buy them again and I dont feel sad anymore . I would buy again but hopefully the other pair will be something for working outside now that I know the tech can reach out there . These would be great for landscapers just leave the truck radio on with the base plugged into a inverter 12vt charge pack . I will comment later as I havent tried them with tv or just the computer alone yet to run into issues where people complain of the auto shut off / gain feature . I cant wait to try these with a usb phono I bought recently for my old 45's ,78's and 33's . For one brief moment my pain was bearable it was worth the money . Please recomend in comments a headset that may work with the base or not that is wearable while bending or being more active . Thanks ..God Bless .

VTwo big flaws ruin an otherwise amazing product
p3167
sg5
VI read many reviews on this product before deciding to purchase and overall they are terrific headphones, but for some reason most people didn't mention the two most irritating things about these.1) If your sound source stops for say 5 minutes, you are suddenly blasted with incredibly loud white noise that really can hurt your ears!2) Overly loud sound in spots will noticeably diminish the volume of the music.I've learned that the unfortunate cause of these are the following "features" of the unit which cannot be changed/adjusted or turned off as far as I know.1) Auto power off mode of the base after 5 minutes of silence.2) Aggressive Automatic Volume GainIt seems that when the unit powers off after 5 minutes of silence, the automatic gain kicks in, and amplifies the silence tremendously to the point where all of a sudden, you get a blast of whitenoise that's really loud. I've trained myself to just turn the headphones switch off when my sound source stops (aka, if some interruption causes me to pause the music for abit, or the tv show I'm watching), and to start the sound source again (music or tv) prior to turning the phones back on, so as to avoid the loud noise. It's a pain, and I still get caught by surprise sometimes, but it's mostly managable.Also in music that has a large change in volume, you can hear the phones cut down the signal significantly when the loud spot comes in. It's very annoying and can ruin the true feel of the music.Despite these major issues, these headphones are otherwise fantastic, and it's a true shame these issues were not addressed prior to production and cannot be addressed after the fact either.The phones are very comfortable to wear, the sound reproduction is excellent, and I've not had much in the way of interference wearing them (although I don't stray far from the base unit). The manual tuning control is not really a big deal as I've rarely had to set it more than the one time initially, and saves money on the more expensive unit they sell.I'm still happy with the purchase and have managed to live with the 2 major issues, but I wanted to make sure the next person was aware of the problems before buying. From what I could tell reading other reviews, the higher priced models from Sennheiser have the same issues.If they can correct these issues in future models, I would buy them in a heart beat since I don't think the other companies offerings are nearly as good.

VBought these for my Dad because he tangles every cord for every gadget into a giant mess
p3173
sg5
VThe good: no cords to easily get tangled. There is a cord, of course, from the base to the device you want to listen to. In this case, my dad's computer. He uses Skype to call relatives overseas and bother me every week about something else and he had problems with another set of corded sennheisers that I got for him. The cord, no matter how hard he tried, got tangled into an unholy mess. After about a year of untangling it for him whenever I went to visit, I said forget it, looked up wireless headphones, and was pleased to see that Sennheiser had a few options. I love sennheiser quality and I use a set of sennheiser gaming headphones with a mic for skype and gaming so of course I'm already a fan. The corded set went to my mom for when she uses skype and mysteriously the cords stay untangled.Back to the wireless set though, the price was solid but I think I got it off newegg for slightly cheaper and they had a free shipping promotion at the time, so it was quicker than Amazon's USPS (Newegg uses 3-day UPS guaranteed shipping, but it's not always free). The main complaints that had me worried were: 1) slight buzzing noises when there is no sound coming out, as in when a movie goes quiet or a song is fading out. 2) the frequency changer is right by the volume changer, so it's easy to accidentally change it. 3) Very poor rangeI didn't notice the slight buzzing noise during silent parts of a movie or quiet parts of a song. I haven't used them as much as my dad has, though, and he still has no complaints. Range is about 1 foot since he's sitting at his computer when he uses them, so again, I can't say I've tested them to their max. As for the poor design of the frequency changer and the volume changer, well a piece of tape over the former will do just fine. I set the frequency on the base, adjusted with the knob on the headphones, and then stuck a piece of tape over it. I just know that dad will mess with it accidentally and so far, he's had no problems there either. He loves the headphones for skype and when mom tells him she can hear his music or movies, so it's a great deal. Rechargeable base makes this an even better deal, he never has to worry about changing the batteries (Which would worry me a great deal, he's not tech-savvy). Over all, I'd say it's a must have if you've got the right set of conditions. I can't speak for plugging into a TV because that could run into the problem of poor range. Sound quality is what I expect from Sennheiser and just as a point of comparison, most higher end models run well into the $300-400 range. No. Thank. You.When you buy from Sennheiser, you can expect high quality and this doesn't disappoint.

VExactly What I Needed
p3178
sg5
VI recently upgraded to a Sony HDTV and needed some wireless headphones to go with it.  My previous Sony TV had a pair of wireless headphones that synced up wirelessly with the TV without an external receiver or anything.  When I upgraded, I lost and deeply missed that function.  My wife is on a different work/sleep schedule than I am, so I needed a way to be able to watch TV without having to keep the volume down really low and sit like 2 inches from the screen to be able to hear it.  After comparing several brands of wireless headphones online, it seemed that the Sennheiser headphones had higher review ratings than other big name brands like Sony.  After doing some further comparisons on price, I found that Amazon was selling the headphones I wanted for about $50 less than the local Large Chain Retailer (Best Buy).After making the purchase and hooking the headphones up, I have been completely pleased with this product.  With my setup, I have the wireless receiver hooked into the headphone port of my surround sound receiver.  I can turn the volume of the TV down to Zero, and then turn up the surround sound and slap on the headphones and listen without disturbing anyone.The wireless range is very broad, and I can walk throughout my entire house and still get a good reception (with only minimal static interference).  There are 3 different wireless settings on the base of the wireless receiver (possibly 3 different frequencies).  By adjusting the base and then using the tuning wheel on the headphones, you can fine tune the clarity of your signal and minimize any distortion/intereference.  Other reviews I have read talk about a background noise/hiss when using the headphones.  I have found that by turning up the volume on my cable box and on the headphones and then turning down the volume of my surround sound receiver, I get a near perfect signal without any background noise or hiss.  This may be different for people with other setups, but I am very picky when it comes to audio/video quality and I have not been disappointed with this product.The one knock I have on this product is that it has an on/off switch on the headphones that is easy to forget to turn off (which is more a problem with me than with the headphones).  My last pair of wireless headphones had a sensor strap that would tell the headphones to turn on when you had them on your head.  Having grown accustomed to that feature, it makes it very easy to forget to flip the headphones off when I'm not using them.Overall, this is a great product.  Again, different setups may yield different results but with my setup, these headphones have performed beyond my expectations and I would definitely make the same decision to purchase them again if I had to do it all over again.

VI bought these headphone for my 95 year old dad who played the TV so loudly that even though he maintains that he is not deaf, he was making everyone else in the house deaf.  We couldn't hold a conversation in the kitchen because the TV in the living room was so loud.  Now we are living in blessed quiet where everyone can speak in a normal voice and my dad is thrilled to pieces because he can hear the TV clearly again.  He finds the headphones very easy to use even though I read in a review that the switches were too close to each other and hard to differentiate.  He says they are small and hard to see but not that hard to use.  He is so happy!  He can hear every word that is said by everyone on the television and if he wants to get up and walk around, he continues to wear the headphones and doesn't miss a moment of his programs.  This is important when someone moves as slowly as he does and just getting a drink from the kitchen can be a 5 minute trip.  He finds the headphones to be light on his head and easy to wear and they do not interfere with his hearing aid.The only problem we did experience was that we had cordless telephones in the room and they picked up the sound from the TV after the cordless headphones were installed.  Our solution was to get rid of the cordless phones and go back to a wired table model.  I think that there are additional channels that you can select on the telephones so that the interference disappears.  We tried several channels but the problem continued so we just gave up.My dad is so thrilled with these headphones that he recommended them to his 97 year old sister and her 98 year old gentleman friend who have similar hearing problems.By the way, my 25 year old daughter has also used the headphones to watch TV and agrees that they are great.

VA bit uncomfortable after a couple of hours and sometimes poor sound quality
p3200
sg5
VThe manufacturing quality of the system is very good, the charging works as promised and they are a fine looking headset.  The ear pieces feel very nice and the headband is nicely padded so they feel great when first putting them on.  However, after wearing for more than an hour or two they begin to become uncomfortable...so they bring happiness twice, once when putting them on and then again when taking them off.  After selecting the best of the three channels they require 'fine-tune' adjust which came as a bit of a surprise and is becoming more and more annoying as time goes on.  It would have been nice if they put the channel fine adjust somewhere other than right next to the volume since it is easily bumped when adjusting the volume; or would be even better if they used an off-on-volume dial on one ear piece and the channel adjust on the other ear.  I rarely use the on-off switch since they turn off when putting onto the charger. The sound quality is OK for listening to the TV, but i think would be disappointing if being used for hi-fi listening.  At first i wish they had come with a 1/8" stereo connector rather than RCA plugs, but i have come to prefer the RCA since (after getting splitters) i have them connected directly into the back of the TiVO rather than in the headphone jack of the TV which would have cut out the TV volume when the headphone was used...this way i can just mute the TV and not have to plug/unplug the headset.  Besides, all the connections are in the back now.  They did come with adapters for both the 1/8" stereo to RCA as well as the 1/4" to 1/8" stereo, so that was a nice touch and an effort to try to please everyone.  Overall, i am not sure i would buy them again but i am not dissatisfied.

sg5
VI've read the one and two star reviews that find fault with these headphones, but I have yet to experience any downside.  I've owned these headphones for about one month and just love them.  The transmitter was simple to hook up to my cable box with the included component cables (other connectors also included, i.e. earphone jack adaptor) and the headphones worked as soon as I turned them on.  The sound is so much better than the 10W down-firing speakers in my Samsung HDTV and really helps me hear every word and sound of the show or movie I'm watching.  I'm a bit hard of hearing and didn't realize all that I was missing listening to the TV through the speakers.  The volume control is broad, allowing me to listen as quietly or loud as I choose.  Even with my hearing loss, turning the volume all the way up is too loud for ear comfort.  There is no sound distortion even at higher volumes.  So far, the range of the transmitter has been excellent.  I can walk all around my house, including upstairs and into the basement without the slightest static.  Since I'm usually watching TV lying propped up on the couch, I wear the headphones just in front of my ears so they don't bump into the couch cushions behind my head.  Therefore, I can't really speak to whether my ears get sweaty after prolonged use.  I do know that I have no discomfort from the ear cups even after 3+ hours wearing them.  Recharging is also simple, as the headphones naturally slide into the proper charging position on the transmitter when set on it.  I have yet to have any issue with battery life, even after using the headphones constantly for 3+ hours.  In short, I love these headphones and they have lived up to my every expectation!

VWhat a Disappointment
p3224
sg5
VAfter reading the somewhat genuine reviews of these headphones, I purchased them without hesitation. Unfortunately, I now wish I had purchased another set of headphones. After two weeks of using these, they were already beginning to stretch. The slightest movement downward will cause them to fall off, which is insanely annoying. These headphones were clearly meant for the morbidly obese and mutated gigantic heads since they really never fit my head at all. Trying to get a good signal without interference was impossible. You would always hear a LOUD HISS (Very noticeable, unlike what others have said) and the connection is very difficult to maintain. It means that, again, with just the slightest movement (I really do mean slight as in an inch) will cause major feedback in the sound and FORCE you to relocate to a better position, which isn't comfortable.  If the headset is not in use after maybe three minutes, it cuts off and gives off a deafening feedback-related tone. I don't understand why I can't turn these feature off. I'm looking in to file a lawsuit for this very reason, because let's say you're viewing a Youtube  video or two, decide to look at your phone to answer some texts, then all of a sudden "PPPPPPPPPPPPSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHH!!!"The end result, they work and have a charger. The headphones and charger are made from the cheapest materials and I would evaluate this at a retail of maybe $35 and no more, however, I paid about $80. It can also be said that my partner can still hear the music and the movies I watch on my computer. This is not appropriate considering I bought these to stop being loud at night to let my partner sleep. What a disappointment.

VThese headphones are simply great.  I was looking for a way to watch TV without disturbing my wife while she worked nearby.  No static at all when I turned the volume up on the source.  I did notice minor hissing when the source was at lower volume but that disappeared when I turned the TV volume up.  Hint: be sure to turn the volume down before unplugging the headphone transmitter from the source!In my home environment I have wifi and 4 computers (3 on wifi) along with cordless phones, microwave, DishTV, etc so heavy "radio" traffic.  No interference problems.  But I also don't have any neighbors within 500 feet of my home (rural setting) either.  That may be a factor in a suburban or urban setting.The sound for CDs, DVDs and video games (Wii) is also excellent in terms of localizing various directions so I am glad I did not spend more for the surround sound model.  Very comfortable to wear too.  Sennheiser is noted for accurate sound reproduction, and my ears were amazed, but then I may just be easy to please.Placement of the headset into the charging cradle requires a special touch to be sure the charging is activated.  But that is but a minor inconvenience.  The manual is a little sparse on operating functions but when you look over the phones the controls are intuitive.Two things of note:1)  Be sure to push the AC adapter plug FULLY into the charging base.  I pushed until I literally heard it SNAP into place.  Until I did so I thought my charger set was defective.2)  Be sure to fully charge the phones BEFORE first use.I'd certainly buy another pair if I need one in the future.So far, very satisfied and at a great price too!

p3260

VThese were purchased for a friend who has hearing issues. He had lost the ability to hear movies and TV without having the volume to a point that kept his family awake at night. This little unit fixed that issue.Here are a few points that I was a bit foggy on until purchasing these headphones.Connections - the base unit has left and right RCA audio plugs that go into your TVs "audio out". It includes adapters for 3.5mm and 1/4" connections.Sound - since you're using the "audio out" on your TV sound will always go to the headphones. That way others in the room can listen to the TV at a normal level allowing the person using the headphones to turn it up as much as they need. Or at night you can turn the TV sound all the way down and just use the headphones to make sleeping for the family easier.Charging - the headphones have built in contacts that match up to the wire holder. When you place the headphones on the holder the "charging" light comes on.Reception - as others have stated, standing close to the base unit results in static. You have the ability to swap channels on the base unit and there is a tuning knob on the headphones that allows you to fine tune them to be static free.Quality - very good sound reproduction that results in clear and rich listening.Overall my friend was amazed at how much he'd been missing. Now he can hear everything while watching TV. He's also able to watch movies again, something he'd missed very much but stopped doing because he couldn't hear half the movie. That's not an issue anymore.

VI read dozens of reviews before purchasing these headphones. I was worried about the earphones falling off my head and not receiving sound well enough, etc. But the positive reviews also convinced me to try them out. I didn't find a single thing wrong with this product. In fact everything so far has been right. It was easy to set up the unit and get the headphones charged. Once I was ready to use them, the instructions led me through each step and I found a good location on the tuning dial to hear my selection. I should say that I use the headphones primarily to listen/watch baseball games without annoying others, so I have no recommendations with regard to using the headphones for more lofty purposes, such as listening to opera or symphony music. However the product itself is in good condition, seems well made and certainly worth a try. As part of a test of this headphone set, I walked around my house, went into a bathroom and closed the door, went outside, went into the detached office and never lost connection. That seems to be a wider range than they promise, which means I can sit outside in the summer time and listen or watch baseball games on a lounge chair. As for complaints from some on thise site that the headphones kept falling off the user's head, they felt a little strange to me, too, when I first put them on. I looked in a mirror and found out that they were not on correctly. They were crooked. Once straightened out, they became among the most comfortable headsets I've used. They are very easy to adjust. I would recommend that if you are considering good wireless headphones, you choose this one. Great price, too.

VI purchased this headset in order to avoid disturbing my wife as she works on various projects that require a great deal of silence and concentration. I have been considering the purchase of wireless headphones for more than a year. I bought at least two other brands and returned them for lack of performance. The pair I bought prior to purchasing the Sennheiser RS120 used an infrared signal technology. The sound was good, but the unit had almost no range at all. You needed to be within ten feet of the TV with an almost direct line-of-sight position in front of the set. Even raising my hand to my mouth while eating, caused interference as I moved my hand pass the set to my mouth. The Sennheiser with its radio frequency technology is excellent. I can leave the room and go to the most remote area of our 2000 sq. ft. house and still receive excellent reception. The unit not only has excellent reception, it also blocks out extraneous noise such as a blender, garbage disposal or running water while I continue to listen to the audio while in the kitchen. The headset also allows me to hear sound details that are not noticeable when listening without the headphones. It's also very easy to adjust the volume without removing the headset. However, I have not experienced any loss of volume or clarity while listening from the most remote end of our house.The unit is also adjustable to various head sizes and is very comfortable to wear. The ear pads can be easily removed and replaced. The quality of these headphones is excellent and the price was very, very reasonable. This device has met all my expectations and then some.

VI've had experience with Sennheiser headphones in one form or another for over 20 years. They have always been the right choice for phones, whether you're looking for audiophile grade, or are looking for a good sounding set on a budget. The decision to pick up the RS120 wireless unit was based on my experience with the RS140's at my work. I was impressed by the clear, artifact free sound I was getting, even at a 200 foot range, with the 140's. When I went to purchase a set for myself, I was sad to see that the 140's were discontinued, but the 120's seemed to have similar features, and were considerably less expensive. I'm happy to say that, though the 120's are missing the auto tune and compression features, the sound quality is actually better (fuller) than the 140's. This is due to the fact that the 120's utilize an open-air design, and the 140's were sealed cans for isolation. They definitely leak sound at high volume settings, so if you are seeking complete isolation, then the 120's may not be for you. For me, it's a non-issue. The sound quality, build quality, range and comfort of the 120's are so good, I almost can't believe that they are such a good deal! The re-charging system, which consists of hanging the phones up on the base unit's antenna, is ingeniously simple. The rechargeable batteries that come with the set are excellent, and they've never run out of juice while using, and I've used them as long as 8 hours at a stretch before. A real nice feature of this RS series, is that I can bring my 120 cans into work and tune them to work with the 140's transmitter! Excellent wireless system - I recommend!

VFirst, I listen too a lot of "talk", Bloomberg, CNBC, NPR, PBS, News, etc, etc.. Second, I live in a one bedroom condo with a terrace.The sound quality is just fine for my use. The reception is just fine inside and out. It's just terrific to be able to listen out on the terrace without my laptop or a 1/4 mile of four different types of extension cords with connection adapters and knots. I can't comment on the battery life, as I don't use it for "extreme lengths of time". I can tell you that it lasts with, no problem, for at least four hours.As far as previous comments about a "blast of static". Well, if you move the tuning control, or move too far out of range, you'll lose reception and hear static, that's all. Also, I've had no problem with the signal dropping out.My main complaint? Well, the headset seems to be designed for a square head. Yes, that's right. It fits very well on a box or better, on a truncated wedge, like a slice of pie with the front cut off.Also, it doesn't sit well on the cradle and charge. You'll have to move it around. I try to get the earcups to catch the front edge of the cradle and that does it. Also, the right angle power plug on the cradle side doesn't sit flush and extends out about a millimeter from the bottom. Just enough to be annoying. I don't want to wall mount it because I have several devices that I use it on. What you see in the product's photo is the headset precisely balanced. (The phtographer was probably holding his breath while taking that picture.)All in all, I like it and I'm glad I purchased it. The price and quality balance out nicely. Good buy!

VGreat Wifi Headphone With One Caveat
p3302
sg5
VThese headphones provide great sound for the price. Just plug the base into an AC outlet and the RC audio out from the TV into the base, and you're ready to go. Rich bass, mid tones and high end are all there. They can be tuned into the TV properly with no fuzzy interference (at least in my house, where there is also wifi internet and wireless land lines), and get crystal clear reception. The range is pretty good too for walking around, and of course since it is not LED, the signal is not line of sight, so objects or a house wall or two can be in the way without hampering the sound. There is a volume and frequency knob on the phones themselves, so you don't have to get up and down traveling to the base to adjust either one. Everything can be done from your recliner. After you use them you just hang them on the base, and it recharges them for next time. The rechargeable battery has a very long life, as I have not had to replace it yet and have had the phones a few years now.That said, I don't know who designed the way they sit on your head, but if I try to walk around with them, say to go to the kitchen for a snack while I am listening to a show, they slide off my head too easily. In fact, I cannot look down at all (like into the sink, or into a silverware drawer) or they slide forward and right off. They are large and somewhat heavy, but it's the way the overhead band is curved or contoured that causes the problem. Maybe the newest ones have been re-designed, but if they allowed me to walk around just a little they'd get 5 starts.Even so I would buy another pair. I like them that much.

VDon't let the title fool you. I love these things. Unlike some of the other comments, I have had nothing but crystal clear sound from the moment I turned them on. I have even gone outside with them a short distance from the house and the sound is still clear and that with the base unit stored in the cabinet underneath the TV. I seldom get any interference. I will say that currently I only use the phones to listen to the TV. I haven't tried to use them in an audio, PC, or gaming application. At this point in time, I have the base connected to the audio output connectors on the TV.There are only 2 issues I have. The more annoying one is the fit. With the Sennheiser name, I thought the fit would be better. They "toe in" toward the front of my head creating pressure points just in front of my ears. After wearing them for a short while, this becomes less noticible but it is still there. The second is a burst of static when I pause the Tivo receiver I have for a few moments. I normally get around this by just turning the headphones off when I'm not actually listening to something (I do the same when a commercial comes on and I'm watching Live TV). The on/off switch is getting a workout and we'll have to see how it holds up after a period of time. Of course, taking them off works pretty well too.Pros:. Clear sound/great reception. Good range. rechargable batteries. quiet house for the rest of the family. better acoustics for the listener. PRICE (this is an exceptional price for this unit)Cons:. Uncomfortable fit (at least for my head). Annoying static during pauses

p3330
sg5
VI use these headphones at work to cancel out background distractions.  This is the thrid set of headphones that I have purchased for this purpose.  I particulary appreciate the rich sound quality of this set.  I also like the charging setup since previous units have required a plug to be inserted whereas these only need to be placed on the charging unit. Another feature that I appreciate is the "Tune" (I originally thought this was the "Tone" control and couldn't understand why the music would stop when I adjusted the tone).  Instead this control is used to accommodate for any drift in the transmitter/receiver link making is easy to make adjustments if the reception should degrad (I haven't really noticed this as a problem yet). The headset is operated about 10 hours a day (charged overnight every night) and the battery has never run down. I turn them on in the morning and off immediately prior to going home.  The base station transmitter will shut down if it doesn't sense incoming sound (i.e. the mute button on the musice souce is active).  As soon a sound inputs are resotred it turns itself back on.Things that I think could use improvement; the headband and the earphones are offset shich means that when the headband is directly over your ears the earphones are canted back about 30 degrees.  This affects the comfort of the headset.  Also, the on/off switch seems to be of cheap quality.  It hasn't given and sign of failure so far but I suspect it will the be first part to fail.Sennheiser RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle

VFirst the bad which are minor.1. I would like it if the tune and volume controls were not so close together but it is a minor thing.2. The connection cable ends in 2 RCA connectors. They include an adapter that plugs these into with a male 3.5 mm standard plug. The problem with this set up is there are going to be some situations where it is going to be very hard to plug in because of the size of the adapter. I can just barely plug it into my flat panel TV because of this. I promptly ordered a short extension off Amazon which will fix this. Again it is a minor thing.Now the good. These use replaceable AAA rechargeables. They come with 2 and I have some already so I was ready to go. I bought these to watch TV at night. I work odd hours so I often want to watch TV while the Wife is sleeping. Had been using a set of headphones with an extension cord which of course works, but is a PITA. I had looked at some of these that were cheaper and saw a lot of bad reviews. These work great, sound is about the same as the headphones I had been using, and no more wire in the way.  So I decided to see how they sound with music. Plugged into an MP3 player in bedroom and walked around the house. Sound quality is about the same as a set of cheap wired headphones. You do need to have the volume up all the way at the source to keep the hiss out. Now if you are expecting great sound quality, no you will not get it. This same company makes some of these that cost 3 times as much so I expect they would sound much better. Bottom line for the price of these you get your moneys worth.

VPurchased for my dad to use in a skilled care facility - can't have cords running across floor.  It works exactly as advertised, sound quality is more than adequate for television viewing.TV set was old and didn't have output jacks, so I installed a 1/4" audio plug from Radio Shack along with a micro switch to add ability to completely silence the existing TV speaker.  This leaves the option for others in the room to hear the TV while the headphones can be adjusted as loud as needed. The headphones have such a good preamp system, it does not take much volume at all from the speaker to get good sound, even with this older TV set.I did not experience the problem some reviewers had with getting the headphones to sit properly on the cradle for charging.  Bear in mind if purchasing for someone in a nursing home, though, that the transmitter will be sitting near or on top of the TV and the headphones will need to be returned there for charging.There is a dial to set the volume and another to match the frequency with the base unit, and these are close enough together to allow the wrong one to be turned.  Easily resolved with a small piece of tape over the frequency dial.  This minor annoyance is why I dropped the rating to 4 stars.Bottom line, I have no regrets selecting this product.  I would suggest it as a good option for someone in a setting where headphone cords would present a problem.  It is also an excellent option for households where one member has hearing problems.  Be prepared to modify older TV sets that do not have output jacks, however.

p3347

VWe're using as many other people do: to watch TV while not bothering other people in the house.  We purchased two of them, and for the most part they are very good.Pros:- Very comfortable.  Ear muffs are a comfortable cloth design, not plastic or foam.  Can wear for hours with no problem, unlike others I've tried.  Adjustable band doesn't slip while wearing.- Good (but not perfect) sound.  Good stereo, very clear, easily loud enough.  Open-air design means I can still hear things in room relatively well, which is good for holding a conversation -- while wearing the headsets -- without yelling.- Convenient charging.  The transmitter/base station is also the charger.  Hanging them on the wire hanger of the base charges the headphones (there are two metal strips on the underside of the headband which make contact with the wire hanger).  Nice not to have to plug/un-plug a charger, and then have to find where to lay down the headphones so they don't get damaged or look like a mess.  The Senheiser solution is very nice.- Good battery life.  I've yet to run out of a charge, even during long periods of use (a full day).Cons:- When audio feeding the base stations is very very low or muted for a couple of minutes, the base stations automatically stop transmitting.  This has the effect of the headsets going to just static noise at that point, which can be disconcerting.- The volume and tuning dials on the side of the headphone are very near one another and feel the same, so easy to be untuning the headphones when intending to adjust the volume instead.

VI've always wanted a set of wireless headphones so that I wouldn't be trailing 20-feet of coiled cord around but didn't want something so cheap that it would ruin the listening. Then I saw the RS-120s on sale at Amazon and decided they seemed like the right quality at the right price. And I'm not disappointed. Like all wireless devices, you have to expect some interference now and then, but I am almost always able to "tune" these using a combination of the channel setting, the tuner, the volume on the phones and the volume at the source. The sound is excellent once you hit that sweet spot and not bad when you're just off. Of course, noises generated by your sound source (radio, CD or whatever) will be magnified when they're playing right in your head, and hisses and pops that you wouldn't necessarily notice coming from your loudspeakers become very apparent. So the better the source, the better the sound on these. And it matters where you place the sending unit -- put it too close to an electrical source (certain light bulbs, your amp and so on) might introduce extraneous noise, so move that around a bit to find a quiet spot. The headphones are light, comfortable and fit me well enough (contrary to complaints from some of the one-star reviewers). They are not "sound-isolating" -- which is fine, I still want to hear the phone and people's voices if they are talking to me. Several friends who have come by have tried these and all said, "I have to get a pair of these!" I certainly recommend these, especially when they come around at under $50.

V6 YEARS OLD AND STILL GOING STRONG!
p3365
sg5
VOK - this review is coming a little late because I purchased these headphones in 2008 - and I still have them - and I am still using them every day. How many reasonable inexpensive electronic items do you buy today that last that long?The only problem that I have had with them was that a part of the plastic cracked on the headband about four years after my purchase and I was very happy to find that I could buy a replacement headset without the base - which I did.  I later discovered that I was able to repair the cracked plastic with some crazy glue, so I now have two sets of working phones with one recharging base. This works out well because I do not worry about replacing the headphones on the charging base every day. I just rotate the phones when the charge runs down, I just replace it with the fully charged one on the base.  One is always on the base recharging while I use the other one.As far as the noise and static that other reviewers have complained about, I have not experienced any myself. I think that this might be due to other wireless devices such as wireless phones or routers nearby that are causing interference.I guess that the fact that Sennheiser have been successfully selling the same model for so many years is testament to the quality of the unit. If they failed tomorrow, I would buy another in a minute. Being a sufferer of loss of hearing, these headphones have been a marriage saver because I no longer have to have the TV or my music turning up so loud to drive my wife out of the house.

VBest Value for Wireless Headphones
p3371
sg5
VAfter doing a bit of research and pricing, I ordered these Sennheiser RS 120 wireless headphones for these reasons: I have used Sennheiser in the past and like the quality, this set is only $69.99 and includes charging cradle so I won't have to mess with switching batteries.  They are very easy to operate, my channel and tune was correct right out of the box, so they worked immediately after charging. The range is excellent, my base is somewhat centralized but I can walk anywhere in my 1600 sq. ft. home as well as the front or backyard with no interruptions.I have no complaints, they are perfect for what I need them for, but my boyfriend says the bass isn't very good, so if that's a big requirement for you - you may want something else. For wireless including charger, you can't beat the price for the quality.  Great Value!There is a small bit of "static" if you're using a high volume on the headphones themselves.  However, if you keep the headphone volume lower and turn it up on your TV, PC (or whatever you're using) it will sound much better.For people saying they didn't work, try this: put the batteries in the headphones, plug the charging cradle into the wall, make sure "charge" lights up when you place the headphones on the cradle (metal to metal), leave them there for at least 18 hours before using.  If they still do not work, try changing the channel at the bottom front of the charging cradle and slowly tune them on the headphones until music is clear.  Also make sure they volume is actually turned up.

VI purchased these wireless headphones because I'm on a one-year deployment to Afghanistan.  I'm sharing a room with three other guys, and while we have plywood walls separating our living areas, I wanted to be able to watch television and listen to music without disturbing them.Conveniently, the base for  these headphones can be set on a shelf or hung on a wall (hardware not included).  The audio and power cables are plenty long -- a good 6 feet or so each.  The set also comes with adapters so you can use it with RCA, 1/4 inch or 3.5 mm audio jacks.For the price, the sound quality on these headphones is excellent.  Whether watching TV, listening to music, or Skyping with my family, there are no background hisses or pops.  It sounds just like a set of headphones plugged directly into a device.  The only somewhat annoying feature these headphones have is that the transmitter shuts off after about 5 minutes of inactivity, so if your music stops playing and you forget you're wearing them, about 5 minutes later you'll get a sudden burst of static when the transmitter shuts off.  Not overly annoying, but if you were rocking out with your music turned up it can startle you quite a bit!I've had this set of headphones about 5 months now and they have held up perfectly.  I have noticed no undue wear and tear, and the battery life remains exceptional.  I watch 1-2 hours of television every night and Skype with my family for 20 minutes or so every day and find I charge these about once every week to 10 days.

VI read most the reviews before ordering my Sennheiser wireless headphones with charging cradle.  We have three TV's, but I only wanted to order one to test it out.  My husband loves listening to sports on the living room TV set and I am not a sports fan.  I would often ask him to turn the TV down and he would get annoyed at me.  I bought this for that TV and he hooked it up.  At first, he did have static in the earphones. But he had the living room TV hooked up through his giant speakers that he also uses for his CD Player.  I suggested he take the TV off those speakers and just let it work thru the TV speakers.  When he did that, there was absolutely no static.  The sound is terrific, clear, and the earphones are very comfortable to wear.  Now he can watch sports all the time and not bother me.  Also, our house has an open floorplan and the kitchen opens to the living room.  I like to turn on the kitchen TV to watch news when I am cooking.  He dislikes hearing that set.  So I ordered a second Sennheiser set for the small TV in the kitchen.  Now I can watch news and work in the kitchen and it doesn't bother him.  I credit this product for saving our marriage from discord over different tastes in TV viewing.  I was so happy with the product that I ordered a third set for the library TV.  They are real easy to hook up and all three worked perfectly with clear sound and comfortable to wear.  If someone in your house plays the TV too much or too loud, this is a perfect solution, and very reasonably priced for the quality you get.

VI received this as a birthday gift from my wife. I was worried that headphones like these would be either uncomfortable, or not very well built. I have been using them for six weeks and so far they have worked great. They are very comfortable and enable me or anyone in the family to watch TV without disturbing anyone else. We like to congregate in the family room to talk, play games, do homework and watch TV. But it can be so annoying for the people who are not interested in whatever is on the tube. So these headphones allow us to watch our shows at full volume without interfering with everyone else. They also allow me to watch a late night movie at full volume while the rest of the family sleeps.I like how the stand doubles as a charging station so I don't have to worry about them going dead. Setting them up was simple. Using them is as simple as flipping a switch on the headphones to turn them on and then turning down the volume on the TV. On occasion I do get a little static and so there is an adjustment dial to help with that. There are also several "channels" for transmitting from the base to the headphones in case one of them isn't working particularly well. I have only had to adjust that one time.I cannot speak much to their durability as I have only had them a short time, but they appear to be well built. If that changes I will revise my review.The sound quality is very good; not magnificent, but very good. All in all I really like these headphones and am satisfied with them.

VI got this head phones from my sons for Charismas. Now a day we kind of tell each other of what we really want for charismas. I have been looking for a wireless head phone for long time. I was looking into blue tooth, and many brand the price from $20 to $200, but never got a chance to try them because they are no test product available in any store. Any way WOW I love this head phones the first time I put them on I was so happy. 1st. I love the sound because it there is no eco and the sound is so soft and clear. For the movie I don't need surround sound any more because the sound bounce around in my head phone and create nice movie sound. I am really recommending every one to use head phone to watch the shows because I discover many sound that I was missing while I was listening with out the head phones. It is also great when my mom comes over and starts talking none stop, I just put it on. The way it made that I can still hear my wife when she talks to me, but I don't know it a good thing or not Ha Ha. The only 2 things that I don't like is 1. There is not bass adjustment2. I look kind of big my head, the hard plastic curve around my head make me look like one of those Japanese pilot actor in the Gozara movie. If Sennheiser can make it look, and fit better like one of that Motorola blue tooth, it will be a big improvement.Add to reviews 12-17-11. it seem to fall off my head easy if I forgot to ben down, and the battery is already not keep charge after a year, but it ok i can but new batteries

VI bought these headphones as a good compromise between something *really* expensive, and something really cheap.  For the price, they deliver a very good sound.  I'm not going to go into the sound so much, as there are plenty of reviews for that, but a few things I did find were that I concur with other reviewers that there is some interference/static.  I don't have to go very far in my house to start hearing slight static noises, especially if I go into another room.  Normally I wear these if I'm doing housework, or vacuuming, and walking around causes some annoying static.  Not enough to ruin the listening experience, but more than I want.  Also, these are uncomfortable on my head.  The ear cups are flat, not cupped, and when they are on my ears, part of it presses against my jawbone near my ear, causing discomfort after just a few minutes of use.  I was going to return them for this problem, but I find that if I turn them around, the shape of them holds them off my jawbone.  It looks funny, and there the sound is not as rich as if they were fully cupped on my ears, but it's the only way I can wear them comfortably.  Even still, as with most headphones I've found, they get uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing (they are not very light).Overall, I bought these for the wireless ability, and they work very well for that (even with some static issues).  But as a set of headphones (if they were wired), they are not that great, not ergonomic (for my head) and not very light.

VFirst,let me state that I only use these headphones to watch TV and surf the web from my laptop.  I cannot comment on range, however I cannot recommend these headphones for anything other then sedentary use.  The headphones themselves are quite heavy due to the batteries and the fact that the headband is also the charger.  Adjustment is "iffy" and unless sitting fairly still, they want to fall off if you move your head to much.  I could not use them for working out or other activity.Having said that, I gave them four stars because they are performing for what I bought them for, as previously stated.  The sound is pretty good for the price.  The head phones are comfortable for short term use.  I do take them off when surfing the web.  Since I watch TV while I surf, I tend to pause TV while surfing.  If you leave the head phones on your head while TV is paused, the sound will shut off after about two minutes unless you are watching video on line.  The result is static in your ears.  You can leave the headphones on your head and shut them off via the switch or you can take them off during web time.  I find that somewhat annoying, but then I realized that the head phones were not that comfortable to wear when not necessary.  Also once you go back to video or TV (DVD etc.) and hit play, the sound resumes in about a second.  At that point I am usually ff through ads anyway!So, four stars for performing for MY purpose, but not five for the observations I have noted.
