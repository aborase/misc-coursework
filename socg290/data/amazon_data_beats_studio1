VUPDATE 12/12/15: Recently my Beats Studio Wireless headphones began dropping the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone, especially when skipping a song. At first I thought it was the iPhone but after testing the Beats with other devices I realized it was the Beats! Reading the forums reveal that this is a common issue. The solution seemed to be a firmware update. Some people mentioned that updating the firmware "bricked" their headphones but I can say that after installing the Beats Updater on my MacBook Pro and updating the firmware, the problem has been eliminated. The headphones have since maintained a solid Bluetooth connection to any device that I connect them to.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Since my family now owns both Bose QC25s (wife's in White/Khaki) and Beats Studio Wireless headsets (mine in Matte Black), I feel like I can finally write a completely informed review and comparison test between the two. I am also a headphone/earbud nut that owns the now defunct Logitech Ultimate Ears Active Noise Canceling UE9000s and eight decent quality earbuds and I have a brother that owns several products that I don't. I have spent weeks comparing and sampling many of these products so I can give you the best review that I'm capable of writing.Testing procedure \u2013 while it's not scientific I spent a lot of time with these products listening to a wide array of music. I left the headsets on my head for hours on end while exercising, doing household chores and flying across the country on commercial airlines. Also, it took me two weeks to write this review as I continued to test and compare the Bose and Beats with a huge library of music that ranged from Eminem to Emmylou Harris.I didn't test the headphones with lossless audio or vinyl records playing through analog tube amps. I used an iPad, iPhone and a couple of different iPods as audio sources since that's what the majority of us use these days. The songs are Apple AAC files sampled at 256 kbps.I'm going to cover every detail that I can think of since good research is imperative before dropping $300+ on headphones. Let's get started...BUILD QUALITY(Winner) Bose QC-25 \u2013 The materials that Bose uses in the construction of the QC25s are absolutely first class. The plastic feels solid and the aluminum feels like it was intended for use in an aerospace project and the padding on the head band is thick padded velour. One issue is the fabric used on the top of the headband. My wife's headphones are the cool looking white with tan ear-cups and teal accents and cord. The white fabric gets dirty really fast. Bose is very aware of this because when I asked an employee at the Bose kiosk at Lenox Mall in Atlanta about it, they told me, without hesitation, that a Tide stain wipe cleans it up. That area should be leather, plastic or aircraft aluminum, not white fabric. The cord (we'll talk about this more later) plugs in with a satisfyingly snug click. The buttons on the cord are the one of two soft spot for the Bose and you'd have to be really picky to fuss over such a small detail but they feel a little cheap.Beats aren't too far off in build quality but they fall short only because they feel a little more "plasticy" and fragile when folding them for storage in the included case. The shuttle buttons built into the beats logo on the left side feel a little "clicky." Compared to the previous generation of Beats, the new Studios are a lightyears ahead in build quality. While I am testing the wireless version of the Beats Studio, they still come with cords, lots of cords. The one that I use most (to extend battery life or plug into non-bluetooth devices) is the one with the shuttle buttons. The cord is thicker than the Bose and is less tangle prone. Out of the box it does not lay straight but keeps some of it's rolled up shaped, especially in the cold. This lessens with use. The buttons click with a much smoother, satisfying click (again, picky but what the heck). I had a hard time getting the micro USB plug plugged into the headphones for charging. The plug was very tight but over time it loosens up a bit.COMFORT(Winner) The Bose QC25s are the lightest weighing and the lightest clamping headsets I have ever put on my head thus making them the most comfortable, especially when wearing them over long periods of time. After wearing my Beats Studios for 20-minutes I put on the Bose and they felt funny they were so light. They felt like those OLD Walkman headphones that were nothing more than a bowed wire with foam and plastic discs on each end. In reverse, after wearing the Bose for 20-minutes, the Beats felt noticeably heavier.The Beats aren't what I'd call heavy and without the two side-by-side, the Beats feel pretty good even when wearing them for an hour or more but in direct comparison to the Bose, you feel the difference. Additionally, Beats clamp harder so they fall short of the Bose in comfort.To put numbers on the weight:\u2022 Bose 196.6g\u2022 Beats 260gAnother win for the Bose is the depth of the ear cups. They are deep enough that people with large or protruding ears will not have an issue. In contrast, the Beats ear cups are much shallower. They are so shallow that my small, non-protruding ears touch the foam pad inside the cup. It's a minor annoyance will bother some people. See accompanying photo.SOUNDThis is what we buy headphones that cost over $300, right? Just so you know, when listening to music, I like to hear all of the sound that the producer and sound engineer intended. I'm not a bass-head but more of a bass-o-phile in that I prefer full, smooth, defined bass. Skullcandy has these headphones called Crushers that have a slider where a user can dial in the amount of skull crushing thump that they want. Dialed up to the max, these things almost bounce off of your head. While it may be fun, the bass is terribly artificial and completely lacks detail. It's not what I call good listening and the fun wears off pretty quickly.(Winner) Beats Studio Wireless. Beats products are well known for their huge, Hip-hop bass. In early versions Dre and Company made the bass more of a novelty rather than a quality audio asset. Fortunately, they reeled in the bass when designing the Studio models. The bass is now lighter, tighter and so well controlled that it's much more pleasing to listen to across a wide range of music. I was in an Apple Store in Nashville, TN when I first donned a demo set of Beats Studios. I started flipping through the demo music on the iPad Touch and I was very impressed with the sound, track after track. Months later, a demoed another pair at the Apple Store in Georgetown, DC and was again really impressed. So, eventually I pulled the trigger and bought a pair.In order to give you a review that you can replicate and hear the differences for yourself, I tried to pick tracks that showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each headset. If you can get your hands on the hardware, see if you agree with me on these songs.Timbaland and Elton John team up for a song called "2 Man Show." The very first beat is a deep bass hit that sounds rough and unimpressive but stay with it and at 0:44 some smooth, harmonic backing vocals come in with an underlying bass line that is really deep...oh but wait...at 0:48, the bass line goes down about a low as speakers, let alone headsets, like to go. When listening to this song on Definitive Technology home speakers with internal powered subs at moderate volume levels, the room shakes. Amazingly, the Beats fully enunciate the smooth, deep audio with no distortion to the point that it shakes my head. It's awesome and a true test for bass capable headphones.When the chorus starts in "Break Up In A Small Town" by Sam Hunt the Beats Studios deliver every decibel that the sound engineer and producer meant for you to hear, and they throw the kitchen sink at you. Turn them up and at 0:50 (when he sings "She would get DOWN...) you will be treated to a beautiful bass hit that kicks of a window rattling chorus that when heard on these headphones sounds absolutely marvelous. Bass hits like that terrify weaker headphones. The Beats take the challenge so easily that they make it clear they can take more. A cool thing happens in this song at 2:44. All of the heavy electric instrumentation immediately stops leaving only a light piano and solo guitar with Sam's voice. It's like someone suddenly unplugging half of the music. The cool thing is that the Studios handle the transition extremely well. I compared an old pair of first generation Beats using this same track at 2:44, the heavy bass headphones left the mid-tones hanging out to dry, revealing their inability to clear mids and solid vocals. The Studios on the other hand sounded as good with a wall of sound crushing your skull as they did listening to melodic acoustic tones.But bass isn't the only thing the Beats Studio's deliver. They do a great job with details in the upper register too. "No More Miracles" by Kid Ink starts off with Elle Verner screeching out "I never waited on a miracle, there ain't no miracles 'round here" over a strumming mandolin. The Beats deliver her vocal rasp with such precision it's almost like she was in the room with you. As a light bass line enters the mix and you can clearly hear the bass player rapidly fingering the string to keep the line humming along with the vocals. Using the Bose, the bass line sounds artificial, like it's being produced from a synth. Later in the song, at 0:24, well delivered bass kicks in as the song goes full-on Hip-hop. I'm so accustomed to sloppy Hip-hop that when you hear this song on the Beats, it's like hearing it for the first time. This song can be a challenge for some headphone as a delicate mandolin can easily get drowned out by deep rumbling bass but the Beats show their balance as both are forward and clearly audible. Listen to this track on Beats Studios for the first time and once it ends you'll want to play it again. I promise.Diana Krall and Bryan Adams (yeah, that one) cover "Feels Like Home" written and originally sung by Chantal Kreviazuk. Diana's piano is so well reproduced that it sounds like she's playing it right behind you but the best part is that Diana's whiskey, lounge-singer voice drifts like wisps of cigarette smoke gently floating into your ears. Every detail of her complex voice is revealed with crisp audio clarity. If the seventeen seconds of Diana's voice and smooth rolling piano, between 0:51-1:12 don't convince you that these aren't just Hip-hop bass beasts then you are either tone deaf or biased against the Beats brand. This short moment in time is near audio perfection and the Beats deliver it flawlessly.When my iPhone shuffled across Little Big Town's "Girl Crush" I stopped what I was doing, sat down, closed my eyes and took in subtle details of the song that I had only heard through Shure SE 535s or my home Def Tech home speakers.Contrary to what I thought before owning them, Beats Studios are definitely a headphone engineered for serious music listeners. Note that they are not neutral or flat but they are balanced. Purists will still snub their nose at the manipulated EQ but it's perfect for people that stream Spotify or listen to tracks downloaded from iTunes. For those that sit at home listening to Wagner or Beethoven on vinyl through tube amps on $1,500 Sennheiser H800 or Grado PS1000s, the Beats are not for you. But for the other 98% of us, they will seriously impress you.**Interesting note. I had read that the Beats sounded better over Bluetooth than wired. I was a little perplexed and a lot skeptical. After hours and days of testing, I have to agree with that reviewer. The BT slightly outperforms wired. The wired sound is a little muffled sounding compared to BT. I'm still perplexed but no longer skeptical.Bose is not known for bass and the QC25s live up to that reputation. They are on par with the QC15s they replaced but that's not saying much. Where they shine is in the mid range, exactly where the Beats are weakest. The highs and lows sound muffled compared to the Beats but mids are more revealed.Bose produces amazing, but slightly muted, vocals and smooth instrumental tones. Close your eyes while listening to both "Beethoven's 5 Secrets" or "Kung Fu Piano: Cello Ascends" by The Piano Guys and you'll hear a cello sing with such a mellow baritone voice that it'll feel like it melts like butter into your ears. I played "Cello Ascends" for a co-worker to get his opinion of the two headphones. When using the QC25s, he sat there with his eyes closed totally absorbed in the superbly reproduced music. When the song had finished playing he pulled the headphones off and with a huge smile said, "Wow. With the noise canceling on, I totally forgot I was at the office. You can get lost with those things on." I felt that was a solid review of the Bose when listening to songs that deliver mellow, mid-range audio that don't have demanding bass.But, if you go back to Sam Hunt's "Breaking Up In A Small Town," you just don't get the punch that you get with other bass rich headphones like the Beats Studios. Don't get me wrong, these things sound pretty good but they don't deliver the same, full listening experience. They provide detail and precision but without the ultra deep, rich sounds that physically move you and the crystal clear highs. If these are all you listen to, I don't think you'd crave more bass but if you do any A-B testing with the Studios, you'll hear what you're missing and wish for more.The same thing happens in Pittbull and Marc Anthony's "Rain Over Me." During Marc Anthony's main riff a huge bass roll drops from a low to almost sub-sonic in the first two seconds of the song. With the Bose on, the bass fades as it bottoms out. They just can't handle the low frequency.NOISE CANCELINGBOSE WINS BY A MILE...or more. I used the Bose side-by-side with the Beats on a commercial flight and with the music playing at modest levels, the Bose QC25s filtered out what I'd call 90 percent of the engine noise. Bose has PERFECTED Active Noise Reduction (ANR). Bose owns ANR. Even without music playing they greatly reduced engine noise.In the housework test, yes I'm Renaissance man that vacuums and cleans toilets, the Bose nearly drown out all of the vacuum cleaner noise and help take my mind off of the mundane chores.A common side effect of non-Bose ANR systems is hiss. Bose ANR produces absolutely no hiss.I was severely disappointed with Beats ANC (Adaptive Noise Canceling) performance while flying in a commercial airplane or while riding on a Washington, DC subway. While I gave Bose a 90% ANR effectiveness, I'd give Beats 50% at best. I had to crank up the volume to uncomfortable levels to get the jet engine noise abated to the levels Bose was delivering. Without music playing, the Beats might as well not have had any ANC. This is again surprising since Beats claims to have dual adaptive noise canceling modes. From the Beats Website "ANC automatically strikes a balance between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, ANC only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancellation, for a quieter world." Huh? The owners manual does not tell you how to get to these modes so one is left to figure it out them self or just assume that when music is playing, you are in music mode and when it is not...you know what I mean. BUT, I did figure out that if you press and hold the "b" button while listening to music wirelessly, you will get the Beats power up/down tone and the headphones will switch to non-music ANC mode. Press and hold and it will switch back. I could not find this explained in the owners manual.In the housework test, the Beats don't fully erase the noise of the vacuum cleaner but they help. Where they DO shine in the housework area is NO CORD! More on that below.As a general rule, we don't spend half of our life flying in airplanes. Most of our listening is done in residential or public spaces where Beats does a decent job reducing ambient noises that can interfere with your overall listening experience. Subways, street noise or at home with a clothes dryer going in the background are great examples of sounds that are well reduced by the Beats.As for the hiss, it's mild compared to sets like the Ultimate Ears UE9000 ANR but it's presence can be a little irritating, especially when you know ANR like Bose exists.If you want or need perfect ANR performance...go Bose. Period. End of story.WIRELESS(Winner) Beats has proven that Bluetooth can sound great (even better than wired). They have nailed BT with the Studios. I am so spoiled by the BT that I find using a cord to be a tangling, snagging hassle. The one issue I have is that I cannot get Siri to activate using the "b" button in wireless mode (remember pressing and holding the "b" button switches ANC modes). She only works wired using the inline iPod controls. Sad, but not too much of a problem and I can reach into my pocket and activate Siri from the phone.One oddity is that the shuttle buttons on the outside of the ear cups only work in wireless mode. You have to use the in-line iPod controls on the cord when wired. BUT, while wired, the "b" button becomes a bypass button. Press and hold the button while listening to wired music and the headphones mute (not pause) so you can converse with out yelling or needing to be yelled at. Pretty cool I guess but since the majority of my listening is wireless, this does not work.As I mentioned above, while doing housework wireless wins! I have caught the cord of other headphones and earbuds countless times on drawer pulls and yanked the headphones off of my head or the buds out of my ears. When washing cars, working around the house or just multitasking, wireless is the way to go, good ANR or not!For Bose, this is an easy one since the QC25s don't come with a wireless option. Bose does make a non-ANR wireless model but they fail miserably in audio quality. Why not merge the two products into one and make a great sounding, noise-canceling, Bluetooth headphone? That sounds like a winning product to me!While doing housework I have to route the cord into my shirt to keep if from snagging on things. Not ideal.CALL QUALITY(Winner) Beats Studio. The call microphone is on the side of the headset. Everything I know about sound leads me to believe that a caller on the other end of the line should not hear me as well as the in-line mic hanging below my chin on the Bose cord. But that is the case. I talk to my brother a lot using the Beats and he tells me that he cannot tell that I'm not holding the phone up to my ear.Bose put a mic on the back of the inline iPod controller that lies right below your chin. It's perfectly placed for great audio pick up but even in the best conditions it has a slight speakerphone sound that disappoints me a bit. It's still clear but not as clear as the Beats.EXTRASAccessories(Winner) Bose comes with a case, two-AAA Duracell Batteries, a cord (in the white version) with shuttle buttons and mic and a commercial airplane adapter.Beats comes with a case, a red mobile phone cord with black shuttle buttons, a black cord without buttons, a red USB-to-micro-USB charging cord and a USB wall plug with folding prongs.Bose wins Accessories for two reasons. First, being battery powered means no extra cords or wall plugs (no matter how Beats spins the supposed benefits of the rechargeable battery thing) and second, the airplane adapter. Beats can keep the straight audio cord and power accessories and give me battery power and an airplane adapter...although there would be nowhere to store them (see below).Cases(Winner) The Bose case is as thin as you can make a headphones case and comes in a very standard rectangle shape that fits into any messenger bag, back pack or suitcase. The small footprint and thinness mean some origami folding of the headphones to get them seated, but Bose solved for that and even embossed a diagram on the inside of the case (thank you). It has a place for a spare battery AAA battery (awesome) and airplane adapter. One oddity is that the pocket for the cord is on the outside of the case. I'd greatly prefer that the pocket be inside. My wife never puts the cord in the outside pocket, she just sets it on top of the headset and zips the case closed. She's afraid that over time the stretchy material will lose elasticity and the cord might fall out while traveling.The Beats case is oddly shaped like an egg. It fits in my Osprey Spin 32 backpack and in my carry-on-sized suitcase but it is awkward to carry in my average Timbuk2 or leather messenger bags. Beats must know that this is an issue as they include a carabiner that allows the egg to be clipped to the outside of a bag. The egg-shape is much harder to deal with and it has NO pockets for cords and accessories. A very strange omission for a headset that comes with THREE cords and a wall plug!POWER(Winner) Bose uses a replaceable, off-the-shelf AAA battery for power and I LOVE IT! If your battery dies, just pop in the spare battery that's nestled in the carrying case. If you forget to replace that spare? Not problem, the Bose will work without power while you make your way to any store that sells AAAs.Beats website says "Dead batteries can kill your vibe." Uh, okay but what if the internal rechargeable battery dies and you can't get to a power outlet? That kills your vibe even more since you'll have no sound. In this case, no charge means no music since the Studios only work with power, just like the old QC15s did. I'm not sure why Beats decided to do this but it was definitely a conscious decision that I will speculate was done because without the powered amp, the tuned equalization and the minimal adaptive noise cancelation working, the Beats don't sound very good.NOISE LEAKBose are so light and the head clamp is so relaxed, they leak way more sound than the Beats.SUMMARYBose and Beats both makes quality, well engineered products for which people are willingly to pay a premium for the brand name and the performance. It's amazing how opposite these headphones are but that fact makes it easier to decide between the two.Listening to certain genres, the Bose sound good enough to justify their price point. Add in the superior noise canceling and they are worth every penny. If you are a traveler that needs ANR headphones in noisy environments and loves great sound, buy the Bose.If you use headphones in more civil environments and love deep, rich bass and crisp, clear highs that accentuate the subtle nuances hidden in your music, get the Beats Studio Wireless.Or you don't mind your music artificially manipulated to enhance today's music and you like your tunes to vibrate your noggin once in a while and can accept mediocre noise canceling, go with Beats Studio.As both brands evolve and develop qualities of the competitive products, the consumer will be the winner.I hope you find this review helpful.(One word of warning, the Beats and Bose will reveal poorly sampled music. Get ready to update your library to 256 kbps AAC or better)

VI'm just going to get this out of the way: these headphones do not produce accurate sound and their sound quality is easily trumped by a $200 pair of Sennheiser or AKG headphones.  Then again, Beats have never, ever been about producing an accurate sound.  Marketing aside, the Studio line of Beats headphones has always been about reproducing a live concert environment where the bass and highs are turned way up.  This dynamic compression is common with many rock concerts.  Go to a Rob Zombie show where the bass moves your clothes and the guitars are piercing, that's what the Beats Studio have always tried to do.These are the new 2013 models and they are vastly improved over the previous editions.  They are sturdier, look much better (the matte black make me look like a kid about to go to a rave or a DMX concert), the sound quality has been drastically improved (it's actually more balanced), and the Bluetooth wireless performance has been great for me with my iPhone 5 (iOS 7.0.4), iPad mini (iOS 7.0.4), and 2012 15" MacBook Pro (OS X 10.9.1).I'll start with the design.  Beats has implemented a design that hides all the screws.  This means that they shouldn't be unscrewing themselves and falling out like the previous Studio model.  Beats have retained the plastic-heavy design along with a thing headband pad but these look sleeker.  They also don't stick out from the sides as much as the first Studio models.  The inclusion of matte black (and even matte titanium) mean that everyday people can buy these.  Beats still offers their standard glossy black color for the younger crowd.  Fortunately, the obnoxious green, pink,  yellow, and red colors are gone from the wireless Studio headphones.  I'm OK with bright color and headphones but not for huge cans like these.  It just screams "look at me, aren't I special?!" when they come in the lime green color.  The matte black is my favorite and looks really nice.As I said, the sound quality is improved over the previous Studio models and I think these are the best sounding Beats to date.  Much better than the unbalanced Mixr, Solo HD, Pro, and even their other wireless headphones (which are pretty much Solo HD's with Bluetooth capabilities).  The sound is not muddy like the previous Studio models which had way too much bass with everything else muted as a result.  A dynamic compression has been applied to the new Studio headphones so the bass, while still more than most other headphones, is more balanced with the highs now.  Modern rock, heavy metal, nu-metal, dubstep, rap, and pop all sound great with these headphones.  It's like experiencing a concert with the band/artist playing.  Again, it's not accurate but it is still a nice experience.  People who listen to classical, inidi rock, real bluegrass (i.e. not Mumford & Sons), and other genres of music with simpler setups probably won't like these headphones as those genres tend to be more balanced across the lows, highs, and mids.  The new Studio headphones are nice for the lows and highs (albeit a higher than normal) but not the mids, those are kind of lost in their mix.These also feature active noise canceling (ANC) which is a nice feature but it cannot be turned off.  You must use these headphones with ANC enabled wired or wireless.  Additionally, once the internal battery dies (it's rated at 20 hours for wired use, 12 hours for wireless but I've been getting about 12.5-13 hours of wireless use), you're done and need to recharge them.  The nice thing is that Beats includes an AC adapter and USB cable to recharge these.  My MacBook Pro charges them up in the same amount of time as the Beats AC adapter: it takes a little over an hour.  The battery indicator light is also accurate whereas the last Studio models weren't.  Some people don't like the idea of having an internal, rechargeable battery since they can just take a pack of AAA batteries with them.  I prefer having the rechargeable battery though.  It uses the same USB connection as many smartphones now and it's a better solution for the environment.  The battery life seems to have improved as well.  My old wired Studio headphones would need new AAA batteries about once a week with my casual listening.  I'm charging these headphones about once every 1.5 weeks through casual listening.These Beats come with everything you need to use them.  A semi-rigid carrying case, a standard 3.5mm male-to-male cord, a 3.5mm male-to-male cord with Apple device control support (and basic Android functionality), a USB cable, an AC adapter, warranty and product information, and a cloth for cleaning them.The only reason I'm giving these a 4 out of 5 stars is due to the sound quality.  For $375, these should have a more accurate and balanced sound.  They are easily some of the best sounding fashion headphones on the market and I can wear them for hours without issues but other headphones with this type of sound quality cost less.  Had these been more in the $250-$300 range, I would have given them a 5 star rating.I would recommend these headphones for anyone who wants quality Bluetooth headphones and listens to the genres I previously listed.  The sound quality isn't perfect but it, along with the build quality, are improved over the previous generation of Beats.  The matte black and titanium models look elegant while still standing out as distinct Beats headphones (though not obnoxious like the lime green Mixr headphones).

VThese are amazing headphones, I bought the in a different store (offline).Sound is great, and you get used to it very quickly.But I am very disappointed by customer service and the way they constructed. After 1 month of *careful* usage, I saw 2 tiny cracks. During next month they became bigger and bigger, until it just broke.So 2 months and $400 headphones are broken. Sound is till working, so Genius Bar (Apple support who is in charge now for Dre Beats) said they can't take it for service as this is "physical damage".I don't know what is wrong with the construction of these headphone, maybe my head is just too big (joke), but customer service really disappointed me :(So I had to glue it back and keep enjoying. But these are my (first and) last Beats headphones.

VAs is widely known, Beats are extremely overpriced for the quality you get in return.  With that known, the wired version of the studio's are frankly a silly buy in my opinion, you can get much more bang for the buck elsewhere.  For 300$, you are really getting a 150$ pair of headphones, albeit, with the beats logo if you need that.But when it comes to Bluetooth quality over the ear headphones, the options are not as numerous so it does make these a bit more sensible.  Their main competitor is probably the bose ae2w and in comparing it to them, I enjoy the fit better, they don't have a silly mic extension sticking out and they sound better, noticeably better.  It's still quite the hike up in price for them but again, if looking for a Bluetooth headset of some decent quality, it is easier to swallow that price hike.I do like the case and accessories and was a big fan of the black matte finish.  While they do feel solid, I do wish they weren't as plastic-ey as the are.  For the price paid, they should have a more premium construction/look to them.  I also was disappointed they don't multipair or have any sort of mutli device memory function.  From what I can tell, you need to re-pair with devices each time when switching.  The anc does produce a slight hiss and yes, it's not in the same stratosphere as the bose anc.  But in this argument, I personally side with the quality sound of the beats over the anc of the bose.  The parrot wireless model do sound better but that look and feel chased me away pretty quick, the fit was horrendous.The big sell here is wireless.  Had they not been, which the 300$ studio's are, they would not have held any personal appeal.  The positives they do have, they have because it's in comparison to what the Bluetooth market currently provides. As a wired headset, even though you won't get the beats branding, your money is just so much better spent elsewhere.  But because of that wireless and their sleek foldable nature, the beats studio wireless wins in the all important category of real word usability.  I find myself reaching for these over better sounding wired pairs I have just because of the convenience of the wireless.  I do wish it had device switching without re-pairing but even that process isn't anything more then 10-20 seconds.

VI absolutely dislike them. Yeah sure they have great music quality and the battery lasts a while, but they aren't any good to me if I play the music through them with them on my desk because they snapped in half. It broke right above the hinge. 1 month into using them I went to put them on and they snapped. The ear muff fabric/leather or whatever also is falling off. I've superglued them and that doesn't last longer than a day. The warrantee ONLY COVERS ELECTRICAL FAILURES!!! Do not buy them because that's the biggest piece of crap warrantee that I've ever seen, and the construction is aweful. I would send them back for a refund if I could but I can't because they broke and aren't warranteed practically at all.

VI own the Beats Pro headphones which have a great sound but I wanted to have a more portable pair. I received my Beats Studio Wireless for Christmas. I didn't know what the sound quality was gonna be since I've never used Bluetooth headphones before. The sound quality of these are pretty good. Pretty good bass response which isn't overpowering. Nice high and midrange as well. The headphones are also light and very comfortable for long amounts of listening. The price is kinda crazy but I would definitely recommend these to anyone.

VThis is absolutely amazing. Previously I had regular studio beats in pink. Those lasted about a year. I revived these as a gift over a year ago and they still work perfectly. Aside from the charging port having a bit of an attitude, (the charger has to be placed perfectly into the port, but holds snuggly after its placed), they are great quality. All the commands can be executed wirelessly from the left headphone. This includes pause, play, volume up, volume done, skip back, and skip forward. They also connect easily with every phone I have paired it with (iPhone 4, iPhone 6, samsung s6, Motorola G, and HTC phones), while with most other Bluetooth speakers don't connect right away or you have to restart Bluetooth many times.  They charge quickly, and the color doesn't chip or scratch. They hold battery very well and will last all day on a full charge. The headphones extend very far and fit every person I know who has tried them. They also play music from the folded position. It also has a port for a cable, if Bluetooth isn't what you want to use it for. It does come with a white and gold cable, and a red and black cable that has the command box on them. The case that it comes with is very durable and I feel very comfortable with them in the case.  Furthermore, the color IS gold. I know it seems silly to say that, but many times a color is advertised, but when you receive it, it's darker or lighter than you expected. This is definitely gold.I love these so much and I use them constantly. Definitely worth it.

VI officially own two pairs of these headphones, purchased off of Amazon.com.  This matte black pair of the Studio Wireless headphones was the first pair, and I also own the White with red.Battery life on this in wireless mode will easily handle 10-12 hours.  I'd been using it every day in the office for approx. 7-8 hours a day.  Sound quality is very good considering that we're talking about something over bluetooth instead of plugged into the 3.5mm port of your device (however, I would say bluetooth-based sound devices have vastly improved over the last several years).These headphones are comfortable for all day use, in my opinion, especially for one whose head is melon-sized as mine (size 8 hat in Men's size).  I would say though that if you're going to be integrating these into a more active lifestyle purpose, you will notice that they will get noticeably warm and that you're going to perspire all over them.I was completely satisfied, until within 6 months of use the inner liner of the right ear cup started peeling off on its own.  At first i thought i had an insect or something when it put the headphones own, but confirmed on sight that the inner liner had in fact started coming apart.  For a pair of headphones that retails at $379.99, you would've expected a little more extensive craftsmanship, like stitching at the seams.  Hence, I can't 100% endorse buying this product for this reason, as it may put into question other aspects of craftsmanship that may ensue further down the road, hence it's not a little deal here. I've included a picture as proof of this issue.Sound quality: good. Battery life (on Bluetooth mode): very good.  Overall craftsman ship?  Raises eyebrows at this moment.

VNot worth the $380 price-tag, but I'm overall satisfied with my purchase.I've watched a lot of reviews on the headphones, and it was either these or the V-Modas m100.I chose the beats since I wanted to go wireless, and based on its looks really. Imo I hate how the V-Modas look.I'm very satisfied with the sound quality, although I didn't really have anything to compare it to.These are my first premium headphones that I've owned. I do have some experience from listening to friends' Bose headphones and Beats Solos/studios. For your average consumer, the sound quality is what you'd expect and more on these new studios.I didn't even use the cables and I went straight to using wireless BT. The only gripe I have is the mute button does not work when using wireless; when you hold the B, instead of it being the MUTE button, it disconnects from the device you're connected to. It does sort of skip songs when I'm in a different room from the device I'm connected, but if I'm lying still, it's okay.I tested out the mic on the headset wirelessly, and a friend could hear me speak clearly and I could hear her. I would like to try it on my PS4, but I don't have any friends with mics :(. I've always played online solo.For comfort, these did make my ears feel a little hot after 2 hours of wearing them. I think that's just me though, my ears are small and are overly sensitive. Hopefully I will get used to it, but it's something I can handle.Something worth mentioning is when I first opened the headphones, the right ear's cup at the bottom was dented because of the way it folds. It retained its form after a few hours, but there's a small difference between the right and left ear cup. That's just me being a perfectionist though.I highly recommend these if you've been wanting beats for a while and have the money to spend.This is the best time to get some beats, especially with all the improvements from the last version. 4 out of 5 stars! -1 star for the price.PROS:- Matte Black Finish, definitely a head-turner- A lot smaller and more stylish than the last version- Wireless!- RECHARGABLE, no batteries!  (12 hours wireless, 20 hours wired)- Mic built in headset, so you won't need the wires for anything but the MUTE button or if you want more battery life- Very comfortable- Nice packaging!- You may feel a urge to dance around to your music when you have these on...:)Cons- Overly priced- Fingerprints can be seen, although less than the other black model (If you're wanting one that's almost finger proof, get the titanium version - unfortunately not available on Amazon).- No mute button when wireless- Case doesn't have any pouch for wiresI hope this review helps you in purchasing these awesome headphones.UPDATE January 18, 2014: Tried these on my PS4 and I don't recommend these as a gaming headset. It does not get that loud and the mic doesn't work, nor does bluetooth (it may work in the future after a firmware update).

VMy wife loves these.  She is hard to please when it comes to the sound of her music.  Great Product.  ** UPDATE **  Funny thing, right after my review, I attempted to charge these headphones and they would not charge.  I tried a number of things and still they would not charge.  I looked to see if I could return these to Amazon it said I was 2 days over the time to return them.  I then called Apple (who now owns Beats by Dre) and they stepped me through troubleshooting them.  Apple determined that the Headphones where in fact defective and stated they needed to be repaired.  When asked where I purchased them I told them Amazon.  Apple said Oh we don't honor our warranty if purchased from Amazon, they are not an authorized dealer.  I was astonished with this response, Amazon the largest retailer in the world and they are not an Authorized dealer, you got to be kidding.  Apple then said because you can purchase from 3rd parties and not directly from Amazon.  This was crazy.  Apple then said if you want them repaired they will cost the same as buying new.  Well I went back to Amazon and called customer service.  They could not believe what Apple stated.  Amazon then went ahead and offered to have me to return the Headphones for a full refund.  **** Way to Go Amazon! ****  This is one of the many reasons I have been an Amazon customer for 16 years (since 1999).  And have had Amazon Prime since they first offered it.  I will stay a loyal customer for a long time to come.  Thanks Amazon!!!  By the way, These are still some of the best sounding headphones on the market and the cost of them is worth it.  To bad Apple now owns them.  This is why I'm not much of an Apple fan!

VMany audiophiles hate beats i get it and there may be headphones that sound as good or somewhat better. However these studios are so much better than previous beats models that i wonder if those putting them down tried the new ones. I have used a wide range of headphones including v-moda m80, seinhesser momentum, bowers and wilkins p5 and p7, bose aew2 wireless, sony mdr1 wireless and all the beats models except the mixrs. They were all good headphones but i did not see how the sound quality on many of them were any better than beats despite what some say. The old beats models werent that great but the new studios are nice. The earpads are so soft, the matte black color is slick and they supply plenty of good cables and a hard case! I would describe the sound as fun and comparable to any of the headphones i mentioned in this review. I would say maybe the bowers and wilkins p7 were slightly better but i didnt like the size of the earcups or how hot my ears got with them. For pop, hip hop, dance and rock though the beats are probably going to sound just as good.Cons - Obviously price is one downside to the headphone. The matte black color though is incredibly sleek though and the option of wireless just made them hard to resist. I kind of wish they had a black inline remote cable so the entire product would be all black. They do include a red inline and a black regular cord without remote though. The other downside is the bluetooth controls are on the left earcup and i never saw any bluetooth headphones put it on that side, except the bose bluetooth ones maybe. Normally left handed people would like this but i walk my dog and hold the lesh with the left hand since im left handed. Not to big of a deal and its one ill get used to but maybe right handed people wont like it as much.My advise is to ignore all the beats haters because the new studios have improved drastically over previous years models. Audiophiles represent a very small portion of the population and they sound great to everyone i showed them to. The matte black color is really nice and doesnt show fingerprints. This is the best bluetooth headphone in my opinion. I have heard the parrot one may sound slightly better but it looks no where near as nice and is just as expensive.

VGreat Headphones While They Work, Poor Customer Service
p108
sg5
VUPDATE 2 - Someone from Tim Cook's office called me, informing me that their policy was to have a flat repair, there was no flexibility, and that if I didn't like it I was free to go buy a pair from another vendor. Wow, I am simply astounded at that response.UPDATE - About 14 months into owning these headphones, one of the drivers on the left ear cup failed. When I took them to the Apple Store, I was told they had to send them back for repairs and it would be $199. I'm not unreasonable, I understand the warranty is up by a few months and was willing to pay out some cash, but I think $199 is completely unreasonable.Bose has great customer service in my experience, and my next pair will probably be Bose. I've outlined this in an email I sent to the Tim Cook email address at Apple.Dear Tim & Team,Wanted to let you know about the state of customer service when it comes to Beats Headphones on the phone in the store. In a word, it sucks. It a few extra words, it sucks out loud.I give customer service a call, and let them know I am having issues with my Beats Studio Wireless I bought in November 2013. They kind of shrugged it off, and then told me I could mail them back and pay for repairs at an undetermined cost.I then proceeded, about a month later after I declined that to pop into the Apple Store because I wanted to listen to the Beats demo units on display. They suggested I talk to their in-store support rep to figure it out. Their response? Well, it\u2019s out of warranty\u2026 but we can send them out for repairs for $199. He said, \u201cthat\u2019s all we can do since we\u2019re now forced to handle the Beats stuff.\u201d - Forced he said.So I\u2019m supposed to pay $199, which is over 55% of the cost I paid for them new, and wait who-knows-how-long for them to be returned with the chance it could be a bigger problem and may break again.A couple of years ago, I had  five year old Bose QC3 headphones which got damaged during a flight by another passenger. I took them into the Bose store, and they swapped them on the spot for a brand new pair for $125 + tax. If the Apple Store rep had said, \u201cyou know, we can\u2019t repair them, but we can capture them to send back and sell you a heavily discounted new pair\u201d and offered me a new one at $199 (the repair cost) I probably would have went with the flow and dropped my credit card.Instead, I\u2019ll start looking for other headphone options. I\u2019m not asking for a free replacement, I fully understand warranty timings, etc. but I don\u2019t think I am being unreasonable in terms of a pair of headphones less than 18 months old, while other manufacturers have policies that extend far beyond. I expect Apple to be the leader in support and going \u201cabove and beyond\u201d, and unfortunately I\u2019ve seen they are not in the case of their stepchild Beats and the dismissive attitude of your teams.---These are, simply put, the best headphones I have ever owned. This includes both the wired and wireless varieties.I connected these wireless to my iPad Air & my iPhone and they worked flawlessly. I was streaming audio from Spotify, using music on my device, and even watched several movies wearing these.Unlike prior Beats products which were made by Monster, these have very balanced sound. While the traditional bass is there, it is very obvious they are providing a much cleaner sound now.These are essentially the Beats Studio with wireless built in. This adds a little bit to the price, but this versatility is well worth it. I can use these headphones wired or wireless, which means I get the versatility of wireless but can still use them on an airplane or with non-Bluetooth devices like my Nintendo 3DS.My only complaint is the carrying case,which I felt was a little spartan; I wish it had a couple of pockets inside to hold cables instead of having to have them loose in the case. Otherwise, it is a solid case that will protect the headphones well.I have owned headphones, wired and wireless, from multiple companies including Bose. These have replaced by QC15 headphones as my go-to for noise cancellation, although I still use my QC20 at the gym.I was hesitant to buy these after buying and returning a pair of the old Beats Wireless headphones. However, looking them over I felt like the chance was worth it since Beats has separated itself from Monster. Well worth every dime of the purchase.

VBest wireless over-ear headphones on the market
p124
sg5
VFive stars. Easily the best wireless headphones I've used, maybe the best noise cancellation, and astonishingly, I'd say well worth the money.I'm used to using on-ear noise cancelling headphones, so the biggest difference for me was the enclosed over-ear style. This dramatically increases the noise cancellation, but also had led to a little bit of air pressure on my ears after prolonged use (2-3 hours), which is only mild discomfort that disappears within minutes of stopping use. The noise cancellation is reliable in a lot of different environments; unlike some on-ear models there's no flutter when using outside in windy conditions. Seems to be very little, if any, sound leakage, even at higher volumes in quiet environments (again, better than on-ear alternatives).Sound quality is very good (definitely better than the typical 'Beats' sound), with a variety of different music and video/voice/phone. And it can get very loud! That said, it's good enough to highlight quality issues with streaming sources; I've switched Spotify and Google Play Music to 320kbps to make up for this. Works ok as a phone headset, although the noise cancellation is so good that it's hard to work out the right level to speak at (without unexpectedly shouting!).They're comfortable to wear, and the matte black looks great. Doesn't attract fingerprints, and isn't as obviously branded as some other Beats models. The lack of red on the headphones is particularly notable (although one of the included cables was bright red). Materials seem solid enough, albeit a little 'plasticky'. A 'stealth' option, as far as large over-ear headphones go. Packaging is quite large and suitably over-the-top, but comes with a good travel case (although I haven't needed to use this yet).The Bluetooth stack seems quite reliable (especially compared to older pairs of Nokia wireless headphones I had). Having the battery indicator on my iPhone is a nice touch. I've paired with a few different devices - phones (iOS and Android) and Macs (laptop and desktop) - without any trouble at all. Pairing is fast and it reliably reconnects to the last device I used. The only annoying part is that the Mac media controls aren't activated by the Beats button on the headphones (this is an Apple issue, and not unique to Beats).Speaking of which, the single Beats button is overloaded a bit. Pause/play is an easy single tap. Previous track (or usually 'start of current track') is a triple tap, which I find hard to time accurately every time. To go back to the start of the previous track can take six taps on the button, which is crazy! Next track is a more realistic two taps, but even that can be hard to get right. Adding two buttons (for previous and next track) would be a nice touch, it's just overloading a single button to do so much. On the other hand, volume control works well, and links to the volume on your device where possible (so it's in sync with apps and the device volume keys).Battery life has been great so far. I'm curious to see how I go on a couple of long flights (it certainly won't hold out on London to Sydney, and I'm not confident about London to San Francisco). The design of the headphones makes it hard to accidentally turn them on in a bag or their case, which is good - I've had a couple of pairs that suffered from this in the past (Bose and Nokia). Standard micro USB charging, worked with all of my different travel chargers, and was quite quick from wall outlets, portable battery or laptop computer. Only drawback is that you can't charge and use the headphones at the same time, but the rapid charging time makes this a relatively minor problem.They tick a lot of boxes across the board, without a doubt. I haven't used them wired, and probably won't. There are competitors with 'smarter' headphones that turn on/off when you fold them, pause/play when you remove them from your head, and have enough buttons to support previous/next track easily. But they all have their own drawbacks (mainly around Bluetooth and audio quality), and the Beats are brilliant at what they're designed for - active/passive noise cancellation whilst listening to great sounding music wirelessly over Bluetooth. They're not perfect, but they're the best option I've found, and although at a high price point, I think they're good value for money.So that said, here's what I'd like to see in the 2015 (v3.0) edition:* Automatic power on/off when folding the headphones (simple switch sensors)* Automatic pause when removing headphones from your ears/head (proximity/pressure sensor)* Better support for audio/media controls on MacOS (Apple's problem now)* A better way to access previous/next tracks (is it too much to ask for another two hidden buttons on the earpiece?)* Less bright LEDs when charging (in a dark room they can be very bright; ambient light sensor?)* Ability to use the headphones while they are charging (good for ultra long haul flights, like London to Australia)* Black cable for microphone/remote control connection (this is red, even in the black edition - the 'plain' cable is black though)* Better protection before shipping - one ear cup was slightly crushed (other reviewers also reported this)

VIncredibly Underwhelming
p130
sg5
VConsidering the price, these are incredibly underwhelming.(1) CONSTRUCTION. The plastic construction is not very durable and in fact started coming apart the 2nd day I owned them.(2) SOUND. There is substantial noise leakage, even when listening at a moderate volume. I don't think people around me want to be listening to my music.(3) WIRELESS PAIRING. The pairing is atrocious. I've owned several pairs of bluetooth headphones in the past and these are without exception the worst. If you disconnect from your phone/ipad etc you need to power off your headphones and then re-power on to pair. On top of that, there's no pairing memory beyond one device. So if you're listening on your iPad and switch to your phone, you need to go into the setting and set up the device again.(4) BATTERY LIFE. The power design is fairly poor. These should power off automatically if there's no music for an extended period of time. They have a wireless or with-chord option with these, but what the heck is the use if you need a full charge to listen with the chord as well? I bought these because the with/without chord didn't make you a slave to a full-charge, but thats absolutely not the case. If the battery is low, you can't use these, with or without a chord.(5) COMFORT. These are okay if you're wearing them for an hour or two, but anything beyond that (late night working/studying or on a long flight) gets really uncomfortable because the ear pieces don't properly cup your ears so your ears get pretty hot and sweaty and sticky after a short while... maybe 90 minutes in.CONCLUSION: I'm usually reluctant to buy high-end mainstream consumer headphones (like Beats) instead opting for the audiophile alternative since of the $400 paid for Beats, $100 goes to their advertising budget, $100 is the cost and $200 is the profit. For a $400 pair of headphones with a 50% profit margin, I'd rather have headphones that cost $200 to manufacture with higher-quality components/design/construction... even if that means that my favorite athletes aren't photographed with the same headphones as me on TMZ.com.  I caved this time because I needed a decent pair of wireless headphones in a jam and I ended up with an overpriced sub-par product.  If I paid $100 for these I'd be fully satisfied.  But for $300-400, severely disappointed.

VGood headphones but the value just is not there.My girlfriend got these for me for Christmas and they came in the mail today. I've been playing with them trying them out on different types of music, comparing them to other headphones and these kind of fall in the great but not perfect range, still overpriced thoughBuildThe build is just just excellent to me honestly, These are way more stylish and light than the previous version of the beats studio, They are a fingerprint magnet because of the plastic finish but in all honesty these are just beautiful. More minimalist than most studio headphones you'll find, and the folding action is great for saving space. They also have maybe the best fit I've ever felt for headphones, you literally forget these things are on your head, they're light, comfortable around the ears, and do not rub against the top of your head in an uncomfortable way. They Just nailed the fit of these things, these are good for working out in alsoSoundYou'll hear a lot of people complaining about the slight hiss you hear with these headphones, and its true there is a slight hiss, but you honestly honestly honestly only hear it when there is no music playing. Once the music starts playing it goes away. I think people are making a bit too much of a big deal about it, since it doesn't affect your music. It's true the noise cancelling isn't as good as the Boise but they're not light years behind. I have used these the bose qc15 and qc3 (with a rechargeable battery) the Bose Barely edge these out on noise cancellation. Contrary to popular belief no noise cancelling headphones and totally block out something as loud as a plane engine, but these do block out noise and do it wellHighs Mids and Lows, in the past a lot of people complained that beats were too bass heavy, and depending on your taste in music that may have been true. I also own the beats solo wireless and the sound these compared to the studio 2.0 the solo wireless have way more bass. Compared to most beats I've heard, these are way less "bassy." These headphones can't handle really bassy music honestly, which annoys me because they cost so much, you expect these headphones to excel with any type of sound, but with the volume up and the Bass blasting you hear and feel that rattle that happens with cheap headphones. The mids are really good, not excellent but really good to the point that they deliver a stand out, premium sound. The highs are actually where these headphones excel, which is odd for Beats By Dre's but its true. With my R&B; and pop music, you really hear a difference, Adele or Whitney Houston's voice really comes through great on these head phones, it's like you're in the studio listening to them sing. The instruments on say a Mariah Carey or Beyonce song as very crisp and nearly perfect to the point where it sounds like the instruments are being played in the same room as you. These headphones have a unique affinity for getting the sounds of pianos perfect. That was the first thing I noticed when listening to "Super Rich Kids" by Frank Ocean. Now what I've found for those of us that must have our ear drum destroying base is that using these with a headphone amplifier allows you to get that heavy strong bass with little rattle, I personally use and love the FiiO e6. Take it everywhere and use it constantly. Anyway, as far as sound goes, it is truly great sound, but not nearly worth $300+ I will say this I have compared these to the Parrot Zik and Bose quiet comfort and I can say these are way louder and deliver a better sound quality at super high sound levels if that's your thingFeaturesOkay this is where the Beats Stdio Wireless shine actually, If your looking for wireless, rechargeable studio quality headphones, these are probably your best pick and the only reason I have these headphones is because of the features. Finally someone has created noise cancelling headphones that do not need batteries, honestly how have batteries not become obsolete by now is beyond me. The Beats use a micro usb, the same as most phones to charge, and you get an honest 20 hours of playing time with the wire plugged up, 12 hours in bluetooth mode and they take about 2 hours to fully charge. The Bose qc15 are not wireless and use batteries (which I HATE) the qc3 are rechargeable not bluetooth and don't use a usb, they some weird lego looking piece that has a specialized charger and you have to unplug it from the headphone and plug it into the charger, it was odd honestly and a hassle. The Parrot Zik headphones Beat the Beats on Features (the app for the zik is just amazing, too much for me to put into words in this short section actually) but have an inferior sound, but the Ziks cost $400! and the bluetooth isn't very good constantly disconnects and has a max range of 20'. I chose these over the QC15 based on the fact that the QC15 are just about 100% plastic, feel cheap and are not loud at all, they truly are quiet, and i like my music LOUD!, the Bose just don't deliver and also cost $300+ Beats have the battery indicator, and a few other tricks that are cool, so that's the main reason I chose these I was looking for a truly niche productPriceI have to just echo what everyone else has said these are just too d*** high, the value just isn't there, if these had the features that match the Zik, and the sound quality slightly improved them maybeConclusionIf you are looking for headphones with the most cutting edge features (rechargeable, noise cancelling, Bluetooth, light, stylish) then buy these, as most people aren't looking for all those features, these are truly a niche product that needs a price drop________________________________________________________UPDATEThese things totally died on me after nearly exactly one year to the day 12/30/2014, originally purchased on 12/11/2013. I couldn't get them to turn on, charge, nothing! Apple extended my warranty 90 days since I was just outside of the warranty.  But honestly how does a "high end" product stop working after a year?  Anyway I send the headphones in, literally the next day they've delivered me a new set, with 1 problem, I can't get them to connect to any device via bluetooth.  They give me the run around, do a factory reset, plug them into your computer and try a firmware update (which my computer can't even find them) finally to just get me off the phone they suggested letting the headphones charge for 24 hours,  I am writing this during that waiting period.  Basically it's looking like I'll have to return them again...another pain in the buttocks.  Long Story short, buy the Parrot Ziks, I wish I had...got the replacements, bluetooth did not work, get a replacement for those and volume button does not work.  Low quality product. Do Not Buy

VBose OE soundlink BT vs Beats Studio Wireless
p146
sg5
VI bought this with high expectations. I got a great deal at amazon on black friday for $275. I also bought Bose OE soundlink for 249.99. I compared them head to head. Sources included itunes music, pandora, netflix, amazon music and apple itune store movies.First pros. Nice finish, comfortable on ear, I could easily wear for couple of hours straight, decent sound (but not worth $275 and absolutely not worth $379.99). Louder with slightly higher bass than bose. noise cancelling.Cons.(compared to bose soundlink) Less detail in music, less clear mids, shorter battery life, only connects one device at time wirelessly. (in contrast bose connects simultaneously with two devices eg my iphone and macbook pro), in order to switch device, you have to turn off the bluetooth on the device you want to disconnect and turn off and then on beats headphone, much easier switching between devices on bose with one button, dont have to turn off and on, no need to turn off bluetooth on the device you want to disconnect. Much clear call quality on bose.So I will be keeping bose and returning beats.

p158

VI am very happy with these headphones! I absolutely love the wireless feature. This is my first pair of wireless headphones and it would be hard to go back. I got a nice deal on these. I don't know why the Titanium ones were on sale, but they were only $229. And a bonus, I had a $70 gift card balance. I had been researching headphones for a few weeks wanting a new pair. I'd been keeping an eye of the Solo version, but this was too good of a deal to pass up. Titanium is probably the color I would have chosen anyway. They are a little less flashy. That's the one thing I actually don't like about Beats. Beats in general do feel flashy to me, but these are a fantastic looking pair of headphones.I do feel Beats are overpriced and you are paying for the name. However, they aren't as bulky as other brands and I love a deep bass and I know other brands such as Bose have a flatter more even sound. My last pair was Bose. They sounded good, but so far these are better. The sound is crisp and I'm very impressed with it. I do have a set of the Urbeats earbuds that have good sound as well, so I knew the sound would be decent. Of course, these surpass the earbuds.The fit is a little tight, but that also secures the sound and prevents leaking, which is something I hate. I've asked and been told, the sound doesn't leak badly. That is a big turnoff for me, when others in the room can hear what I'm listening to. If there is anything that annoys me, it's having to endure someone's headphone noise in a quiet room. I've been wearing them to bed at night and after a couple of hours, my ears do get a little sore. However, I've only had these a little under 2 weeks, so maybe I will get used to the fit and that will lessen. I've already noticed it's not as bad.My only con is battery life. I haven't had it last 12 hours. Maybe 6-8 of playback. But I plug them in and they charge fast.Overall, I'm very impressed! Would I pay $379 for them? Probably not, that's a lot of money and I'm not sure if they would be worth that. I guess it will depend on how well they hold up. If they last me 2+ years, then maybe I would drop that kind of money. Time will tell. But so far, so good! If you can get a deal on them, I'd go for it. I'm glad I did.

p164
sg5
VBroken out of the box (9/3/14)... really looked forward to these headphones. Volume + button did not work and after tweeting, calling, chatting and emailing, Beats support was a disappointment. Bought these for a trip I was taking and wanted to try out the noise cancelling feature along with overall sound quality, but couldn't get a replacement in time for my trip. Beats support could care less about my sense of urgency. Amazon on the other went above and beyond to try to help. Apple support has always been exemplary (10 years plus owning various products). I hope Beats gets some well needed guidance in providing better support and follow-up. Someone from Beats was supposed to follow-up with my service / product concerns - that was two weeks ago and I've not been contacted.Update as of 10/3 - no one from Beats has contacted me - down to one star.

VThe sound is good. The Bluetooth functionality is terrible. I expected so much more out a nearly $300 pair of headphones. I have had this product for less then a month and I can't count how many times I have had to reconnect these headphones to all of my devices. I tried only using it for my computer and still have to reconnect it all the time. Maybe I got an unlucky pair that doesn't work the way it should, or maybe Beats skimped on the wireless functionality, which is the ONLY reason I bought these in the first place. I'd buy a different pair if I had to do it again.

Luckily I only paid $260 for these and that's too much. I would feel more comfortable at $125 or $150 but definitely nothing over $200.Unless you work in the music industry and your ears are tuned to pick up every sound, I think for the average user, there are better headphones to choose from, like the other headphones I have pictured here.

p194
sg5
VThese are by far the best set of headphones I've owned.  I was hesitant about paying another $79 just to get the wireless, but it was worth it.I use these in my office where I am located on the corner of a busy street.  The noise cancellation makes an unbelivable difference.  Even with no music playing, I am not able to hear the traffic outside my window.  With music on, I no longer notice the fire trucks screaming by.Out of the box it was simple to set up.  I paired it with my Galaxy S3 and listen to streaming audio.  Battery life is good, I can work all day and not run out of juice.  I do plug them in to charge while I'm at lunch.Very comfortable as they are over the ear.  Occasionally I give my ears a 5 minute break.  The ear cushions are nice and do not compact like cheaper headphones.Sound qualiity is awesome.  The play/skip/volume controls work perfectly with my Galaxy S3.  Deep, rich bass.  No adustments for bass or treble, but you could control these through your device.  I use the DI.FM app and it sounds perfect.The carrying case looks like a giant pill and is not very convenient to carry if you have other things.  It comes with a carbiner so you can hook it onto your laptop case, which I have done.  It is still obnoxious looking and flops around while walking, but it's about as small as it can get to hold the headphone.The packing material is over the top for me.  I don't require an "Apple unboxing experience", but if you like that sort of thing, you won't be disappointed.All in all I highly recommend these headphones.

p217

VMy first quality headphone purchase in a while, these had all the features I wanted.Pros:-There's not much I don't listen to and they sound great with everything, running the gamut from jazz and classical to classic rock to modern r&b.; This is a bit of a subjective area I know some people don't like how they sound, I can't see the issue. I used to work in a music studio so I'm used to being critical of how music sounds. My suggestion would be to try them out in a store first.-It's a bit of a novelty but when there's enough bass on a modern recording to really drive them and make them vibrate it's very satisfying.-The Bluetooth works flawlessly with an iPhone 4S. Phone calls also work very well with the built in microphone even though I still can't see where the microphone is. I've noticed a big drop in people having to ask me to repeat myself.-When listening to music above 50% volume it's pretty much a complete isolation experience with the noise cancellation.-Good battery life.Cons:-The noise cancelling when used by itself isn't complete, there's some left in the upper register so things like an intercom in an airport and someone talking close to you get through, which some might find useful. I can't help but think that this was intentional. If that's the case maybe a good feature would be for that to be switchable on and off.-The Bluetooth really eats up a phone battery, which I guess isn't anyone's fault. However, this is a battery that's been in my phone since I got it (over 2 years ago) and it's seen heavy use. I recently ordered a replacement and since I needed a case anyway I got a battery case that doubles battery life. With headphones like these that's probably an option everyone should consider.Other thoughts:-I've never worn a set of over the ear headphones that were completely comfortable with several hours' continuous use, and these aren't the exception, but they're far from the worst I've come across.-I'm not a fan of the glossy plastic color options but the matte black (what I got) and the titanium versions are great looking.

p222
sg5
VIf I could give ZERO stars I would. My Beats headphones have a manufacturing defect: the seam-line in the ear cup separated showing the foam, and fell apart 2 months after the expiration of the 1 year warranty. This is called "planned obsolescence" and I shouldn't have been surprised that Beats created an expensive product that falls apart, and set their business workflow so they wouldn't have to shell out replacement parts or product. This is not normal wear and tear, check the pictures, the headphones are fine. I can't buy another earpiece, and Apple customer service told me that they wouldn't replace it. Apple said that the only option was to "repair it for $205 including shipping". I can buy a new pair for almost that price, but I won't. Don't buy these headphones. The product is horrible, Beats is a horrible company, Apple has become a horrible company.

p228
sg5
VI never thought I'd own a pair of Beats headphones, let alone recommend them, but here goes:  There are very good BT headphones, that with a few tweaks would be excellent.  I won't dwell on the Beats reputation; if you care about it strongly (positive or negative), likely nothing I can write that will change your mind.  That said, I have a hard time liking the glossy versions of these headphones, but I have the matte black version (but would have gone with the titanium color had it been the same price).  I liked these well enough that I returned a pair of Bose SoundLink On-Ear BT headphones because these were much more comfortable and sounded noticeably better.This is a "fun" headphone; it's not balanced by any means, but the bass is much more controlled compared to earlier generations of Beats headphones, and I was surprised by their clarity and dynamic punch.  With the Bose and other BT headphones I've tried, you can tell at times that it was a wireless connection; I didn't get that sensation with these, which is a plus.I had no issues using this with an iPhone 6 (running iOS 8.1).  There is a very slight lag when watching video; you can tell if you are looking for it, but for the most part, it's not noticeable or annoying.  The two (maybe three) things I wish were different:  There is a NC "hiss" that is pretty prominent between tracks, which surprised me.  If you want to use these just for NC, look elsewhere, as it is somewhat annoying.  Oddly enough, the hiss seems to go away completely when playing music, so it's not an issue for me.  (It'd be nice if you could just turn the NC off.)  The other annoying thing is that you can't use Siri in wireless mode, other than activating it from your iPhone or iPad.  Hopefully, this is a firmware fix, because the omission is puzzling.  Finally, it would be really nice if the headphones could remember multiple BT connections and allow you to toggle between them, so you aren't having to disconnect and reconnect if you are switching source devices.  The Bose headphones are great in that regard.Finally, in terms of aesthetics, these (at least in the matte black version) are great looking headphones that seem well built and fold down and fit into a relatively small case given that they are over-ear cans.  Even though I got these on sale, it'd be nice if these were closer to $250, not $370.  At MSRP, these are a luxury/splurge, and if I had to spend only $250 on BT headphones, I'd probably get a pair of Sony MDR-1RBT, which are now being nicely discounted and sound great, but don't really fold down much.All in all, I was surprised by how much I liked these headphones.  Wireless is great, and you aren't giving up much with these compared to wired, if you can live with the sound signature and price.

VVastly improved over original Beats Wireless headphones, but still could use some work.
p234
sg5
VThe Beats Studio Wireless are essentially the same headphones as the wired version, except with bluetooth connectivity. Audio quality is about the same, with no real difference in most situations.Sound QualityMuch improved over the previous generation Beats, but still loses out to similar headphones in the same price range. Bass is nice and deep, mids and highs are acceptable (but not great).Noise CancellingNoise cancelling cannot be turned off and this results in a constant but light hiss the entire time. The noise cancelling ability is not nearly as good as Bose QC15s, which are the absolute gold standard when it comes to active noise cancellation. I'm not sure if they headphones actually cancel out noise or if they just emit a hiss to cover up noise using a white noise effect.Battery Life12 hours of wireless battery life claimed. I haven't had the chance to test that out. One issue is that even though it comes with a stereo wire, the headphones are inoperable if the batteries are dead (similar to the wired versions). You'll get better battery life with the wire, of course.LooksThis may seem silly, but the main reason I purchased these headphones is because of the way they fold up, which makes them take up much less space in your backpack. The matte black finish looks solid and is a welcome departure from the finger print prone glossy finish that comes with most Beats headphones. Finally, the Beats logo blends in to the headphones and gives you a look that will look great at the gym, walking around town or sitting in first class.

VI cannot recommend these, and it's a shame, because they are very good in wireless mode. The Studios are extremely comfortable, and well made. The charge lasts a good amount of time, and sound quality was great! The people who say the Beats Studio headphones sound badly are either 1) Repeating internet mantra and/or 2) Actual audiophiles who are used to much pricier headphones (which are generally not suitable for mobile use).So what's good?The sound, the comfort (big emphasis here), battery life, design, and accessories included are all awesome.The bad?In 3 pairs, the active noise canceling (ANC) will not adjust while in wired mode. It does work perfectly in wireless mode. Hearing the white noise of the ANC lower when your music or audio plays is very cool, and it strikes a great a balance to where it's not discernible. But plug in either of the included wires and you get a loud hiss that does not go away. This was consistent in all 3 pairs, as was the proper wireless function. Also, the Studios handle wireless calling oddly. When using the mic, it allows all noises into the headset as well. So you can hear yourself talk in your headphones, as well as sounds around you. This doesn't happen with the wired mic.Conclusion?If you only plan to use these in wireless mode, and don't plan on using them to make a lot of phone calls or use as a wireless headset, they are quite good. But for me, at $350 (on sale), I think it should function all around. The ANC is just way too loud when using the wire, and that just shouldn't be.

VThese are my first Beats headphones and an upgrade from my Bose QC15. I love my Bose headphones but I got tired of throwing away AAA batteries and I was looking for something with a little more bass punch and better dynamic range. I almost got the wired model but decided to get the wireless just in case it might be useful. I had low expectations but the audio quality over wireless is EXCELLENT - I can't tell the difference between wired and wireless. Compared to the QC15, I LOVE not having to deal with the cord. I used to always get the cord tangled up in my chair or blanket. When paired with my computer, I can keep the music going even when getting up for a snack or going to the bathroom.I got the black headphones with red accents - looks great but if I had to do it again I'd probably get the matte black ones as the polished plastic is a fingerprint and scratch/scuff magnet.Just plug in the included wire to essentially convert these headphones into the wired Beats Studio Redesigned headphones. The buttons on the left earpiece have different functions depending on whether the headphone is in wired or wireless mode. In wired mode, the center button disables noise cancelation and fades out the music. The volume +/- buttons do nothing.In wireless mode, the center button disconnects Bluetooth when pressed once and the volume controls control the headphone volume. If you are connected to a music player or smartphone, you can double click the center button to skip forward, triple click to skip back. If you are connected to a computer, this does nothing. The volume buttons still allow to adjust the volume, though.The battery lasts an entire evening of use (5-6 hours) in Bluetooth wireless with capacity to spare.There are two noise cancellation modes - one for when the music is playing and another for when music is not playing. There is a pretty noticeable hiss when music isn't playing - as soon as music starts, the hiss cuts to almost inaudible. Is there any way to make it always be in the music ANC mode?Pros:-Great audio quality, both wired and wireless-Bluetooth wireless!!!!-Look great-Rechargeable battery-Comes with a wired cord as wellCons:-ANC hiss-Others say they can wear these for hours -- I must have large ears; they hurt after wearing these for an hour or two. The foam pads are comfortable but I can feel my ear lightly pressing on the headphone speaker cover inside the pad. Do they make thicker pads to raise the headphone farther away from my ears?-Fingerprints (glossy models)-The price...

VGreat wireless headset. Noise suppression works like any other beats studio. I would give a 5 star if you could activate the active noise reduction just by flicking a switch like the normal studio instead of holding both power n b button's down. Otherwise as far as sound goes their definitely the best I should know I own every high end wireless headset out there...

VKicking myself for not buying sooner. Great WIRELESS headphones and perfect for the gym

VWow. It took me a year to find the perfect wireless/Bluetooth headphones and should have bought these in the very beginning.I always snubbed my nose at the Beats by Dre brand and went with other headphone brands in the same price range. I thought the Beats were just gimmicky headphone products marketed towards the urban/hip-hop community (although I listen to hip-hop). And I always said you\u2019d never see me wearing \u201cthose beats\u201d headphones LOLThe issues I had with other wireless headphones was a mix of things. For me, size, build quality, controls, comfort, and last but definitely not least sound quality must all be excellent. Pretty much all of the other wireless headphones I tried didn\u2019t have much bass, and/or they were too big, or lacked easy controls.I looked at the Samsung Level Over wireless headphones, a couple of different JBL\u2019s, and they hardly had any bass at all, and two other brands I can\u2019t remember. I then tried several in-ear bluetooth earpods including Plantronics, Bose and JBL. All had terrible volume, bass or overall sound quality IMO.I even tried the SMS by 50 headphones (the ones with that small adapter), which actually sounded decent but was way too big for me to wear frequently in the gym. I also tried the SMS Audio sport headphones, and the volume at its highest setting (both on the headphones AND the phone) was way too low, and overall sound quality was very disappointing.I ended up going back to wired headphones for a few more months, but got so fed up dealing with the cord when I work out, so I finally gave in and purchased these Beats by Dre Studio wireless.For Bluetooth, the sound quality to me is by far the best compared to all of the other wireless headphones I\u2019ve tried. I was actually really surprised that even the volume could even be turned up higher than my WIRED headphones! I\u2019m no audio expert, but for me music is more clear, and it just sounds more \u201ccrisp\u201d overall. And the bass is right where I need it when I\u2019m hitting those power lifts LOL. Overall, the sound quality is right on par with my wired sport headphones, if not a tad better. ESPECIALLY for Bluetooth.The beats were also surprisingly comfortable. The over-ear pads were probably the most comfortable out of all of the other headphones I\u2019ve tried, and I like not having to stick earpods into my ears anymore.Oh and as far as looks, I like the all-matt black version of these headphones that don\u2019t have the big red \u201cb\u201d LOL (I **hate** headphones that have huge visible logos on them. I like things understated).My perfect type of headphone overall.  Sorry Dre, I should have listen to you Lol

VCrowd pleasing sound & the best looking over-ear headphones, questionable build quality
p267
sg5
VIf you're considering the Beats Studio Wireless, there's a good chance that you might be as concerned with how your headphones look and fit as you are with their sound quality. It's been long documented that Beats are just as much of a fashion statement/accessory as they are headphones made for music. They're made to sound pretty good and look really good.And you know what? That's totally ok with me.With the Beats Studios, I'm really happy to have a set of headphones with crowd pleasing sound (to a non-audiophile like me), rock solid Bluetooth, long battery life, and a better than decent built-in microphone that actually look good and turn heads. Some headphones make you look like a nerd sitting in the basement drinking Mountain Dew; these are not those headphones.I also considered the Bose Soundlink On-Ear Bluetooth headphones, but knew that I wanted Bluetooth headphones with an Over-Ear design that I could wear for a long time. While the Bose's on-ear design steered me towards the Beats, I saw someone wearing the Soundlinks in the airport and thought the headphones looked kind of small and silly, instead of substantial and premium. I was 90% leaning to the Beats already, but I admit that sealed the deal for me.For the argument that the Studios are overpriced, I compare getting the Studios to a purchase like buying designer sunglasses. Do your Gucci sunglasses block the sun better than a regular polarized pair you can get from the gas station?Maybe, but do they block the sun $300 better? Probably not.If you're shopping for designer sunglasses, chances are you really don't care. You're in the store because you care about the general function AND the look. Chances are that's why you're even considering the Beats Studios. They're a little more expensive than other headphones in its weight class, but nowhere near the 20x premium you'll pay for sunglasses.To shape my perspective, I own a bunch of ugly $20 Sennheisers that always seem to go on sale and underwhelm despite the reviews (I realize the high-end Sennheisers are a different game), cheap Bluetooth ear buds I wear when running, and a nice pair of on-ear Soul Republic Tracks Air Bluetooth headphones that I use at work. The Tracks Air headphones are great, but I still prefer the Beats by a good chunk in terms of sound and overall comfort.And yes, the Beats look better.I don't consider myself an audiophile by any means. I listen to a lot of music (pop, rap, country, electronic, etc.) and the Beats are my favorite pair of headphones I own. I'm actually wearing them right now as I write this review. We have three Sonos speakers in our place that we love, but my Beats have started turning me into a headphone person.Here are some of the main reasons why I'm a fan of my Studios:- Over-ear design is very comfortable: This is the first pair of headphones I can continuously wear for multiple hours without having to adjust them. I have pretty bony ears, so this is a rare find for me.- Leak very little sound at higher than reasonable volumes: People on airplanes won't want to kill you if you keep the sound at a decent level- Long battery life on-par with all other Bluetooth headphones in this price range- Music controls built into headphones- Crowd pleasing sound (read: LOTS of bass, vibrant highs, ok mids): I'm a big concert-goer, so the heavy lean towards boomy sound instead of pinpoint accuracy is very familiar to me. I'm sure that hurts the heart of some audiophiles, but the sound from the Studios will get your nodding your head to the beat.- Strong Bluetooth - no blips, pops, or drops with my Moto X 2014- Folds up much smaller than you think- Good noise canceling: At a moderate-high volume, you are in your own world. Chances are it won't block out all airplane sounds, but if you just want to zone out and get lost in your music at home, on the train, or while studying, you're good.- Microphone built into headphones (when you're not connected with a cord) is pretty decent when talking on Bluetooth. My wife has never noticed when I'm on my Beats vs. my phone.- Discrete on/off button and battery indicator- Comes with a nice carrying case, charger, and multiple cords to plug into your phone if you don't want to use BluetoothAnd of course, these are the best looking pair of over-ear Bluetooth headphones available right now. They just are.For months, I tried to convince myself that I'd be happy with another design, only to try on other brands and look like I was going to a LAN party or dressing like an alien with a bulb head. If you look at the Beats and they're the best looking pair of headphones to you, whether it's because you saw an NFL player wearing them in a commercial or because they actually fit your head, you'll never look back once you have them. You won't need to convince yourself that a different pair looks better, which is worth a lot of sanity dollars in itself.They're definitely pricey, but the sound is better than good; and if you care about looks, they look better than all.**UPDATED RATING FROM 5 STARS TO 3 STARS: After 9 months, the glue that held one of my ear pad covers together wore off spontaneously. I really baby these headphones, so it came apart with really gentle usage As a result, the foam was showing in one of my ear pads, which is pretty bad for a $300 piece of hardware.That being said, I called Apple and they're going to replace my headphones because it's within the one year warranty. It was really painless to get the exchange process going.If you order these, keep your serial number handy! If you need to do a warranty replacement, it'll make the process a lot simpler**

VSo here are my finding about these headphones :-)After a lot of research and comparing Bose with Beats I finally decided to buy Beats Studio. I'm writing this review so that other people can get a few points to think about while deciding to buy headphones.I like to listen to music which has a lot of bass and thus need to hear the "thump" in the songs. These headphone are clear winners in terms of sound quality. They beat Bose (QC 25 and SoundTrue) by a huge margin. Comparing with my friend's Bose QC 25 which also has good sound quality but at 80%-100% sound volume, QC25 tends to blow up and doesn't give the same sound quality.Beats Studio definitely has great sound reproduction and you'll hear the different instruments and bass clearly in the songs. However, the things that I don't like about these headphones are they they are not that comfortable. Even though they are around the ear, they put a lot of pressure on the ear. After continuously listening to music for around 30 minutes or so, they start hurting. I feel the pressure is not because of the padding but due to the fact they are a bit heavy and the construction of the frame.The Bluetooth connectivity is very good and with an iPhone you also get to see the headphone battery stats on your iPhone. I didn't feel any loss in sound quality while on Bluetooth vs when wired. One thing which I wasn't aware of earlier was that even for the wired mode, you need to have the inbuilt battery charged. On an average, a fully charged battery will last you around 12 to 15 hours of music on wired mode. Bluetooth mode will reduce by additional 4 hours or so.People who are looking at this headphone just for Noise cancellation should consider Bose QC 25 which has great Noise Cancellation. With Noise Cancellation ON on these headphone with no music playing, you'll hear a light "hiss". It is not a concern for me as my use for these headphones is purely for great rich music.The build quality is very good as well. Product looks and fells nice when you hold it.Since I can't give star rating for each piece, overall I would give it 4.Sound: 5/5Feel/Quality: 5/5Comfort: 3.5/5Maybe Beats comes up with a better comfortableness in their new Studio models.

VThese headphones are great for whats out on the market right now. They are expensive and while I do feel part of the cost is based on pure hype I just was not willing to purchase another brand on a whim. I read a review mentioning the white noise and how that person did not like it, I personally enjoy the white noise as a noise canceling effect and it works well to me. Its a surprising feature and I did not expect it. The headphones are also cool in the way they fold into each other, much different from prior beats.There is also another variety of wireless headphones from beats that are cheaper, those are the older model and the difference is that they are "on the ear" instead of "over the ear", This is a review of the most recent, more expensive over the ear headphones. I do believe the over ear headphones have better sound quality simply because it covers the whole ear and that is my rationale for buying these ones.I previously had the motorola sd-10, I had one of the original models and this is 10x better than that. If you are looking for some headphones that are loud and clear this is it. When I first purchased I was mainly concerned about the sound quality and though some people were complaining about mids, and lows, I personally cant complain. I mean I guess if you are some serious, serious, serious, serious extreme music listener that is absolutely disgusted by anything that does not sound like pure rain or music from God or music in a recording studio, or front seat in an orchestra or live music with Nat King Cole and Miles Davis then no you will not like these headphones :/  Lol like come on these are portable headphones not a in person Bach concert. The sound is great, the sound level is great and the ascetics are great..Now the cons to these headphones are the distance you can go without carrying your phone or whatever you are streaming from. When I had the motorola sd-10s they had a pretty good distance, i dont know exact feet but it was mildly farther then the beats but carrying my phone or whatever i am streaming with me is not that big of a deal so this is not too much of an issue with me. I would say the range of the beats is about 20 feet.Another con but this seems to be a con with any headphone, at least for me, They become uncomfortable after a while. Say about an hour or so your ears may start to hurt, not your hearing, but your eat itself. They are slightly uncomfortable but i can say the same thing about the motorola sd-10s. All in all great headphones, not that many people have them yet because of the price and plenty of people will look at you like where is the cord. I actually have the beats pro headphones (corded) and I do not even use them anymore, (actually only when I am DJ-ing)But that price is pretty steep for some headphones? yeah i know..would I buy it again? ummm..yea, with a blindfold on, Its hurts to believe and see that I am paying near 400$ for some headphones but i absolutely hate wires!Hope my review helped.

VI love wireless headphones. I own the Beats Wireless (not to be confused with the Beats Studio Wireless), which is a fantastic headset, but because they're over-ear my ears would be aching by the end of the day. Beats Wireless are great, but not for wearing for hours on end, like I do.When I saw the new Studio Wireless headset, I had to give it a try. And man... this is the best headset I've ever owned! Well worth the money. They're a more intuitive machine than the former, and the noise-cancellation and volume are just amazing. Best of all, they fit comfortably over my ears and I've never felt the least bit of discomfort wearing them for 5-8 hours daily.

VI recently purchased these headphones. My previous set was Senheiser HD280s. I found the Beats (Studio Wireless 2.0) to be fantastic, with a full bodied live sound to them, which I personally prefer. I am not an audiophile, and certainly could not vouch for the sonic accuracy, but I can say they sound great to my ears, with solid, but not overpowering bass, rich mids, and crisp highs. Obviously, using them plugged in vs. wireless you notice a quality difference, but having the flexibility to go wireless when I want makes the sacrifice negligible. To be honest, they sound a little better wireless as the highs are evened out a bit.I find it amazing the reaction I get from them, as most people seem to have opinions formed based on the circle jerk of price complaints, but to be frank, I have no regrets. I think the build quality is top notch, presentation was obviously the result of some care and effort, and the sound quality is exactly what I was hoping for. All in all, I would definitely recommend them, as Beats delivered on my expectations

VWe all love Beats headphones because of the design and the "cool" factor that goes along with a pair of these premium devices.Pros:- Bluetooth capability- Slick design- Hard Casing storage- Comfortable fit- Intuitive controls and features- Decent sound quality- Good battery lifeCons:-Charging cable is short-Pricey-There is a lot of white noise in the higher volumes.-ANC mode does not work with Bluetooth; I believe it only works with wired connection.Overall, these headphones work well. I think where these headphones fall short is the inefficiency of noise cancellation. The noise cancellation, even in ANC mode, did not work as well as other headphones I have. I will say though that this pair of headphone looks sexy and very comfortable. If you don't care much for absolute noise cancellation than these headphones are great. It drowns out just enough noise to enjoy sounds and music but leaves a bit of outside noise in tact. For traffic and other safety precaution, these headphones are great due to that bit of leak sound. I like these headphones and I don't think anyone could be disappointed with them. But I would recommend waiting for a discount or price drop.[Update]: The pair of headphones cuts out too much in bluetooth mode. I'm not sure if my pair is defective. I also notice that if one places their hand(s) over the left ear cup during playblack that the bluetooth actually gets worse; this is absurd because that means that every time you adjust the volume to the headphones you get trashy playback. For such a high price I expected better functionality.

The best sound, noise cancellation or not, is the BEATS.  Period.  In an airplane or loud places maybe the Bose are better....  But straight up sitting in your apartment just chilling trying to block the world out and chill to whatever it is you listen to....  Hip hop, country, jazz, soul....  For a guy like me primarily Trance.....  The BEATS beat the Bose QC 25's.  Sorry Bose, both are amazing headphones but it's not just the advertising being so highly budgeted for BEATS.  They just sound better.  I have to charge my Apple Watch nearly every day too....  Ain't no thing.

VI purchased the headphones in spite of reports of questionable reliability. Comfortable, stylish, decent sounding. My teenagers and spouse wouldn't use them because they didn't want to break dad's fragile looking headphones. I was so concerned with physical damage I didn't anticipate that the electronics would be the first thing to fail. Static on the right side speaker. Sounds like noise canceling circuit messing up and makes them unusable. I did enjoy about 10 hours of use before failure. About $38 an hour for use. I can't return through Amazon. I will now test out Beats warranty customer service. I would probably purchase through a brick and mortar store as opposed to Amazon next time simply because a real person is more likely to help me with a product failure.

I'd heard the song at a friend's house over her awesome stereo system, and liked it.  Hearing it on my son's Beats was an entirely new experience.  I liked them so much I decided to replace my Bluetooth Motorola headphones with these.  I primarily wear headphones at the gym.  (It's a great way to zone out when you're on the stationary bike!)All I can say is these wireless Studio Beats are incredible!  I used to think turning up the system in my Mustang immersed me in the music - not like these Beats do!  Every note is audible - IT IS LIKE HEARING ALL MY FAVORITE SONGS AGAIN FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME!!!!!  From Adele to Dobie Gray to Rhiana to Alan Jackson to Pittbull to Otis Redding - I'm hooked on music all over, again!  Yes, they're pricey, but now, to me, they're PRICELESS!

I exchanged them and the second pair started doing the same thing. Terrible quality control. Sadly, I'll be staying away from Beats from now on.

VI have owned these headphones for a little over a month. Overall, I am really pleased with them. Before I proceed with actual features, I must say that the packaging is nice. Presentation/branding say a lot about a company, though the product can still suck! I even keep the box.The headphones have a great look.  They appear to be well constructed. When I first put them on, they were really tight around my head. Even after six weeks later with moderate usage, they still fell a bit snug. So far, this does not bother me, but it may for some.The pairing with my mp3 player and computer was simple, so no problems there. The sound of the music from the headphones is great for my liking. As others have commented, the sound is bass heavy. If you do not prefer a lot of bass in your music, then these may not be the one for you. The sound of the music is crisp and clear. I was hearing stuff that I did not know exist in songs.The headphones feature noise canceling aspects as well. This feature is okay. You will probably read a lot of reviewer who compare these to the noise-canceling headphones by Bose. I did try those on in the store and I would agree that the feature on the Bose\u2019s headphones did a better job with noise canceling. Now, there is a feature where you can use the noise-canceling aspect only. The Beats try to have that balance between music and the outside environment. I hear very little outside in my environment when the music is playing and a bit turned up. Nevertheless, the noise canceling features is fair and it should be good in most environments. This beats are a bit weighted as compared to the Bose.Another aspect to note is the time you have before you have to recharge. I would agree with the up to 12 hours of wireless usage that are advertised. I can get over 10 hours of usage. You have the option to connect with a cord for longer usage but once they are dead, you will have to recharge them.The aspect that I am worried about is the plastic coming off inside the ear cups. I have seems pictures of this from others and it is not appealing. So, durability is a major concerned ; I will monitor this through time. The headphones are not waterproof, so I am not sure if sweat or other wetness plays a role in this malfunction.So, with me being a month in, I am pleased. I would hope that one year later, I will still be able to say the same thing. These headphones are not cheap and are high end in quality (hopefully) and sound (if you like or can tolerate bass).  I use my headphones about three times a week for gym workout and when on travel, which is not too often. I try to keep them dry and in the harden case that you can place them in.With one month of usage, I would recommend these headphones if you can afford them, adjust to the snug fit, can tolerate the heavy bass in music, and need/desire a moderate noise canceling set. Let us see if my review changes in the coming months.

VBeats are the whipping horse of the audiophile community. They are well meaning people who want to educate people on how putting effort into good sound can really make your life better. And they may have a point:1. Music just before the digital age was lossless CD's. The only bottleneck was your headphones2. Then when the digital revolution started, ripping CD's to MP3's was commonplace. Rip speeds were slow, 128Kbps was the common bitrate to save time3. Pirating was also commonplace, napster. Shoddy rips everywhere.4. iPod launched with the iconic Apple Earbuds that sounded like screaming babies fingernails scratching chalk.5. Pandora launched was highly compressed music to save bandwidth.6. Bluetooth launched to highly compressed signal traveling to speakers and headphones.It's been a rough 20 years for quality music. Radioshack is gone, Circuit City is gone, and a lot of generalized tech stores has bitten the dust. teenagers simply have grown up around poor sounding music. They probably don't even know what bass is or have ever experienced it.So they walk into their Best Buy with their Apple Earpods around their neck, walking up to a Beats demo booth, with high bitrate MP3's at key moments  of a song ready to play with the hit of a switch. And yeah, they are absolutely floored. Despite messy bass, most teens probably thought they heard the sound of God.And that's why beats has been beneficial for the audiophile community. They are the gateway drug to better audio. To finally get people off from bundled in ear pods. They charged overpriced, stylized phones that were iconic, and it should have been a boon for the audio community to keep pushing people forward. But some resented Beats for being so successful, while their beloved brands have a moderate consumer base. Their complaints weren't wrong, but their head was in the wrong place.With the revisions, including the Beats Studio Wireless refresh here, they've improved the sound signature. I was listening to these at Best Buy and did a quick comparison to the Solo 2's, and the Bose models. I also own Sennheiser Momentums (audiophile endorsed). These cans have a really exciting pop to them. They will not make an audiophile happy, because they are not neutral sounding like the Momentums, but they are simply fun to jam out to. A guilty pleasure. The bluetooth is an added convenience that has come a long way in sound quality. AptX which is popular compression to improve sound through bluetooth, gives the Beats Studios a near indistinguishable sound from a wired connection. Streaming programs like Spotify have improved their bitrates, and if you subscribe, you can get their premium sounding bitrates (320kbps mp3 I believe), which will let these headphones do high quality work while on the go.So don't despair. People might be spending more money, when they could purchase nicer and uglier cans. But at least they're not tied to the dreaded ear bud bundles, and maybe when these things inevitably break they'll be interested to see "what else" is out there. The counter culture nerds are probably already throwing their wallets at Sennheiser or V-Moda.So accept this attractive, and rather fun sounding piece of equipment for what it is. A pricey but pleasant introduction into the world of better music, and just leave people be who purchase this model. In fact, i'd encourage you to give it a listen, you might be surprised how far they've come.

VOk, so here's my review of the new Beats Studio Wireless. I want to talk about each aspect individually so you know what you're getting. I hope this helps.Sound qualityBefore I start talking about sound quality, please understand that 1) I haven't listened to many high quality headphones so I don't have much to compare it to and 2) I love bass so if you don't like much bass these might not sound quite as good to you as they did to me.  So sound quality is one of the most important qualities of a pair of headphones, and I'm happy to say that Beats nailed it in that regard. The music sounds very clear and they are actually fun to listen to. The bass does sound awesome and the highs and mids are nice to. I also love that I can listen to different genres of music and experience the same great sound. For example, I listened to a song with a lot of vocals and not much bass and it still sounded very good. Now I've heard that these may not produce accurate sound, but I don't really care that much. I mainly use these to listen to music and my main goal for listening to music is to have fun, and I definitely achieve that goal when I listen to these headphones.Comfort and FitThis was another area that was very important to me as I wanted to be able to wear these headphones for a long time. I was happy to find that they are very comfortable headphones. Since they are over-ear, they don't put any pressure on the ears whatsoever. The ear-cups are very soft and the headband has sufficient padding as well. The one problem I did experience is that they clamp a little harder than I expected, however this is not a big problem (the good thing about this is that I do not have to worry about it falling off my head at all) Also, I've heard these do heat up on your ears but I have done household chores and such in them and they didn't get to the point where they were uncomfortable. Overall, these are a comfortable pair of headphones that I can wear for a long time.Update: So I've had my beats for a while now and the clamping problem is not as bad as it was. They are very comfortable now and I don't have any problems in that area. My guess is that either they've loosened up after a while or my ears have gotten used to wearing them. Anyways, they are very comfortable now.Design and FeaturesI purchased the glossy black version of these and I love it. They look amazing. They don't look or feel too big, and they are very sleek. They also feel fairly sturdy and very high quality. As far as features go, I love the fact that they can fold up into a more compact design. I also love the noise cancellation. It does work very well to block out sound, and with the music playing I can hardly hear anything (other than the music obviously). If you listen very carefully, you can hear a very quiet hiss while the music is paused, but I can't usually hear it while the music is playing. The battery indicator is nice, and the play/pause buttons and the up and down volume buttons are great too. They are built into the left ear-cup, and you can't tell they are there if you didn't know better.AccessoriesThe accessories it came with are very handy, including a hard carrying case, a charging cable with a usb to outlet converter, an auxiliary cable with control talk, and a regular auxiliary cable. The case does a very nice job of protecting the headphones, and even matches the style perfectly. The cables also seem to be very high quality and seem to be durable.Wrap-upAs I said, these are great headphones and I would recommend them to anyone. For the average person wanting a nice pair of headphones, they sound awesome and are fun to listen to. They are also comfortable to wear and offer a premium design. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of the Beats Studio Wireless headphones.

VA compromise between features and looks
p375
sg5
VPros:-Stylish. There's not much else on the market that has this color selection-Comfortable. After ~2hrs of wearing they still feel comfortable (my opinion)-A hard-shell case is included-Sound quality is decent-I've walked across the house from my device and was mostly interruption-free while listening to music. In my experience the range has been pretty good.Cons:-Expensive given the included features and sound quality. You're paying mostly for the stylish looks and the name.-Only 16 increments from min to max volume. This may seem like a lot, but it really isn't. Often I find that one click is too high, and the next one down is too low. The volume adjustments via the headphone buttons are very "coarse".-Power on indicators are very poor. When powering on while wearing the headphones, you get no indication whatsoever except for some noise canceling that occurs. No voice saying (like my plantronics earpiece does) "Power on, xx hours remaining", no power on chime. For the price, you'd expect better features in this regard.-Pairing/connected indicators are poor. My Bose Soundlink Color actually tells me in a computerized voice the name of the device that has connected to it. These headphones only give you a jumble of tones/beeps when a device has connected, and a similar sound when a device has disconnected. It's very confusing when changing devices to figure out what the beeps mean that you just heard. Also, to enter pairing mode you press the power button and look for led's to blink on the outside of the headset, but to hear the audible indicator when connected you need to be wearing them.-No dedicated track forward/reverse buttons. To change/pause a track or manage devices, you have to press (depending on what you want to do) the "b" button either 1x, 1x and hold, 2x, 2x and hold the second press, 3x, or 3x and hold on the third press. Not kidding. Confusing? You betcha.-The noise canceling "hisses" more than other noise-canceling headphones I've owned-The advanced noise canceling mode (which doesn't allow music to be played) gives no audible indicator, often making me wonder if it's in that mode or just powered on and not connected to a device.Maybe at some point in the future we'll have more manufacturers making wireless/noise-canceling headphones that aren't all black or make you look like you're piloting an aircraft of some sort, but for now this is about as good as it gets, which still leaves a bit to be desired.

VI was extremely excited to get these. Opening them was much like an Apple product. The packaging is beautiful, the product gorgeous, and you can't help but be proud of what you have in your hands. After using them for almost a full month though I returned them as they did not quite meet my needs.Pros:>Wireless bluetooth connection works really well.>They look great>Comfortable for an hour or so>Well Made with good quality materials>GREAT noise canceling, better than a set of Bose wired noise canceling headphones I have.Cons:>The really great noise canceling comes at a cost, the ear cups appear to be sealed. They get very warm with long listening (1.5+ hrs continuous listening) and my ears/head would sweat.>Ear cups are slightly too small for my ears causing discomfort after long listening. (They fit my wife perfectly though and she preferred the fit over the Bose). I have average sized ears for a guy in his 30's, not some huge elephant ears like the old guys you see sometimes.>Pairing with multiple devices either doesn't work or is complicated. I had trouble with it, and since you only have a single blinking LED to tell you what is going on it can get really frustrating sometimes. If your connecting this to just one device and leaving it that way you'll be just fine, the first pairing is very easy.>Buttons could use some tactile feedback. The buttons are the silver "b" on the outside of the cups. This looks slick but when it comes to using them, changing the volume, mute/pause, changing track, etc I tended to hit the wrong part of the b or fumble when it was something urgent like UPS at my door with another Prime delivery.>Sound is good, but it does not have the clarity of my Bose, nor the ability for pounding bass. You tend to get one or the other (both of which I enjoy in the right setting), but with these it was a middle ground of good but not seller sound quality.Overall these are really well made, and VERY attractive headphones. I still recommend them, they just were not for me.

VI've never listened to a pair of previous generation Beats, but I understand they are unnaturally bassy and generally frowned upon by audio purists and audiophiles. Well, I'm not entirely sure when they changed the sound signature, but when I found out they were supposed to sound more neutral, I had to buy a pair as I've always been a sucker for the stylish, minimalistic design of the brand.I am not disappointed! I wasn't actually expecting these to sound considerably different compared to earlier models, but as someone who's extremely critical of audio (I have a small collection of custom monitors that is slowly expanding), I am impressed. These are about as neutral as I could want them. To my ears, they sound just right. Not too bassy, not too bright, very clear... and I can't comfortably play them at 100% volume, so there's a ton of headroom.For those of you who are unaware or unfamiliar (as I was both), these support a bluetooth protocol called "aptX." I had never heard of it until now, but it's an amazing advancement in bluetooth audio. The company behind it has figured out how to compress the data for bluetooth transfer without compromising the audio quality, so you get CD quality wirelessly! I can't tell the difference between wired and unwired! However, for my computer (a somewhat outdated iMac), the codec wasn't used by default. I had to download an Apple developer utility called "Bluetooth Explorer" to force my system to use the codec. I'm not entirely sure, but I think some systems may use it by default. If you buy these and the wireless audio sounds poor to you, you have to enable the aptX codec manually on your computer. (Side note: some smartphones support it, however the iPhone 6 is not one of them)A few more notes before I wrap up: The design is REALLY elegant. I've always loved the look of Beats headphones. The glossy black finish, the iconic "b" logo, the minimalistic screwless design and attention to small details are not lost on this consumer. As an Apple fanboy, I've always thought, "THIS is how Apple would design headphones"... and then Apple bought them out. Good move, Apple.Battery life also seems like plenty. They're supposed to be able to run for 20 hours. Of course, I would never wear them that long, so I'd still be happy if they didn't meet those expectations. For the record, I watched a ~2 hour movie last night using the aptX codec and afterward, the battery still showed a full charge. The latency is pretty bad, however this could have been due to my computer. Nonetheless, if you're using VLC to watch movies, you can adjust the audio sync with a simple touch of a button (I believe they were "d" and "f").The packaging is also really nice. It feels like you're opening a gift on Christmas day as a child. First, remove the outer sleeve, then slide the top half of the box off, then pull the box cover off by it's tab... and there they are. Underneath the headphones is yet another partition where the accessories are. They didn't just slap everything in a box. Some thought went into how they would be presented.Finally, the only reason I gave these 4 stars is because most people know the margins on these are extremely high. I'm well aware you could buy an even better sounding pair of headphones for considerably less than these. Having said that, I'll admit I'm a brand whore. These headphones could have sounded worse and I still would have been happy to have them. If I need better quality, I'll grab a set of my custom monitors (Google it if you haven't heard of them), but for a pair of wireless headphones I can just throw on whenever I don't feel like the hassle of wired CIEMs, these are PERFECT!

VI gave up using a pair of Sony noise cancelling headphones many years ago - recently I decided to pull them out and give them another shot - they were a pair that rested on-ear, and during a flight to London - after about 2 hours my ears just plain hurt and the noise cancelling was simply not very good - so I began researching out other possibilities...  I had noticed a lot of people wearing Beats - and on prior flights I have gotten to use Bose QC 15.I went to a Best Buy to try both Bose and these wireless Beats Studio out - although the noise cancelling was superiorly better on the Bose, Bose simply has no competing product to the Beats Studio Over-Ear Wireless.  And in my opinion, the Beats actually did sound better.As I read these reviews I was worried about this hiss, but it's not like a buzz or what not and I don't even notice it really.  Especially with airplane noises or what have you.  When watching a movie on a plane or listening to music - these simply feel very comfortable - sound great and block "some" of the outside world.Over all for me - I really really like these.  I am no DJ - but they absolutely sound so much better then the Sony I had, more comfortable then the Apple ear buds - and I simply love the wireless/wired option.  I feel a little ridiculous wearing them - but they do look better then alternatives and I bought them for the sound and wireless option!So for me, these meet all my expectations very well!

VThese sound much better than the old Beats headphones, which had a really muddy sounding bass tone. Ever since they cut Monster loose, their sound seems to have improved, but for 300+ dollars you should expect much more. It's still not on par with headphones(albeit wired) that cost half as much. My biggest complaints with these, and why I ultimately returned them to Target, was that they're incredibly uncomfortable, feel cheap, and the bluetooth kept cutting out despite being mere inches away from the source. The tightness was making my ears hurt within 10 minutes of using them. The cheap feel and all the videos of them snapping online made me not want to try to stretch them myself in the hopes of making them less tight. I tried multiple Bluetooth devices, and they all had connection issues. It just wasn't worth the headache.For such a premium priced item, the biggest letdown was how non-premium the actual product felt. It sounded fine when using the included wires, though, but I didn't pay 300+ for a wired headphone. Another complaint is the non-stop hiss. They call it noise-canceling, but it's just annoying if you listen to any quiet song or watch a quiet scene in a movie. Hissssssssssssss all the bloody time. Somehow Bose manages to do it without the hiss, but not these. And what's worse is that the noise canceling didn't even work well to remove background noise.I guess what people say is true, these are more fashion statement than serious headphones.

VSorry to give a great product a less than stellar review.  Whenever I tried to use these, they would work great for about 15 minutes to 1/2 hour and then a very annoying low frequency popping or fluttering noise would start on the right speaker only.  Otherwise they sounded great when they worked  It wasn't the Bluetooth source transmitter because I hard wired the speakers to the source and the noise continued after disabling Bluetooth.  I have other Beats products and love them... so I suspect this is an anomaly.  Despite it's disappointing performance, the product gets two stars because the appeared to have good/solid workmanship and were comfortable. I got over the ears because on-ear headphones are uncomfortable to me.  They had a really good weight and held to your head better than many high end headphones.  I'm going to stick to hard wired headphones for now.Amazon handled the return within the 30 day no-hassles period.  I haven't seen the credit on my card yet, but I have received verification that the credit has been issued.  Kudos to Amazon on their return policy.  Amazon's return policy gets 5 stars.

VHorrendously Overpriced.
p421
sg5
VKind of conflicted about leaving what amounts to a negative review on these Beats Studio headphones when the only complaint I have is the ridiculous price point. The problem here is that they are such a horrendously poor value when compared to other headphones, this really should be reflected somewhere in the products reviews. These things are sooooo ridiculously overpriced it reminds me of the old Monster Cable mentality. Price your product ridiculously high, hire celebrity sponsors and paste their image all over the place in order to convince ordinary people to part with an extraordinary amount of money for a good, but nonetheless ordinary product. This was ridiculous with Monster cables and it's more of the same with these headphones.For those that would say that these headphones are better than common headphones, I would agree. Sure. They ARE good headphones. And no doubt they are better and worth more than average run of the mill headphones, probably even 2X or even 3X as much. But 8X as much?? Sorry Dre and Apple. no friggin way are these even a remotely reasonable value at $375. I compared these Beat's Studio headphones to $50 Photive headphones and while the Beats might be worth double the price of the $50 headphones, they are in no possible way in any world worth 8X the price. I wouldn't mind paying $100 for these. Maybe even $150? But $375!!In my opinion, if you're hoping to find any sort of value when you spend your money, probably should keep looking. Saying these are overpriced is an understatement. But on the other hand, if you're just swimming in cash and a brand whore, these might be a good fit.Would love to know what the teardown cost of these headphones is. Development costs aside, I'm betting these couldn't cost more than $50 to manufacture. While I guess somebody has to pay Apple back for the 3 Billion they shelled out to Dre and Jimmy Iovine when they bought Beats from them. I guess Dre bought himself an island in the Caribbean.On the positive side, while I agree they do sound good, the biggest advantage of these Beats Studio headphones is the comfort. They are very comfortable headphones. In fact, I can't imagine them being any more comfortable. It's like having two pillows on your head. But how much can two pillows cost?So one star on these for horrendous value, plus an additional star for the pillows. Get regular headphones and a couple of small pillows. And save yourself $300.

p427
sg5
VInitial review is 5 stars, because I have no issues with this so far.I bought this after returning the Bose QC25 headphones I purchased earlier.  I was vacillating between the QC25, the Beats Studio wired model and the wireless model.  I first decided on the QC25 because Beats has a reputation for being overpriced junk, something only rap and hip hop listeners buy.  After using the QC25 for some time, I found the sound quality was not that great and the headphones didn't fit me so well.  So i figured I might as well try this out.  So far I am happy with this after 2 days of use.Design: Better than the QC 25.  Looks better and stores better in the provided case.Comfort: More comfortable than the QC 25.  And it stays on my head better.  The QC 25 fell off so many times.Noise canceling: The QC 25 has a slight advantage over the Beats Studio in this department.  It blocked out more of the continuous noise than the Studio does.  Even so, the Studio does well with blocking out noise.  I have read of people complaining of a hissing noise.  There is a soft hiss, but it sounds more like a waterfall to me.  But that is just me.  Everyone's perception will be different.Sound quality: I want to preface this by saying I do not listen to rap, hip hop or techno crap music.  So I guess I'm not the target demographic for Beats.  I listen more to classic rock, indie music, singer songwriter type stuff, and Hindi music, old and new.  I don't notice any overemphasis on any range in the songs I listen to.  I have heard that Beats headphones are bass heavy, but I don't find that to be the case here.  If there is any distortion of any of the ranges, it's usually a result of poor mixing or poor sound quality, which is the case with some old Hindi songs.The selling point of these headphones is the wireless capability.  Very easy to connect.  I have Apple devices so I can't say how well these headphones will pair with Samsung devices or other brand devices.Battery life is about 12 hours on one charge in Bluetooth mode.  I have not used the Studio in wired mode.Overall, I am glad I took the plunge at the risk of looking like a consumeristic tool.  Beats has made a decent quality pair of headphones.UPDATE: Okay, I used it with the wire, and that is when I noticed the heavy bass sound and the hissing noise when the noise canceling is on.  Still doesn't change my rating.

VI travel a lot for work, and I wanted a set of headphones that were wireless, over the ear and noise cancelling. When looking for headphones with all of those features, the pickings were quite slim. The Beats headphones fit what I wanted perfectly. I am a frequent flier and I was tired of getting the cord snagged, so wireless was very important to me, as well as being noise cancelling.As far as the noise cancelling goes, they are very good, and work nicely while flying. They are not as good as the new Bose 25's, I would say they are about 75 percent of what those headphones are in the noise cancelling department. I wish Bose made a wireless version of those headphones, I would buy them for sure.The sound from these are good to me, I'm not an audiophile but I'm satisfied with the performance from these headphones. I personally can't tell a difference when using these wired or wireless, but I only tried them wired a couple times to see if there was a difference. I bought these specifically for the wireless functionality anyway, and in that department they sound great.The comfort of these headphones is great, I can wear them for hours without any type of discomfort. The ear padding is more than sufficient and they fit around my ears nicely. I would say I have a medium sized head and these fit on my head well, the padding on the band isn't as heavy as I've seen on other headphones but I haven't had any problems with that. Oh yeah, these are very light, not the lightest on the market, but still very light.To me, the style and design of these headphones are some of the best on the market. I was torn between the matter black and the titanium, but in the end I went with matte black. I was looking for something nice looking, but not something that said look at me. These have a very clean, understated look and that's exactly what I wanted. They fold up very nicely and come with a nice hard shell case, which is also perfect for traveling.In conclusion, if you are looking for a set of headphones that are wireless, over the ear and noise cancelling, these will do nicely. As many people have said before, these are on the pricey side, but if that isn't a problem for you, I say go for them. That being said, if you don't happen to want/need wireless, I might look elsewhere, as you can find a much better value for the money in the $150-200 range. All that being said, I'm very happy with my purchase.

Vimprovement over previous models ? really ? where ?
p438
sg5
Vdisappointing would unfortunately be the sum up of my experience with those headphones. It failed to meet the expectations i had on it, and moreover performed below average competition when i compared it.I'm not new to beats, i already have a wireless solo. I use it mainly at the gym, and the no-cable thing is something i got used to very quickly. So there was no doubt in my mind that a good replacement would only be another wireless headphone. i didnt feel i needed to change mine until i found out a studio version (promising better sound quality and insulation from surrounding noise) and wireless, with active noise cancellation, it was definitely a call to try. Plus i thought i could use them during travels/commuting. Boy, what a disappointment !Better sound quality over previous versions ? well ok maybe, but it's not that striking based on previous models, nor stunning by itself.Passive noise insulation ? well for an over ear headphone, i would have expected it to perform much better, at leat better than mine which doesnt cover the ears. No difference ! seriously, it doesnt make sense.Active noise cancellation ? thats probably the worse, and i felt i was tricked by the name of that. Try beats vs sennheiser vs bose headphones with active noise cancellation and you'll understand what i mean. It's not active noise cancellation (counter sound to insulate you from surrounding noise) but just a cheap white noise. Moreover, depending on what type of music you listen, it's annoying and you can hear this parasite noise (that you cant stop as its permanently working) They should advertise it for what it is : white noise, nothing more.Plus they revamped the controls (pause/play, fforward, rewind) on a single control button (good luck with resistance over time as this piece will be over used) like a small remote control : it doesnt make sens as they had plenty of space on the outside of the headphones to maintain the separate button controls, plus it works poorly : from time to time it understands FF over RW, or the reverse.In the end, after two weeks of extensive try out, i had to send it back for refund. It definitely is not and improvement over what was already in the manufacturer line up, noise cancellation is way below competition and performs poorly. It's a huge disappointment. I'll try the powerbeats 2 (they would be without noise cancellation, but lighter and might fit my needs better for gym)

VWorth the Upgrade
p444

VI have always been a fan of the beats studio.  so I had the first generation of beats studio for about 2 years.  But one thing that was bothering me with the older version was the wire.When I heard that a wireless Bluetooth version was coming up.. I jumped right to it and trust me when I say: " I am glad that I did"I think it mentioned that it can play on Bluetooth for 12 hours... I am not going to back this claim up but I the very least, I can tell you that on a full charge, this device can play for more than 10 hours... I spent a whole Saturday doing work while listening to music/movies from different Bluetooth  transmitter, from my phone to my computer to another phone etc.. and it work very very well.The most compelling factor to me to get this product is that it's wireless.  Again wireless was for me the only reason why I upgraded. Being able to stand up and leave the room and still play music, being able to control devices from the headset itself was the world to me and I am very glad I did.The sound quality  is as good as the previous generation ( wired)  I have been taking it to work everybody and listening to music and I haven't noticed the difference on the sounds output... I haven't really paid attention very much but I am sure that I would have noticed the difference it there was any.the bad??! well when I take call with the device I get the sense that it just listen to the whole room; by that I mean that you will hear very clearly any object moving around the room you are located... although the people I talked to haven't complained yet ( asking if I put them on speaker or something), personally it's a little annoying to hear everything that's happening around you when you are trying to talk.  But other than that the microphone is awesome.Bottom line.I am very happy with the product! I was afraid that I wasn't going to get my money worth but so far, the product is performing very well, I have not had any battery issue. it last me the whole day without any problem and the sound quality is great.The noise canceling is also great, and although it doesn't cancel all the noise out, activating noise canceling does make a huge difference.P.S: when I first used the headset I thought I was just happy because it's a new and shiny devices.  But I think I am 3 weeks in and it still amaze me at how comfortable and "FREE" of wire I can be.my 2 cents.

VThese headphones could not be a worse value at the price.  Absolutely do not recommend these if you are any kind of audiophile.Pros:* Nice look* Wireless nice and the bluetooth connectivity works well* Lithium ion batter is goodCons:* Very poor mid-to-high performance.  I had heard these about beats headphones but I was surprised that their top-of-the-line product has such poor performance.  Many songs come across as very tinney and there is a lot of crossover noise* The noise-canceling is sub-par.  My 10 year old Bose Quiet Comforts perform better than these in noise canceletion AND sound quality* The headset is uncomfortable after extended wear.  They put a lot of pressure on the ears with no way to adjust and you have to take them off for a while to alleviate your ears.Overall very poor.  Happy to return these and stick with Bose for $100 less like I should have done from the beginning

VGreat sound but they constantly disconnect. Even if I move my head, the sound sometimes cuts out. Forget about the 30-foot guarantee! I can't even stand up without being disconnected. And it's something a full charge doesn't fix. For $280 I would hope for a pair of earphones that blow my mind, and not disconnect whenever I turn my head to take a sip of soda.Saying all this, the sound quality is 7/10. I've heard better but these are still pro and give rich, deep bass.The noise-cancellation function isn't all that great and it's what is being sold here for so much. I'd give that feature 5.5/10.The wireless capability is an absolute fail. 4/10.I would still recommend these to a friend. After they've fixed the wireless disconnecting error.

VI bought mine from apple store on January. and after 10 month the seam of the leather got open. I was surprised it is glued instead of stitched. the leather is low quality and it gets open because it is glued. apple store said they will fix it but not replacing it. and they said after one year warranty is over I will have to pay $199 for any repair. It is very costly product and broke so fast. I used it only on my desk at work not even gym or workout. The design is really cool and the sound is great. But now I'm worried if the seam gets broken again I will have to throw it away because I will not pay $199 to fix it. I hope Beats will start to stitch the leather components and use better quality leather material.

VLooks absolutely magical.In terms of comfort, I'd say these can last around two hours before i need to give my ears a break. These newer generation beats also have less bass than the older gens. The "around the ear" cushion is also a bit smaller in terms of circumference as compared to the older gen beats.In terms of sound quality, these are definitely superior but, ill be honest, it wasn't anything spectacular. I can definitely study with these, blocks out some sound but I can still hear the muffle when people talk.Oh, and the wireless is a nice touch too if you're into Apple products.

VNot the greatest for a person seeking bass on the music. Packaging very presentable, the materials of the headphone quite descent. Audio: too many highs, mids, and a lack of low freqs. The headphones will do great for a person that listens to hip hop, pop,  or other music that doesn't include essential bass. Noise cancelling not the greatest.Great headphones for the looks; for a person who knows how real music needs to sound, the headphones aren't worth the outstanding price. Not a beats hater, purchased them, returned them the next day and still looking for that specific headphone that will exceed my expectations.

VThis is an excellent pair of headphones, sound quality is excellent for average consumers, I can't compare headphones in terms of how deep and bassy or how clear or or or, coz am not a professional, simply it is excellent for me good bass and clear lows mids and highs.I have to say that I bought this after a good research, I chose this for the following reasons:-1. Wireless: I wouldn't buy a wired headphone whatsoever - personal preference2. Sound quality: I tried Solo HD before from a friend it sounds good honestly, and in my research I found that the new studio is the first beats that paid attention to clear mids and lows rather than boosting bass, so reviewers were gladly announcing that this pair is of the best beats sound quality.3. Built-in mic: this feature is way too helpful, I am using it to answer calls and as it is wireless it is so convenient to be used in car or office. btw I have an android htc one.4. Chargeable battery: while comparing it with bose, I was not sure which one should I get, but the fact that this is chargeable and bose is AAA battery, I went with these. again maybe bose is better sound and maybe not but for me I don't think I can say what is better even if I compare listening to them at the same moment, but the fact that bose has a better noise cancelling I am very sure of but I preferred to go with chargeable battery :)5. Looks: this is a really stylish and sleek pair of headphones.Note: for an android htc one, all controls worked properly, the remote control cable worked and I can make calls using it (but volume buttons didn't work), built-in mic worked properly while wireless which is the most important thing.If you want to benefit from my research, if you are looking for a wireless headphone and a stylish look with excellent sound, consider these too:Beats Studio Wireless, Parrot Zik Wireless (touch ear-cup), and check Senheiser models.I personally loved to have Beats logo when compared them :)

VWhen you get the box, it is a high quality type of experience, similar to opening up the I-Phone box.  You expect the product to be packaged well, from the headphones themselves to the wires in their little plastic sleeves.  I finally got fed up with the crappy little ear plugs made by everyone.  They always fall out of your ears and you always hear the jabbering idiots talking loudly next to you.I decided that I deserved true "over the ear" high end headphones....  Did I get them with the Beats Studios?YES YES YES......did I mention....yes?These are the best quality earphones and they continue to get better.  The first generation ones  have been dramatically improved with this set.  The carrying case is great.  I always have them in my backpack riding on the Metro in the morning and have always dropped or knocked my pack against someone or something, no harm to the Beats!The sound is great.  Those that review and say that they hear things that are off.......are you ##$#@ kidding me?  What the heck do you do for a living that that minute detail is that important?  To the vast majority of people, these rank up there with the Sony Noise-cancelling one, but do not feel as "flimsy" as the Sonys.  Sony has really let EVERYTHING go past them.  They created the Walkman, the Discman, the Trinitron TV.....but they missed the ENTIRE boat on the MP3 players, flat screens, etc.......The only thing wrong with these?  The wire is a bit short, thus I wish I had spent the extra $$$ for the wireless version....!Maybe when my next option/stock pick does well, I'll reward myself......

V01-18-2014 - Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone (Matte Black):Great sounding, great bass, great tone, great volume capability, comfortable, easy to charge and pair, Sturdy, well made, attractive, no finger printing on matte finish (which is really nice), nice hard carry case that zips (but limited room in case for cables and no room for charger).BUT **NOT noise cancelling. I bought these for studio use as a drummer. I have been using Bose QC15 for several years but wanted to go wireless. The Beats Studio Wireless have absolutely no true noise canceling properties. All you get is a quite digital hiss in the background that does absolutely nothing. They could not even cover the sound of my small floor fan that is under my snare drum.If you want great sounding wireless headphones then the Beats Studio Wireless would be a great choice. If you need true, real noise cancellation go with the Bose as I have tried every brand that claims noise cancellation and the Bose are the only ones that actually work.I hope this helps.

V$379 is asking a lot for a set of wireless headphones.Pros:  - Stylish  - Comfortable, Seem to be well made (only had mine 2 months now).  - Noise Cancellation is Adequeate ( NOT Phenomenal ).Con:  -  Very Expense.  - Battery life is not 20 hours of continuous use, mine only gets about 4 hours. (wireless)  -  Can only Pause or Start Music  ( for reference my $59 pair of LG bluetooth headphones can pause, start, select tracks, and increase volume and answer  calls  ALL wirelessly ---  These only pause and start music, not sure yet of you can answer calls with them without it being plugged in to your phone ).I might reconsider about the price if these were made in the USA.  But since all of these electronics are made in factories over seas by the lowest bidder.  I don't think these are worth $379.... $150 MAX.  maybe.Sorry DRE  err  Uh  Beats you missed the mark on this one.

VTHIS IS A REAL FRAUD!!! NO APTX SUPPORT, but Beats Customer Care keeps saying the opposite!!! SHAME on you Beats!!!
p553
sg5
VYou find at the bottom my analysis of the decent Sound "Quality" of these Headphones.At first I want to talk about their lack of the Aptx codec, and the fact that Beats (through their Customer Care) keeps saying to everybody that the Studio Wireless DO support Aptx. So people even write that in forums and in their private (non professional) reviews. And even professional reviewers end by saying that. And so people buy them, but there is NO Aptx support, and THIS IS A REAL FRAUD!!!Such a SHAME that I cannot give anything else than one star till Beats/Apple will apologize for the false Info given.About Aptx: when the Audio is transmitted through the BT signal it must be encoded, and Aptx is a relatively new Codec which gives a much better Sound Quality than the old SBC codec.Some products support it, some don't.Beats Studio Wireless do NOT support it.Here some FACTS to prove it:- On the Official Aptx website you can find a list of all the devices which support Aptx.  The Beats Studio Wireless are NOT in that list. Only the old Beats Wireless (without "Studio", and which look totally different) are listed. This list is not 100% actual, for example no Apple product is there, although Apple Products with OS X support Aptx.Still, it is not a good beginning.- When you connect an Aptx device to an Xperia Smartphone with Aptx, you get a notification like "Connected to an APTX Device". ALWAYS. This is automatic, it can NOT be avoided. And with the Beats Studio Wireless nobody gets this notification, EVER.- When you connect an APTX device to a PC through an APTX Dongle powered by the CSR Harmony Stack, you ALWAYS get a CSR APTX Logo.But you NEVER get it with the Studio Wireless.- The Sennheiser BTD 500 USB Dongle with Aptx support blinks red when connected to an Aptx device, blue when connected to a NON Aptx device. With the Beats it blinks, guess what, BLUE.- The Avantree Priva Aptx adapter also blinks differently according to which Codec is being used.With the Studio Wireless it blinks like "SBC Codec" being used.- On the Manual and on Beats Website you cannot read ANYWHERE that they support Aptx.  The presence of Aptx is a major selling point. Nobody would ever hide it.- I have tested them even with the Macbook Pro of a friend (OS X, Aptx supported). There was NO APTX connection active. We even tried to FORCE an Aptx connection. It FAILED. The connection was always SBC. I have asked an internet friend to do the same with his Macbook Pro Retina and his Studio Wireless (which he then returned). He confirmed: NO APTX connection.So, these are FACTS, and are a LOT of facts. It is clear: the Beats Studio Wireless do NOT support Aptx!I wanted to understand why people say that Beats told them the opposite. And so I called Beats.Their Customer Care told me that the Studio Wireless support Aptx.I was shocked.I asked them for a WRITTEN official answer, with a link to the corresponding information on their website.And I got this E-Mail from 11 Dec:"Thanks for contacting Beats by Dr. Dre Support.As per our earlier conversation, please find below the list of codecs for the Studio Wireless Bluetooth version:AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)APTXAVRCP (Audio/Video Remote Control Profile)A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile)HFP (Hands-Free Profile)SBC (Sub Band Codec)As mentioned, this is specific information which is not available online, therefore we are not able to provide you with a link as requested.Please let me know if you have any other questions.Kind Regards,xxxBeats by Dr. Dre(tm) Support"(I have hidden the real name of the Supporter for respect to the Privacy)Also the German Support of Beats wrote me on the 22th Dec that the Studio Wireless support Aptx.So. Here there are only two possibilities to me:1) this is a FRAUD and Beats give wrong info to sell more.2) the Customer Care of Beats is just bad (but, in this case, who is guilty if they only give the info they receive from Beats?)In both cases, Beats has lost all credibility to me.Now as promised I will talk of their SOUND.I have compared lately in a long test of many many weeks more than 20 BT Headphones among the best and more famous ones. If you ask I can tell you which ones and I can also make detailed comparisons.Tastes are tastes and I will never claim that my tastes are better.Besides I'm not gonna talk of my tastes but only of what is more or less objective.And due to the big amount of BT Headphones compared, I am in a good position to judge a Headphone more objectively, or less subjectively.Briefly:they are not "bad", and if they would cost the half of what they cost, and if Beats would not scam around with a fake Aptx support, I would have given 3 Stars.But they do NOT worth THAT money, EVER. You get MUCH better for less.Anyway the Beats look very nice, they are portable enough, they are very comfortable (IF you do not have big ears), they have a good BT range, a decent sound, and they are loud, but also with a high frequency HISS which you can annoyingly hear when the music is more quite.Thoroughly:- The soundstage is mediocre, the different instruments are not well placed in the space- the detail is decent. Nothing special, but also not bad.- The bass is abundant. No problem for me, but some people could find it too much. The problem is its mediocre quality: it is muddy, dark and intrusive (=it invades other frequencies, it is not controlled, not precise), with a muffled punch, almost zero rumble, and no  warmth, no depth, mediocre body. Absolutely no "wow". No locked smile in your face while listening to dubstep.- In the Mid Range the low mids are dominant and dull, the center and upper mids are a bit recessed and lack warmth. They cannot create a bridge along  the sound, which is divided between bass and highs and so not harmonious. If you know the expression "V Shape", you know what I mean.- The highs are abundant too, and actually not bad for a Headphone which has no Aptx support. But they are a bit harsh and with just decent detail. You are not going to say "wow" listening to jazz and lot of hi-hat.- They have a ANC which does not cancel much noise and which cannot be deactivated when you do not need it.- They do not support Aptx but they support AAC, which anyway unfortunately requires that you stream AAC files. So, it does not work with CD or MP3 or FLAC.- I do not know what kind of problem had other people with their build, but to me they seem very solid.- I had no problem with their comfort, they are soft enough to me, tight enough, with large enough pads. But people with larger head and/or ears have complained about low comfort.- they claim to have some kind of active/adaptive noise cancelling. I did not notice anything. They do isolate a bit, like any other around the ear closed headphone. But they do NOT cancel much more than that.- Their wireless range is quite good. This is what I liked more. I had no blind spots in my little department. Connection is fast too.Overall they sound decent without EQ, and can sound "good" with some EQ.But you cannot change them much. And you cannot make them give what they do not have. You can only moderate their faults.I definitely do NOT suggest them for THIS price. If they would cost $200 or less, they would be a nice choice, IF you can EQ them.But there are much better alternatives. I will name those which have a good strong bass (and a better bass than Beats):The Harman Kardon BT cost 1/3 and sound better, with more body in the bass and less dullness in the mids, even if also with a bit less highs.The Plantronics Backbeat Pro cost also less and sound MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better, plus they have many more functions.The Philips Fidelio M2BT cost also less and are universes better (in all but the range), with a REAL bass, the best I have ever heard in any BT Headphone, controlled, warm, vibrant, punchy, rumbling, fat, deep. Similar to the UE9000, maybe just a little less fat on some frequencies but also a bit punchier and more clean.The House of Marley Liberate XLBT cost the HALF and sound MUCH better, with an incredibly beautiful warmth in their mids, and a strong bass which is also a bit dull like the Beats but at least is warmer and more vibrant. They lack highs without EQ but improve a LOT with EQ.The Bose Soundlink On-Ear are a wonderful pair of Headphones, they sound overall MUCH better than the Beats, look very nice, are extremely comfortable, and their bass is comparable in quantity to the Beats, but better in quality.The JBL Synchros S400BT are also much much much better than the Beats.The Sony MDR-1RBTMK2 are one of the best bt headphones around and their bass is also strong enough.As you see, the alternatives are many. And all of them cheaper than the Beats.Now, it pisses me off when people have to vote a review down just because they disagree.If you disagree, write your review. I will not vote it down.It is important to have different reviews from different people with different tastes and opinions.Votes are for if a review is useful. And a review is useful when the reviewer explain in detail what he thinks of the product and why. No matter if you agree with his opinion or not.I have spent LOT of time in comparing headphones and writing reviews, and although I had fun while doing it, I didn't do it for fun, I did it to help people, including you :)The fact is, I always read reviews when I need to buy something. This helped me a lot. So I decided to return the favor. I have lost so much time in this comparison, that I want to make people save the time I have lost.So I hope this helped you people making the right purchase, and if you want to want to have more details about this review or the other Headphones I have tested, and how they compare, feel free to ask.I will be happy to help further!

V(Note:  I do not own a pair.  I extensively tested them at an Apple Store, and have subsequently used a pair that a friend of mine purchased.  I wouldn't personally spend so much money on a pair of headphones like this for reasons I will go into below.  But I have used these headphones enough to write a fair and honest review)I honestly believe that the reason you're going to shell out about $400 or so (counting tax) for these headphones is not because of their quality, but because you are buying a product with a recognizable name.  (Which is completely baffling and foolish to me.  But I understand that there are a certain number of people who care more about brand-names than quality, so this'll be right up their alley.)Now don't get me wrong- these are indeed good headphones, but they are not "$400 good."From a first-impressions standpoint, they did leave a little something to be desired.  They look good. (and from the product description, they were obviously more concerned with aesthetics than performance, boasting words like "sports car" and "sexy" to describe their product...  again, because you aren't buying this for quality, but rather for the "Beats" name)  But I personally found them to be fairly uncomfortable.  Too snug, I suppose you could say.  Even after adjusting them repeatedly, they always felt a bit too much like they were "squeezing" my head.  But I can forgive that.The sound quality was fairly excellent.  I particularly admired the bass.  Although as others have said, these do not deliver the best possible sound quality.  I would even venture to say that some of the cheaper $30-$50 headphones I have owned in the past were easily comparable if not even just-as-good in terms of sound quality.  Heck, a few weeks ago, I bought a $20 set of headphones from a generic brand at a CVS (just to have a cheap pair for traveling so I wouldn't have to worry if they broke while I was out and about), and they honestly didn't sound too far removed from these headphones in terms of clarity and quality.  (Although these were obviously better.  But NOT so much better to justify such a huge price difference.)The noise cancellation on these sucks, though.  It barely works.  I had heard rave reviews from people over how good the Adaptive Noise Canceling feature works, but it did literally nothing for me, or the other people I know who tried it.  Sure, it somewhat lowers the sound of what's around you, but again...  not in a dramatic enough way to justify the outlandish price.  You can still hear everything around you perfectly fine with the noise cancellation enabled.  Everything is just slightly muffled.  If I'm paying $400, I want more than a slight muffle to the outside sound.Bluetooth feature works fine.  Charging works fine.  Everything else is good.But the price isn't right.If these were about $100-$150, then this would have easily gotten a 5 out of 5 from me.  Because that's about what I'd say their worth.  But they most certainly aren't worth $400.  And that's what drops this score down to a 3 out of 5.  (I should give them a lower score on that principal, but I won't.  I'll be a bit more generous.)Good headphones.  (But NOT great.)  Good sound quality.  Bad noise cancellation.  Ridiculous price.

VGreat headphones for the gym but not that great for phone calls.  Call quality seems worse than when I just use my corded iPhone cords plus it's a bit confusing to answer calls with.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase because they are great for the gym or working around the house but was hoping they'd be better for making/receiving calls.

p587

VThese are actually really good headphones, but there are a few things you must understand before buying them.1. Audiophiles trash the hell out of beats, but what they don't understand is that they are meant for/marketed towards a totally different audience, and serve a completely different purpose than actual studio headphones. These headphones are meant for the power music listener/media consumer who enjoys a very full bodied sound to their content, not a sound engineer who is spending their time analyzing and tweaking sound frequencies in a digital audio file. These headphones are not "precise" at all... but understand that precision doesn't always equal a pleasurable listening experience. In fact, to the average joe, highly precise studio headphones will sound boring, and often times dull. Beats products provide a very rich and "bass-y" listening experience, which gives your music a sense of warmth and depth. This is done by tweaking the EQ frequencies, but they sound great nonetheless. Now, i agree that the name "studio" is extremely misleading, as these are NOT studio headphones. But i guess Beats' marketing department feels different.2. THEY ARE VERY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT THEY ARE. Truth be told, there are headphones out there for less than half the price that will give you the same/better listening experience; but understand that thats not what you are paying for when you buy beats! Beats has spent countless hours/money on marketing their products, and they have very successfully built and maintained a brand image like very few companies before them have ever been able to do. You are paying a premium because it is considered a privilege by society to be seen wearing beats, and it makes you the "cooler" person in the room. Its a fashion statement; much like a Louis Vuitton purse or a A&F; T-shirt. These headphones are not worth $380, i would even venture to say that they are not worth $280, but if you want that "beats image", thats what you are going to pay for.

VThese headphones sound great, period. I really wanted to get them to work for me. If your anything like me when you can't get your headphones connected it drive you crazy. I spend ten solid days with these and had enough aggregation that I decided to actually write a review. Here we go....Got these on Christmas from my wife, connected them that night and listened to some jams while coloring in my new adult coloring book....perfect combo, I know. Everything was going smoothly until the next morning. I woke up with the urge to toss on the headphones to take the dog out and walk around the house getting things put together....wouldn't connect. Turned the headphones on and off, bluetooth on and off, even went to my devices (iphone) and clicked connect/disconnect. I ended up having to forget the device, then connect them again....twice. Finally I got it working and by that time my wife could see the frustration was building. The same thing happened several other times during our short relationship.That being said, I wear bluetooth headphones for about 12 hours/day while I'm working and I know how to connect a pair of headphones, it wasn't user error. I rely on my headphones for my job, I don't want to waste time getting them connected multiple times throughout the day. If I'm not listening to some jams during the day I'd go crazy!The last straw was when this happened two days in a row, the EXACT same problem.Fast forward a couple days after the initial connection issue, maybe day 5 and 6. I'm pumped about trying these things out on the treadmill so I get on and start running. The zone is perfect, great pace, great bass..."started from the bottom now we here"......that's all you can think about. Songs over, I'm more than a mile in and don't even remember what happened. Time for some 2Pac, wait where is the music?? No sounds, NOTHING. I could hear it coming on, that different silent pitch you hear, but no music at all. Force closed my apps, turned headphones on/off, bluetooth on/off, everything, hard reset on the phone.....all while running....nothing worked. I had to listen to the music on my phone speakers the rest of the run. This happened two days in a row.I wanted to love these, I really did. I had wanted a pair for a very long time and wouldn't ever buy them for fear I wouldn't like them. I'm perfectly happy with the LG 730's...they've lasted me over a year and have great sound quality for what I use them for. I would imagine these would get 5 stars from me had I wanted a headphone that I plugged in.I'm not proofreading this.

VOk, I will try to be as comprehensive as possible, and update it as the earphones age. First off, some background: I use these at work in an industrial setting. There is a considerable amount of background noise, and that's what enticed me to spend $260 on some ANC headphones such as these. Picture the noise of an airplane, times about two.First impression: they definitely seem well-built, you can tell the plastic isn't cheaply made, and the unfold to the regular shape with a satisfying snap, with no worries that they'll fold up on you while wearing. They are very comfortable when wearing, without too much pressure against my head, and without feeling like they're going to go sailing across the room if I bend down to pick up a penny.First use: in a high-decibel setting, I was initially a little disappointed. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was really hoping for an instantaneous ultra-quiet oasis to pop up, surrounding me in peace and serenity with my best music playing quietly and in such exquisite detail, that all my problems melted away. But seriously, they just seemed decent and stopping the noise, though the music quality was fantastic.After heavy use: the more I played with them, the more I found the proper positioning in order to keep any outside noise from leaking into the cups, after that, the noise cancelling was truly phenomenal. It got to the point that if I took them off, I was overwhelmed at the noise that it was preventing from getting to my ears. They stayed comfortable for decent amounts of time, though I did feel the need to adjust them every hour or so in order to give my ears and the top of my head a little break (they seemed to press very lightly on the furthest protruding point of my ears, only a minor inconvenience over my 8 hour shift). The battery was impressive, I still had 25% left after my shift. And the best part: no wires to get tangled up in! I could set my phone down and plug it in and forget about it. I did run into a small quirk regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. It would occasionally decide to disconnect for no particular reason, though it wasn't often, and I just had to turn them off and then back on to reconnect.Value wise, I'd say I wouldn't spend the MSRP on the apple website of $350, but $260 on Amazon was on the high end of reasonable for the quality and features. I previously owned some Jaybird BlueBuds that set me back $160, and comparatively these phones were much more high-quality, with much longer battery, and not to mention I didn't enjoy having buds in my ears for long periods of time.Overall, I am very impressed, and I look forward to pushing the performance of these high-quality earphones.

VNot the original improved - a whole different headphone. Too much hiss, cramped / boxed in sound.
p603
sg5
VBackground hiss is too noticeable for a product at this price point. I have the first generation Studio, so when I read comments in reviews about the noticeable hiss I was thinking it would be like the very slight hiss that is noticed in the first generation from the amplification + noise cancellation circuitry. Not so, unfortunately - it is quite a bit more noticeable. When switching back and forth between my old Studio and the 2.0, I couldn't even notice the first gen hiss in my kitchen (probably not a quiet enough environment), but I could totally notice the hiss in 2.0.In addition to the unacceptable hiss level, I can't approve of the direction that Beats has gone with the tone in the new generation. It's not just gen 1 but better / clearer / tighter / etc., and with wifi and recharge ability and better build - it's really a completely different sound. If you liked the first gen, don't expect this headphone to be first gen but better. They don't really compare from a sound point of view. You should approach these headphones from the perspective of buying a completely different pair of headphones - you can throw your experience from gen 1 out the window pretty much entirely. At that point, you may then just as well consider alternatives like the Sennheiser Momentums or other candidates in this price range. I find the sound of Studio 2.0 to be cramped, boxy, too mid-rangy, and at times unpleasantly shrill / ringing in the mid range. In comparison, while the first gen admittedly has some issues with muddiness or boominess in its bass, it still overall sounds more open and spread out than this 2.0, and easier to listen to for long stretches. I could tell immediately from listening to 2.0 that the sound would be fatiguing - even in short listening I was wincing at some piercing / ringing notes.The first gen Studio really opened my ears up to a whole new experience of music - classical, electronica, jazz, rock, you name it. With 2.0, I feel the Beats Studio is no longer worth considering as this product category of relatively affordable, semi-audiophile grade headphones has filled with better alternatives. They blew their chance, in my opinion.

VWhat are now the best headphones for my needs
p609
sg5
VListening to just a few wireless headphones in the stores but reading about dozens lead me to the ultimate question in the universe: What are the best headphones for my needs?  In a short answer the definitive conclusion was the Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. In a long answer the overwhelming conclusion was based on several things. One of which was sound. The reviews were in and the actual listening concluded these are best of the best including the lows, the highs, and the midrange without effort or struggle or false harmonics that some have suggested. I didn't see any high-end headphones where I was going so I took what was available to the masses in regular electronic stores.I've played a variety of music which includes instrumental, dance, jazz, hip-hop, soul (listening to Joss Stone made my ears melt [in a good way]) and a slew of vocal jazz.  Most of the music was 192k up to ~900k Apple m4a lossless and the subtleties are profound! No need to turn these bad boys up very loud because of the noise cancellation which I found pretty good in a very low decibel space. Once I try these out in a noisy environment I am sure the subtleties will change and I will be forced to either turn them up or just deal with it.Besides the quality packaging (better than Apple I'd say hands down), the quality of the hardware are sturdy and durable compared to a pair of HD280 Sennheiser wired headphones just gathering dust now.  Bluetooth capability (Link Quality) to the mac and iphone and ipad are steady at 3.0 (Transmit Power) and 0.00 errors (Retransmission) per Bluetooth Explorer (from the Apple Development downloads - IO Hardware Tools). The controls and functionality of what is available works cleanly with sustenance and quality. These will last a long long time.  I am one happy camper!  And now on to the movies!Updated: 11/22/15: Listening to a few movie and tv shows were pleasant to the ear for many reasons. The clarity of the words were clear and noticeably without harshness or unnatural voice harmonics. Midrange and lows were tight and with no muddiness or harsh booming fluttering sounds indicative of over zealous or under powered speakers. From earlier stated there is no need to crank up the volume to gain anything perhaps on the fringe of voice or sound. Everything is present and clean. The lows never rattled or disbursed fluttering effects which is a new level for Beats from what I gather on earlier first gen headphones. And listening to much more Rap (lots of Eminem) and Hip-Hop was very clean and very studio like allowing me to focus on the lyrics and tonality of the rhythm.

VBeats Headphones by Dr. Dre! I'm in! This was my first thought when the first round of headphones were introduced, unfortunately, I re-learned why I shouldn't become influenced and manipulated by marketing to purchase anything. The style was cool and new, but more importantly they sounded like crap and I hated them. I don't want my headphone to sound like a car rolling down the street with so much bass you could hear the truck rattling.  I wanted sound quality so I sold them and purchased a pair of Bose. With technological advances I wanted to upgrade and experience even better quality so I began researching for the best pair to enhance my experience with music.  Here are the candidates I considered: Parrot zik 2.0, Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless with Active Noise Cancellation, Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Sony MDRXB950BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headset and Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone - Matte Black. I spent hours watching reviews and going over the pros and cons of each before narrowing down to Parrot, Sennheiser and Beats. After internal debating I was leaning toward Parrot but their out dated blue tooth capability was a deal breaker. Sennheiser ringing in at $500 was more than I though necessary. Beats were left standing, and needless to say I was apprehensive. After listening to them at a store I was very impressed by concerned that they were somehow amped in their enclosed display cabinet. And I was glad to learn that Monster was no longer associated with Beats. So, lets give this another try.When my new pair of Beats arrived I was happy but not as excited as I had been the first time around. I carefully unwrapped the impressive box and charged them. When I finally put them on and it play I had an instant eargasim.  They sounded exactly like I had hopped they would. Clear, crisp and and properly balanced. I could hear the little idiosyncrasies within songs and the bass was right on point and not disruptive. They are comfortable and sturdy and I'm beyond excited by the many hours I'll spend under the spell of my favorite artists.Hope you enjoy as well.

p621

VTo start off, my headphone credentials are not that of an "audiophile" but I listen to music almost every day on multiple sets of headphones. In the past I have owned the Beats studio HD (1st edition), Beats in-ear headphones, Skullcandy Skull Crushers, Beats Mixrs, Bose QC15, Powerbeats wireless, and the Beats Studio Wireless. Of that list of headphones, I was never satisfied with a pair of headphones until the Bose. Both pairs of Beats had just "eh" sound and terrible build quality. Both pairs were broken, replaced, and returned at least once until I bought the Bose close to 6 years ago. Unfortunately, the headphones finally showed they were made of earthly materials as the speakers began to crackle and fade. After a couple weeks of research, I finally decided to take a leap of faith and go with another pair of Beats. I recently purchased the Powerbeats wireless and they really made me re-evaluate my opinion of Beats. Whether it was the buyout by Apple or years of negative reviews, it seems as if the company finally decided to make a change. Now that I've had the Studios for a few days, I figured I'd share my first opinions:Build:Much better than the 1st edition of the headphones, as they feel much more solid and a lot less plastic feel. The outer layer feels like a metal substance while all clasps/enclosures feel like metal as well. The ear cushions are made of a comfortable and soft leather. The headband is a simple rubber band with a little air pocket/pad inside. This is the main area for concern for me as this was the big problem I had in Beats past, but only time will tell.Comfort:One of, if not the main reason I gave the product 4 stars. The materials used are solid as listed above, but the total weight of the product is definitely felt after a little while of usage. The headband is the biggest problem so far, as it feels like someone is pressing their thumb to the top of your skull while you wear them. I've found a few different areas on the top of my head that are a little more comfortable, but regardless I find myself adjusting them every 20 minutes or so. The ear cushions are a nicer feeling leather but aren't big or deep enough to completely encase your ears. It isn't noticeable until a half hour or so, but the combination of the small ear holes and how the speakers stick out to the point they touch your ears, leaves your ears hot and hurting. While this may not be as big as a problem for some people, I'm used to the extreme comfort of the Bose QC 15's which aren't noticeable after 6 hours of use.Sound:Like I said, I'm not the most qualified to give a review on sound, but I know enough and have heard enough headphones to understand the difference in sound and quality. This is where Beats truly surprised me. The first generation headphones were nothing more than mediocre which caused waves of negative reviews. In the second outing by Beats, they really stepped up their game and put out a pair of headphones that are well balanced through the lows, mids, and highs. With the Bose, I always felt like there was something missing with the lows, and Beats really did a good job bringing down the low levels and balancing them out. Overall they do sound a little heavy, but the mids and highs are still crisp and evident whether listening to classic music or watching movies.Wireless:The main reason I went with the Beats Wireless. The Powerbeats wireless made me realize how annoying wires can be especially moving around or doing something as simple as laying in bed. The bluetooth works well and smoothly with minimal problems so far. The headphones quickly recognize the last device you were using with them and transition to another device quickly. Definitely puts the product above the competition.Noise Canceling:Nothing special here. The noise canceling isn't very noticeable compared to the QC15's which are still the best noise canceling for the price out there. I really do wish there was an option to use the headphones without noise canceling to save battery but then the sound quality would probably go down as well. The noise canceling in these headphones is by no means something to brag about, but a nice feature as it most likely improves audio quality etc.Overall:I've had the headphones for only a few days, but I really enjoy them. The big thing to me is the price. I was able to score these for 225 new on a prime deal. For 380, I wouldn't buy them. I put them at the 300 price range like the Bose or non-wireless Studios, but for 225, it was definitely a steal. The sound of the headphone, to me, was and upgrade from the Bose, but the comfort and lack of noise canceling was definitely a let down for sure. I didn't expect the noise canceling to be anything near Bose (which make those the great headphones they are), but the comfort was a big turn off for the headphones. The overall build of the headphones was a nice surprise, but the big win in these headphones was the wireless feature. I loved my Bose and would buy another pair if the price were the same as these, but the lack of wireless really was annoying at times especially when I have a life proof case which means you have to use an adapter to even use the headphones. The wireless means no adapter and no wires. All in all, the headphones were an amazing buy for the price, and if you can buy them for anything near (I saw the blue pair was around 260) they're definitely worth it, but unfortunately I had to give them 4 stars solely for the discomfort I have when wearing them.

VWhen I set out to buy a pair of headphones I had two features I was looking for: over the ear and wireless. Our local store had a few wireless headphones for sale, but not all of them were over the ear. I decided to purchase the Beats brand because of the hype (sad, I know) and because they fit my two requirements.After 4 days of use I decided to return the headphones to the store. They were so tight on my head, and the weight of the ear muffs pulled the top even tighter on my scalp. I admittedly have a sensitive scalp, but I could not handle wearing these for longer than 10 minutes at a time without feeling like my blood supply was cut off in my scalp and getting a headache.My 2nd reason for returning these to the store was the battery life. Even when I wasn't using the headphones it seemed like the battery was draining. I would have to plug these in 2 or more a day, even if I wasn't listening, just so I could use them later in the evening.I returned the headphones to the store and bought the Bose Soundlink On-Ear Bluetooth headphones. They weren't off-ear like I wanted, but they were wireless. After one week of using the Bose, I like them 200 times better than the Beats.PROS:Comfortable ear muffsDurable caseNice soundConnected easily to my phoneA charger base, charger cord, phone cord and standard connection cord were includedCONS:PriceyUncomfortably tight on my head, it gave me headaches (ultimately why I returned the product)The battery life was very short, lasting 4-6 hours of listening tops.

VYes, when Beats by Dre headphones first came out, they were great and sounded better than most others until you got into the big studio-standard price ranges. They set a standard for "portable" headphones worn by the average person (willing to pay over the average price) for their looks and a pretty good sound. I was happy with my wireless pair for a long time.But two things have happened since they started you should consider before putting down around $350 for these wireless headphones: 1) Other competitors have caught up and surpassed the sound, folks like Voda and others, now simply sound better, especially to people who do NOT like the boosted base of Beats by Dre (always had to adjust the EQ on my iPhone when listening to "reduce bass"), which is still there even in the newer models. If you want pure fidelity and the honest sound, that includes classical, jazz and the older classic folk-rock and not just modern pop or hip-hop, they are not the best choice. 2) the Apple buyout of Dre has degraded warranty service: Dre was also known for GREAT service as an independent company, no questions asked with real audiophiles answering the phone (sounded like the Dre studio geeks, to be honest) , you just sent in your old pair and got a new pair in a couple of days. No need to go to a website, no need to "prove" how they were broken. Now you are in the world of trillion-dollar Apple Corp., who seem polite on the phone, but let you know it's totally up to them to decide if you might merit a warranty replacement or not. They track serial numbers and are very strict, just like they are for iPhones that have even a drop of water in them. The reason this matters is that Beats by Dre were NEVER the most durable headphones. If you wanted to wear them daily working out in the gym, there was a good chance you would drop them or bump into something or just take them off to abruptly, and the plastic would break. Forget high-sweat running or anything riskier than indoor gym. They do not have all-metal connectors like the Voda and some others.The bottom line is I liked Dre for a year or so, but would not purchase again, because of the lack of durability (I've broken two pair in three years, not working out, just wearing them to store and stuff, taking them on and off) degraded warranty service (it's still professional, just not liberal replacement as before), and the fact that a pair of hard-wired Voda's sound much better and last much longer. No matter what they tell you about "new HD bluetooth standards," it does not and probably cannot ever sound as good as hard wired, anymore than wi-fi can ever be as reliable as hard-wired gigabit ethernet. With some of the recent high-definition audio standards like 24-bit at 96-176khz sampling, this really makes a big difference in what you hear on the headphones, and even at the older standard of 16-bit at 44khz, I could always tell when I had my Dre's on wired or unwired mode (luckily, they gave you that choice).So if you MUST have wireless, these are still a viable choice, but beware the risk and note that just because you are paying $350, you are not going to get anymore durability and not as good a sound as you get for $200 elsewhere (e.g., Voda). If that's okay, to have them possibly break in 18 months or lose 1-2% fidelity, then go for it!

VI was in the local Best Buy store trying out the different headphones because I had some cash burning a hole in my pocket. I'm a huge Bose fan and think they are the best thing on the market. But.... I now think there are 2 headphone makers in the top spot. After much trying out I decided to bring these headphones home. I didn't realize how much I'd enjoy the wireless feature. I just left my iPod setting on the sofa and I strolled to the kitchen, then the bathroom and out to the garage. The clarity didn't change. Nothing changed in the sound as I moved around. These phones sound just as good to me as myBose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones, BlackandBose QuietComfort 20i Acoustic Noise Cancelling HeadphonesandBose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones(yes I like to spend money on expensive headphones). The bass thumps, I heard things in my music I've not heard before and they didn't hurt my ears. I love how they cover my whole ear and being able to walk around away from my iPod is just awesome. Housework will be much easier with these headphones because I don't have to find a place to put my iPod and then tuck away the cord so I don't rip them off my head. The carry case is superb. Nice and tough, very hard to smash, and looks great. For the price of the phones I was impressed with the case. My Bose phones didn't come with a case this strong, but then they didn't cost as much as these either. There are three cords you get; charging cord, phone control cord, audio cord (so you can switch from wireless to wired if you like). The power adapter is compact and snazzy looking. Doesn't take up the space like Apple's adapter.My only dislikes are the price and the packaging. These are the most expensive phones I've ever purchased. But for the money you are getting top notch headphones that won't disappoint. The packaging was a nightmare. After removing the shrink wrap I tried to pull the red boxes out of the slip cover. It wouldn't budge and after about 10 min of fighting it I just tore the slipcover off. If I had to return the headphones I would explain the packaging issue. The inside boxes provide very tough/heavy cardboard housing the phones. I've not opened such a secure and tough box like this in a long time. But... for the price I expect to have tough packaging.

I also have the newest Bose.These are not like older Beats, they sound great.  Great highs, mid where they are supposed to be and good bass.The bluetooth works great within the advertised range.  The sound is great without wires!The volume needs to be up a bit to really drive them, but they sound great on all my Apple devices.These are the coolest and best sounding bluetooth headphones on the market.

VPositives+ Snug Fit+ Good Frequency Range+ Compact storage with the ability to fold+ They look goodMiddle of the road+- Wireless, no cables but does require charging+- Noise cancellation, it reduces the outside noise, but hurts music quality by pumping out a frequency+- Rubber skin contact, most headphones use this but there are some with more comfortable cloth optionsNegatives- Sound quality, the bass was overbearing, muddy and sound clarity was horridAll of the convenience features were great, the headphones are easy to store, comfortable and there are no cables to get in your way while working.  But the good stops there, to me the most important aspect is sound quality, and the Beats Studio Wireless do not deliver.  I tested the headphones on all kinds of music; hip hop, EDM, rock, classical, good dynamic mixes, poor flat mixes.  I was appalled at how horrible these headphones sounded, especially for the price.  They do have a good frequency range, you may hear bass frequencies you've never heard before and be impressed.  But don't let the frequency range fool you, the problem is with clarity.  A few times I had to take the headphones off for making parts of songs unlistenable.If you want headphones that are convenient and don't care about sound quality, get these.If sound quality is important to you, look elsewhere.  I recommend the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs.  (they have the same amount of noise cancellation but don't transmit a frequency to your ear, therefore retaining sound clarity)

VI got these as a Christmas gift from my wife.  She knew I liked to listen to music via Bluetooth headphones so she got me these.I own quite a few BT headphones (Sony, Parrot Zik, Bose OE/AE, LG, etc.), and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how good these sounded!  After reading all the negative reviews from all those self-professed "Audiophiles", I now doubt their credibility and tastes in sound/music!I also did a 'blind' test with some of my friends and they were very shocked at the results.  They even admitted that, had I told them that they were actually Beats headphones from the beginning, they would have definitely been negatively biased and not would have judged them fairly.The ANC is good, not great.  But for what I use them for (work and home), they get the job done.The fit is comfortable, just make sure you find a good setting and remember what they are.  I find that when it's properly set to my head, I can wear them for hours.  BUT, if you don't, the top of the band can dig into your skull after a while. So finding the perfect fit is really important for these cans if you want to wear them for extended amounts of time.I recommend them if you are not a snobby, self-righteous, Mr. know-it-all, 'audiophile' snob.  If you're like me, and just want to hear your music with good quality sound and fit while still remaining wireless, than these cans are for you!Thanks all!

VPoor UI and mediocre noise cancellation
p682
sg5
V-- Overall --As a pair of wired headphones, it is pretty good. As wireless/bluetooth headphones, it is mostly unusable. The noise cancellation is mediocre.-- Sound Quality --Rich, full and immersive. It is exactly what I expected. It is good. Nothing much more to write.-- Wireless Functions --The Bluetooth UI is terrible. There is really no other way to put it. I have been using it with my Nexus 5X and am disappointed. All functions are on one invisible button over the left earpiece, and is rather unusable. The design (from what I feel is a misplaced sense of minimalism) reduces the functions to single, double and triple clicks of the same button for different things. As one can imagine, reducing simple functions like skipping over a song into a difficult-to-master special-move combo out of a martial arts video game can be rather distressing. The teeth. They gnash. To top it all it randomly drops the bluetooth connection. Your phone suddenly bursting into song, in public places can be embarrassing.-- Noise Cancellation --I am not impressed. I generally use the noise cancellation function at work. I have been using plantronics and sennheiser headphones and have been very pleased with them. In comparison this one is rather bad. Hardly manages to kill the hums and drones in the workplace.

VBest Headphones EVER!!!
p688
sg5
VI'll admit, I bought these from another retailer (Best Buy).  Still, I felt compelled to review these headphones and get the word out.  I bought them from Best buy because I knew that I wanted to try them on first before spending that kind of money; and I wanted them in a color that Amazon didn't have in Prime.  Once they met my ears, I was hooked!The beauty of these is in the noise cancelling.  They can get quite loud if you need them to, but often times, I find myself not needing to "crank" them due to the noise canceling.  Perhaps this is how they deliver such clean, crisp, accurate sound?The only slight drawback is that they are a little bit difficult to pair with a windows computer.  An "audio cable" is included for those kind of situations but, these are supposed to be wireless headphones.  Who wants to use a cord?A month later.....  I would still buy these headphones.Further note, I even use these in the car.  I have the Studio Wireless, my partner has the Solo Wireless, and we gave our old wired headphones to the kids.  The price of these new headphones and a couple creative mounts = individual audio / video in the car (using our i devices) that would take THOUSANDS to build into the car.  These are a must have for varying tastes and age ranges in shared spaces.

p693

VThe truth about Beats Studios Wireless Headphones. I\u2019ve been reading a lot of these reviews and there appears to be a severe lack of understanding about what these headphones truly offer. First off I personally own a pair of Audio Technica ath-m50x, V- moda m100's, Solo 2, Solo HD 2.0. All of these headphones serve a very specific purpose. I will say by far out of all these headphones that the beats are my favorite, why you may ask? Simply put for music that I primarily listen to such as rap/hip hop, R &B;, Rock, Electronic music etc .These headphones sound the best period.  The bass is tight in all ranges to include low/mids/high and the bass transitions are done fairly well. The Treble is just right in my opinion and not too harsh sounding but also not to rolled or muted due to heavy bass emphasis.  The headphones make the music come alive and add much depth and feel to the sound. Yes it\u2019s artificially created meaning not as originally intended but I don\u2019t care because it sounds  too DAMM GOOD.  There this notion that accurate sounds better, this is not always the case especially with certain types of music that have no complexity. For example, I love my Audio Technica ath-m50x but with the music I like to listen to, they sound shallow and lack depth. However if I were listening to music that supposed to sound this way like Jazz or classical or other music that was complex then these headphones would be much better suited. Overall like I said previously these are my favorite headphones out of all the ones I have. The wireless connectivity on my Note 4 works perfectly. The build quality is great but could be better in my opinion for this prince range for sure.  Comfort depends on the size of your ears and head. For me personally, some say I have a large head, these headphones are the most comfortable headphones out of all the ones I own.  I keep hearing people talk about this annoying hiss sound. I can report that I do NOT hear any hissing whatsoever when listening to music or with low volumes. I think this was more a problem with the wired studios. I will say that this product and the Solo 2 are the best sounding beats products available to this date. I would go on record and say to anyone that thinks these headphones sound like crap that your credibility as an audiophile, reviewer and or enthusiast is severely questionable. Yes beats are overpriced, Yes in the past the products were complete garbage. However, in terms of sound quality they nailed it right on the money.  Here is the breakdown!!ProsAmazing sound quality and probably the best sounding wireless headphones on the market.Excellent low/mid/highsGreat connectivityGreat designComfortableConsCould be built of better quality materialsBattery dies music diesCan\u2019t replace battery or ear cupsLongevity questionableIf you love music that\u2019s sounds alive and has lots of depth get these headphones. A good alternative would be the v-moda m100. The produce the same depth and have a slightly better sound stage but just do it in a slightly diff manner.

VThis is my first pair of beats I've owned and very happy with what I received. The sound quality is great a lot more crisp and clear then the previous version, also the bass doesn't overwhelm the headphones like the other early gen beats. The Bluetooth works fast and is easy to pair with great range around 30ft like advertised. Battery life is good and last quite awhile with a easy quick display to show battery life and also no more batteries which I find as a great plus. The frame of the headphones are much better quality and don't creek when wearing and moving around in them. The only downside might be that the hiss of the noise cancel might be a little annoying at times but once it's playing music you can't hear it.

VBeats vs Bose
p703
sg5
VThey're fine. Seems the wireless headphones are all in the same price range and these serve their purpose for me. I tested both the Bose Soundlink Wireless and these and here's what I found:BEATS work better with an iPhone than a Macbook. DOES NOT CONNECT WELL TO A MACBOOK!!! Not that they won't work with a Mac but they tend to prefer to connect automatically to an iPhone OVER a Mac over bluetooth and it's kind of a pain to have them connect to my MacBook Pro. Not a huge issue, just pretty annoying.BOSE I found connected better to my Macbook. Or iPhone. Was strong with both and connecting was easy breezy. I also think BOSE had a longer range, but I didn't test it to be sure, but it does seem that BEATS drops the connection pretty fast.BEATS is a bit better for bass sounds, and Bose has more depth / range of sounds.My tip? If you're willing, go to an Apple Store and buy both and test both out, playing the identical songs on two different devices and see which sounds better to you. Personally I stuck with Beats mainly because I use these for electronic music and the BEATS had the EDM range I was looking for. But BOSE had a different range. Plus I just liked the look of the BEATS more. But honestly, each are fine. I just stuck with this one because I liked the colors.

p709
sg5
VI was skeptical about this purchase in from the jump. The price was almost $130 less than what apple and other retailers charge for these headphones. The reason, I believe, is that these are older stock. My reasoning is simple. When the headphones arrived, I had Bluetooth connectivity problems. The headphones wouldn't stay synced.I was completely oblivious to the fact that headphones could have their software updated. I downloaded the beats updater app from their website, and completed the software update to the headphones. It was surprisingly painless, and felt very apple like, and appropriately so.Now the reason I believe these are simply old stock/overstock... the updated software contained verbiage related all the way back to early versions of iOS 8. At the time of this review and purchase, the current iOS version was iOS 9.2. Clearly the reason for the connectivity issues was the needed update. It worked, and I am very pleased with these headphones.As far as sound quality, that's subjective. I do prefer these over the older beats models, as the sound is much more flat and not quite as bass heavy. Build quality seems to be good, and they have a metal band instead of the previous models plastic headband.

p715
sg5
VYes they look slick, O.K noise cancellation, great battery life, comfortable and I love that they're wireless.  They also have pretty decent bass provided you listen to a lot of bass heavy music but overall the sound quality isn't few hundred dollars worth.  The deal breaker is the fragile headband on this thing. It cracks so easily its infuriating.Got a pair a little after Christmas 2014, at the time they were almost four hundred dollars and by around June 2015 the plastic around the hinge started cracking and splintered away, leaving the earpiece hanging loose. This happening after light in home use and being babied was appalling.  The Apple store switched it out for a new set. A little over a month later as I was taking them off I heard a crack.  Surprise surprise, same area around the hinge between the headband and ear piece.  I was told that my first replacement was a special case and was given an explanation of a sketchy warranty that didn't hold up to logic so they sent me another (that I will not be keeping).  Not even a year's use out of these headphones and as it turns out, the brittle headband is a known issue.  Overpriced, pretty garbage and I'm so done.

Vif you want AWESOME noise canceling headphones
p720
sg5
VFirst off I will say, if you want AWESOME noise canceling headphones... You will have to go with a  WIRED headset. These Beats do a great job but you really can't compare their noise canceling to the Bose Quiet Comfort.Now as far as Wireless headphones with noise cancellation....I really think these are great. I have been reading a lot of reviews on here that are really hating on these and comparing them to Wires sets which is obsurd. No Wireless headphones will EVER compare to a wired headphone. Wired will Always produce a better sound.So now that we have that settled, let's talk about these wireless headphones. For a wireless headphone I really think the sound is great. They aren't as bass heavy as before and it appears they have really improved the balance between the mids/highs to the bass. Quality seems awesome as well. These really feel like good quality....they feel "expensive" if you know what I mean. I think these are some the best wireless headphones (for non-Audiophiles) out there. Of course you will always have those "professional" audio gurus that say these suck but at the end, it's really about how you feel about them!!!

p743
sg5
VBought both the Sony MDRXB950BT and the Samsung Level Over with this guy, I was in the quest for the best "wireless" headphones and ended up keeping the Beats Studio Wireless as the sound is much louder than the other two plus if you want more bass, this is better.I've also found a tweak to bring out super bass by turning up bass and turning down treble all the way using my phone's equalizer, then turn on the volume to the max and you get this awesome, club-like super bass.  This would not be possible if the volume on these headphones didn't get loud as it is.Sound quality is actually pretty good so long as you are listening to high quality MP3 files, Pandora on high quality setting is also okay.Just make sure to tweak your sound using equalizer on your phone.  If you have rooted Android, you can use Viper4Android.  Once you tweak the sound, you can really turn these into super bass headphones.Just awesome product, the loudest wireless headphones out of all the ones I've tried plus the most bass.  If you are a bass head like myself, this is the best.

VI'll say it off the bat.  This may not be the most awesome sounding cans that I own.  But if you're not an audiophile or prefer lots of bass heavy music, you will like these headphones.A couple of things really stood out for me:1.  The price was good and better than what you get at the Apple Store (no surprise there)2.  These headphones are pretty plush and comfortable.  I can wear these for quite a long time and have no issues.  Wearing it with glasses on is also no problem. B3.  The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless.  It's simple to link to your phone and turning the headphones on and off without any issues is nice (unlike my wireless jaybird earbuds which seem to disconnect constantly - which is beyond annoying)4.  The sound may not be upper echelon, but when it comes to listening to dance and rock music, I like how those genres really sound good when I use these cans.5.  The gold color looks seriously awesome.If you're looking for a versatile set of wireless headphones that look great and have decent sound, you totally can't go wrong here.

VBest Headphones, Period!!
p755
sg5
VThe best headphones on the market, period. Battery lasts a very long time between charges and it's very fast to charge. You actually feel the music and cancels most, if not all noise around you. Plus it was an added bonus that it could be used as a wireless Bluetooth device to talk on the phone. I didn't even know that it had a microphone when I bought it. But obviously it's best feature is playing music. There is a big difference between these headphones and others. You actually hear and feel the music like no other. It's also great for watching movies on tablets, phones or any other Bluetooth enabled device. I even use them while working out in the gym because it cancels all noise around you so you don't have to hear other people's workouts or machines going. Also they are very comfortable and just fit perfectly since it's adaptable to all head sizes. Another bonus is the controls on the side since you can raise or lower the volume or pause something etc.. There isn't enough great things I can say about these headphones. You pay for what you get, plain and simple.

VNoise cancelling?
p761
sg5
VI bought these headphones because I thought that was "Noise cancelling". I guess it's my fault, but I write this in case anyone has the same thought:This Beats Headphones are NOT completely noise cancelling, when you are listening to music you get a really good sense and supresses about the 60 % of the enviroment sound. When you have the headphones on and turned on you listen a little buzz because according to Beats "the ANC-only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancellation to create a quieter world", but it is annoying.I don't know if it is just me but the headphones press too much and that provokes me a pain in the ears.The price is a really high. You can find similar headphones $100 less. And others good and really cheap for less than $100. Just search a little.By the other side the design is probably the best, with great materials and looks great when you are using them. The connexion with Apple devices it's impeccable. The battery lasts 12 hours (really nice). It's really simple to use and you need just three buttons to reproduce, pause, advance or go back.But returning them...

VOk this is my first review on Amazon and I wouldn't have bothered writing a review if I wouldn't have been so terribly disappointed by Beats Studio Wireless headphones.(I bought it for $264 around a week back from Amazon which I feel is the amount you pay for just having that b logo on your headphones). Firstly, I would say that the bass is good in these headphones(unfortunately only the right earphone provides the right impact.. I don't know if the piece that I received was defective) and that is about it. Highs are muffled and even the wireless performance is nothing to boast about. My cheap Made in China Bluetooth headphones have a better range compared to these headphones. Headphones look good but it wouldn't hurt Beats to provide better quality headphones(such is their profit margin). Some people might like it but then you did be blown away by ATH M50s with FiiO amplifier combo which you can get for like $200 combined. I also have an older version of Sennheiser momentum and even I felt that they were a bit overpriced for what you get from ATH M50s.

VThese are what everyone buys for a reason- They look great on and sound awesome and they are LOUD! Bose headphones are not loud enough at full volume where these I never turn all the way up. These seem to have toned down the bass from earlier versions I've had. I think they are just about perfect. They are also the only ones that work (other than the Studio wired version) where the noise cancelling and over the ear style eliminates wind noise while biking or doing anything where the wind is whipping past your ears and also goes loud enough to compensate for very loud environments. This new subdued matte black color is a much needed improvement. I took off a star for comfort- I cannot wear these as long as I can most of my other headphones. These squeeze your head and are not expandable with force as the padding will pop off and you'll likely damage the hinges. Also the ear cups are not deep enough and will put pressure on your ears. ...but for my intended purposes (windy sports and loud environments) they work amazing.

VI think Beats started to cheap on their construction and quality. Makes sense with the price drop. I used some Beats studio wireless over a year ago and was impressed with the sound clarity and performance. I turned the music to the max and the headphones handled it with ease. These same headphones I just got are no where near what I experienced in the past. They started to crackle and rattle at about 75% volume. I thought maybe it was the connection so I tried plugging it in. Same results. I thought maybe it was the source so I tried different devices and different songs. Same result. I thought it must be a faulty pair of headphones so I exchanged them (which was a breeze, kudos to amazon I received new headphones in 1 day and it was Sunday) I was excited to get a new pair so quickly, not so fast... Same results. I am returning both pairs and will likely look into a pair of wireless Bose headphones as I know Bose has a great reputation for sound quality. After all isn't that important?

VVery nice headphones. Built very sturdy of good quality materials. Overall sound is good (not $380 good though). The wireless function is great. The headphones fit pretty comfortable, battery has good life, and the headphones look really nice. The carrying case is a hardshell that is good if you are like me and carry your headphones in your backpack when not using them. For some reason though, the earpads on the headphones I bought were alot softer than the wired version I saw at Bestbuy. Not a bad thing, just something I noticed. One small gripe i have is that the headphone buttons on the left ear feel alittle cheaply made or like they cut corners when installing them.Pros:+Wireless works very well (~25 ft distance)+Sturdy construction out of good materials+very nice look, not as flashy as the old beats looked which can be good/bad depending on how you look at itCons:-Too Expensive-headphones buttons leave alittle to be desired-easy to steal off your head-sounds is good but not great

p808
sg5
VI didn't buy mine from Amazon, I got them from a pawn shop for dirt cheap. To my surprise they were brand new and never opened so I got the full buyers experience. These headphones are a great quality especially if you like heavy, tight fitted ones. I've had them for 2 months now and the sound is crisp and clear, nothing is wrong with them but the second "Call Wire". You get three wires with these, a charging wire , a music wire that's just an aux cable, and the call wire that has the microphone. The back plastic part popped off a few days ago which is no big deal because when you don't use it for calls but it's still a nuisance. I've learned this is pretty common in the wires but can be fixed with some glue ( just be careful not to get the buttons). But other than that great sound, very sturdy, overall great product just be prepared to order new wires.

VBest Looking Headphones currently, IMHO. It's worth the money if you can use any gift cards you have and at the right timing when Amazon reduces their price. I got these for about $250 when the price dropped. It's a premium but the marketing is the appeal here. I'm not an audiophile but I needed a replacement to my Bose OE headphones, which were 8 years old and the leather earcups were degrading. The SELLING POINT on these was WIRELESS & SIMPLE STYLE.  Great sturdy case it comes with and the looks will come as well as to what you are wearing on your head. The delay in video is noticeable at times but I listen to music more on this.  It may not be the top notch headphones technically nor have a world title but it makes me feel good owning & using them and I'm satisfied. That's what counts to a consumer. Great marketing by Beats & Apple!

VCan we please stop acting like these headphones are aimed at audiophiles. The philosophy behind them is pretty simple to understand. Great design and excellent sound quality TO THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. Someone listening to there favorite artist on the bus will never realize the subtle inaccuracies like the absurd Beats haters. They look good, are very comfortable and sound pretty amazing to the average consumer. That being said I thoroughly enjoy these headphones. They are extraordinarily comfortable and have really good sound quality. My only gripe is that even when plugged in, once the battery is dead the music dies. From what I understand it is due to the ANC feature. That being said, they need to come up with a solution that maybe will just deactivate the ANC if the battery dies? Surely a solution can't be far behind.

VAfter a long debating and has tried many difference BT headphones i gave a Beats another try on their new Studio Wireless Model.The sound quality is really bad and not accurate, the sound is more like a humble heavy bass but very lack of balance mid and high tone.Compare with my Sony MDR-ZX770BN, the Sony sounds way better and true balance on every aspects and features for half of the Beats price.After 2 days testing, the sound quality really bother your ears and become headache.The bluetooth connection is drop sync with my Iphone 6.The headphone will return and totally not worth the money. It is more for fashion type headphone but very poor quality sound.Quake up Beats. This headphone are way too over-rated. You pay for $300+ for the heaphones equal the value of $100 tag.

VOn my head, the rubber head band and relatively shallow ear cups prove uncomfortable after 30 to 40 minutes of use.Significant audio delay with iOS devices (much greater than the Parrot Ziks or Sony MDR10RBT) -- may be a defective unit.Aside from those issues, sound quality is quite good for general listening, and the ANC, while not up to Bose levels, does a great job of nixing commute noise (though has issues with higher frequency noises).The cans look great, fold down into a relatively compact space, and come with a hard carrying case.If not for the significant audio delay (and assuming they fit comfortably for you) the Beats would make for an excellent wireless commuting device (and if you only listen to music, come recommended).

VAwesome headphones. ANC so you don't get a disturbance from your environment. The gold and white color or champagne and white is awesome looking, and looks great with my beats 27 inch touch screen computer. They sit on the hanger next to the monitor that comes built into the monitor. But in all honesty I know there are better headphones out there on the market for cheaper that would weigh out to Dr Dre Beats. But I mostly bought them so they would match with my computer. Now I have the set. Beautiful look seems to be made of good quality products. As long as you're careful with them and take care of them like a two hundred and $99 set of headphones should be, then they will be just fine I assume. Will be doing a product review in a year to tell how they wear over time.

p860

VGreat headphones while they work...but really horrible customer service if / when you have an issue.  Mine stopped charging after 8 months and now I am left with an expensive pair of earmuffs.  Customer service was less than helpful...the only replacement color available at the current time is red, so I was instructed to call back weekly to check when another color MAY be available (if I even qualify for a refurbished replacement).  In the meantime, Beats would not even let me send in my faulty pair of headphones to get the process moving forward, which is frustrating.  Don't see many other mentions of charging issues, so perhaps my problem is unique.  That said, would have expected far better customer service given the price point and nature of my issue.

VI don't know why everyone is knocking the sound quality.  These headphones sound awesome!  Rich bass, clear highs, just an overall great listening experience.  Bluetooth works great.  Noise cancelling isn't the best but it doesn't advertise as being the best.  I have some Bose QC-15's and nothing has ever come close to these in the noise cancelling department.  The Bose are good, but the Beats Studio Wireless sound waaayyyy better in my opinion.  Plus, the QC-15 aren't wireless.These are a little expensive, but I think the sound quality, comfort, Bluetooth capability, and noise cancelling properties makes up for the higher price.Overall very happy with my purchase!

I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.Prosa) I like the build quality.b) Very stylish indeed.c) Very comfortable on earsd) produces very high volumee) integrates really well with my iPhone and iPad.Consa) One thing to keep in mind, Don't expect to be blown away by the audio it produces. Don't get me wrong, it's good. but not good enough for a $379.00 headset. I'd give it 7.5/10 for sound quality.b) Battery could be better.. The battery doesn't last anywhere close to 20 hours.c) Doesn't work without charge, even when wired (bummer).

VI bought these over a year and a half ago at a military base in the deserts of California. They have survived that and the bipolar weather of Northern California. If you take care of these the right way like anything els they will last. Sweat dose get in them(causes the speaker to stick to the plastic frame, just blow into the speaker a few times) and the pads will eventually start peeling apart but super glue will help and it doesn't damage the the fake leather. Mistreatment doesn't mean they suck. I am looking to replacing them because i can't stand having my things look beat up, but definitely getting the same kind. Worth the price.

VThe Beats Studio are really good casual headphones. They can be a bit cruel to music that is maybe not that well mastered and comes as MP3 off the iPhone. As with other headphones they sound best with Quality recordings, and they are best with contemporary as you would expect from beats. Bluetooth works fine. Noise cancellation is ok, does the trick. Design is sleek. Comfort is good, wireless phones have to be a bit heavier, the batteries simply have a certain weight. Really like the carrying case and the attention to detail.What are the disadvantages ? Not so great in very quiet surroundings as the noise cancellation creates a little background white noise. Not so great for classical music.But overall clearly a recommendation.

VSound great. Simple to use once paired to device. Can be cumbersome when switching to another device. I'm always having to go through the re-pairing process or fiddling with an awkward sequence of turning devices and (and the headphones) on/off to get them to pair. For example, when switching from my iPad to my iPhone is always a pain and never smooth. That's my main gripe. My second issue is that they can get uncomfortable after long use. They are snug, but my ears start to hurt after an hour or so.The positives...best sounding Beats headphones I've had, and I've used previous versions of the Studio and Solo headphones in the past and didn't like those at all (sound and build quality was garbage).

VAfter my Bose QC2's finally gave up the goose, I decided to look for some modern cans. These Beats fit the bill in terms of style and sound, but the comfort was lacking.  I could only where them for 10 minutes before I got a headache. I would say that my head is probably above average in size but these phones were pretty uncomfortable after little time. Also, the white noise from the noise canceling feature is a little distracting and quite noticeable between tracks.This was my first Amazon return and it was simply amazing!  Super easy electronic process and no issues with returned funds.

Ear cups aren't deep enough, so your ears touch the hard plastic under all the pads; sometimes really uncomfortable.  2. Blue tooth occasionally disconnects from my mac book pro; I don't know which side is causing the problem, but they're both expensive as hell, so this shouldn't be happening lol.Good sound quality.

VBought after reading multiple reviews. I expected base centric sound, I did not expect the discomfort of smallish round ear cups that either need to sit on the outside of my ear, where they hurt but don't push in on the ear canal opening, or over the back of the ear where they do push in, affecting the sound quality reaching my eardrum. Additionally, the range of the Bluetooth is more limited than other brands - it starts cutting out at 25 feet of unobstructed distance from the source, be it an iPhone, smart TV or receiver. Back to AKG or Bose for wireless.

They are noise canceling, which means you can't hear anything else, and no one else can hear your music. The quality of the music is also unrivaled compared to anything else I've ever put on. The wireless is absolutely fantastic. They connect to blutooth in about 20 seconds and then you're ready to go. Once charged, my headphones last at least a week without having to recharge. Highly recommend these to anyone and everyone!!!

More importantly, these headphones are wireless (if you want them to be), and they are rechargeable, while the Bose went through AAA batteries like fiends. I highly recommend these!

VI was curious whether Beats could pull it off again with great headphones in a wireless design. Having multiple Bluetooth headphones for different occasions (incl. Bose), I was not sure whether they could compete with my wired Beats headphones. Ultimately, I have to admit, they are kick-ass and better than I dreamed wireless headphones could be.An absolute must buy for music lovers looking to go wireless.

VStay away from these headphones. They are way overpriced and the outer shell is made from a cheap, brittle plastic. After 3 months of minimal usage, the plastic above the ear cup started to crack on both sides. I contacted Apple Support and was told the only option I had was to pay $200 to have them replaced. These headphones are a piece of junk and Apple knows this. They will not stand behind their product.

VThe only reason I still own these is because I was too lazy to return them. As wired headphones, they are passable as $100 headphones; in other words, they are completely over-rated. As wireless, they are total crap. They constantly drop the bluetooth, especially if you accidentally touch the forward or reverse function. Another example of a product hyped by a celebrity, that is all hype, no performance.

VI've been waiting for a good pair of headphones available to consumers that are wireless. Personally, I am extremely picky when it comes to the quality of sound, especially in a pair of headphones.  I'll admit that they are expensive, but for the price you pay you get a fantastic pair of durable, great sounding quality, wireless headphones.  I use them when I go jogging, and they do not fall off my head, which is exactly what I bought them for.If you're on the fence between purchasing these and the other wired studios, I recommend spending the extra money and get these ones.  Wireless/Bluetooth technology is amazing!Also, the matte black version of these is super sleek!! I love matte, and if you do too, then you'll love the matte black.

They're comfortable, the battery life is exceptional, and the sound is excellent. As far as overall sound, I honestly have heard better from Bose, but with the noise-cancelling function, I can't hear two people on either side of my having a conversation on a noisy bus ride to class while I'm listening to music. 5/5 would buy again.

VFirst time reviewer here. Only doing this because i read EVERY single review i could find about these before dropping a weeks wages on them!First of all, you can see where your moneys going, PACKAGING. And lots of it.Very well presented. Boxes inside of boxes makes you feel like a kid at christmas.Secondly, the design. Very fresh, very nice to look at. Definitely the leader of its class in terms of style.Ive read a few reviews with some people saying buttons weren't there or whatever. The button in the centre with the Beats logo is for pausing and playing (one push), skipping tracks forward (two pushes) and skipping back a track (three pushes).Its not always the most convenient but it works.There are hidden buttons above and below the Beats logo, for raising and lowering volume.Next, connection. Bluetooth to both my iPhone 5s and my Macbook Pro Retina has been great.No dropouts. I use these at the gym so i keep my phone in my pocket.Ive had a good signal at 40ft but that was pretty much line of sight. I have no problems keeping my phone in my pocket though.Haven't used these with the 3.5mm cable yet, have had no need to. Nor have i tried to make a call with them.The noise cancelling in my opinion isn't worth writing about, i could hear most things reasonably well with it enabled. The only time i could NOT hear my surroundings was when my music was pumping.The sound is good. I say good and not great as i compare these to my Monster iSport in ear headphones which sounded clearer with tighter bass.Thats not to say these don't sound great because they do. Turn up a bass laden track and you can feel your ears vibrate with pleasure. One thing i have noticed is to me they sound rather flat until you turn on an equaliser, whether through your laptop or iPhone.Very comfortable too, haven't had any issue with discomfort yet. They stay on my head while I'm at the gym also.I also have a rather large head and these fit with room to go bigger! So very pleased with that.I hope this little blurb helps you in your decision on whether or not to purchase the headphones.All in all i would say, buy these if you are after (1) Bluetooth headphones, (2) Comfortable headphones and of course (3) you have money to spare. (I also recommend the Monster iSport for a great in-ear experience)Good luck!

p1081
sg5
VI like these headphones.  They're comfortable, light, and sound great!  I really appreciate them being wireless as I can move away from the source, or keep my phone in my pocket or bag, and not worry about cords.  A real plus!However, there are two issues with these headphones:1.  There is a noticeable "hiss" emanating from the headphones when they are on and nothing is playing through them.  Most of the time this won't bother you since it's not there when you're listening to music or watching a video.  However, during those moments when you're looking for another track or video to play it is pretty loud and bothersome.2.  The headphones work great for listening to music.  However, when using bluetooth to watch video the audio and video are noticeably out of sync.  The workaround is to use the provided cord to connect the headphones to the source.  Doing this keeps the audio and video in sync.  The tradeoff is you lose the wireless functionality which is one of the selling points of these headphones.  If you're purchasing these to primarily watch video I would probably look elsewhere or buy the wired version since you'll find yourself using these with a cord anyway.

VThese headphones are amazing. I have always hated on Beats because of their attention to fashion vs sound and their high price. Everyone knows this changed, the sound aspect, with the redesigned studios. They sound much more balanced. These headphones are no exception. I am amazed everytime I power these on how I can start listening to music without plugging anything in or even touching my phone. The noise cancelling is nowhere near as good as the Bose QC-15 but when you are walking around campus, this can be a good thing as you can hear if you are being called or need to move out of the way. These are pretty comfortable but not the most comfortable headphones. The bluetooth is awesome but when watching movies, There is a noticeable delay between the video and audio over bluetooth. Overall the bluetooth capabilities makes up for its shortcomings and these headphones would be incredible. Only reason I did not give them a 5 star is because I think they are overpriced. They should be around $300 maximum

VFirst off forget everything that the previous beats did. These are a complete 180 from the previous version. I purchased these with some apprehension because i had the previous ones and didn't like them at all, but after trying the Sennheiser Momentums (not wireless) and the Phiaton Chord 530 M's (wireless) and was supremely disappointed with the later. I got these for primarily connecting to my laptop for Netflix and the occasional music listening. The bluetooth quality is superb and the sound quality is what you would expect from Dre, not as bass heavy as the previous beats but rap, rock and even metal sounds incredible on these headphones. As for noise canceling capabilties, as a general rule for those who do not know about noise canceling it doesn't mean its going to block out everything around you without music going. With music yes everything will be blocked out. But without music playing you will be able to hear someone talking next to you, but thats even the same case with the bose (which i have as well.) They are pretty good when it comes to noise canceling. Overall I would say give these a try. If you look at the price tag and say no way, remember you get what you pay for.

VBest Bluetooth headphones on the market
p1127
sg5
VPrior to this, I was using the original Beats Wireless headphones. Those were OK, but they were flimsy, on-ear, had no noise cancellation, and wireless sound volume was noticeably weaker than when wired.I was waiting for the Bluetooth Bose AE2w headphones, but these were incredibly disappointing. They have no noise cancellation, mediocre battery life, a huge ugly Bluetooth module sticking out the side, and wireless sound volume is also inferior to wired.So finally, I've settled with the Beats Studio Wireless and I'm very happy with my decision. Here are some pros and cons I've noticed after having these for almost three weeks now:+ The design is so sleek! Much better looking and more streamlined than the old Studios. I also love the matte black color, as it's much more subdued and is less prone to fingerprints.+ Build quality is excellent. Again, MUCH better than the old Studios and original Wireless.+ I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but the sound quality seems very good, and more balanced than previous models. The bass still kicks a bit at higher volumes, but it's not distracting anymore. Also, sound quality and volume is not diminished when using Bluetooth - this was my primary reason for upgrading.+ Firmware can be upgraded via USB. This future-proofs your investment a bit.+ I haven't actually timed the battery life, but it's excellent. There is now a battery status indicator, which was somehow absent in the original Wireless.+ The volume is finally in sync with my iPhone's media volume. The original Wireless had separate volume controls and this was a PITA.- Holy crap are these things expensive.- Noise cancelling is nice to have, but it's pretty mediocre. Don't expect anything like the Bose QuietComfort series. But again, the Bose Bluetooth headphones don't even have noise cancelling, so it's better than nothing.- I miss the prev and next track controls from the original Wireless. While the buttons are definitely more solid and give a more satisfying click than before, there is just a volume up/down and a center button for play/pause. You need to click the center button twice for the next track and three times to go to the previous track (four times if you're already in the middle of the current track!). I've gotten used to it, but I'd rather have dedicated buttons for this.- They're not especially heavy, but I'd still like them to be a little lighter. Like a lot of headphones this size, they can become a tad uncomfortable after 2-3 hours of listening. My ears do stick out a bit, so your mileage may vary.- Not Bluetooth 4.0, so you're limited to about 30 feet before it starts cutting out. This isn't a big deal to me, but it's worth mentioning.In summary, if you can afford these and you're in the market for Bluetooth headphones, it doesn't get any better than the Studio Wireless. If you are considering the bluetooth Bose AE2w or original Beats Wireless, do yourself a favor and spend the extra $100-$150 and get these...it's worth it. If you really don't need the Bluetooth, I'd recommend the Bose QuietComfort 15 over the wired Studios.

VExchanged a set of Sennheiser MM 500 Xs for these (originally got the Sennheiser set b/c of no adaptive noise cancelling).Have only a few bad things to say about the MMs: Really, really ugly, and awkard fitting - shoot out a couple inches from your head if you have a thin head.  Sound was good, passive noise cancelling was fine, but they didn't get very loud.On to the Beats:ANC turned out to be not a big deal; the only time you notice it is when you aren't listening to something, and I didn't buy a set of headphones to not listen to music.  I find the sound to be great, just as good as MMs if not better, except they get much louder, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Paired fine, haven't dropped off at all, controls are easy.  Have only been wearing them for about an hour so I can't speak to comfort yet, but early indications are very positive.All in all, well worth the price of admission.

VSound was OK. Noise canceling is not anything to write home about and the fit was too tight for my husband. The worst part: it completely died (won't charge anymore) in 4 months. It wasn't even used that much, mostly during travel. For such expensive headphones, you would expect more reliability.

VLove these headphones for the gym!
p1247
sg5
VI bought these to use at my gym, 24 Hour Fitness, where, to my dismay, the company has recently initiated a highly-irritating, advertising campaign on their TV monitors that includes playing insipid pop songs at high volume. These headphones do the trick. They completely eliminate the gym "music" and my music sounds great through them. They fit very snugly -- I wear them not only on the gym floor but also while racewalking & running on the gym track and they never budge.At first, I was a little bemused by the control system, fumbling around getting them up and running on bluetooth with my iPod Nano. Finally, I realized that when you turn them on, it takes a second for that to happen and the tone to tell you that it has. I had been double-tapping the button, erroneously turning them on but then back off. Now I'm fine with that. Initial bluetooth connection is easy and the headphones automatically connect with the last bluetooth device you used them with, so now I just turn on the Nano, then the headphones, and music is playing. Controlling pause / play / fast-forward via the headphones works fine, as long as I remember how many quick pushes on the button does what. Not really intuitive, but maybe that's just me.Can't speak to durability as I have only had them a few weeks but at this point I highly recommend them, at least for gym and home use. I don't think they would be appropriate for outdoor running any distance, where you really build up a sweat, as they fit tight all around your ears, thereby encouraging sweating and then would become a reservoir for it. So, if you are a heavy sweat person, maybe look for something else for workouts. I get mine only a tiny bit sweaty working out in the gym and I just wipe them with a slightly damp paper towel.Seems to me at this point that my iPod, on bluetooth, uses battery much faster than the headphones. Last time I recharged the Nano, the headphones were only about a quarter way down, according to the indicator lights.

p1253
sg5
VFirst Impression:I have an original Beatbox by Dre that I absolutely love and expected the performance of the Beatbox to translate over to the Beats Studio 2.0, especially since the Studio is a much newer product. Boy was I wrong. My first impression when I put these headphones on and turned them on was, these must be defective. The best way to explain the noise produced by the "active noise cancellation," (keep in mind I was in a silent room using the headphones) is to imagine a scene from an old western movie where the wind is blowing really hard and making a whistling noise. It's not just a faint noise, but an awful whistling noise that made me want to take the headphones off immediately before I developed a headache.Sound Quality:You know the plastic headphones with the circular foam on them they try to sell on the airplane? Those blow the Beats Studio 2.0 out of the water! The whistling and white noise from the "active noise cancellation" distorts the music even more than it already is. The noise cancellation slightly dampens the surrounding noise. As I type this I have the headphones on and turned to about medium volume. I can still here some guys lead pencil he is writing with and can here him turn the page of his book. I am sitting about 20 feet away from this guy. I tried to give these headphones the benefit of the doubt, but when I played some Dr. Dre through them I almost fell out of my chair in disbelief. The bass sounds as if there is a piece of notebook paper between the ear and the headphone that is being slapped every time a low note is hit. I had my friend try them on without telling him any details so I could obtain an unbiased opinion. I put on a heavy bass track and handed him the headphones and said listen. He listened for about 3 seconds, looked up and almost started crying from laughter. He couldn't believe how crappy they sounded and said, "cheap wal-mart headphones sound better than this."All in all:In all honesty I got a great kick out of these headphones. They really lightened the mood around the house. Everyone was able to get a laugh in. Needless to say I will be sending back these "headphones" (I don't think they should even be called headphones they're so bad) and purchase a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 25.

VI like these headphones, but there are some caveats.First, they're great looking. If you like the over the ear aesthetic, I think Beats does it best, especially the black-on-black slickness of the version I picked up. They're stylish without being obtrusive. I'm not the type to want to wear this sort of headphone in public, but this version of Beats is so cool and slickly made, I don't think they draw the wrong kind of attention whatsoever.Next, they're comfortable to wear. While some of these products can irritate the ear, or make them downright sore after a while, I haven't had that issue at all with these. The ear cups are a soft, plus leather, and the fit is spot on.I only get about 15-20 feet worth of range out of these wireless headphones before sound begins to drop out and get choppy. At most, the signal feeds through one wall. I'm not dinging them for that, because it could be a bluetooth transponder issue, or maybe just a problem with that technology to begin with. Either way, the signal is clear when I go from my living room to the kitchen and back, and that's all I'm looking for.Sound quality is fine. Other reviewers go into this area at great length and it's just as, if not more, subjective than style can be, so I'll leave that up to the individual buyer to investigate at length. In my experience, as an average consumer of media, these headphones sound just fine and I've got zero complaints in that department. They're as loud as I need them to be, and as clear as I could hope for.Battery life ain't so great. I don't know the actual span, but if I'm sitting at the computer watching a movie and playing some games, it FEELS like I get maybe 5, 6 hours tops out of them before they need a recharge. However, if I'm sitting at my desk any longer, not only would I go a little stir crazy first, but I could easily solve the problem by plugging them in and charging while listening wired. Not a big negative, but be aware that battery life isn't out of this world great, it's just adequate. It's fine.Last, and here is where it's a mixed bag, comes the construction. I have only ever worn these headphones around the house, and they go on a dedicated metal stand when not in use, so wear and tear is minimal, but I had an issue with durability within a month of buying them around August of 2015. The sound suddenly cut out one day, and for weeks afterward sounded muted and distant. Additionally, one ear was markedly worse than the other, though each clearly had a problem. For headphones at this price point, I wasn't exactly thrilled. HOWEVER, I live near an Apple store and, as always, their customer service was wonderful. They took the headphones, mailed them into their service center, and within three days I got a call saying the problem was found and couldn't be fixed, but that they'd be sending me a brand new pair, free of charge. Two days later, my new Beats came in, and in the 3+ months since, they've run beautifully. Tech gadgets fail, I'm used to it, so I judge manufacturers more on their response than on dinging them for putting out a bad egg or two from time to time. As long as I have no bad experiences with this new pair, I'll be very happy with my purchase. I'll come back to edit this if something changes

VI did some research on wireless headphones and CNET rates these as number one so I was definitely leaning towards these headphones. I went to Best Buy to try them out and saw these new JBL Everest Elite 700 wireless headphones for $299 that are exclusive to Best Buy and the JBL website. I decided to go with those because they have a ton of cool features including an app to adjust the amount of ambient noise the headphones allow in. They were built well and JBL is known for having top of the line products. I was hesitant because they didn't fit has well as the studio wireless and the look of the studios is better in my opinion. The frame of the JBLs sticks out too much making them very wide on your head. The studios fit great and still were very comfortable. I am not a sound hound so to me both headphones sounded great! The JBLs ANC worked while playing music and other things but the studios do not which I think is really weird. After using the JBLs for a day I realized that I just wanted a pair of nice headphones that sounded good, felt comfortable, and looked good on my head so I decided to take the JBLs back and get the beats studio wireless. I have not regretted this decision. Now I feel that the JBLs have a better build quality and way cool features that a lot of people will love! Since they are a new headphone though I don't feel they got the design right and maybe down the road they will but until then the Beats Studio Wireless are the best looking and best fit headphones that I have tried. I even owned the original studios when they first came out and these new design ones are a vast improvement. I did not give these headphones 5 stars because the noise cancelling feature is not as user friendly as others, my box did not come with a cleaning cloth like it was supposed to, and the case should have pockets or enough room for the extra cables and charger to fit.

VGot my beats today and still testing it around....1. First thing I noticed after opening the box was that a part of the foam on the earcup was dented because the other ear cup collapsed onto it probably for a really long time (probably since it was made in the factory). But the dented foam seem to slowly get back to its original shape and that really shows how great its quality is.2. I noticed the band is very stiff when compared to my beats wireless (that I own for like 2 yrs and is now discontinued), I remembered my old pair of beats used to be like that when I just got it. So now, I just want to recommend the people who just got it or going to get it to be extra gentle to it for a while and wait til it softens or loosen up to avoid possible band breakage. I know its a very expensive pair of headphones and we'd expect a lot from it but... let's admit that although its expensive its still not perfect. At least I know that the only reason I sticked to beats is because of its stylish looks.3. The wireless connection isn't quite smooth on the first try. Haven't tried it again cuz its now charging. I really hope that nothing goes wrong with the Bluetooth functions in it cuz I had to send in my first pair of beats wireless (discontinued) about a month after I got it cuz the bluetooth function died. Luckily beats send me a new one which I find them to be responsible. Not bad not bad. Though I did heard about the poor customer service beats/apple provide for some people which I have no idea of but do think that's possible...4. Overall: I recommend to be careful to these beats headphones especially ones with wireless features. I do think they are fragile, but honestly, its a $300+tax worth pair of headphones, and that's a price exclusively available on amazon. Its about $400+tax in bestbuy, staples, target... you name it. I treat it like glass made gold (at least in the beginning I do). So if you be gentle/careful to it (so it doesn't Break), its actually a pair of good looking (stylish), good sound quality, known/famous pair of headphones (with some risk which obviously I'm willing to take...). Worth considering pair of headphones.PS: will be updating if anything new comes to mind.

VSynopsis: Very good sound, noisy noise cancellation, ear cups not roomy enough, finicky connections. Unfortunately had to return them.Sound:  I really liked the sound of these.  I have a number of wired headsets (in, on, and over ear), and these were as good as any in terms of sound.  Good base but not overwhelming.  Everything was clear and not muddy at all.Sound, Pt. 2 (Using these with an iPhone): When I use the iPhone's built in Music app (with music in AAC/M4A format) they sound great with very little (if any) discernible difference from a wired connection, so these headphones definitely support AAC over Bluetooth.  When using the Amazon Music app the sound was nowhere near as good (becomes more obvious if you listen to Amazon Music for a spot that sounds wrong, then listen to the same spot with wired headphones).  My guess is that all Amazon Music is encoded as MP3.  It probably works great on a device that supports AptX, it doesn't on the iPhone.  This isn't a fault of the headphones but of the iPhone and Amazon Music not playing nicely with each other to get the music to sound good over Bluetooth.  Real bummer. I like Prime Music.Noise Cancellation: It did cancel out some noise, particularly lower frequency constant sounds; however, there is some pretty substantial hiss. Also, there are periodic soft beeps when nothing is playing (i.e. if you just want things quieter).  They aren't very loud, but to me it was enough to distract.Fit: Initially, these were very comfortable.  They are a bit snug but the very soft cushions keep the tightness from being uncomfortable.  The downside to the soft cushions is that they give enough so that my ears touched the inside of the headphone covering the speaker.  I bought these for all day wear (at work) and after several ours the pressure and slight rubbing on the tip of my ears caused them to begin to ache. I have what is probably a tad smaller than average head with smaller than average ears that don't lay flat on my head but don't stick out more than average either.Bluetooth Connection: Usually, it worked great, but if the phone and headset were separated by much distance (not in the same room but still in the same house) the connection dropped and I would have to manually reconnect them (i.e. turn headphones on and off or make the headphones discoverable and go through the menus on the iPhone).  Sometimes the connection was a bit wonky: I would get a call and the music would keep playing while the call would come through on my phone.  Disconnecting and reconnecting would fix this.  Finally, these DO NOT support multipoint (i.e. connecting to two devices at once) and DO NOT support NFC pairing.  With them being a new version this year and expensive they should support both.

VWireless Studio Beat Headphones These headphones are one of a kind and made perfectly for music lovers that like their music loud. The headphones have a noise cancellation where they block out all noise around you so you can only here the music. The headphones have very good sound built into them with a great bass also for those of you who like that. The Beats headphones come in all different types of colors and you can customize your own beats to make them just how you want! The most popular thing about these headphones is the fact that they are wireless and Bluetooth. Wireless is a big thing these days and people are looking for that and these are the headphones for you. They are great because the wireless connection holds up to 30 feet from your phone. You can set your phone down and run down stairs real quick to get something and still be listening to your music when your phone is up stairs with no Bluetooth connection problems.On the headphones it tells you how much battery life is left. The battery life is very good and more than you will ever need for one day. The battery life on the headphones last 12 hours of Bluetooth connection. If you plug your cord into the headphones they should last about 18 hours of played music. The headphones are also very easy to charge. All you do is plug them in at night and they are ready to go all day for you! On the other side they are a little pricy but well worth the money because they are awesome headphones and wont let you done. They are also a little on the bulky side but when you are done using them they fold up so you can put them away. When you have the headphones on your head you cant even tell that they are on your head because they are so light. These headphones are a lot better than ear bud headphones because they wont hurt your ears after you are using them for a long period of time. If you enjoy listening music and like a good bass or sound then these headphones are for you. The headphones aren\u2019t made specifically for one type of music it\u2019s made for all types of music. They work awesome and wont let you down.

VFive star review for a five star product
p1287
sg5
VBeats headphones were built to produce live concert sounds. So if you listen to music while exercising, studying, or just performing everyday tasks, these wireless headphones are for you. They not only stay on your head and hug your ears tightly while performing physical activity, but they also keep you focused with little to no distractions, making it useful to students, athletes, or just plain music lovers.Simple to use:Upon receiving the slick black box that opens like a book to reveal the products, you will find a microphone cable, USB charging cable, power adapter, instructions, and the headphones. The directions give you a step-by-step guide to work the headphones. Any age group that is familiar with technology is able to function the product.Comfortable:They are light, strong, and flexible to custom fit all head shapes. The headband is heavily padded, as well as the ear cups. You will find the ability to use the beats studio wirelessly contributes to comfort enormously; the Bluetooth allows you to roam 30 feet and lasts for 20 hours.Upgrade your listening experience:The creators want you to feel that you are at a real, live concert. You can expect that the music genres that sound best through these headphones include: rock, hip-hop, R&B;, electronic, and pop. Though it depends largely on the song, the treble response creates quality sounds. If you want to cancel all external sound, the adaptive noise canceling feature completely puts the world on mute which increases the experience of the Beats Studios.Affordable:The price of $264.29 for the wireless Bluetooth, high quality sound, lightweight design, and other mentioned aspects of the product make the headphones worth the price. They come with a one year warranty, but they are built to last long when taken care of.In the areas of comfort, simplicity, sound quality, and the price, you can expect positive evaluations. If you are searching for that concert-like sound and high quality, popular headphones, you have found them. Hope this helps you make a decision on the product.

VFantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.----Pros----Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.---Cons----Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.

VI've own these pair of Bluetooth headphones for over 3 months now. Here is my review.I will try to keep this review as short and concise as possible.Pros: Offers a listening experience that is friendly to all types of music. Bluetooth feature is amazing with connection length extending up to 30 feet. I can connect the headphones to my phone and leave it on my wireless charging mat and walk 25 feet to the kitchen and make food freely without any cable mess. Another good thing is that the wireless features doesn't degrade the sound quality. Battery life last 12 hours and there is an indicator on the headphones itself that shows how much juice is left. Some phones with newer OS even have a dedicated battery indicator on the phone itself. A nice little touch. These headphones are also extremely comfortable. I can wear them for hours and hours. Glasses doesn't cause any discomfort. Last but not least these headphones, in my opinion, looks really nice. The Titanium color I got with the matte finish helps prevent fingerprint marks as well as make it not so flashy when compared to the glossy counterparts.Cons: These headphones are expensive. I'd say these headphones are probably not the best bang for the buck in terms of tying sound quality with price. These headphones also won't work without charges on the battery. Even on wired mode. On wired mode you will get about 20 hours of use and on wireless mode, as mentioned above, you will get about 12 hours of use. Luckily it charges relatively quickly. The headphones may be really comfortable but the build material doesn't qualify its price tag. The headphones is primarily made up of plastic which is disappointing at this price point but materials choices didn't ruin the comfort levels or the durability levels.Edit (8/25/2015): With the recent price drop, the cost went down to $240. At this current price range these pair of bluetooth headphones offer a much better bang for the buck than the previous $380. I'll also raise my rating from 4 to 4.5 stars (round up to 5 since Amazon doesn't allow adjustments lower than 1) due to the price drop as well as I realized that after 100 hours of burning in the headphones, I noticed a slight yet significant improvement in sound quality.

VTL;DR:A much better BASS upgrade from the first generation of Studio Beats.Wireless connectivity is a major bonus and selling point for me.Left side is Audio Control [Music Control]Right Side Power On.2 3.5mm Audio cables. One has a 3 button Music Control and the other is a revised Beats cable.5 LED Battery indicator.Super Soft ear muffs.All metal Matte Black Head Band.Soft Rubber on underside of headband.USB 2.0 Charge Cable and a 5watt Wall adapter for Fast Charging.MUSIC QUALITY:I listen to AVICII, DEADmau, Kaskade, FLux Pavillion, Dubstep, DaftPunk, E.S.Posthumus, RIhanna, and Kpop/Jpop.For some reason I was able to listen wirelessly 3 rooms away with zig-zag walls in between. Maybe a something to do with my thin living room walls.I won't talk about the box as almost any Youtube Video in HD can show you the premium quality of the Box, contents, and opening.Before all this I own:-SOL REPUBLIC 1298-01 TKDK Tracks HD On-Ear Headphones +3 Button Control-SOL REPUBLIC 1601-30 Master Tracks Over-Ear Headphones Gunmetal +3 Button Control-Beats by DRE Tour +3 Button Control [1st Gen]-Apple In-ear +3 Button Control-V-Moda REmix HD +3 Button Control-V-Moda Bass Freq metal +3 Button Control-Jaybird Bluebuds X +3 Button Control-A Jays 5 for Android +3 Button ControlThe only other thing that can second the BASS on these Wireless Beats is the V-moda Remixes/Bass Freq. The others don't quite do it justice.The beats by Dre Tours [1st gen] kept popping out of my ears so I can't fully listen to the bass that it was designed to.Highly recommend for the Wireless and USB 2.0 non-proprietary charge port!

VBeats Wireless Studio Simply Amazing Noise Cancelling Headphones
p1310
sg5
VAs an owner of the original Studio Beats I was hard pressed to spend $300-400 again on another pair of noise canceling headphones. Fortunately, Amazon had a great Goldbox deal around Christmas that made this decision somewhat easier ($275). These headphones are lighter, sleeker and the noise leak is much less than the originals. And best of all, these are Bluetooth wireless. So I've been using these everywhere, from pairing to my iPhone, or my MBP, wireless makes it just so easy to use these whereas with my original headphones I find myself avoiding using them because I would be tethered to something and would be getting tangled up in long extension cables or on a short leash from my phone or computer. Now I can just toss these on and play my audio. That alone makes they pretty compelling upgrade if you own the originals and are looking for an excuse to upgrade.My old pair will be given to my wife or kids to use on the airplane for the noise cancelling capabilities.Sound: These cans still sound great, the sounds stage is still slightly mid-low heavy yes, but I don't find them as heavy on the low end as before. The improved cushioning on the ear pieces might have helped in this regard, because find myself not turning up the volume as much but hearing much better. The highs on these seem a bit more clear than before making these tied for the favorite headphones I own. My Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 were my favorite headphones before I bought these but now they are about neck and neck, Audio-Technica are open air headphones that produce a nice sound stage throughout all frequency ranges, but Beats isn't that far off, and you get many more features (but you're also paying for them too).Noise cancellation: Again with the improved cushioning, these headphones are made much better than the originals. It is far more difficult to hear the outside world with these on my ears even without the headphones on, once I turn the headphones on the active noise cancellation kicks in and it virtually blanks out the outside world. There seems to be an improvement in the noise cancellation as well from the originals because I find myself much less irritated when I use these headphones without audio playing. Sometimes I just need quite and need to concentrate and with the original Beat Studio headphones I found it made a droning/pulsing white noise that would feel a lot like change of pressure in my ears like when you take off on an airplane. It sometimes gave me headaches. With this latest version of the Beats Studio, the droning/pulsing is much less and I can just wear these to give myself some piece and quiet in noisy environments. Once I turn on the audio for music, movies or audiobook, the outside world is pretty much gone.Bluetooth: Bluetooth pairing, simple and easy, turn on the headphones, turn on Bluetooth pairing on your device and when the Beats are connected they will play a little sound bite. When you turn off your Beats or your Bluetooth on your device, the headphones will play a different sound bite. If you need to switch from one Bluetooth source to another, simply turn off the Bluetooth or disconnect the Beats on one device and connect on the other. Makes switching from iPhone to Mac very easy. You can skip tracks with the headphone, change volume and start and stop audio (or video if you're watching something) right from the headphone left side controls.Battery: Charge time seems fairly normal, you can get about 80% charge within an hour. Though I haven't timed from completely drained battery to full, I don't think it takes more than 3 hours to get a full charge. The headphones last a while so you should be able to get an entire day of audio play if you need to. Good enough battery life for most long flights or frequent use. The only disappointing feature I find with these headphones is that I cannot switch out batteries if I need to. I haven't tried pulling off one of the covers but it looks like the side cover can be removed if you have a small screwdriver.Weight: These headphones feel significantly lighter than the original Beats Studio headphones I own. They are overall a smaller profile making packing and traveling with these much easier. The case is about 30% smaller than the original but lacks an internal pocket for holding accessories but so long as you can pack away a micro-USB charge cable somewhere you should be good to go.Appearance: Comes in many different colors and I like the titanium colored ones I purchased. They are unintrusive looking and keep a low profile. But there are several other color combinations to fit your style. Before Beats introduced other colors, for better or worse you had to look a bit obnoxious, somewhat like Ed Hardy shirts 5 years ago. With the white or gold colored headphones they look "softer", matte finishes look a bit more masculine and bold solid colors like red and blue for those people that like to stand out.Overall: These headphones are spendy but if you can afford them they are definitely worth it. The build quality is superb and the noise cancellation and sound quality are top notch. Even if you owned an older version like I do, these are worth looking at and even replacing the originals.

VI got these on Dec 6 by Jan 2nd the leather on the right earcup started coming apart at the seem exposing the the foam, (all i did was wear the headphones i did nothing crazy and i dont wear earings).  This would not be as big of a deal if their customer service was better, here is a recount of my experience. When i noticed the damage i emailed beats CS, the same day i took the product into Best Buy where it was purchased, they informed that because it was past 15 days, i should take the product to APPLE, I went into Apple, and had to book an appointment for 2 days later, within that time beats got back to me and informed that the type of damage was not covered and that i would have to pay. on Sunday i brought the headphones with the receipt to the Apple Genius and he told me that all they did with beats is return them to beats to be repaired and if there was a charge i would have to pay, this process could take two to three weeks. I agreed after voicing my disappointment, however; when the rep tried to fill out the online form the serial number was not recognized (these are legit btw). anyway being out of options he spoke to someone in the back and granted an "unofficial" exchange, except the headphones he gave me were not wireless, i didn't figure this out until the next morning, which meant i had to leave work go to Apple and explain, luckily they still had the original pair in the back so they gave me another pair of wireless.In the end i was able to get my headphones which is cool, and I really do enjoy the product; However when you pay $400 dollars for an overpriced product you expect there to be enough quality so that it doesn't start falling apart before you reach a month, but if it does you you expect the company to replace it no questions asked.

p1321
sg5
VI had never owned a pair of premium headphones before I bought these.  I'm in love with these babies.With these headphones, I hear a solid bass, but the bass does not over-power the melody.  When I'm listening to instrumental music, I hear instruments that I never knew were there. It is a spectacular experience.  I've had these headphones for about a week.The cushions are very comfortable to wear.  You really can forget that you are wearing them. They are a billion times more comfortable than my ear buds.  I haven't fallen asleep with them on, but I certainly could do that.The headphones don't completely block out noise.  They block it out well enough for me. For example, I can still hear if my dogs bark, but the sound doesn't over-power my music.  I find it comforting that I can still hear a bit from the outside world.The bluetooth works very well.  I had no trouble syncing the headphones with my phone and my laptop. (I have a Samsung phone and Mac laptop.)  I can walk several rooms away from my phone without losing the bluetooth connection.  That's better distance than I generally get with my Jawbone bluetooth speaker. I have not had any problems with lag or dropping sync, etc.)The headphones come with a sturdy hard case, which is very helpful.  You can plug them into your device and use a wired connection.  I haven't noticed much of a difference in listening to them via bluetooth versus listening with a wired connection.  They also come with cables that allow you to charge the headphones through your laptop or through the wall.I don't know exactly how long the battery is lasting, but it seems like they last forever. You can check your battery life by looking at a set of lights on the right side of the headphones.My criticisms:  First, I've only tried talking on the phone with them once.  They worked, but I found talking through them to be a little awkward.  I'll be experimenting with that feature later.  I was told that I sounded like I was talking in a tunnel.  Second, the manual that came with the headphones wasn't very helpful.  It took me a while to figure out how I was accidentally muting the headphones. Initially, I thought there was something wrong with them.  It turned out that I was hitting a button that altered the sound.  I suppose I should take a star off for these criticisms, but those things seem like such minor issues in comparison to how much I adore the headphones.Bottomline:  These headphones are pricey.  I only purchased them because I had some extra cash on hand.  I normally wouldn't have spent this much money on something like this.  That being said, if you have the extra cash and you like listening to headphones, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

VI purchased these because I wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones.  These are decent, but not great.  I upgraded from a pair of Audio Technica ATH-MX30x ($69), thinking the sound would be quite a bit better, and in some ways they are much better, but in some ways they are no better.  The base is a little sloppy (not tight), the mids are muted (sound distant), but the highs are fantastic.  Overall, they don't sound incredible, but they do sound very good.  There are things I wish were better, and I am not sure the sound quite meets the price tag, but there are very few good wireless headphones on the market, and I personally really want wireless.These can be listened to in wired mode.  Many reviewers have said they sound better in wireless mode, and I have also found that to be the case.Pros:  Well built, great wireless performance, great battery life, comes with lots of cable (Yes they are wireless)Cons:  Mediocre overall soundConclusion:  One day a decent pair of wireless headphones for half the price will be released.  Probably best to wait.  Stick with wired right now unless you can't live any longer with wires.Update:I have now had these headphones for approximately 5 months, and I could not be happier with them.  Once you adjust the equalizers on your listening device, these sound fantastic.  I imagine my ears have largely adjusted to the sound of these cans, but when I listen to other headphones now, I just don't think they sound as good.  I would strongly recommend these headphones to anyone.

VI'm not a audio techie by any means & therefore don't know (or care about) the nuances espoused by audio-phile reviewers. All I wanted was a quality set of "over-the-ear" wireless headphones to use primarily when working out because ear buds do not fit in my ear comfortably or securely. So after a little research, I purchased Beats Studio2 wireless in Titanium. Here's my review on what was important criteria for me: The fit is very comfortable: does not shake loose while exercising but is also not so tight as to cause a headache.  The sound is very good to my UNtrained ear.  Easy to use controls. This "over-the-ear" style, which envelops the ear almost completely (vs "on-the-ear" which merely lays on top of the ear) provides a soothing noise-blocking environment. Yes, sweat does tend to accumulate round the ear during a good workout but, like other reviewers, immediately following my workout, I wipe the ear cups with a non-alcohol wipe & dry them off (when I get in my car) so the set is clean & ready for tomorrow.  My complaints?  I have two. First, these were very expensive -- well over $300. Had I waited a few more days before purchasing, I'd have secure this exact set for almost $100 less than what I paid. That's on me cause I was in too much of a hurry. Lesson learned!  My second complaint is that the case is a pain in the butt. It's very awkward to handle -- it's almost impossible to grip the thing because of the shape & rounded edges. Yes, there is a clip provided to attach to a cloth loop on one side of the case which does provide something to grab on to. All things considered, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

VPros:Great sound.  Nice and deep.  Bass is very good.Not too much like the Skullcandy Crushers.The protein leather on the earpads are very nice and soft.Cons:Not the most comfortable.Ears get hot because they did not leave enough space left between the ear and the leather.The ears cannot breathe and gets hot pretty quickly.The ear pads are very soft and cushy and so it is still more comfortable that the ATH M50X.The wireless convenience is what  you are paying the premium price over the ATH M50X though.The build quality does not inspire confidence.  It still has a plastic rattling sound from the folding joints.A $300 headphones should have a much better quality than this.  This is nowhere close to how well ATH MT50x feels in your hands.The active noise cancellation is very muted.  It probably adds around 25% in addition to the passive ones you get from covered earcups.As opposed to like 85% you would get from the Bose QC25.If Bose made the QC25 wireless, you might still get this becuase most likely Bose would price that at something ridiculous like $450.Bose's wireless headphones do not have Active Noise Cancellation yet for some unknown reason.=====================Update:  The Bluetooth connection kept dropping off with my iPhone6 plus.Thanks to other reviewers on Amazon I found out that there was a firmware update released by Beats to address this.You have to go to the website, download the sofware and connect your headphones to update the firmware.After a restart and reconnect with my phone, it was fixed!

VI was initially very happy with these headphones. One of my friends got a pair first, let's call him friend A. Followed by me. Then another friend, let's call him friend B. All within a week or so. I say this to make it clear that my issues aren't isolated. I want to give one other piece of information. We all use them similarly. At work in an office 9/10.The sound is very impressive as is the noise cancellation. In those two respects. In my opinion these headphones were and are still near perfect. After 2 years. The batteries still hold a great charge. With typical use you can go days without charging them.Now for the issues. Within the first 11 months, they were great. Then one of the parts where the headphone folds with the studio logo on friend A headphone just shattered. At that point they looked like a pair of nunchucks. While not as extensive, something similar happened with friend B and his were not longer able to fold.The cover for the cushion on my Ear pads began to separate shortly after exposing the foam. I then had a similar issue as the friends above where my headphones don't fold as they should.At the time these headphones were $300 with maybe $10 off here or there. The expectation was that these would be headphones that last a long time. It's definitely not the case.Within the first year of warranty. These headphones have been great. Beyond that they deteriorate rapidly. I can't in my right mind recommend them.We did order some replacement parts to give them a bit more life, but for the price the build quality is seriously lacking.

VSo far so good, I love these and they are very good at blocking out surrounding sounds. I use these while cleaning the house and occasionally when getting ready to wind down and go to sleep. The sound is very impressive and the bass is quite powerful. At first I wasn't so sure because the music sounded very "drowned out" at first. I would recommend tinkering with your phone's equalizer and sound settings to get the sound you want, especially if you have an android like I do. I did and finally got it to the way that I want it to sound. The controls in the instructions say that the most features can be used with apple devices, but so far I've been able to use the same controls with my android  (skipping songs, backtracking and taking calls). The only complaint is have is when taking calls I have to have the phone up in front of me for the other person to hear me. This can be pretty annoying especially because I get quite a few calls and gave to run to my phone when using the wireless feature. The ear cups are good and I have not experienced any problems-yet. I hope I can be one of the lucky ones who don't have the faulty ear cup issue.I used to have the power beats 2 and hated them because they kept slipping off or pushing my glasses with the rubber earpieces and making them fall off my face. Obviously these have been great and I have had no issues there. If you are like me and wear glasses I know you can also relate to the dull soreness that some headphones give you when they push on your ears against the eyeglass earpieces for a period of time.So far, good purchase and worth the price!

VI went to Best Buy with a budget of $300 to purchase a pair of headphones. I listended to Bose, Sony, and of course Beats. I was instantly surprised with the quality of the sound from the Beats Solo 2 wireless. They were crisp, had punchy bass, and were no where near the sound that I was expecting. I had heard that Beats was all name with no sound. Well, I was about to purchase the solo 2 until I decided to give the Studio wireless a try. I had no intention of purchasing these for they were near the $400 mark, thus well above my $300 budget. I was blown away by the openness, punchy bass, and overall fun that these headphones produced. It had solidified my decision to go ahead with the purchase of the solo 2 wireless. As I reached down to grab the solo 2 off of the shelf, I noticed a studio wireless in red being sold as open box for $285 dollars. I could not believe my eyes. I immediately asked the salesperson what was the gimmick. Were they the  previous model, damaged in some way, for they were just sitting there as the deal of century as far as I was concerned. He said no. In fact, he said they were floor samples that the manager decided to put back on the shelf to sale on the fourth of July. He said I just noticed them myself, and was contemplating on getting them if no one else did by the end of the day. Well, you know the rest of the story. I picked them up, took them home, and have been amazed at not only the deal that I got, but the overall quality of build, and premium sound of these headphones. In addition, my kids were all jealous of how cool these sleek red headphones looked as well.

VPros:BeautifulBluetooth or wired connectionGreat sound quality (coming from a non-audiophile guy)Nice to wear outside in the winter monthsVery nice packagingCons:Uncomfortable after only short period of timeCan't use headphones in wired mode after battery is deadThese headphones are great! As always, Beats provide a beautiful product. Very stylish indeed. But that's only one aspect. The sound coming from these is simply pleasant. I did notice I don't need the volume as loud when listening to a movie or music. I think partially due to the noise cancelling feature and the fact it encapsulates the whole ear. Well that and I'm sure there's technical advances in the drivers.Another feature that I love is the Bluetooth. I don't always have it on. Mainly because it does run through the battery much faster. But it's nice to know its there when I'm out walking around or don't want to be tied down with a cord.Now a huge downside is the comfort of these headphones. I couldn't believe how tight these headphones are after weeks of use. I certainly thought they would loosen up after some use, but no they didn't. It's so bad, that I find myself almost tapping out in submission to the headaches they give me. Perhaps a break after a couple hours is needed. But I'd like to be the one to make that call. Not the pain of just simply wearing headphones.Overall, I do enjoy these headphones a lot. I only wish they were more comfortable when it comes to how tight they are. Otherwise the cushions feel very nice.

VIn 10 minutes you have to leave so you have a few minutes free making this a good moment to listen to a track or two, so you switch on the headphones, checking the phone that serves as your audio source to see if it's connected, see it's not, try pressing 'b' on the headphones, check the source again, go into bluetooth settings, try poking them here and there, hold 'b' down again, longer this time, and eventually you decide to get the audio source to forget the connection and wait for the headphones to be discovered again and after a few attempts holding the 'b' button down for different lengths of time, trying to re-pair each time, until suddenly you find everything says it's connected and you can't see any reason for there being no sound, and yet there is no sound, and so you switch the headphones off and on and suddenly they work and it's awesome but everyone is looking at you funny as you were radiating sound from the main speakers but you didn't realise, and you've only got 30 seconds left from your 10 minutes so you take off the headphones and get them folded and packed and zippered away in time to leave for your appointment wondering which of the many steps you tried was actually the one that made it all work and whether they'll work next time you have a spare 10 minutes and you set off in your car but it doesn't give you navigation instructions because in the process of getting the headphones to work you broke the pairing between your phone and your car.They sound fine.

VThe wireless Beats Studios are some of the best headphones I have bought and are overall a great buy. Having the beats now with a wireless feature is very handy and you never have to worry about losing the cord or getting it all tangled up in your headphones. The Bluetooth that links the phone and headphones, connects really easy and is never a hassle. The sound and bass that the headphones project are astounding. When you want to listen to your music in piece and quiet, and put the world on mute, the noise cancellation that the Beats have are amazing. If you want the headphones to cancel out more of the outside would, ANC mode increases the cancellation of the noise outside of the headphones and makes the daily commute quite. The headphones are really light and easy to carry around, and the durability of the Beats is stronger than ever.  The negatives of the Beats are really minimal. The price is kind of high for just a pair of headphones, but once you get the experience to use them, the price shouldn't be a problem. If you use the beats for quite a long time, you ears start to get a little irritated and you might just want to take them off because of it. The Beats website says that the headphones will last you up to 20 hours, but if you use them constantly and for long periods of time like me, it's feels like it last for about ten hours, but maybe that's because I get so into them!! But other than that, these headphones are hands down some of the best and are worth every penny!

VHaving been an owner of the earlier generation of Beats Studio Headphones; purchasing the updated wireless headphones with a black matte finish was a no brainer. I couldn\u2019t believe, being a first time wireless headphone owner, how free I felt not having a cord that tied me down to my phone, laptop, or iPad. These headphones are perfect for a student on the go and for anyone working out at the gym.PHYSICAL: The black matte finish is subtle; yet, very sharp looking. The headphones are professionally built; very sturdy and smooth movements of the ear flaps. One of the things Beats really improved one with these headphones is the padding around the ears. They set comfortably and don\u2019t move around much, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them falling off your head. Having glasses, the pad on these are very comfortable and don\u2019t push too hard on ears or frames. Overall, these headphones have a sleek, comfortable, and attractive design.AUDIO: The sound of these over-ear headphones is second to none; I can hear everything the producer intended the listener to hear, its quite remarkable. The padding of the ear-phone part is noise canceling, meaning when you put them on you can\u2019t hear much other than what is coming from the speakers. With the great sound and noise canceling headphones it is worth every dollar of what is now $264.29.I definitely recommend these headphones for a student on the go and for anyone working out at the gym.

VFor the better part of the last 3 years I've been through about 4 different headphones as I've been longing for 1 pair of just great headphones.  I started with a pair samsung ear buds that shipped with my Galaxy.  Clearly, I needed something better and so after some research I bought a pair of Audio Technica's ATH-50S that have the straight cable.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED them minus the fact that they came with a non-removable 11' straight cable.  So after using them for about 6 months I begrudgingly sold them for a pair of Audio Technica sport earbuds.  Again, I fell in love.  After using them for about 6 months I realized that ear buds after long use became extremely uncomfortable.  I needed to go back to over the ear.  After a recent trip to Vegas where I got extremely lucky at the roulette table I bought a pair of these Beats Studio at the airport Kiosk.  I'm currently in love and happy again.  These are comfortable, the sound is extremely well balanced and the highs and lows hit as expected.  The build quality feels pretty premium to me.  The one knock that I have is that if the rechargeable battery were to ever permanently die then these headphones are useless.  The reason for that is due to the noise cancellation which require power.  Beats, due to value on aesthetics opted to forgo the battery pack which is usually attached to a wire and went with an internal rechargeable battery.  Barring that, the set is near perfect for me.

VExcellent Sound.... For Specific Music Genres
p1430
sg5
VLet me preface my opinion by saying that I'm no audiophile and I *hate* the "accurate" music reproduction that audiophiles get off to debating. I like specific music types and I like headphones that enchance the music types that I like. These headphones do that for me.I like rap, hip hop, pop, electronic/techno and the occasional bass heavy rock. I love bass- sharp and well defined booming bass, not the bass that muddles the rest of the music. If you enjoy the sound that I just described, then these headphones are one of the best options that you can go with. These are a MASSIVE improvement over the past generation Beats' Studio headphones both in terms of build and sound- enough of an improvement to warrant buying these if you have a past generation.I've tried 20+ headphones that audiophiles rave about: too many to list here but from brands like AKG, klipsch, Sennheiser, Bose, B&W.; I don't like "accurate" music and freaking out because x or Y is 2hz off. Each person is unique in what sounds good to them. If you're a fan of bass and great sound quality for the genres listed, you won't regret buying these. Sound and connection is EXCELLENT on Bluetooth as well.All of that being said, Creative Aurvana Platinums are a great slightly cheaper alternative... Be ready to wait months if you order as of 3/19/14 however.

p1436
sg5
VSome background for a review of a Beats Studio headset  Been purchasing premium headsets for a few decades.  While not an "audiophile" I know what I like.  Solid base reproduction, clear high end and a mid range that doesn't muddy the two.  The best I've ever used are Shure 535se ear buds.  They exceed my listening requirements, with triple woofers and crystal clear mid and high range reproduction, and passive noise reduction.  For reference, I have also used numerous active noise cancellation headsets and ear buds, wired and wireless from Bose, including QC 2 and QC 15 headphones, AE2w bluetooth headphones, and QC 20 ear buds.  Add Voda and Audio Technica to the list.The Beats Studio headset is the best combination of all features I look for.  Comfort is exceptional.  The headset is a lightweight minimalist design with attractive detail.  Controls are unobtrusive and easy to use.  Active noise cancellation is excellent.  Long battery life and quick recharge eliminates power as an issue.  Base rocks. Treble is crystal clear.  The mid-range is a solid bridge.  Then there's the convenience and VALUE of wireless connectivity to every bluetooth capable device I own.  As a package it doesn't get better.  If you want head banging reproduction with no compromises, and NO CORD, you can't go wrong with this investment.  As endorsed by voozoo.

p1447

VGood battery life. Lasts one entire day of continuous play.The ear space is not as big as it looks, your ears will still be in an un-natural position. It's still confortable, but you will start to feel the pain after a few hours. It will be annoying if you work with music or you listen to it all day for whatever reason.The sound is great, and the controls on the side are awesome. You have control over 2 separate volumes: the volume of your device (phone, ipod,  computer, etc.) And the volume of the beats. This is great for people with good ear, or people who work with music.They are warm. Great for the winter but it will suck in the summer... your ears do sweat. However, they are powerful enough that you can play the music from your neck and hear it perfectly.The max volume sounds like a regular speaker with base and everything. (Imagine a speaker on your ear? Yeah, that loud, don't hurt yourself.)Overpriced? Yes, but hard to find the same thing with the same quality. I'd say, they are wirth 200 - 250, not nearly 400 dollars. But it's apple, they are all about name, beauty and branding.I don't think there is anything else that's relevant, but ask if you have any questions.I'm generally happy with my purchase, I need them; but beware... not for the general public.

VUncomfortable and Made for Apple Products
p1453
sg5
VI purchased these headphones from Amazon and have been a loyal Beats owner in the past.  In fact I had the old original studios so I was excited to get the newer ones, especially being wireless.  When I first put them on they sounded okay (using Galaxy S5).  I really had to turn the volume up pretty high on the device for them to output adequate sound.  A few days later I took the headphones to work and after about an hour of listening they started to hurt the top of my head.  The band used is a little thicker and is made of this rubbery material.  I thought to myself as much as I love the looks and the wireless feature of this headphone I can't wear something that is going to hurt my head.  Because of this discomfort, I decided to return my headphones and get the Bose QC25.  The Bose QC25 are lighter and more comfortable after longer use and also have better noise cancelling.  Before I shipped these headphones back I wanted to test the difference of sound quality between my Galaxy S5 and my iPad Air.  Like stated earlier, the sound output from my Galaxy just was not what I had experienced with Beats in the past.  However, when paired with my iPad the sound quality was magnificent.  There was a huge difference.  I am unsure of what is causing this issue, but it is something to be aware of.

VThis product is not for audiophiles.Now that that point has already been laid out, I will recommend this pair of headphones to people who are looking for:1. Bluetooth/wireless2. Noise cancelling3. Comfort4. StyleThis may not be the best product for each of these categories, but its the only one that seems to offer a good combination of these 4.Connectivity is not as superb as other headsets, but if you're just planning to connect this with your phone which would always be at your side, then there should be no issues.I use this on plane rides often and the noise cancellation works well enough to silence the occasional noisy child in-flight.If you listento music mainly through the popular streaming services, don't really see any issues with the sound quality. Heavy on the bass, so it may turn off some people.One gripe I would have is the durability of these things. A year into my first pair, some internal cable probably snapped and the bluetooth connection kept dropping whenever the headset gets moved slightly. My fault though as I haven't really been the most careful owner, sometimes just throuwing them into my bag without putting it inside the case and all.

VGo buy the Bower and Wilkins P5 Wireless!! I have the beats studio wireless matte black and I thought they were good until I purchased the P5's, no comparison and they're the same price. I bought my beats in February of this year, the foam was infinitely more pliable on one side making them lopsided and now it's only been 5 months and the padding is falling apart. I just sent them back to apple to get fixed and I'm going to sell them when they send them back to me. I just purchased the P5 wireless from B & W and the first impression was WOW! there was such a clear difference in the quality of sound and build. I thought this was a good headphone and if I wouldn't have bought the P5's I would have never known how much I was missing out on. I'm disappointed in these headphones for the quality and build at their price, these are not 400 dollar headphones, on that same note, after listening to the Bower and Wilkins, I said to myself, I would have paid double. Granted, many people buy these because they're beats. I will no longer being Beats headphones in the future. Just to clarify, The sound is fine, it's not bad at all, but after paying the same price for another headphone that sounds so much better, it's upsetting.

VAs many have said, the quality of sound you get for the price is lower than I would have hoped for. Make no mistake, the sound quality is good but I was underwhelmed due to the price.So with that out of the way, it's pretty awesome for blue tooth head phones. They did a good job of combining the pause/play, forward/backward, and Bluetooth connect functions into one button. The cables and case were nice and yes, you can fit the cables and even charging plug and headphones in the same case without forcing it.Plus, the base isn't that much in my opinion; they balance sound pretty well, and if you take into account the noise canceling any type of music genre sounds nice on them. You should be able to tell when a sound file was made with good quality and when it wasn't.On the noise canceling, it pretty much only blocks low tones, so high pitches can be heard... But I wore them while walking next to a busy street and it blocked out noise pretty well.Most I can say is they grow on you. No loss of quality when using them wireless at all.I guess I'll go ahead and give it five stars. After all, they sure make you feel fancy

p1494

VLooks awesome and sounds great, as advertised. Not as plasticky as I expected and the audio quality is the same with or without a cable. Battery life is good and the headphones feel comfortable on the head and ears even after long hours of listening. If you're after noise-cancelling though, you're better off with Bose QC25. Have no regrets nonetheless as I got a good deal from the vendor, OneCall. The absence of a cleaning cloth and serial number on the new batches of this unit is sowing doubt and confusion re authenticity... Beats tech support hotline confirms that some Beats Studio Wireless headphones manufactured and/or sold after July 2014 do not really come with a cleaning cloth and serial number on the unit so it's best to save the box (with the serial number visible at the bottom), just in case the headphones need servicing. The same company should also update their authorized retailer list on the website or provide their customer service reps with a current list at all times to avoid misinformation. Old and new clients of the brand naturally presume that paying a premium will not only mean procuring an excellent product but also receiving good customer service.

VGood Wireless Headphones, Sound OK...
p1506
sg5
VI give 3 stars only because of the pricing - if they were $100 they would be a 4 star item.  The sound quality is solid, meaning they sound good.  They aren't $1000 DJ/reference headphones so do not expect to get your socks knocked off, but do have a good bass response and are wireless.Some people say they have issues with bluetooth, others' say that they actually sound better in "wireless" mode.  I can honestly say that I don't really notice a difference, besides I feel like I hear a very quiet high kHZ distortion when they are silent and paired (could be my imagination but I have a pretty good ear).I do not know what qualified someone as an "audiophile" but I listen to music all day, worth with DAW's (Adobe Audition, Logic, etc.) and video production, so have quite a lot of experience with different sound gear and levels of quality of audio sources...Bottom line - if you're like me and just can't deal with another wire on your desk, and have the cash to spend, go for it, they sound pretty good.  If you wouldn't mind a wire and a price conscious buyer, look elsewhere for a wired pair for half the price that will sound just as good.

VSound Quality is Great, Product Quality is Not
p1512
sg5
VI purchased my Studio Wireless headphones in February 2014, prior to the Apple takeover, and couldn't stop telling people how great they were. They are very comfortable, have a long battery life, do a decent job of noise-cancelling, and the sound quality is outstanding. The reason I only give them a 3 out of 5 stars is because they broke today (5/12/2015) a mere 15 months after I purchased them. When I say they broke, I mean the plastic on the headband above the left ear-cup SNAPPED while I was simply putting them on. Considering most people's heads aren't only 6 inches wide, it's required to spread the ear-cups to put them on. I find it to be ridiculous that there would be such an obvious stress point on the headphones that it wouldn't be addressed before going to market. Now Apple is providing the "support" for the headphones, and of course my warranty ran out 3 months ago.I have taken very good care of them since purchase, having them inside their case whenever they are not in use. For the price of $400 I was hoping that these would last for several years before I decided to replace them with whatever was the latest and greatest at the time.

sg5
VI've owned these since July 2014. Don't trust any of the 5 star ratings.I bought these mainly for the wireless bluetooth and the name assuming the name would be higher quality than other brands. At $380 clams, these headphones should not be falling apart after 1 year, especially with how little I use them. The pleather is completely separated, not torn, effing separating. I am so annoyed that they are falling apart based on how little I use them; mostly road trips and airplanes. Also, the bass does not compare the the original beats that were made by monster. I get more bass out of apple earpods than these. Also the headphone wire is on an angle, so I have to use an extender to use it with my iphone case. Also, the cups don't cover my ears 100% which causes pressure on parts of my ears, almost like they designed them for children sized ears. Plus they're heavy as hell, horrible to wear longer than 4+ hours. I cannot recommend these headphones or the brand, I feel totally ripped off. But I do like the rechargeable battery via microusb, that is really convenient.

VI got the studio wireless in matte black. The headphone sure looks classy. Sometimes the price drops 100 bucks below the list price and again go back up, I was lucky to get hold one of those windows. The sound is awesome, I am listening to all my favorite songs with this one and they seems as new. There are lots of music which I was missing earlier which I am able to enjoy now. The balance between bass and treble is perfect. None of them is too much. It also has adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) in wireless which is a major win over other competitor products.There are a few reasons though for which I am not giving 5 stars:-1. Comfortability - I expect it to be more comfortable with the price I am paying. After longer duration I feel some heat around my ear and sweat accumulate around the ear cushions and sometimes the headphone switches off automatically when I do workouts wearing it.2. Battery life - Though in the description it is giving 8 hours listening time but if I turn on the ANC it hardly last 4 to 5 hrs. But it has a quick charge up time. In this price range the battery expectation was a bit more.

I've never let it run all the way out truthfully, so I don't know how much more I could stretch it.  The material seems fairly well built.. I do feel like I need to be very careful with them.. probably just because paying almost $400 for a pair of headphones makes me think they must be fragile.The only complaint I really have about them is with the earcup size.  I have somewhat regular sized ears I think, especially for being a bigger guy (6'3,230). The earcups are shallow so the depth of my ear (for lack of a better way to describe it) gets compressed quite a bit and is uncomfortable after an hour or so of wear.  If they increased the depth of the cup, these would be my favorite headphones, even over my Bose (which I can wear for 10+ hours straight without being uncomfortable).

VLet me say I'm no audiophile, I love music but have no interest in spending a lot of money and time on HiFi systems to try and get as close to studio sound as possible, that's not me.So going into the review knowing that I can say I'm impressed with these Beats Studio Wireless, having no wires is great, the battery life is good at 12hrs+ and to me the sound quality of these is great, a lot better than previous iterations of Beats, I know people will say you can get better sounding headphones for the money and that's probably true, but I don't mind paying extra for the wireless feature and to be honest the design and name - it's no different in that respect to any premium brand name, you pay extra for it. They are comfy and I have had no trouble pairing with my phone or laptop and they work well.The only con I'd say is when the battery dies so does the music, even if you plug in the supplied audio cable they will not work so that's not good - it would be better if that was changed.I can't give 5* because of the point above, but I'd definitely recommend these to a friend.

V"Hi there, I purchased my Beats Studio Wireless from Amazon and I love it. I am however having problems with it's bluetooth connectivity. I have updated to the latest firmware via the Beats Updater. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with the app, Poweramp to connect to my Beats Studio Wireless but it keeps losing it's bluetooth connection intermittently or if I increased the volume, tried to change the track or pressed any of the buttons. Sometimes it plays for half an hour before it loses it's connection without me touching any buttons. I then have to turn off the Beats Studio Wireless and turn it back on for it to work again. I also have the Beats Wireless and I don't have any connection problems whilst connecting to my Note 3. I sincerely hope that this problem can be fixed with a simple firmware update as I am unable to return the device because my Amazon window period expired on March 14, 2014. Is this a defective device or are others experiencing this sort of problem ?"

VPainful to wear and don't cancel noise
p1577
sg5
VGot the gold pair for Christmas and tried them out on my return trip home. I could hear every word of the flight attendant's safety speech with the volume turned up to a good level. I think a pair of ear muffs would cancel noise about the same.They also hurt my ears and my head. They are very very heavy and push down on the top of my head and pull my ears down. I had to take out my stud earrings to be able to wear them, and even then they werent comfortable to wear for a 2 hour flight. They're fancy looking but when worn (I'm an adult female), I felt like I looked as if I was trying to channel princess Leia... in other words silly.All that aside the actual audio quality was nothing to write home about. Certain types of music rich in bass will get you the most out of these, but I found a lot of white noise in the acoustic, folk, and classic rock that I listen to.Overall certainly not worth the $289 price tag on Amazon. Though with the level of discomfort they caused me, I probably wouldn't buy these at any price.

VThese headphones are great for whats out on the market right now. They are expensive and while I do feel part of the cost is based on pure hype I just was not willing to purchase another brand on a whim. I read a review mentioning the white noise and how that person did not like it, I personally enjoy the white noise as a noise canceling effect and it works well to me. Its a surprising feature and I did not expect it. The headphones are also cool in the way they fold into each other, much different from prior beats.There is also another variety of wireless headphones from beats that are cheaper, those are the older model and the difference is that they are "on the ear" instead of "over the ear", This is a review of the most recent, more expensive over the ear headphones. I do believe the over ear headphones have better sound quality simply because it covers the whole ear and that is my rationale for buying these ones.I previously had the motorola sd-10, I had one of the original...

p1594
sg5
VBeing an audiophile really sucks. To put it frankly, I am so picky about getting a perfect sound that I sometimes feel like I don't enjoy the music. When I'm playing a video game with headphones on I don't pay attention to the game, I pay attention to the headphones and try to figure out what is WRONG with them.So imagine my reaction when I first picked these up!So far, the only headphone capable of delivering a "perfect" sound under 500$ is SENNHIESER's HD-600. Audio Technica's ATH-M50x's (about 150$) are the best for it's price tag but lack the soundstage and speed of the HD-600s when properly set up with an amplifier.For 300$ I would expect something along the lines of my ATH-m50s or better but this headphone is just a complete failure! The reason why I gave it so many stars is because I don't know how the engineers were able to create a headphone that can provide so much BASS extension without breaking! It's a very sexy phone but is sexy REALLY worth all that money?

VI bought mine as a Christmas gift for myself last Christmas.  I had planned on using them occasionally while I am at work, or exercising.  When I received them, I enjoyed the sound they put out, and were very comfortable.  After a couple of months, maybe 10 uses total, I heard a loud pop in each ear and the sound quality went to hell.  I called beats and returned them for repair.  To my surprise, they replaced them free of charge.  Now it had only been a couple months later, maybe 10 uses later and now there is no sound coming out of one ear, and I am about to call them again, and how they can be replaced, again.  I had high hopes for these.  I am not a heavy user, user them on occasion, and they keep having issues.  For how much these cost, I expected them to last longer than they obviously do.  I shouldn't have to replace them every couple of months for a casual user.  The Bluetooth feature was why I got these, and it is looking like I need to look into other brands... I'm just not satisfied with them.

VA little bit about myself, I am a avid techy purchasing the latest gadgets every year. Of course I do plenty of research into products that I purchase.I purchased the beats from the Apple store, since I had a gift card.These headphones are overpriced hence why I gave it 4 stars.The quality of the build is great, feels sturdy and durable. Also, the sleek design is what sold me to the product.The sound sure isn't like other headphones but Beats doesn't advertise to be the best in sound quality. Yet I feel these heads phone do a great job at being headphones, because if you're not an audiophile your not going to know what highs and mids even sound like. Since, I love EDM music this headphone is always my go to.The Bluetooth is probably the best I seen on any headphones. The controls work great even on my Galaxy S6. The battery is 11 hours but I don't even use it for that. I mostly takes these to the gym with me, break at work and walking to class.

They were all good headphones but i did not see how the sound quality on many of them were any better than beats despite what some say. The old beats models werent that great but the new studios are nice. The earpads are so soft, the matte black color is slick and they supply plenty of good cables and a hard case! I would describe the sound as fun and comparable to any of the headphones i mentioned in this review.

p1621
sg5
VI've been pretty apprehensive about buying a pair of beats as I'm a bit of an audiophile and they have notoriously butchered highs and mids in favor of heavy bass. I received these as a gift from work and was surprised at the better balance of this model over other beats models. They still aren't perfect, but as a comparison they sound on par with a pair of $150 wired Bose cans I got a couple years ago. The build quality is excellent, soft cups and band could be worn for a long time comfortably. They fold up and have a hard case which is nice for travel. The wireless is much better quality than the other wireless headphones I've tried in previous years, and there is even a mic on board the actual headphones that works wirelessly. Had they not been a gift I doubt I would reach for them at the price point, but I would probably pay around $275 for these. I'm not going around saying these are the best headphones ever, but they are a pretty high quality and feature rich consumer product.

VThis piece is a major upgrade for me from the older beats wireless, sound quality is amazing, beats are more clear. I love and I'm used to the way beats amplify the power of lower frequencies. compared to the previous, it looks and fits much better on my head, specially the black matte version also the titanium.but unfortunately, I had to return 3 headphones due to the following: first 2 had un-balanced bass, one side is clearly higher than the other in one, in the other, bass was vibrating one side more when turning the volume to maximum. the third one had a problem around the Bluetooth led plastics wasn't closed properly around the led.My advice for you, is to buy it from authorized dealer with warranty as it seems beats has major manufacturing quality issues with this brand. when you receive yours, turn the volume to max setting, run something that beats hard and repeatedly, listen carefully if balanced then you are safe.

VGot these a week ago and must say they sound better than the previous Studio model.  The design is much better looking in my opinion too.  Sound wise it seems like everything (highs, mids and lows) are all amplified or something.  I have a pair of Monster Inspirations where I feel the sound on those are more balanced and natural.  When I did a side by side sound check the Beats seemed to be much higher in highs and mids at the same volume.  It just seems like the sound is intensified or something.  Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing.  Different strokes for different folks.  Maybe I still need some time to get used to them.  They are still a decent pair of cans but the price is pretty steep.  I like the rechargeable battery instead of 2AA's which made the previous version bulky and heavier.  Style wise you can't beat them.  Beats are always a status brand and when you walk with them on the street everyone will be looking at you.

p1653
sg5
VThese headphones are very shoddily made and began falling apart almost instantly. Right out of the box, the leather around the left earcup began to loosen a bit. I thought to myself, "no worries, nothing a little superglue can't fix." After all, I purchased them mainly for the sound quality, not aesthetics. A few weeks later, the same thing happened on the opposite side. Next, I noticed that the catch on the left side would malfunction, prohibiting the headphones from remaining in the default (non-extended) position. So the left side would kind of just hang. Subsequent to that, the headband came undone. I've only had these headphones for five months. They are beyond repair with superglue and duct tape. This is my second pair of Beats and I am extremely disappointed because the sound quality was pretty good. Based on this experience, I'm moving on to another brand. One can get poor craftsmanship at a much cheaper price.

VI bought this pair of headphones over the weekend and when I brought them home I charged them as per the manual but the beats never recognized the full charge and therefore would endlessly sit on the charger even though it had a full battery. I googled around and found that this is a common issue and that it is recommended to power cycle the headphones. I loved the bluetooth/wireless aspect and decided to give them another chance. I spent the last 3 days using them and now I know that these headphones are not for me. The beats button feels cheap and seems easy to break, the bluetooth died on day 3 while I was using the headphones and now the bluetooth doesn't even turn on or indicate that it is working. So now I have these expensive broken plastic headphones. I will be returning my pair today.

VI usually don't venture into the electronics department, when considering a gift for my husband, because he already has everything, and he is very picky!  But, just one week before Christmas, I asked him what he thought about the beats headphones, and to my amazement, he didn't know much about them.  I didn't know much either, so I began my research, reading reviews and watching videos.  Since he loves everything Bluetooth, I settled on this model in black, and Amazon Prime got it to me just in time for Christmas.  Well, my husband loves these headphones!  Every few days, he tells me of a new discovery.  For instance, he is impressed by the clarity, whether he is talking on the phone or listening to music. He loves how well the noise cancelling feature works, and that they are so comfortable to wear, he could easily fall asleep with them.  These are great headphones, and the perfect companion for his IPad and IPhone.

VI know all the bad things people say about them, how they are overpriced and have a very low range.  I listen to mostly hip hop and electronic, so that suits me just fine.  I have the older wired Studio headphones as well.  I have to say I love these the most.  It is so nice and the range is great.  I tested it around my house.  To give you an idea my house is just a bit under 1500 sqft on the main level.  I was able to leave my phone on the opposite side and was able to still hear it crystal clear, so the range is pretty good.  Overall comfortable, I haven't traveled anywhere yet, but these seem to fit my ears/head better than the older ones did, and I never had problems with them unless it was a flight over 4 hrs then it got to be a bit much.  I can't tell if these are any lighter than they claim, but they're fine weight wise for me.  Overall these are great for what I need them to be.

VFantastic! Love the fact once I connect to Ipod I only need the headphones--they change songs, go backwards & forwards, pause, adjust volume, etc.  I have had other wireless and love these. Husband bought for me as I needed noise cancelling at work but needed the ear part to be recessed so I could put them on over my phone earpiece.They fit well, have no leakage of sound to others. Only thing is they really do not totally cancel outside noise; they muffle it.  I have to turn the music up to be able to get complete noise cancelling.  However, these are better than others. The ease of not having to touch the Ipod to change songs or pause overrides the noise cancelling need. They also have a long battery life and long reach from the source--the signal goes thru walls too.  And they are vivid colored so everyone around me sees I am trying to focus and don't interrupt unless it's urgent.

Vone of the few products i've ever bought that's managed to merge itself into every-day use. walking the dog, playing video games, just jamming around the house, whatever - it's all literally next level with these headphones. the ease of movement with no cable is amazing; i never have any issues syncing with bluetooth (but i also work on bluetooth for a living) and these things literally THUMP they sound good. like, physically. there's some sort of thumping mechanism that makes beats sound great although a bit overwhelming (like they should be) whenever you turn them up to full blast.the sound isn't perfect objectively speaking, but i use these more than my Sennheiser HD25-1 IIs because of how dang slick they are. they feel great, they sound great, and best of all they open you up to an amazing world of accessibility while you're listening. 5 stars, worth the bucks to me

VGreat headphones and now wireless!!!  I had the generation before this and thought they were okay.  Beats has definitely stepped up the game in terms of quality and now being wireless makes them even better.  I hated the wired stuff as it was always getting in my way.  They are super comfortable to wear for long periods and the matte black looks super nice.  It connected to my iPad and iPhone and has always worked perfectly and has a range of about 20 feet as I work with these sometimes. If you have your phone in your back pocket you get clear sound all day.  Haven't tried to see how long they last.  Longest I used them was about an Hour straight and still had 3/4 lights charged.I use them to listen to music, produce music (primarily hip hop) and movies.If I had one gripe it would be price.  I would pay 200-250 tops for these but 300-400 is way too high.

V**I've owned these headphones for about 4 months and use them every day. I did not purchase them from Amazon.**I would have rated these 5/5 if they didn't retail for almost $400 because they are definitely not worth that hefty price tag. But hear me out.They sound great. They're comfortable. They fold up so they're easy to carry around. They're wireless, so you can sync them via bluetooth to your various devices (I've yet to get these to sync wirelessly with my Windows 8.1 desktop, personally I blame that problem on my crappy Chinese bluetooth adapter)Sure there are better sounding headphones for the same price. But I didn't buy these to be absolutely blown away by the sound. I bought these because not only do they sound good, but they look good and they're comfortable. If you can find them cheaper than retail, I say go for it.

p1732
sg5
VDo not buy if you want the bluetooth to work. Brand new out of the box, the sound in one ear using bluetooth is completely muffled and distorted. I thought maybe it was the song or something until I plugged them into my laptop and the sound was balanced in both ears (and i did a quick google search to find that many people have experienced the same issue. So i thought, maybe it is my computer's bluetooth. but I connected the headphones to my iPhone through bluetooth and the sound was again muffled in the right ear. I would STRONGLY suggest spending your $300 elsewhere. I specifically sent my working "non-wireless" beats back because I figured it would be worth the  extra money to have the wireless feature. terrible idea. now I have to adjust the sound when they are connected through bluetooth and again if I want to use them plugged in normally.

Only issue is the cusion on top isnt glued on right. Im just gonna keep this one since i think its the best ill get.Update 3: the cushion is getting worst, its already starting to get undone as pictured.

VVery balanced sound compared to previous generation of Beats Studio (I own that as well). Wireless battery life could be improved.Battery: Gave me 12 hours (I'm a heavy listener).Though USB charging is a bliss.You can even use it when its charging. Charging is pretty quick. One hour.It seems to consume more power on standby, power management on standby could be improved.Connectivity: Quickly connects to Bluetooth clients. Sound quality is superior when using Bluetooth 4.0.(May be that is due to a fact that it uses a better compression method - aptX which gives you CD like quality over bluetooth) More refined product than previous generation.Neat punch of bass, better clarity and definitely an improvement on mids and highs. Great wireless headphones to get.Build quality is excellent.

VSolid Bluetooth Headphones!!!
p1756
sg5
VI really like these headphones, I listened to them first at a best buy and though I liked them then I didn't feel they were worth 379.99 after all they are made of pretty much plastic!,  When I seen them on amazon for 264.99 which imo is a little more reasonable for what you get it was a no brainer!, the bluetooth is great I dont notice any significant sound quality difference between wired and bluetooth, the battery life is great and the sound is what you would expect from beats, also the noise cancellation is great, it doesn't cancel everything but Its enough that if you are listening to music the background noise will go unnoticed...... Overall Im satisfied..... My only gripe is for a headphone that is advertised at 379.99 retail, I would think they would make them with a better quality material to give them a more premium feel.....

p1762
sg5
VI debated for months about buying these headphones; I had owned the original studios in shiny black for 2.5 years which I loved but was aware of the negatives (burning through batteries, massive noise leak, mediocre comfort, finger prints).These wireless studios (no longer associated with Monster) are a major step forward in almost every way. A sleeker look, additional on ear controls, rechargeable battery, Bluetooth range, reduced leakage...while maintaining the audio performance I've enjoyed the past years.Being able to seamlessly pair the beats to your iPhone and stream Spotify while walking between rooms is completely unnecessary...but will likely result in an involuntary smile. A brand such as Beats will always have negativity directed at it....put the headphones on and listen to the haters fade out.

VFYI: Having LOW VOLUME can be adjusted by pressing up and down on the left side of the "B" logo. I was about to return this because the volume wasn't high enough but I found the solution from another forum.PROS- Wireless. Works flawlessly with my LG G3- Sounds really good for blue booth wireless. Has better bass then my wired Studio Beats.- Option of having wireless or wired- Can control volume, pause, skip, forward and rewind through the left side of the headphones that have the "B" logo.- Extremely Comfortable. Bose QC 25 has the Slight edge but other then that no one comes close for comfort.- Noise CancelingCON- Bose QC 20's, Audiotechnica m50x and other similar headphones have better sound quality but not its that far off. This is wireless !- Price. On sale at Target for less then $300 with a red card.

VWas worried that I'd have some connectivity issue since I'm not an Apple user. I have a Dell XPS 13 (2015) and Note 4 and haven't had any issues at all. Connecting to my Note 4 via bluetooth was simple. Not a problem whatsoever. Getting the headphones to connect to my Dell XPS 13 was a little frustrating at first and after about an hour of frustration I realized I hadn't ran the most recent updates for my computer yet. After running the update everything connected perfectly and haven't had an issue yet.I know Beats aren't necessarily the best sounding headphones but I love them. The fact they are wireless is perfect. The battery life is pretty good. I charge them about every 4 days and use them fairly often throughout the day.The thing about these Beats headphones is that they are extremely comfortable.

VFairly good sound (bass heavy as we all know Beats are). The noise cancellation(ANC)  is the best I have seen in wireless. To compare, I have the Denon AH-GC20 (great sound and comfort, terrible ANC). I also have a pair of wired OPPO's which are incredible sounding and the most comfortable headphones I have but they aren't wireless and lack ANC. By far the best noise cancellation are my QC20 headphones. They are simply incredible and I won't travel without them but they are wired. The one thing that made these a three star instead of a four star is the comfort. They hurt the top of my head. I really wish they were more comfortable and I would keep them. The bluetooth was ok unless I was talking on the phone with them. Then, for some reason, they had issues. Might be my phone so I wouldn't hold it against the Beats just yet.

VI bought these headphones about six months ago and I keep them at my work (a desk job).I have two cracks right above the ear pieces (one on each side of the headphones). One side's is larger than the others. The plastic is so low quality on these headphones that they crack just from putting them on and taking them off of your head. I think I might have accidentally "dropped" them 1 1/2 - 2 feet onto the ground (from my chair) one or two times. Either way, I watched the cracks start from the tiny stress marks on the headphones to full-on cracks just from every day use.P.S. I tried sending them back into Apple and get them fixed under the warranty. Apple claimed that the damage to my headphones isn't accidental and that they won't repair them under the warranty.

VUPDATE:So after do a little research I found out if you have a computer (yes an actual computer and not a tablet) you can actually hook up your headphones to your computer via USB and download the Beats Updater and update to the newest firmware and it should fix the issue.  In the Beats instructions they mention nothing of this and who would have thought you would ever need to update your headphones.  At any rate, the headphones are now staying connected and now I would recommend these for people to buy even with the pricy price tag.https://www.beatsbydre.com/support/how-to/firmware-updates-beats-updater.htmlOriginal Review:I wish there was a star less than one.  I would save your money.  These headphone are pretty expense and for that they should work.  The wireless is disconnecting from my iPhone non-stop.  I went on the Beats webpage to trouble shoot and they said simply just to reset the headphones.  Well that is all good, but you have to do it all the time.  I can't believe Apple would even sell this product since it doesn't work well with their products.  For almost $400 these headphone should at the very least be able to stay connected to your device.  I was actually surprised by some of the high reviews.  I'm guessing people spent a ton of money on the headphones and were too embarrassed to say they were crap, much like the people who buy Dyson vacuum cleaners.  Save your money!!

It seems that this brand has been hit or miss and it is a shame; the sound quality is decent and they always look very nice.I could rate them on looks it would be a 5.I WILL NOT be buying another set of beats over-ear headphones.

VWhile it'll cost you a hefty $300+, the Beats Studio Wireless is an excellent wireless Bluetooth headphone.THE GOOD:The Beats Studio Wireless is a very comfortable over-the-ear wireless headphone that offers excellent sound for a Bluetooth headphone and features active noise-canceling technology. The headphones fold up into a more compact form factor and battery life is decent at 12 hours of wireless listening. They also worked well as a wireless headset for making cell-phone calls.THE BAD:Expensive; if the integrated rechargeable battery dies, the music dies.On style and performance I would compare to these version of Sennheiser's before deciding found here: http://amzn.to/1CmKWw1

VI'm typically not a fan of beats their headphones tend to have way too much low end for my taste.  All my other headphones are sennherisers which I definitely prefer as far as sound.  But after trying a friend's studio wireless headphones on a couple of long plane trips, I have to say that I'm liking these.  The batter lasts a long time, the noise cancellation works well, and after EQing my iPhone to lower the bass, I'm liking how these sound.  Plus, the matte black doesn't scream out "look at me" like the rest of their lineup.  Overall, I think they're great headphones and as far as bluetooth wireless goes, I actually prefer these over the sennheriser MM-450 X lineup.  Each has their advantage, but I like these better.

PowerBeats failed after one month.Beats... Now that you are owned by apple you need to get on the stick.  For approximately $400 you need to fix your charging mechanisms. This is ridiculous...Love your products, but the quality (specifically related to charging) just isn't there.  This and the PowerBeats are probably the last beats products I'll purchase.

I paid for the "warehouse deals" $288 and I think that is a very fair price for the headset. It came brand new in original packaging. I'd say the original price for the them is quite steep IMO you could get wireless Bose for $250 and they are good quality headphones but if you're looking specifically for Beats and don't mind the price tag then you won't be disappointed.

p1882

VI wanted these because they are wireless and too large for me to lose. The only problem is that the headphones seem to disconnect from my phone often and I'm not sure why. Initially I thought they were dying but I have since learned how to check the headphone battery percentage on my phone and that is not the problem. Sometimes when I attempt to skip a track the headphones will actually turn off. Normally I can just turn them back on and keep going but I for the price of these headphones I have higher expectations. If I had paid $60 I would probably be more willing to let the disconnecting issue slide. I did purchase the warranty and will update the post once I have filed a claim with them.

VThese headphone are by far the best wireless headphones I've ever used. The connection stays strong and you can feel the bass but if you like something like pop it's also quiet good at that. It's noise canceling in and mode can block out surrounding noise such as a TV but when people are talking you can hear them. If you were looking for noise cancelation then go buy a pair of qc25. The build quality is okay but sometimes it feels cheap and flimsy, almost as if you could break it by adjusting the the cups. The comfortablity is great. At around 264 instead of the 379 retail price this seems like a steal. You cannot use it without the battery which means if the battery dies so does the music.

VGot this as a gift for Christmas. They are really nice to look. Very well made product over all. I travel to work by public transport so I end up spending almost an hour each way. Regular headphones cannot prevent all the extra noise and I end up keep the volume to max. But these headphones have decent noise cancellation. I was able to watch netflix and listen to music even in a tunnel. Sound quality even on bluetooth is amazing.The only minus point for me was the comfort (or discomfort) while wearing them. After using them for less than an hour I would get a headache. I like to work while listening to music so having a headphone that would not hurt my head is a definite plus.

VI feel proud of it when i am using it. It looks extremely magnificent and is comfortable(I can wear it for couple hours(until the battery dies) just with a little bit pain). You dont need extra AA or AAA battery, charge it full which takes 1 hour and you are good to go. The connection does a fine job.BUT, the buttons are kind of confusing. I dont know which one is the switch and the other is what.I am quite sensitive about the sound quality but I still cant say THE BEATS does an extraordinary job to improve that(perhaps it is none of the headphone business but the tracks). It is better than any headphone i have ever used.JUST ONE MORE THING TO IMPROVE IS THE PRIZE.

Vabsolutely love these headphones. i lost my matte black ones in the airport recently and was really disappointed. i re ordered them in the titanium color 3 days later. i had paid full price for my first pair. the titanium ones are only $229 which is a great deal for these. awesome sound quality, comfortable fit, great battery life, and if you take care of them, they will last. the people who complain and post pics of their broken headphones were probably careless with them. it should also be noted that these are not good for the gym. sweat will dry out the earpad covers and eventually they will rip/crack.

VI just got this yesterday and so far I love it for being wire free. The sound is good and clean, and the bass is just right. But I think I prefer the sound and look from the Beat Pro. I got the Matt Black which is 40$ cheaper in Target and looks less fleshy which I prefer.it appears there are some humm now and then from the noise canceling (with or without music playing) when I was walking in the mall which drove me crazy. But it was dead quiet at home. Hence the 4 stars.It is a bit tight and uncomfortable for wearing long period of time (over 30mins). with that said, I may return it and get the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless (which is 200$US more.)

VPlays deep bass and has extremely clear high ends. You'll end up hearing things in songs that you've heard a thousand times that you didn't even know were there. I'm no music buff, but I do like my stuff to sound good. These deliver. The wireless connection to my phone is worth every penny. I use these when I'm doing chores like vacuuming or dishes. I use them while I mow the lawn, and trim the sidewalk and weeds. About the only thing I haven't tried using them for is shooting muffs, although I have thought about trying it. The noise canceling feature makes it a great tool to use for much more than just sitting at your computer, it makes doing chores less of a chore!

VI just exchanged my second pair of Beats. Same problem both times: the lining came apart from the foam. Infuriating. Especially in light of the fact that I did not travel with them, did not walk around with them, and only used them while sitting down and in conjunction with my desktop; not harshly treated at all. Another issue I had was that the mini-USB charging cable had to find an extremely small sweet spot in order to charge. I also did not like how they fit, though I suppose that's a subjective problem that not everyone will have. And finally, there is a ridiculously small number of features compared to other models. Look elsewhere, you can do much better.

VI know Beats has been getting a bad rap lately, but these headphones are GREAT! I can hear everything in the music, and the sound is fantastic. The wireless tech is to die for, I absolutely hate wires and eliminating one and keeping the quality high gets my thumbs up. The headphones are super lightweight and very comfortable (given you don't wear them for longer than 3 hours at a time), and you have no worries of them falling off your head! Absolutely great! And I play my music at a decent volume (and have had trouble in the past with headphones leaking noise), these Studios have little to no leakage of noise! It's brilliant! Would completely recommend! Cheers!

I can not comment on that but i tested Bose once as well somehow piece which was there on display was not good on Bose.Overall this is good, some things which i want beat to improve is- Weight- Bluetooth connectivity between multiple devicesOverall i am satisfied with the product so far.

Yes it is a fashion statement and yes it is expensive but consider all the expensive crap people buy like Louis bags or Gucci shoes and they are not the BEST product for performance in any facets but they know they are paying for the brand name.  The product itself performs admirably as I own a bunch of bluetooth headsets and this new version is much sturdier than their 1.0 version.  If you gotta the cash to drop, dont regret buying an ugly headset you hate wearing, just buy a nice one

Flying sucks and these actually make it fine, in fact they make it relaxing (once on the plane). You can't hear a kid or any talking. Wireless works perfectly, they are comfortable and they sound great. The battery has never come close to dying and they fold into a nice solid case.One thing, keep an eye open while on the plane. They block out nose so well you may miss the beverage service.I bought titanium. Clearly the best color.

These really also look great with the matte black colour I am always getting compliments about them. The battery is great unless you are going on a 13 hour flight but even then you can just use the included audio cable. These truly are the perfect wireless headphone.

From all my searching I did NOT want to buy a Beats product, but through my search I could not find a product that met my specifications as well as this one. This is absolutely the perfect gym headphone! I can do muscle ups with no movement of the cans on my head, I can blast music at full volume without affecting anyone, I can go several days without charge, and not having to deal with wires is a gamechanger. 9/10

VThe Beats Studio Wireless headphones are totally overrated.  I purchased the Sony MDR-ZX770BN headphones from Costco, and order the Beats Studio Wireless headphones from Amazon for side-by-side comparison.  I had no problem with paying more for better quality.  Needless to say, I kept the Sony because it is indeed the superior BT headphone.The build quality of the Sony and Beats is about the same. However,  the Sony MDR-ZX770BN is much better in terms of sound quality, weight, and fit.  In fact, my fiends that tried the two headphones side-by-side also ended up purchased the Sony headphone.

V3 stars only because the noise cancellation is weak at best. Sound quality is very good. Very comfortable to wear.I can tell that it works because if I remove the headphones is obvious that there is some amount of noise cancellation. In my situation there is the noise from the AC vents and it cancels that noise  but people talking normal volume levels a few feet away are not cancelled out at all and actually seem to be heard as good as if I was not wearing Them. Sound quality is very good but Bluetooth does create a small amount of "noise", but it is not audible when the music is playing.

VThe sound is very clear and they sound great i was impressed at first BUT they do distort sometimes when you turn them up which is a bit disappointing, besides that these are worth the $265 not only because of sound but these days you are considered "cool" just for being seen with them. One interesting thing that i noticed is that they sound EVEN BETTER through bluetooth than the wired connection which is a pleasant surprise. Only thing in question for me will be how long they will last because I've only had them for a month. Had a small issue with connection dropping to my macbook and iPhone 6 when i first used the headphones then i realized that you can update the software on the headphones and the connection hasn't dropped since. There are cheaper headphones that sound just as good or better BUT they aren't BEATS so of coarse u get no cool points for owning them so these do good across the board.

VIt looks beautiful. The matte black version is a major go. The box presentation that the product came in was very high quality, similar to that of an apple product (as Beats is now owned by Apple it is, in a way, an apple product). The sound quality is amazing. The base is very loud and thumping, as well as the mid-and high range sounds. The fit is very comfortable. The price is a little hefty but when you're going for electronic products, you can't expect to pay less and get the same quality product as this. The branding of the beats is minimalistic and beautiful. Love it.

VI thought that the dedicated ANC hurt the sound quality more than it helped the listening experience.Also, headphones were really uncomfortable. The fit of the headphones was really tight, putting way too much pressure on the sides and top of the head. Unfortunately in my case, adjusting them didn't help. Ultimately the poor fit was the biggest reason why I was unsatisfied with them and returned them.I'd recommend trying them on in-store, to see how they fit. Also, wear them for more than a few seconds -- ideally, for a good few minutes.

The noise cancelling is pretty cool, I find it handy when all of the kids are in the room with me.  The are a little heavy, and would probably be a little uncomfortable with extended wear.

VSound quality is great, especially if you like some bass.  The finish is nice, and the white battery gauge LEDs look great with the color as well.  As others have mentioned, the ear pads feel cheap - cheaper than any other premium headphones I've owned (Bose, Nokia/Monster).  The noise cancellation has a bit of a hiss - especially when it's quiet.  Overall, it's a nice looking and sounding set of headphones, but it also gives me greater appreciation for the quality of noise cancellation of the Bose QC15s I have at work.

I could be playing music loudly and still hear the vent in my office, same thing with the fan in my bedroom.  I would also distinctly hear people talking over the audio I was listening to.  I was pretty bummed that I had to return them

VDefinitely worth the money. By far the best headphones of the entire beats line up to date and the Bluetooth capability is just an added bonus. Everyone knows these headphones aren't the best for sound quality according to the average audiophile. Good thing most people aren't audiophiles(insert sarcasm). But for the average consumer just looking for good sound quality, good overall construction, durability, comfort, ANC, Bluetooth capability and last but not least "LOOKS" these are the headphones for you.

VThe quality is fantastic, unlike 50 Cent's SMS of which I own 2 sets Beats are more comfortable and fully surround your ears. Beats are not as loud but overall sound quality is unparalleled. Beats also cancels out noise better than SMS. The other major advantage is Beats uses Bluetooth eliminating the need for a dongle that on one of my SMS sets is spotty in transmission. Two good products but I highly recommend Beats over anything out there! I'm going to purchase another set soon. Love these Beats wireless!

VThese headphones are amazing! The sound quality is incredible and the bass is very strong. These headphones are meant for music but they can be used for pc gaming if you want! The headphones are more meant for indoor use due to their size, but they can be used for plane trips, car rides etc. If you want indestructible or very strong headphones for rough use, like for listening to music on construction sites or related then these aren't for you. Overall I like these headphones and am enjoying them everyday.

VGreat quality beats headphones as is quite known. Very comfortable and easy to use. Slight problems I faced were, if you are playing a video stream on you laptop for example and you have connected your headphones via bluetooth, if there is a delay in the video and it stops and starts several times, the bluetooth connection with the headphones will be lost. Overall though, the bluetooth option gives you great freedom to walk around the room or the net room while listening to your music, movie or audiobook.

The moment I put them on & heard my music through them I knew that I did not want to use another pair of headphones except for these. I've bought many headphones in the past but they cannot compare to these. Through my review I can sincerely say, beats has to be the best headphones you can use to listen to music.

VThe sound quality is great!  The biggest reason these where bought is for the noise canceling feature.  They are NOT noise canceling.  They only muffle out sound.  You can hear all outside sound, which is very disappointing given the extreme cost of this product.  We thought our first pair which was bought at Christmas was defective in some way and sent them back for a replacement pair.  Second pair that was received was exactly the same.  I feel the item description should be changed.

True Bass, Treble, comfortable, built sturdy, easy user friendly controls  and quiet signal with effective noise reduction here sound better than Bose Bluetooth (cheap materials) headphones. Expensive but at 264.00 it's a great headphone for Bluetooth listening or wired. I pair with Apple TV gen 4 and IPhone 6 and they sound great . True bass not overdone . Buy em!

Beats noise canceling is bad.  It was like putting your hands over your ears.  I returned these and ordered my 2nd pair of Bose QueitComfort 20i.  Read the reviews on the internet and trust them.  Beats has brand recognition, but if you are looking for noise canceling - Bose are the only way to go.

Obviously they're good headphones because of the majority of the reviews being good. Just got tired of trying to find a good pair.  Very glad Amazon has such a good return/refund policy.

Comfort wise they are great, the wireless option works well too. All in all, not the best purchase but if you want comfort and decent audio quality.. I guess these work fine.

p2212

VAfter a few weeks of use, I am incredibly impressed with these headphones. I've had two pairs of Beats in the past, both of which I returned due to the poor sound quality. The balance, clarity and mix in these headphones really is fantastic - gone are the bass-heavy days of old, with much clearer highs and mids. The only slight disappointment (and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5) is the noise-cancelling - if that's what you are after, I would stick with Bose.

VI love the style of the headphones, personally I think they are the best looking on the market. They sound very good when used wirelessly, obviously beats aren't renowned for the greatest sounding headphones. Strangely they are not very loud or as good sound quality when using a  wired connection, this is extremely disappointing. Because the wireless sound is so much better I find the battery life to be terrible as you're constantly using the Bluetooth connection.

My head isn't tiny and I also have bad sensory issues and couldn't wear them for long periods of time. The top of my head would start to hurt and so would my ears. I tried stretching them out, and that worked for awhile, but now one side doesn't produce sound. So if you have sensory issues, I would look for something else.

I keep bluetooth on so that whenever I want to listen to music, I just turn on the beats and they connect. The distance you can be from the device is about 5 feet before it starts cutting up and disconnecting, but if you have an iPod or your phone, you can just put it in your pocket and not worry about it.

I haven't been able to wear them more than once since he keeps them with him all of the time, but they did sound great. Love the bass levels in them. Nice and clear. Bluetooth cuts in and out randomly (hence the 4 stars and not 5), but overall not a major issue.

VMy dad and I have a pair of these. they were gifts to the both of us. I have matte black and he has red.These can typically last me about 3- 90/120 minute workout sessions without needing to be recharged. They are comfortable and I can wear them with my earrings. the foam around the ears though could use a little bit more clearance because sometimes the drivers are directly touching my ears and it can hurt

VLoved the sound quality. With iPhone Bluetooth sound great but with Samsung you need to use the cord to get the best quality in sound. Body is just fine but I think I have to be careful as it feels fragile. Case which comes with it looks kind of cute . Overall the price of $279 will be worth  if it works well for 365 days. Which is spending less then $1 a day for music and sound for me makes it worth the price.

I was able to get a hold of apple and they walked me through on how to update the firmware on my headphones.

VThough I think the Harman Kardon BT headphones are just a smidge better in sound. The Beats Studio Wireless 2nd generation are really good. They have a accurate sound and aren't as bass heavy as the first generation. The active noise cancelling is also a plus. I would give them five stars but for the price, I can only give four. You can find just as decent sounding bluetooth headphones for less.

VI purchased these wireless headphones for overseas flights. They did the job in noise cancellation. The sound quality is great, as well. The bass highlights the type of music to which I typically listen. However, I got these on a great sale ( $100 discount for grey/titanium color) and would not have paid full priced for these, as there are likely better quality headphones in that price range.

VI like the headphones. They look and feel good. The sound is good and all of the features are very simple to use. The only reason I am not giving them 5-stars is because the padding compresses down most of the way and your ears will be pressed in (I have very small ears, and even they get smashed) by the padding, causing soreness and discomfort after 30-45 minutes of continued use.

p2548
sg5
VI bought these primarily to use with WebEx and Skype calls at my home office. Secondarily, I was hoping to use these as replacements for my Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones during airline flights (I liked the idea of not needing a cord on the occasions I might also want to listen to music during the flight -- Bose still doesn't have a wireless option on their sound-cancelling headphones).The Good:* Great wireless range. I can walk anywhere in the office during calls while maintaining a great connection.* The sound cancellation doesn't create the "stuffy ears" effect that the Bose headphones do.* The sound quality when listening to music is superb. I understand previous Beats headphones overemphasized bass notes.* In my quiet office, the microphone works well -- sounds great to my callers.The Bad:* The headphones are essentially unusable on planes. Though the sound cancelling works OK on low notes, it seems to actually amplify higher frequency sounds. It creates a continuous, loud, and harsh rasping sound that is worse than not having them on at all. In contrast, the Bose headphones greatly reduces background noise on planes (that is why half the people in First Class seem to be wearing them).* The headphone produces a background hiss, very noticeable in a quiet area though certainly not noticeable when listening to music.* The headband is very tight, not so much as to induce a headache, but enough to make one wish there was some way to reduce the tension. Still, the headphones are pretty comfortable, just not as comfortable as the Bose.Bottom line: These work well for the primary intended purpose of a wireless headset for calling at my desk. For flights, I took them on one cross-country flight but quickly went back to the Bose.

VBefore I really begin, why are people giving these headphones such good ratings?!I'm was definitely in the market in search of beautiful sounding headphones which a satisfying bass sound to listen to at night and awesome sounding headphones to use for gaming on my PS4. After seeing a lot of good reviews about these Studio Wireless Beats I really thought that Beats might've changed and gotten better plus I love the way the Matte Black looks so I figured why not. I knew that I was paying too much already but I really wanted to spoil myself on headphones that people say sound really great and I wanted the stylish look.PROS:- I really enjoyed the packaging, I'd give them that. The way it's packaged reminds you of the way Apple products are boxed. Presentation of the product is very well.- Given accessories are really nice looking and there was a generous amount of accesses given as well (Charger, USB Cable, Headphone Cable, Headphone w/ Microphone Cable, Cleaning Cloth, Stickers, etc.)- The Beats Headphones itself are really beautiful and you fall in love with the design immediately with that Matte Black finish.- Better than Average sounding headphones but read the cons section for some explanation.and that's pretty much it... not to the part that really matters....CONS:- Like I said above, the headphones sound better than average but there is absolutely no "WOW" factor, especially when you think about how much money these things cost. I was so disappointed. I even gave the headphones a little bit of time for them to burn in and the quality is just what... maybe 5x better than skull candies? These headphones are unfortunately extremely overpriced and overhyped, I just can't explain my big disappointment for these headphones.- Bass is disappointingly low and messing around with EQ rather makes it a worse experience no matter if you're connected via Bluetooth or Direct Wire. Mids and Highs are there but sounds a bit muddy...- Battery Life is TERRIBLE- Slow Bluetooth Performance- Slight Music Leak- Uncomfortable... The headphones fit too tightly on my head and I'm pretty average I guess you can say. They just start hurting your ears after about 20-30 minutes of listening.I'm really not trying to be a hater or anything and I'm really thinking basic about these headphones meaning, I'm not stuck in audiophile mode or anything like that. You're honestly going to be paying too much money because of the way it looks and because of the brand name. I return these beautiful looking but terrible sounding headphones for Sony MDRXB950BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headset that came out I think either October or September of this year (2014). Guys.... trust me when I tell you that you won't be disappointed with the Sony MDRXB950BT/B. Just check it out on Amazon and see for yourself. Much cheaper, offers better quality sound and comfort, you'll thank me later.

VI purchased these in May 2014, they sound, they work fine, a little problematical at times connecting to blue tooth.  My biggest complaint is the construction, the plastic sliders on both sides have large cracks, and had to be taped to keep them from falling apart.  Given the cost the fit and finish should substantially better.  No more beats for me.

Comparable to any headphones on the market. The only complaint is the controls are so discreet, they can be awkward to get familiar with.

VMy 1st pair of Beats headphones
p2602
sg5
VOnly one day with these headphones and so far i'm impressed.  I'm a techie, so wasn't difficult figuring out how to turn them on and pair with my macbook and iphone.  Now for the sound...i'm not an audiophile, but thought the music was sharp and crisp, and the bass was not overpowering, but I was only listening for a few hours.  Although not noise canceling, they seem to do a pretty good job blocking out the sound around, but I could still hear a little of what was going on, mostly because I didn't have the volume jacked up in the headphones.  I purchased this for an upcoming trip where i plan to use them quite frequently.  Based on that trip I will update my review and add in what the battery life is like, and the call quality when using the supplied cord with mic.

VGood headphones
p2667
sg5
VThe headphones are good, pricey yes but not a whole lot of over ear wireless headphones out there that aren't pricey. The sound is slightly above average, could be better if the bass wasn't so over emphasized. The range is pretty good, I can set my phone down in the gym and not lose the signal almost 30 feet away. Pairing it with my phone was painless, however pairing with my laptop (Windows 7) was not. This isn't a knock against these headphones I assume any Bluetooth headphones would need to overcome this challenge. They are very comfortable, they feel sturdy, and the carrying case is a good thing to have. Prior to these I had a pair of wired Audio Technica MH50 and they had awesome sound. But they were bigger, hotter on my head, and obviously wired. If I didn't get these then I would have gotten a pair of Parrot Zik's and they are close to the same price range.

VI have read reviews about the sound of these.  Yes, they tune up the base and the high end is slightly unrefined, but overall I like them.  When you factor in the bluetooth plus these are matte black (and not the previous crazy colors), plus I purchased these to replace a set of Bose QC1 (yes, QC1) that were killing my ears - these are great.  I just can't see how they're charging so much for these, but since I cashed in over $300 in gift cards, these were a great value.

p2721

VGreat Headphones! First of all when you read reviews from numerous different people, you get numerous different opinions. Of course, everyone has their own opinion. Audiophiles rant about a headphone which does all frequencies perfectly. Honestly, the headphones recommended by audiophiles, sound flat to me. I listen to bass heavy music. I tried Bose QC15 which are considered one of the best sounding in the class. They sounded great and hit every note perfectly, but were not designed for the genre of music I listen to. I like the Beats Studios because they can do bass heavy music as well as other genres, just as well. Thats thanks to the reengineering of these headphones. Sounds nothing like my previous monster beats studios. These are much more clear and their is no bass muffling. Noise canceling is pretty good too. Construction is solid. Easy to Use. Wireless is seamless. Nothing like them on the market in the same price range. Buy and enjoy.

They do sound great but they look pretty amazing.ProsSound - Great,Battery - I use very frequently, almost on a daily basis, the battery last a good while and fully charges from empty within an hourLook - Well of courseDurability - I have only had them for a month, but I use them frequently and kids are always grabbing at them.Usability - I use my phone on bluetooth to listen to music, I can also take phone calls with it without the extra adapter. Also works with PS3/4 gaming.ConsColor - The material on the over the speakers can get dirty really easily if you are not careful. It is difficult to get out.Sound - (also a pro) at a reasonable volume, you can't here the world around you and get yourself hurt. So use discretion when drowning out the world. You may miss a fire alarm or a car's horn.

I do have a few complaints, they are very bass heavy, I've heard they are but had never tried a pair until this. and they squeeze my head a little, its just a slight pressure that hurts over time. i can wear them for a while before i have to take them off to relieve the pressure, on the plus side, they don't slip off your head easily. other than that, Love em!

The freedom that comes with these, along with the superb audio quality and exceptional comfort makes them worth every single penny in my book!

VBest beats ever made ! Way better than my Beats Pro plus it's wireless :D. Im in LOVE :) THANKS !-Updated Dec. 13,2014-Disappointed .... After 6 months of usage ...Ear cups open by themselves showing the cushion inside. I HARDLY use this headphones because I didn't want it to get messed up and even doing so, the ear cups still get messed up and my ears are small. Waste of my money !And the bluetooth sometimes shutters ... Or the audio jumps sometimes while listening.For this price you shouldn't be having these problems.I'm finished with beats.Those people saying for the price you shouldn't get this product were right. I wish I had listen.This is my second and last beats.

p2877

VI picked up the Matte Black Beats and my local Best Buy and I have to say that they are very classy...  Using the words classy and beats in the same sentence...  That is something that I never thought I'd say.I have tried and owned more than a few audiophile headphones.  From Sennheiser and Sony to Audio Technica.  I'd like to think I have a good understanding of what Hi-Fi audio is and I must say the Beats don't disappoint.  I also owned the Beats Solo HD Wireless before hand.These headphones should not be used as monitors.  They do not represent accurate audio what so ever.  They're exciting and dynamic.  The bass thumps and the mids come in fairly clear.  I would say that in comparison to other Hi-Fi gear, they would be very competitive around the $200 sector.  The value isn't there when compared to the other products you can get at the price range, but Beats demand a higher premium due to their marketing.With that said, they're very convenient and the build quality is excellent.  The headband and synthetic leather padding have a very premium look and feel to them.  The wireless capability is excellent and they're very fun headphones.Overall this is huge step up from the last Beats Wireless headphones that were released.  One of my favorite new features would be the battery meter on the device.  The noise cancelling seems to work well, although I'm not a huge fan of noise cancelling either way.I would have liked to see rotating cups on this design, but you can't win them all.  I would feel confident in saying these are one of the best readily available Bluetooth headphones that you can find.  The only downfall is the price.The sound quality rivals the $200-250 sector of hi-fi headphones, but the build quality and convenience of wireless bluetooth definitely warrant a premium to the overall cost.  I don't know if I agree with the $375 price tag.  Would definitely be a 5 star at $300.A great buy for me either way.  I hate having wires dangling around when I'm at the gym, and these are pure convenience and class.  They are comfortable and stay on my head without any issues even during running.

VI like these as they look good, have good sound/base, are comfortable and NC is very good.Sure, there are better headphones for NC (bose), sound quality (senns), etc, but these combine the qualities of all which no one else does.My main requirements were NC headphones that were wireless and the options out there are scarce. The sennheisers cost a lot more, and bose wireless ones have to use batteries which I find less user friendly.I am not a pure audio-phile - just your average person that likes to listen to mixture of hip hop, rnb and pop. I think for my requirements, they are currently the best out there that ticks all the boxes.

VEven Better than Beats Studio 2013!
p2894
sg5
VBeats claims, "Music as the artist intended," and "You're not hearing all the music.." This leads me to expect that I will make new discoveries in familiar music when I listen through Beats headphones.I indeed have heard new things in old music with Beats, listening to songs I have listened to DOZENS of times on my other headphones (Sennheiser HD 598, Parrot Zik, Apple In-Ear (their best), Klipsch s4i, and others). In about 25% of familiar songs I hear something new with Beats, spanning genres of classical, hip hop, electronic, and others.I take this to mean that the headphone sound quality is at least comparable or perhaps better than these other headphones. It is also much better than that of the original Beats Studio. The headphones are my most comfortable and are awesome at noise cancellation. While being large enough to be "over ear," they are small enough to be light and comfortable and do not fall off your head when doing such repetitive motions as scrubbing or vacuuming.I also have the Beats Studio 2013, which are the same as these but without the Bluetooth wireless capability. Sound quality and fit of the Studio 2013 and this Studio Wireless 2013 are identical.  As regard to fashion, the contrasting wire on the Beats Studio is an attractive touch, but on these, there is no need for a wire (though they supply one that can be used instead of the wireless Bluetooth).As compared with my Sennheiser HD 598, also here on Amazon for about $187, the Sennheisers have larger earpieces, which means they fully encircle your ears, while these actually touch the edges of your ear as they encircle them.  The sound of these has more bass but less definition... for example, a bass drum on these will sound louder, but the Sennheisers will preserve the "twang" of the drumhead. Sounds on these headphones seem as if they are coming through the softness of a felt cover, while with the Sennheiser, more as if they are coming through a window... more detail, but still a veil over the source.These effects are consistent with the frequency response of the two headphones, as shown in the Data Sheet Download section of the website innerfidelity.com.  The Beats Studio have their highest frequency sensitivity at about 30 Hz, while the peak of the Sennheisers is around 120 Hz.  Likewise, the response of the Beats Studio trails away above 10 KHz more qulckly than the Sennheiser's.I can compare these to my Parrot Zik noise cancelling wireless headphones as well. Like these, the Zik also has a smaller ear opening so it touches the rim of my ear.  The Zik sounds slightly better, with a bit more "transparency"  (not felt over the speakers like the Beats, and not a clear window like the Sennheisers, but perhaps a thin cloth).  The Ziks are heavier, tending to shift and actually once falling off during the motion of moderate housework (vacuuming, specifically).  The Zik, of course, has an iPod app that allows setting reverberation, size of sound stage, and equalization profile, that these do not have.These headphones have turned me into an aficionado of both hip hop music and Beats products. I have purchased both the wireless and wired version of these Beats Studio headphones as well as the Beats Pro headphones, taking advantage of the "Buy 2 Beats for 10% off" special that Amazon (and Beats) had.  I have also purchased the Beats premium audio in my new FIAT Abarth (fabulous!) and am subscribed to the new Beats Music streaming service.Value:  3/5Audio Quality:  4/5Design: 4/5Comfort: 5/5

Vi've owned a series of headphones prior to this ranging from 100-400.  the main complaint i see is the bass, or lack thereof and the "hissing" you hear when no music is playing.  i'll start with the hissing:  the hiss is there, yes, but you can only hear the hiss if you're standing absolutely still with no music playing.  if you play anything, even talk radio, the hiss disappears.  also, i'll mention the hiss itself is so light it does not bother me at all.  now i don't know about you but if these headphones are on, something always playing.  you'll never find me walking around with headphones on for the sake of walking around with headphones on.secondly, the bass:  yes the bass is definitely a reduction from the previous beats studios; however in return you get a much more "rich" music experience.  it's not like the bass is nonexistent.  it's definitely there, just not nearly as aggressive as its predecessor. lastly, there are apps out there (at least for the iOS iphone 5, not sure about android or other devices) in which you can adjust the equalizer.  i use spotify and there's an app i use to adjust the EQ whenever i feel like i need/want that extra bump.  the iphone's integrated equalizer sucks so an equalizer app is nice if you want to adjust settings to your liking and get the most out of these headsets.all you whiney QQer's out there, go buy your skull candy garbage headphones and listen to your muddy music. i'm sticking to these for awhile.  ;D

p2930
sg5
VI was hesitant in purchasing this because of the price (definitely the most money I've spent on a pair of headphones), but it's one of the best sounding headphones I've ever owned (wireless or otherwise). I charged this unit only for a few hours for a full charge, been using it for more than a day and I still have a charge.The overall sound quality is great, the highs are not too pronounced, the mid's are good and the low's are just right and not overpowering.The volume controls are easy to access, in addition to the other buttons.  You can also use the included wires to plug this in, the micro-USB cable is standard, I can either use the included charger or simply plug it in to any USB (like my Macbook Pro or my Windows laptop). The wireless range is about 25-30 feet, then past that, you'll hear some crackling, which was expected. The over the ear cups are very comfortable, you really get what you pay for, so while the price is a little much, I figured if I'm going to own a good pair, might as well pay for it.

VThe New Beats Studio Wireless Headphones have finally got it right!
p2959
sg5
VBeyond just having the hype or image of just the Beats branding, these headphones are actually finally worth the price as far as high quality audio that even meets the standards of audiophiles where the audio is not over-stylized towards bass like the previous Beats Studio Wireless headphones. Whether it's hip-hop, soundtracks, orchestral scores, alternative, and classical music all those genres of music come through with great rich clarity that one would demand for how expensive these headphones are. The accessories of the hard case (comes with hiking style key chain link too) that make the headphones easily transportable and protected versus other pairs of headphones that don't come with those important accessories make these Beats worth buying as far as preserving your investment. Headphones sound awesome whether listening in Bluetooth modes or with wired in. Definitely recommended if you're looking for high-end audio quality with some very cool style too.

VBest bluetooth headphones
p2965
sg5
VI have owned several different Beats headphones, as well as many other brands. It is difficult to find good quality bluetooth headphones. I previously used the Beats Wireless for about a year. They were too tight on my head and not comfortable for wearing more than an hour. I also tried the Logitech UE9000. They sounded good and had great build quality, but they were extremely heavy and very uncomfortable. I didn't like the idea of paying such a hefty price for the Beats Studio Wireless, but they have not disappointed.The bluetooth works flawlessly, with less drop outs than any other bluetooth headset I have used. The sound quality is great. The bass isn't too much like it can be on many other Beats products. The part that really sets this headset apart from the Beats Wireless and Logitech UE9000 is the comfort. I can wear these headphones for a long time without having to take a break. They hold a charge for several hours as well.

VExcellent sound. Heavy on the bass, but still clear on the high end. Not muddy at all. As a recording studio owner I'm a critical listener and enjoy listening to music at home on these. The added feature of noise cancellation is an excellent bonus. Only negative I've experienced is that it's sometimes difficult to pair with my devices.

VThese headphones are so great! I love that I can wear them without the cord and move about my business without any issues. The only drawback I would say they have is that sometimes connecting to my MacBook or iPad is quite difficult, it takes a couple of tries before they can connect and work but other than that I  have no complaints!

VDON'T BUY IT ! It will be very comfortable for few minutes(5-10 mins). After 5 to 10 minutes, your ears will start paining, the headset will slowly start compressing both the ears and you have to remove it to get rid of the pain. IT DOESN'T WORTH MONEY. My friend told me not to buy it, he told that you can't wear it while travelling, wearing it be will very uncomfortable after very few minutes, but I thought it will comfortable for me as I have smaller head than him. But, I regret after experiencing the real pain of wearing it.Also, never buy products from AMAZON, I guess they are big time scammers. They didn't credit my Amazon Credit Card reward points worth around $70, when I placed the order the invoice showed my Reward points in it and the Order went successful. But, the next day when I logged in to track the status, my Order was cancelled and there was a button to Retry. I clicked the retry button and then the Order was successful again, but this time invoice didn't show my reward points. I immediately called the customer care and the representative was talking nonsense and didn't understand my problem, I asked her to connect me with the Supervisor, the supervisor told me that the reward points will be Credited once the item is shipped. I believed the guy and thought the final invoice will show my reward points credited.But today, when I checked my Credit Card statement, I was SHOCKED. They charged me couple of times worth $102 for AmazonPrime membership, which I never subscribed. Also, they didn't credit my reward points and charged me the full amount of the product. I thought to return the product to get the full refund, but their return policies seems to be not customer friendly. I will call the customer care and see how I can return the product for the full refund.I don't know what prompted me to come to this STUPID website to purchase items, it's BIG NUISANCE, calling customer care multiple times and calling bank to dispute the charges etc. I should have walked in to some electronic store and purchased the item to have the peace of mind.Thanks, Lokesh.

VBetter than my Bose but a couple of issues
p3236
sg5
VThese headphones sound great and I love the wireless feature.  They work perfectly with my Mac mini, iPhone, iPad and Macbook Pro but they have a few blue tooth problems with my 3 week old Alienware 14 running Windows 7.  On the Alienware the bluetooth cuts out every so often but it seems to get better with time.  This is NOT a problem with the headphones,  They are great.  I have an older pair of Bose quite comfort headphones and side by side, the noise cancelation of the Beats is better and the sound is also much better.  I was surprised because I have been a Bose fan for years and I read some of the negative reviews about the sound quality of the Beats but for me they are perfect.  The Bose are a bit more comfortable with regard to headband on my bald head and the ear cups around my big ears but overall the Beats come out on top.  The price is a lot more than I would have liked to have paid but I know that Beats are as much a fashion / status statement as anything else.  I only wear them at home so I don't care about such things.  Still, they do look great!  I hope they last better than my Bose.  The headband on the Bose cracked after 18 months and the warranty had expired.  Every problem I've had has been related to Windows 7 and the Alienware laptop so I just wanted to mention this.  I also just purchased the new Wolfenstein game for the Alienware PC and it will NOT work with the bluetooth.  It disconnects the bluetooth connection after the initial credits and the main game menu comes up.  The Beats work fine with the wired connection.  I do not have this problem with Deus Ex or Tomb Raider so it may be an issue with Wolfenstein.  If anyone has a solution, please respond.  I'm going to contact Wolfenstein customer support and see if anyone else has experienced this.  So in summary, if you use Apple products you should be fine with the bluetooth but you may have some bluetooth cutout problems using Windows 7 and / or Alienware.

VThe battery doesn't last too long, and compared to our other (great brand) wifi headphones, it falls behind. Comparing to a second headphone (also from the other brand, non wifi), the noise canceling on the Beats is WEAK. It's almost as if there is no noise canceling. Maybe I am spoiled, but my other headphones have longer lasting battery and a ridiculous noise canceling capacity (same price range).Now, the looks are unbeatable, it is gorgeous and, for listening to music, I like it better than the other headphones I mentioned above. If I am watching a movie, the Beats doesn't necessarily stand out.My dream-come-true would be having the best of these 3 headphones combined into one, but since I haven't found that yet, I will use each one of them according to my needs. In the end, it wasn't that much worth the purchase, but I am keeping it because I need a wireless device - my old noise canceling headphone is wired and the wifi one that the battery lasts much longer is my son's.

VDrops blue tooth constantly on all apps/music but is very bad when using the beats with youtube.  Have only had them for a few days and are very unhappy with them.  They are terrible with Apple, and that is VERY bad because Apple purchased Beats and they are not very compatible.  Did the update on the Beats that was supposed to fix the problem with blue tooth dropping but then they stopped working altogether.  Got a hold of Beats direct and tried to troubleshoot them and I was told to send them back to get a return/refund or send them in for repair.  I only had them for 3 days.  Amazon is sending me a new pair now.  I will update this post as needed after I get the new ones.  New ones are here. Same issue. Will be returning them for Bose.

Vlistening to my audiobooks is just like having my own reading actress/actor next to me, and all lectures are so real, makes me feel in the auditorium while the professor is giving the course. No more wasting time. Also helps me in developing my multitask skills. Thank you kindly

VFew things that I was looking for in Beats Studio Wireless.1. Wireless/ Bluetooth connectivity: Extremely wonderful compatibility with Apple products. I was able to quickly connect with my iPhone and Macbook Pro. The disconnect, reconnect works just seamless. You just don't have to wiggle. I was able to connect with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with equal ease.2. Voice In/ Voice out for phone: The voice quality you get while over the phone is great. The mic is equally good and the other party I called to test was able to hear me loud and clear. I also tested Skype call and the voice quality was just perfect. No distortions, even at 25 ft from the phone. Phone controls are just plain simple.3. Music/ Audio quality: Just they way I wanted. I really enjoyed listening to music. No crackling or popping. The quality of sound depends on the sample rate though. Other's experience may be different, everyone has different response to different sounds but for me, it was just they way I wanted.4. Noise cancellation and battery: ANC works perfect. ANC is great. I travel a lot transatlantic, and ANC is what I was really in need of. I did not recharge the battery when I received the headphone, it had some charge on it that lasted almost 8 hours. I'd wait for a few charging cycles to determine the battery life.5. Comfort: After continuous use of about 6 hours, I was still feeling very comfortable. Did not hurt, however, feels slightly heavier than the Bose headphone I have.I would recommend this headphone, though your experience may be slightly different.
