sS'review'

VThe QC25 is Bose' best noise cancelling headphone to date.  As someone who has been using Bose QC headphones daily for 3+ years now, I think I can give this a reasonably educated review.  I have owned QC15 (predecessor to these headphones) for about 3 years now, and have owned QC20 (in-ear headphones) since they came out.  My musical tastes are varied: everything from Yiruma to Taylor Swift to Childish Gambino to Zedd.  I listen at my desk at home, in the office, and on public transportation.Four things really mattered to me when I upgraded to the QC25: sound quality, noise cancelling, comfort, and the portability.  So I'll skip aesthetics and the other features that you can easily read about.  And I'll tackle each of those four critical points in this review, naming a winner in each category.Sound Quality Winner: QC25You do need to "burn-in" your Bose headphones.  Play music through them for about 100 hours and you'll hear a difference\u2014they'll sound much better than they did straight out of the box.  After burn-in, indeed, the QC25 has a slightly superior sound to its predecessor.  Also, the over-ear headphones have the easy sound-quality advantage on the QC20 earbuds because you get a wider sound stage and harder-hitting bass.Noise Cancelling Winner: QC15/QC20/QC25 (3-way tie)There's marketing hype about how the QC25 noise cancelling is superior.  Honestly, I can't really tell.  I could tell the difference between the QC20 and QC15 because the "StayHear tips" blocked the sound in a different way.  But in every-day use, the QC25 noise cancelling is really about the same as that in the QC15\u2014which is to say that it is excellent and industry-leading.  Even at low volumes, you can block out most ambient noise and idle chatter: "quiet" indeed.Comfort: QC15/QC20/QC25 (3-way tie)The QC25s are just as comfortable as the QC15s: VERY comfortable.  This is due to the light weight and light pressure on the ear cups.  This is extra beneficial to people with wider skulls.  They make Beats Studio/Pro headphones feel like strapping two conch shells to your skull.  As a side note, the earbuds in the QC20 are also the most comfortable in-ear pieces that I have used\u2014much more comfortable than they look.  All three options live up to the "comfort" portion of their name.Case/Portability Winner: QC20The in-ear design of the QC20s makes it the easy winner.  You can stuff them into their card-case sized pouch very easily and you can wear them in the office without looking too anti-social\u2014not so, with the over-ear designs.  The more-compact case for the QC25 is an upgrade, and folding the headphones is easy.  In terms of storage, they did away with the card slot from the QC15 (seriously, that was a waste of space), and dropped the interior zippered pouch as well.  In its place, there is a slot to store a single spare battery.  I only ever stored one spare AAA battery in there anyway, so the QC25 case storage is sufficient for me.  The back also features an elastic compartment like the QC15 case\u2014never used it.Other considerations:Hi/Low switch: I honestly have not found the absence of this switch to be a problem.  I checked my QC15, and saw that I had set it to "Hi."  I hadn't changed it since I bought it and have never had any problems with getting a range of volumes.  Similarly, the QC25 work fine for me too.Ability to listen without battery: They introduced this feature in the QC20.  Unless you're desperate, you do NOT want to use the headphones without the active preamp because without active equalization, these sound worse than $2 headphones.  Nice-to-have feature, but just be sure to pack a spare battery.Long-term foam pad wear: About 2 years into my QC15s, I needed to replace the ear cushions because the leatherette was starting to disintegrate.  I suspect the same thing may happen to these QC25s.  Expect to spend $15 to $30 on this maintenance depending on whether you go OEM or aftermarket.No aware mode: The QC20 headphones had "aware mode" which was supposed to let you listen to your surroundings.  This feature worked, but after a while, I stopped using it and just popped an earbud out as necessary.  It isn't particularly missed on the QC25.Batteries: The fact that they use a single AAA battery is perfect.  Eneloops are your best friend.  I am grateful that this doesn't have a proprietary battery like the QC20.Overall Winner: QC25The QC25 represents the best Bose noise cancelling headphones to date.  If you are considering upgrading from the QC15, the improvements are incremental and I would think twice about parting with $300.  If you're looking to supplement a set of QC20 earbuds, this is a great buy.  If you have no Bose noise cancelling headphones, this is THE clear choice.

VNot worth the upgrade from QC-15...
p14
sg5
VMy review is geared more towards QC15 owners wondering if they should upgrade.  I myself was under this dilemma, debating whether it was worth it, and up until now there were pretty much no reviews comparing both headphones.  So I gave in to temptation and decided to bite the bullet and buy myself the QC25 to compare to my QC15 so that I could use it on a long-haul flight that I was about to take, which I already took, which is why I am writing this review now.  So yes, I have actually compared side-by-side both headphones on the battlefield.  I think this is the best place to compare them, where they are meant to be used, as opposed to going in store and trying them on there. At least in the stores where I have seen the demos, there is no flight noise simulation, so I think that such trying out is useless.Anyways, results?  I think I am keeping my QC 15.To be specific, here is why:1) In the noise canceling department, I honestly could not tell a difference between the QC15 and QC25.  Maybe some people claim that the QC25's noise cancellation is better than the QC15's (I've read quite a few reviews saying so), but I suspect that that is more of a psychological influence in which the NC on the QC25 is considered better just because the QC25 is a newer model than the QC15.  This reminds me of a psychology experiment in which our professor held an opened small bottle with a special aromatic liquid inside, and told us that within a few minutes the whole room would slowly begin to be filled with its very powerful, but attractive aroma... She then asked us to raise our hands as soon as we smelled the aroma.  A few minutes later when about two-thirds of the lecture hall had their hands up (about 120 students were there present) she revealed to us that it was just water in there!  Anyways, I think you get my point here.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the noise cancellation of the QC25...I think it is excellent!  I just don't think that it is any better than that of the QC15.  Btw, I was one of the students who did NOT raise their hands in the above experiment :-)2) I am not an audiophile, but I was disappointed with the bass sound clarity of the QC25 compared to the QC15.  I played one of my favorite tracks to test both headphones.  Granted, I am in to classical music, so the bass for me normally comes in the form of the double basses and cellos.  On my QC15, I can actually hear the individual vibrations caused by the sound of the bow hair pulling on the strings (if you have any experience with bowed string instruments, you will know what I mean).  Not so with my QC 25.  It was just a general generic sound coming from the double bass section... No bow hair vibrations as you would normally hear live inside a concert hall...or from the QC-15.3) They eliminated the Hi/Lo switch on the QC25, and by default the cable is set permanently to the equivalent of the "Hi" setting of previous QC headphone cables.  What does this mean?  It means that you will find yourself having to constantly turn down the volume on your audio equipment, unless you don't mind the sound blasting in your ears.  I was watching a movie on the in-flight entertainment system, and with my QC15 cable on the "LO" setting, I had an ample range of volume on which to adjust up or down on the aircraft's volume control.  However, when I switched over to the QC25, I had no choice but to use the lowest possible notch on the aircraft's volume control....any notch higher and I would go deaf from such loud volume!  And that lowest possible volume notch while using the QC 25 was loud enough as it was, but tolerable... I would have preferred to lower the volume further down, which was only possible in the "LO" setting of the QC15.  For me at least, this was a BIG minus for the QC25.  Btw, the reason I know that the QC25 cable is permanently set to the equivalent of the "Hi" setting on the QC15 cable is because during the in-flight movie, while I was using the QC15, in addition to testing it on the "Lo" setting, I also tested it in the "Hi" setting, and just like with the QC25, I had to use the lowest possible volume notch on the aircraft's volume control without going deaf.  Edit: I forgot to mention here that I also tested both headphones on my iPhone, and got the same exact results.  TO BOSE, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, BRING BACK THE "HI/LO" SWITCH!Update 1:  I've been reading other reviews complaining that sound "leaks" from the QC25 headphones...and I suspect that this is the very reason for this...considering how the QC25 cable is made to permanently function in the equivalent of the "Hi" setting of previous QC headphones, the QC25 are essentially loud headphones.Update 2:  Someone in my comments pointed out that the Bose manual states you can get lower volume output if you plug the QC25 using the airplane adapter.  Since as of writing time (Oct 2, 2014) I already returned my QC25s without having checked this adapter feature, I was lucky that a colleague recently bought a pair and was kind enough to allow me to check this out on his QC25.  Indeed, I can confirm that the only way you can get a "Lo" setting on the QC25 is by plugging the QC25 via the airplane adapter that comes included in the case. The adapter is double-pronged, but one of the prongs is retractable in order to convert it into a single-pronged adapter.  This would mean that those of you who normally prefer to use the "Lo" setting on the QC15 (or other previous QC models) would have to plug the QC25 into your devices with the airplane adapter from now on, whether it be into the aircraft jack, your iPod, tablet, smartphone, PC, or any other listening device.  When I tested this feature, the first thing I realized is that for everyday use, this would be a hassle in the long-run as it creates unnecessary bulk at the device jack of whatever it is you're listening.  Moreover, with such daily use, I imagine the risk of losing or misplacing the airplane adapter becomes significant, which could eventually force you to buy a replacement adapter if you were to want to keep having the option of having a "Lo" setting.  Yes, the airplane adapter is perfect for using on flights with in-flight entertainment if they require a double jack, but I would assume that for many of us, such flights are infrequent.  Bose, what were you thinking?  A simple "Hi/Lo" switch on the cable would have done the trick!  Bose, I repeat, if you are reading this:  BRING BACK THE HI/LO SWITCH!  You don't even have to redesign the QC25 themselves, just redesign the cable so that it has the switch and voila!  I suspect the cost to update the QC25 cable would be minimal.4) The case of the QC25 is more compact than the case of the QC 15, which is good.  My only gripe is that they decided to leave out the special zipper pouch that was common in Bose QC cases.  That zipper pouch was always handy to store multiple spare batteries.  Instead of the zipper pouch, the QC25 case has a slot that allows you to store one extra spare battery at a time.  Apparently, it seems it is a common complaint about the QC15 that once you run out of battery that it stops working, but guess what?  This has NEVER been an issue for me.  I have always stored multiple spare batteries at a time in my QC15's zipper pouch... If a battery runs out on me, I immediately replace it on the spot.  I have always made sure that I had no less than two or three spare batteries at any one time.  But with the QC25, I am forced to have only one spare battery.  Yes, I realize that it has that feature that allows you to play music without a battery, but I never intended on using that because I have always cared about not losing the noise canceling feature since I only use Bose QC headphones while traveling, which is where I need the noise canceling the most and the very reason why I purchased these types of headphones in the first place.All in all, I have decided to give four stars to the QC25, especially because of reasons #2 and #3 above, and I guess I'll be returning or selling the QC25 soon.  Many people are saying how the looks of the QC25 are better than that of the QC15, and I admit it was part of the reason why I considered the upgrade, but in the end of the day I give priority to practicality than to looks.I am not discouraging you from buying the QC25... They are awesome headphones in the noise canceling department.  They cut out the noise pollution of vibrations from engines, so they do exactly what they are designed to do.  But this is a product that I would buy if I didn't have my QC15 already.  So to all of you QC15 owners, you are not missing out much, continue to use your QC15s!  For everybody else, go right ahead and buy the QC25!  Besides, if this is your first time buying Bose noise-canceling headphones, chances are you have nothing better to compare them to... Just my two cents, and I hope this answers the question of whether or not to upgrade for QC15 owners, and thus helping you save money...Edit:  A few people have written to me saying that it seems my review is promoting the QC-15 as better headphones than the QC25, and yet I recommend buying the QC25 for those who do not have the QC 15 already.  I would just like to clarify that my review assumes that the QC15 are no longer available for purchase.  True, I realize that as of writing time it is possible to buy the QC15 in addition to buying the QC 25, but I don't count on this option lasting forever.Also, one more thing, for those who already own the QC 15, keep in mind that the reasons stated above are what influenced me personally in helping me decide to keep my QC 15.  Perhaps the absence of the Hi/Lo switch on the QC 25, for example, may not be an issue for some of you, especially if you always keep your QC 15 on the "Hi" setting.  But if you often use your QC15 on the "Lo" setting, I suspect the QC 25 upgrade may be an issue.  Personally, I don't understand why somebody would have their headphones always on the "Hi" setting.  I've always found that sound volume has always been significantly loud on "Hi", and the few times I ever did switch to the "Hi" setting was because the overall sound of what I was trying to listen to was extremely low already, and the " Hi" setting was very helpful at amplifying such sound.  In fact, that is how I have always thought about the "Hi" setting, as an amplification mode.By the way, when you listen to your headphones on the "Hi" setting, the louder volume does help block more ambient sound around you... Could this be perhaps the reason why Bose markets the QC25 as "blocking more sound" than the QC15, considering that its cable is permanently set to the equivalent of "Hi" thereby outputting louder volume?The ultimate purpose of my review for already existing QC15 owners is for you to be able to make an informed decision on whether to upgrade or not to the QC 25 by knowing ahead of time what differences to expect should you go through with an upgrade.

VBose QC25 vs. Bose QC15 vs. Beats Studio (by Dre.) vs. Sennheiser PXC 450 vs. Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7bDisclosure: I have tried all these on an airplane. I am not an audiophile. Noise Cancelation is the most important attribute to me.The Carrying Case: All four are quite durable and stiff.1.) Bose QC25- Very small, compact, and just big enough.  Does not really have room for anything else.  Could fit in a briefcase.2.) Bose- QC15- This case is bigger than the QC25 (Which could be a good thing.  Doesn't feel much bigger, and still has room for ipod, Gameboy, batteries, whatever).3.) Sennheiser- Square shape, low profile, however not a lot of room for anything else in case.4.) Audio Technica- Nice big case if you want to carry extra stuff (Nintendo DS, ipod, etc).5.) Beat case is very elegant and hip, but very wide and skinny.  Maybe room for an ipod and that's about it.  Caribbeaner Clasp.Build Quality:1.) Sennheiser- you can tell this is built VERY well. Strong plastics, good components, thick cord. Top notch. You feel like you are getting something really high quality.2.) Beats appears to be extremely well made.  Heavy duty industrial plastics, metal fasteners.  High end box, thick cord, great packaging, solid construction. Only concern of mine is that the battery compartment seems a little fragile.3.) Bose25 is a step up here from the 15.  Detachable cord.  A little more substantial feeling.  Touches of aluminum on the headphones, and some nicer quality padding.  While not as substantial at the Sennheiser, they do feel more luxurious and a little more solidly built than the QC15.4.) Audio Technica- Nice solid construction, appears durable.  Mostly heavy duty plastic.5.) Bose15- If this had a Sanyo logo on the side, I would not have flinched. How can something $300 be so incredibly cheaply made.Size:1.) Bose25- A step up from the Bose15.  A little more sleek.  Not as dorky looking. Fold flat.2.) Beats- These are a little bigger than the others, but that are also meant to stand out and be seen. Probably the hippest looking, but a little bold for business users.3.) Bose15- as far as over the ears go, these are pretty small.4.) Audio-Technica- mid-sized.5.) Sennheiser- These are big. No question, but they store flat.Comfort:1.) Sennheiser- Very comfortable, will fit almost any size ears. Keep on for hours.2.) Bose25- A stepup here.  More comfortable than QC15, more flex, better padding.  Less hot.  Could be tight around some larger ears.  Can press a little tight after some time, so test them.  After a few hours, my ears hurt from the pressing, but some adjustments can be made.3.) Beats seemed to be a little tight on my head and I didn't see a way to make them less "compressy."  I don't think I (personally) would like to wear these all day.  Too pinchy for my head.  The earphone part is also a little small for me.  These became hot and uncomfortable after time for me.4.) Bose15- Also comfortable. I did not experience "highs" discomfort.5.) Audio-Technica- Perfectly satisfactory. Larger opening than previous AT model. Gets warm and tight on head on long flights.Sound:Disclaimer.  This is a tough category, as they all had very different sounds and need to be used personally.  The Sennheisers helped me hear parts of songs I had never heard before, but so did the Beats (baselines were much stronger).1.) Sennheiser- I actually wore these at home too, simply to hear parts of songs I had never heard before. Astounding. My 10yr old music collection sounded totally NEW.2.) Bose25- A step up from the QC15.  Music more evenly balanced.  Bass is hard hitting, but not as annoying as in the QC15.  Some break-in is required.  A more 3D sound than QC15.  The QC25 closes the Sennheiser gap much more than the QC15.  Be aware, some mp3s might feel a little flat.2.) I put the Bose25 and Beats in the same category.  The Bose seemed more evenly balanced.  The Beats sounded great, but were EXTREMELY bass heavy.  You will hear complexity of base lines that you never noticed. Drums tracks will sound like drums, bass guitar will be noticed for the first time on songs, but the highs are VERY weak. Pop music will sound very muted, rap and hip hop will pop and you'll feel like you have a Kicker Bass speaker in your car.  I can't compare Beats to the others.  It's a totally different sound which you will either love or hate.3.) Audio-Technica- Well balanced, good sound.4.) Bose15- Great clear sound, but very heavy on the bass. I listen to a lot of rap and pop, so it was mildly annoying. I ultimately had to turn my treble settings up on my ipod to balance the sound.Features:1.) Beats- Great packaging.  Two cords with different connectors.  Nice Case.  Cloth.  They do a good job of making you think you bought a nice product (and it is).  Only concern is the headphones don't work without batteries.  The headphone creates a pseudo noise cancellation.2.) Bose25- Nice new case.  Removeable cord (so it won't rip out if you jerk it accidently).  Passive headphone (if battery dies, headphone still works - albeit without noise cancelation).  Choice of white color.3.) Sennheiser- nice cord, push to talk button (temporarily mutes NC and sound which is great for interruptions on airplanes).4.) Bose/Audio Technica- just the basics. Bose simply an on/off switch.Price:1.) Audio Technica- $125 depending on how you shop.2.) Beats Studio- $175-$2003.) Bose QC15- $200-$2504.) Bose QC25- $300 (hard to find discounted)5.) Sennheiser- $200 to $400 (how are these going up in price- 5 yrs later)Noise Cancelation:1.) Bose- No question here, far surpassed the other two. Best Noise Cancelation.  I did not notice a significant change in QC15- to QC25 on planes, however did notice a little difference in office.2.) Audio-Technica- Good Noise Cancelation.3.) Sennheiser- Not sure what happened here. Incredible sound, less than satisfactory noise cancelation.4.) I don't think the Beats are official noise cancellation, but the headphone part is great at isolating outdoor noise, and they are very tight on the head.  When you put them on without music, they offer decent noise cancellation.Summary:Please understand, noise cancellation will not drown out a crying baby, slamming doors, or people talking.  They will help out with repetitive noises like airplanes, air-conditioners or soft noises.  If you don't listen to music, these might isolate sounds even more and be counter-productive.The QC25 are a nice step up from the QC15.  I do not feel they are overwhelmingly better or worth an upgrade if you were happy with QC15 (but some people like the latest and greatest).  If I were buying new and the price difference was only $50, go for the QC25, if you have QC15 and you like them, it's not a huge jump (or buy them and return if you don't like).  The QC25 sound a little better, are better built, and a little more convenient.  But not sure they are 5 years of R&D better.  If the difference in price is >$100, QC15 looks more attractive.Audio Technica and Sennheiser don't seem to have any new offerings either, so this segment has been kind of stagnant.  I will say that Bose seems to have listened and addressed most of the complaints of the QC15.  They've improved the size, sound, build quality, and maintained their quality Noise Cancelation.The Sennheiser Noise Cancellation is a real disappointment.  Great headphone, horrible noise cancelation headphone.  The Audio Technica is a great entry price point-value item.The Beats are kind of their own product with their own demographic.  Like the Sennheisers, they made me hear parts of songs I had never heard before, but on the bass side.  If you like heavy, heavy bass, go for the beats.Final assessment:Audio-Technica- best balance of value for moneySennheiser- Best sound and comfortBose- By far Best Noise Cancelation.Beats- Best for bass.  More of a hip hop bass then the Bose though.I use these for airplane travel only, so I ended up keeping the Bose.

VI recently became obsessed with headphones after my 8 year old son wanted a pair of beats headphones for Christmas. I looked for some bargain deals for a pair of used beats, only to find that most of the people that were selling them stated something was either broken, missing or malfunctioning. so I said to myself why would anyone want to pay so much money for something with such poor quality? so I did my research on those headphones only to find out that they are not quality headphones. They have great sound but no durability whatsoever. So I decided that would be a bad idea to buy for an 8 year old who can't keep a pair of shoes clean for two days. So I said to myself if the Beats Headphones werent the industry standard as I thought, then who was? my research led me to names like Sennheiser, klipsch, vmoda, audio technical and Bose. I soon after bought a pair of headphones from each brand. I love to bargain shop so I found some pairs brand new and some were used. I have the sennheiser momentums, klipsch status, Audio Technica m50, and the bose QC25.as far as Comfort, the momentums were dead last. the momentums are very light but I believe it is due to the fact that the ear cups are too small and they fit basically on the ear instead of over the ear as advertised. makes it hard to keep them on for long periods of time. The klipsch status fit comfortably over the ear however they fit too tight on the head, also making it hard to wear for long periods of time. The Audio Technica m50 came in second place. They fit very comfortably, & I can definitely wear them for long periods of time however they are a bit heavy due to the coiled cord. But they get a pass because they are basically DJ headphones so I am told. The Bose QC25 obviously came in first place because they are very light and they fit great on my head. I can keep them on all day and not feel any discomfort.Style/Design/ durability:  the M50's are DJ headphones so once again they get a pass for style and design although they look really good they are a bit bulky for my taste. the Bose come second to last in my opinion. although they look really smooth and clean, like something I would wear with a business suit, but they are too bland for my taste.there is nothing about these headphones that is attractive by looks alone. the status looks really neat and clean just like the QC 25's but the status' have a bit more flair to them. I have the all white pair. They have some glitter effects inside the paint. And they just look like they cost a lot of money to make. The Sennheiser momentum are my favorite design. they may look like they are the cheapest to make however the materials blend really well together. I would say that durability will not be an issue with any of these headphones. They all look very well made and I'm not concerned about them falling apart anytime soon.sound: all of these headphones sound really great, and there are subtle differences in the sound quality in my opinion.if you like to listen to music with bass, I will go with the M 50. the other three were not bass heavy at all.  if i want to watch a movie, the Klipsch status are by far the go to headphones. Second will be the QC25's.overall, the statuses have the best sound. They have so much detail in every pitch. I'm not a music enthusiast nor do I know much about sound but I know what I like to hear and the klipsch status give me what I like. if I hear the word audiophile one more time I am going to scream!!what sets apart the Bose QC25 is the noise canceling feature. as I stated I am a college student and I use public transportation to get back and forth to school, I also use the school's library when doing homework or using the computers. when I listen to my music on the bus I turn on the noise cancelling feature and it feels as if I am in a quiet room.the library can get pretty noisy as well so I put them on and voilà, the chatter from nearby patrons goes away. I don't have to turn the music up as loud to drown out the outside noise which saves my ears some damage in the long term. for that reason alone is why i use the QC25 far more than the others. furthermore, the case for the QC 25 is the best, compact and stylish. Makes it much easier to throw in my laptop case and take it with me on the go.

VAfter using the QC15 for five years--and as a Million Miler they served me extraordinarily well--for some reason I felt it was time for an "upgrade."  I replaced the ear pads on the 15's--which, given their overall condition rendered them "brand new" (I take care of my stuff)--and gifted them to my daughter.  I then ordered the QuietComfort 25.After two weeks of use, including a week on a long overseas trip, my brief observations and impressions of the QC25 are as follows:- Pro: The case is very attractive and slightly more compact than the QC15, with a nifty holder for the airplane adapter a spare battery.- Pro: The zipper construction is clean and sturdy, and probably will provide years of use without problem.- Pro: The battery seems to last about the same amount of time as it did on the QC15, but when the battery goes dead you can still hear your music.- Pro: Folding the headphones to fit into the compact case is easy, and the hinges work without binding.- Pro: They sound as good, if not modestly better, than the QC15.  (Non-HiFi but good enough for Road Warrior use.)- Pro: The noise reduction seems comparable to the QC15.- Pro: The inline pause/start and volume control works great with my iPod and iPad.- Pro: They are comfortable, but...- Con: They are not as comfortable for long wear (8+ hours) as the QC15. I can't explain why, they just aren't.- Con: Without any input and the cable disconnected--i.e., just using them to cancel outside noise--there is a slight background hiss that I never experienced with the QC15.- Con: The QC25 "feels cheaper" than the QC15. I can't explain why, particularly given the construction of both is plastic.- Con: From the very first use, when jiggling the cable I experienced a "dirty connection" clicking in the headphones. After two weeks of use this went completely bad, leaving me without audio, and and the device jack (opposite the end that plugs into the headphone) appears to be broken below the plastic housing.Additional CommentsIn my opinion, the overall cheaper feel to these phones and the problem with the cable is a margin-preservation effort (a.k.a. cost-cutting). The cable connector design in particular is clearly inferior to the that of the QC15.  I've attached a photo that shows the difference, which can be summed up with two points: (1) The QC25's more rigid connector stress-relief sheath, coupled with the 90-degree connector structure, puts more stress on the connector itself than the non-90 degree angle and more flexible stress-relief sheath of the QC15. (2) The connector base of the QC25 is "on the cheap" compared to the robust connector base of the QC15.Sorry, Bose, but I'm sending these back. Cutting corners will bite you every time.Perhaps my daughter will let me borrow her QC15's....

VI'm not like most reviewers on here. I do not fly often. I do not work in an office where the noise of the A/C's bother me. I haven't ever owned another pair of headphones this high end so I do not have anything to compare them to. I have been called a "high tech redneck" before by several of my friends. I have an Iphone, Mac and samsung tablet. So what do I do and why do I want or need a pair of 300 dollar head phones? Well, I work offshore on a derrick barge (a boat out in the Gulf with a huge crane). My routine is I show up for work and take a bus (usually 3-5 hours) to a dock. The bus is full of all manner of noise. These headphones blocked all of that out. No stray conversations. No snoring. The noise cancelling is awesome. The music quality is great if you are not into deep bass.  The sound is clear, precise, full bodied with very balanced high, mids and lows.  Queen's Somebody To Love gave me goosebumbs the first time I listened to it.  You will hear parts of songs that you've never heard before. The music is very rich and clear without having to be turned up. John Bohnam's bass drum pedal squeaks in Led Zep's Since I've Been Loving You and it is very clear even with the occasional loud outburst. After the bus ride I then step aboard a crew boat and ride the loud, rocking, diesel fueled beast 3-6 hours out to where ever the barge is. During the boat ride I like to watch TV shows or movies on my tablet. Before I owned theses headphones it was hard to hear the dialogue of the characters with my tablet's volume all the way up. With these I could hear the TV and music in the background of Sons of Anarchy while the characters were speaking. I also listen to audiobooks and these are great for that. After the boat ride I am transferred to the barge. I work, eat, sleep and relax while under the tracks of a crawler crane (the kind of crane with tracks). To say it is noisy is an understatement. These cover that and make it enjoyable to listen to Norah Jones before bed. If I would have known that her voice would sound even more angelic through these headphones I would have bought them a long time ago. I was watching Sons earlier and someone yelled through the Gaitronics (the overhead paging/phone system) and I could hear the speech but could not make out the words. It is very nice to be able to raise and lower the volume on my mac while leaning back in my chair. The same controls work on my Iphone but do not work on my tablet. Nothing in life is perfect. I like that they still work if the battery dies. I carry many batteries with me. It is more convenient than having to charge the headphones themselves. I like that they can just reduce the noise without music. It sounds and feels like I am sitting in a vacuum until someone drops something on deck. It is muffled but you can still hear it.  To tell you how awesome they are, the crew was running winches (the huge diesel engines that turn the drums for the huge anchors) and the whole barge shakes.  I could feel the barge vibrate but could not hear it.  I had to take them off to make sure there wasn't an emergency.  The case could be better (they could come in a pelican case) but I doubt you office types would like that. Comfort? Yes. They are like wearing a dream. After 6 hours of my other in-ear, I would be sore. After 8 hours of my on ear my ears would be sore from where they would press against my glasses. These touch my glasses but I do not feel it and it does not disturb me. All in all, these are worth their weight in gold (which is what it cost to own a pair) when you work and live in a noisy environment. I should have saved all the money from the countless numbers of other earphones I have purchased while working out here and bought the Bose ones first. I hope this helps in your decision.

p45

VGood quality comes bursting at you from the time you start unwrapping the clear plastic. Packaging is simple and pictorials are provided which made exploration of the product really simple.The case was really small and compactly thin which is really considerate for travellers. Already included was a battery which has its own compartment in the case. Good for carrying an extra battery. An airplane adapter is also included and similarly, a slot was provided.The headphones can play music without the battery as advertised. However the sound volume was diminished compared to when the battery was inserted. However the volume can be adjusted at your playing device. Sound quality wise, without the battery the sound is a little muffled but still ok.For those who complain that the headphones hurt their ears, i really wonder if they wear it wrong? This headphones are light. The tension on your head is really low although it differs by head size. The ear cups sit around your ears so it does not press against your ears at all. Comfort wise, it is really hard to fault this headphones.For the record, I do not wear glasses and I have always liked Bose's audio style.

VI'll start by stating that I am replacing an older pair of active noise canceling headphones that I used for 5-6 hours/day for the past four years in varying office environments.  The old pair had a plastic swivel attaching the ear cup to the head band which finally broke after about a thousand times (literally, do the math) placing them into and taking them out of the case.As I mentioned I use these headphones primarily in an office environment to listen to music (I'm a software developer) and/or to just block out the constant hum of HVAC systems, etc.  I've been reading countless of reviews on numerous headphones looking for something that fits my needs and after much consideration I settled on the QC25's.The main things I took into consideration when looking for my replacement headphones were:  comfort, sound quality, noise cancelation, noise leakage, craftsmanship/durability, battery life, case, style, features (wireless/playback control/etc), and price.  Here's how the QC25 rates:Comfort - 5/5 - These are the most comfortable non-studio headphones I have ever worn.  They are fairly light weight and have a large over-ear design.  The ear cups are also fairly deep so there's no contact between my ears and the ear pieces at all.  The cups rotate to allow you to wear these comfortably on your head however you desire.  The material on the ear cups is a soft foam filled leather that doesn't apply too much pressure to the side of the head (I wear glasses so ear comfort is of utmost importance to me).  There is also a foam filled suede material on the top of the headband making the headphones rest comfortably on your head.Sound Quality - 5/5 - Excellent and well balanced.  If you're looking for headphones that just amplify the lows and the highs, these are not for you.  If you want solid lows, crisp highs and a pronounced mid-range then look no further.  These headphones play the music as-is and let you control any equalization you feel is necessary for your best listening experience.  I suppose if you're just into thumping base and are listening from a mobile device that doesn't support custom equalization you may be better off with a different brand.Noise Cancelation - 5/5 - The first thing I did when I got these is pop in the included battery and walk into my furnace room (the furnace was running) to see the impact and it was profound.  These far outperformed my previous noise canceling headphones (which weren't too shabby).  At work I sit near a call center where there are typically 4-6 people on the phone during busier times.  There are also heat pump units in the ceiling which hum and buzz throughout the day (especially since the temperatures have been in the single digits the past several weeks).  The second I flip the switch on all of the humming and buzzing is gone without a trace.  The call center noise is also greatly reduced (I'd say about 70% quieter than without the headphones on) to the point that I have a hard time focusing on any one conversation.  This is of course remedied when I turn on some music and the awesome sound quality completely drowns out any remaining distractions.  I frequently have colleagues walk up and do jumping jacks to get my attention as I don't even hear them knocking on my desk when I'm "in the zone".Noise Leakage - 4/5 - One of my slight disappointments with the QC25 is the level of noise leakage (the amount of sound that can be heard by people nearby).  At a comfortable listening level the noise leakage can be heard from 4-5 feet away.  If you like to listen to your music loud, expect people up to 10 feet away (in quiet environments) to sing along with your tunes.  I'm currently in a cubicle environment so the closest person to me is about 5 feet away, however at my previous office I sat 3 feet from another guy with no divider so it definitely would have been an issue there (except he wore headphones all day as well ;).Craftsmanship/Durability - 5/5 - I only have a couple pairs of headphones to compare these to but they look like they are made well.  The joints and swivels are made with metal parts and are fastened with screws.  The headband is made from a metal ribbon surrounded by plastic.  The cup internals are covered with a rugged cloth (as opposed to the foam covering which often disintegrates after extended use).  The ear cups are a foam filled leather material that seems durable (same style on my old headphones and those lasted 4+ years).  Even the cord is made with sturdy gold-plated ends.  They flex well and seem like they would last a long time even on larger heads. (I had a friend who ate through headphones due to his large head).Battery Life - 4/5 - So far the battery life on these is acceptable.  The noise canceling feature is typically on for 6-8 hours a day and I find that so far I've gone 2-3 days before swapping batteries.  I am also using some older rechargeable batteries which probably don't have the same life that they once did.  I have not completely drained a standard AAA battery to see how much life you get out of those.  The battery life is comparable to my old headphones (which is where the batteries came from) and is sufficient for my needs.Case - 4/5 - The carrying case included with the headphones is sturdy and has a nice look/feel to it.  The headphones fold up rather small and fit neatly into the case leaving just enough room for the included headphone cable and maybe an adapter or two.  There is an elastic pouch on the back side of the case but it is designed more for storing your instruction manual or thin items (perhaps an extra cable?).  Because of my obsessive use of the headphones I own a small USB powered AAA batter charger which fit perfectly into my old case...when my batteries were low I could pull out the charger and charge a battery while my backup was in the headphones...not so with this new case.  Fortunately I almost always use the headphones with my macbook pro so I can keep the battery charger in my laptop bag when I need it.  Aside from that, the case is very compact and does include a little slot for a spare battery (one AAA is included) as well as an airplane adapter.Style - 5/5 - I own the black design and I like them.  I'm not a style buff when it comes to headphones but I certainly don't want some big ugly things on my head.  These are sleek with an undertone of teal on the cups and on the in-line playback controller.  The plastic is a brushed style and I am overall very pleased with how these look.Features - 4/5 - The only feature I was passively looking for in headphones that these don't have is wireless capabilities.  This isn't a show stopper for me, of course, since I came from wired headphones and I am typically always at my desk when using them.  Again, I do not use these while walking about listening to music from my phone or music player so I can't speak to that experience.  There are inline playback controls which consists of a small (1.25" long) control with three buttons.  There is a volume up button, a volume down button and a center button to control playback.  A single press of the center button will play/pause your music, a double-tap of the button will skip to the next track and a triple-tap will skip to the previous track.  I already have keyboard controls for this functionality but I imagine if listening to a music device (that supports inline playback controls) this would be convenient.Price - 4/5 - Who doesn't want more for less?  For the quality and package you get the price is fair.  If you're looking for an exceptional pair of headphones with great noise canceling, great sound and decent features this is a great option to consider.Overall - 4.5/5 - I would recommend these to anyone that doesn't mind being wired to their audio source and who doesn't mind anyone within their reach being able to hear what they're listening to.  I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and would buy them again.

VTop-tier noise-canceling headphones; worth every penny
p57
sg5
VHaving had these headphones for a little over 3 months now, I\u2019ve come to know their every nook and cranny, their every nuance. And with knowing all that, I\u2019d have to say that the QC25 is one of the best noise canceling headphones that I\u2019ve come across.I\u2019ve owned a few other (somewhat cheaper) noise canceling headphones, and have also extensively tried out other higher end ones, like the Bose QC15 and QC20, before purchasing the QC25, so I know I chose right. My musical taste is also very diverse, from heavy bass to light vocal solos and acoustics, so I also know the spectrum of sound that these have to offer.Pros:Sound quality. Right out of the box, the QC25 sounded relatively great, but after burning them in for about 125 hours, the sound got much better. The bass hits clean and strong, though it in no-way dominates over anything, and mids and highs come through very clear and balanced. The sound stage is pretty wide from my experience, and given its noise canceling, makes you feel right in front of the music with nothing else there.Noise Canceling. At low to mid volumes, most (if not all) ambient noise is blocked out, as well as any conversation. At higher volumes, you feel like you\u2019ve traveled to a space where there is only the music that is pumping through your headphones and yourself present; it\u2019s really a relaxing yet thrilling feeling. It truly feels like utilizing a cutting edge technology in the music industry.Portability. Bose seems to have done everything they could to make these headphones be as portable as possible. They provide a fantastic case that fits the cord and the headphones neatly inside (the headphones fold into a more manageable size too), and it also provides a little compartment to store an extra battery.Comfort. I haven\u2019t ever had the experience of wearing more comfortable headphones (or earphones) in my life. Period.Cons:Honestly, I can\u2019t really think of any function/form cons; the only thing that is sort of a con is the high price, but that\u2019s expected given the excellent quality and performance of the headphones.Conclusion:The best noise-canceling headphones I\u2019ve ever had or tried.

VI bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, trusting the Bose name and Amazon, as I have never had a problem with either company before. The speakers stopped working after the 30 day Amazon return policy and Bose will not honor the warranty because Amazon is not a licensed Bose dealer. Buyer beware, I guess. Don't buy these from Amazon, in any case, and if so many people are having trouble with them not working after a few months, I suggest not buying them at all if you can't afford to take the risk of getting a lemon.  I can't afford to keep plunking down this much money to buy new (not Bose) speakers.What a crappy Christmas gift for a really hard working college daughter. I will tell everyone I can what I think of Bose now and this puts a giant black mark on Amazon's name as well.

VLife saving implements of quiet

VThese headphones have been lifesavers. Specifically, for my neighbor's dog's life.New neighbors moved into the apartment above mine, and they have two of those annoying little yippy dogs.  Whenever they leave, the dogs bark and howl and whine on a near-continuous basis.  Of course, the neighbors care nothing for anyone around them, the apartment complex just wants the rent money and nothing else, and the police have better things to do than respond to noise complaints.While coming here to Amazon to order a copy of Office Space to find tips on burning down the building with the yippy dogs inside, I decided perhaps rather than desperately turning to a life of crime, perhaps devices where available to stop the dogs from making my life a living hell.  Well I still have to go to work, but other than that, these Bose Headphones have proven to be a magnificent solution.  I put them on, plug them into my mp3 player, turn them on... and while the dogs can still be faintly heard, it is as if they were three or four apartments down, rather than right on the other side of the thin drywall.  I can live with that, and so can the dogs.That the headphones also do a great job at blocking out other noises like the dishwasher or the fans, is a wonderful bonus.  That they work with readily available common sized batteries is also fantastic.Thus, these headphones have saved two dogs' lives.  And perhaps the neighbors as well.  Maybe even kept me out of jail for 20  years.  They might seem expensive, but cheaper than a defense lawyer.

VAre these good headphone for a noisy office?
p81
sg5
VThe QC25s are a very comfortable pair of headphones and do an excellent job of reducing (not canceling) the noise from office air vents.  The strange effect of reducing background office noise by the QC25 is the concomitant effect of actually making office chatter more distinct.  Although the loudness of my co-workers voices is lowered, I seem to be able to make out their conversations better.  Even with white noise or music playing, I can hear the admins' weekend plans and romance gossips.I think that in-ear buds like the Shure SE215 do a better job of blocking office chatter (voice) at a lower price. I feel that the Shure SE215 with foam inserts reduces~85% of office chatter.  In comparison, the QC25 reduce about ~50% for me.  The Shure SE215 sounds a lot better, but you'll have to be comfortable having things inside your ear canal.In conclusion, both these headphones are the best I've used to reduce sounds from noisy co-worker.  I would recommend the Shure SE215 for better isolation and sound quality.  However, if you can't stand earbuds, the QC25s are an okay choice.  For ultimate noise reduction, you can even wear earplugs under the QC25.I rate the QC25 as follows:Comfort: 5Blocking co-worker's voices: 2Blocking air vent noise: 4Sound Quality: 3Price: 3Average = 3.4 starsUpdate 11/1/2014(A few additional comments after using QC25's for a week)1. No auto shut-off when you disconnect the headphones so you'll drain your battery if you forget to manually turn it off.2. The tiny latch that holds the battery is crap.  It's hard to open and close, and I'm afraid that it will break one day.3. The headphone case is small, but not designed well.  Inside the case, there is a diagram on how to fold the headphones to fit inside the case with the cord attached to the headphones.  Unfortunately, they recommend folding the headphones in a certain way that bends the cord at a sharp ~90 degree angle.  Over time this will lead to the cord breaking.  [Hint: I recommend tucking the left earcup inside first (i.e. opposite to what they show) to avoid kinking the cord at such a sharp angle.]4. I'm slowly becoming more convinced that the QC25's are not the best for office use.  When I had to finish a long report at work, I ended up using my in-ear Shure SE215 while listening to "coffee shop" white noise.  The Shure SE215 blocks office chatter so much better the QC25s.  I realize that I'm not bothered too much by air vent noise and other low frequency background office sounds that the QC25 cancels so well.  Noisy co-workers talking bothers me the most, and I think I'll have to stick with the Shure's or with earplugs.5. With my office being a bit cold, the QC25's did keep my ears warm.

VThe new gold standard in noise-canceling headphones
p87
sg5
VThe Bose QuietComfort 15 has been the gold standard in noise-reduction headphones for the last 5 years. I've been in the market for a new pair of NC headphones since I lost my Sony pair 2 years ago but didn't buy because I felt that Bose kept the QC15 on the market for as long as possible. They could easily have made a better pair of headphones but they chose not to, to maximize the profits on the QC15. In 2014, competition has come from various places and Bose had to up its game. Enter the Bose QuietComfort 25.I put the QC25 on in a noisy airport terminal and was slightly unimpressed. Then I realized the NC was switched off and hit the switch. Silence. A pin dropped, and went unnoticed. It's not perfect at voices, but background noise is completely eliminated, more than any other headphone I've used.Then there is the comfort. At 6.9oz, the QC25 is lighter than the QC15 but more than anything, it is way less bulky and cleverly fit in a 8.25"x5.7"x2" case, which easily fits inside my laptop bag. Yes that compares to 8.5"x8.8"x2.8", which is a huge difference. They are super comfortable on the ears and the case fits a spare battery which lasts for 35h. One spare is enough. They feel like gloves on the head and can be easily worn for hours.If you do run out of battery then the NC will disengage and you will hear more of the outside world. What's more, the noise quality degrades substantially. It is somewhat useful for phone conversations, because using NC during a phone conversation is really weird, your own voice is very distorted.They come with a detachable cable with mic and volume, which is handy. I find I ruin cables quite quickly so no doubt that will be replaced soon! Included is a single AAA battery, which will get you started immediately. Remember to buy more and put one in the case!Onto a plane I sat down, turned the NC on and zoned out from the world. I downloaded a few things to stretch them out on my iPhone 5 (I wish those things had better sound quality!). That brings me to the sound quality.I've been an audio fan for many years and have the wonderful Sennheiser HD-600 cans at home. The Bose QC25 is quite crude by comparison and the Bose NC comes at a price of no audiophile experience. But then when I'm traveling, I'm usually pushing music out on an iPhone or a Mac and those are hardly high definition audio sources. The HD-600 is open-backed and terrible in public spaces, and completely pointless when paired with an iPhone. That's where the QC25 comes into its own.You are enveloped in stunning silence and the chink in Pink Floyd's Money, the saxophone in Dire Straits' Your Latest Trick, the bass in Faithless' God is a DJ and the guitar in The Eagles' Hotel California all come to life in a way that you don't get in a public place. It's an extremely private and intimate experience.I've tried out every headphone for the last few years I got the chance - Sennheiser, Beats, Parrot, B&W;, , and didn't think anything beat the QC15 for NC. So, I was waiting for Bose to release this headphone and when I tried it I fell immediately in love.The QC25 is THE new standard in noise-cancelling headphones. There are headphones with better sound, better style and cooler looks. But if you spend a lot of time on a plane or a noisy office and want some peace and quiet, look no further. It comes at a price of somewhat average audio but if you are a frequent flyer then that trade-off is a no brainer.Put another way, I can't wait to get on the train to New York tomorrow and zone out.

VFacing issues with product after only 4 months of use
p92
sg5
VBought the QC25  4 months ago through Amazon (Oct 2014). At the time of purchase not many reviews were up, the product had only just been released and there were not one single star review. It now seems that more and more people are having issues with the left speaker, just as I had since yesterday. I'm guessing it has something to do with poor quality components on jack, as fiddling with it gives ocasional sound, as if it is related to a bad contact problem.I've always had very good experience with Bose products, I'm now very disappointed and concern. I haven't tried contacting Bose yet, i've only just discovered the problem and came here to check if other were having the same problem. I'm worried i've put 300 U$ to waste as others have been having a bad time getting a refund from amazon or replacement from Bose.I'll try to write a follow up after contacting Amazon or Bose.

p98

VThe sound quality of the Bose headphones is great but the quality of the construction is awful.  I've had 2 previous pairs of these dating back 10 years and that's because successive pairs have fallen apart.  I do use them a lot - nearly every day. But when you pay $300 for something you should be able to expect better durability than that.With the first 2 I had, the padding around the earpiece came unglued or the stitching around the padding came undone.  Still, those 2 models lasted several years before I had to replace them. But with this last pair - purchased just 2 months ago - the sound just went out in the right earpiece and nothing I've tried will work to get the sound to return. My window to return the headphones to Amazon closed - you guessed it - just a couple of weeks ago.I'll be damned if I'll pay Bose another $300 to replace these. Bye-bye Bose. Too bad your excellent engineering is canceled out by shoddy construction.

VYears ago I had a great set of Jabra noise-canceling headphones that I absolutely loved.  When the foam eventually broke down, and the plastic just plain broke, I wanted a replacement, but Jabra wasn't in the game any longer.  For the last few years, I kept my eye on the market, and while the Bose headphones looked nice, I just couldn't swallow the price tag, so I kept looking, but most of the reviews for other models had drawbacks that I couldn't live with.Ahead of a trip to Europe, I finally broke down and spent the money for these headphones, and I honestly don't regret it one bit.  They're super comfortable, even when worn for 9 hours at a time.  The sound quality is absolutely great and the noise canceling is top notch.  I've worn them on planes and at work in a datacenter and office cubicle environment, and I've used them as a headset for my cell phone while working in the datacenter.I've got a pretty good sized melon, but these fit fine with room to spare.  Using the active noise canceling in my office reduces the ambient air handling noise to complete and utter silence, and drowns out most noise from other cubicles as well.  In the datacenter, it cuts the roar of the servers down to a tolerable background level, and I could clearly hold a phone call while wearing them (though the person on the other end would sometimes have problems hearing me over the noise).  On a plane, they fold up nicely into the little case, and I love having the little spot in the case to store a spare battery.In short, if you can part with the money, these are great headphones, and you won't regret the purchase.

VI've now spent a month with the Bose QC25. I've listened to them through four battery changes (about 120 hours of use music time), four flights and in a variety of situations with a variety of music. I'll detail below but my conclusion is that they are great for the Noise Cancelling style headphones but I still prefer a high end set of earbuds in every situation.I'll start with the "big deal" -- Noise Cancelling:Ask almost anyone what they think of when you say "Bose Headphones" and they'll say "Noise Cancelling". In this respect, the Bose do not disappoint. This is my first set by Bose and the first time I "flipped the switch" I got a huge smile. Much of the world around you just disappears. It's an almost eerie experience. Further time with them showed me that the sounds that disappear the most are low rumbling noises. For example, our dishwasher, lawnmower and garage door opener are almost completely silenced. But higher sounds like peoples' voices and the squeak of a shoe on the floor are just muffled.A special case here: During flights, the sound of a jet engine is still noticeable but very nicely quieted. It's actually easier for me to hear other people speaking which is rather strange.Additionally, something that *bothered* me a lot during two flights was that the overhead air vent would blow at a perfect angle onto one of the Bose microphones that it uses to cancel sound. Whenever this happened, I would get a loud "air whooshing" sound in the headphones and needed to readjust my head to move away from the vent. This only happened in the unique situation of being on a jet but I found it very irritating.My conclusion on the noise cancelling is that it is real. It works and is not just some gimmick. However, as noted above, it does have certain limitations and its own unique set of irritations.Comfort:They are *very* comfortable. There is soft foam in all the right spots and they don't push on my ears. The bridge across the top rests on my head just right. I've worn them for four hours at a time and felt no discomfort. No complaints at all here.Noise Quality:This is probably going to be the most controversial part of my review. At this point my QC25 probably have about 120 hours of music time on them. They have been through the "burn in" period that others have said they need. I feel that the sound is "pretty good for the price".The highs are a little exaggerated. The lows are pretty decent. The midrange is about where *I* feel they should be. But, here's the thing, they do not bring out any nuances in the music. To me, this is a big deal. I don't hear the guitarist's fingers sliding on the the strings, or the accidental background conversation that sometimes gets picked up (or the occasional cussing when the musician misses a note). These are the little things that make me feel like I'm there, in the studio or concert hall and the Bose fails here.If most of the music you listen to is modern pop, I suspect you probably won't care as much about these things (forgive me for saying). In this situation, I still the Bose would be a fine choice.Style:Well, personally, I don't like the white style. I'm old-school. Black and grey is beautiful. The blue cable make me feel like I'm standing out even in the airport. I want to stand out for other reasons, but the Bose absolutely draw attention to themselves, even in a jet full of Bose wearers. Final thought on this? To each their own. If you like the bright white, go for it.Battery Life:Pretty consistent so far. A little over 30 hours on each AAA battery. I keep one battery in the headphones and two spares in the case. This has allowed me to never be anywhere near running out of juice. By the way, the case provides a nice built in slot for one spare battery.Case:The case is bulky but as small as this style can be made because the headphones fold flat. It's a little awkward getting the QC25s back into the case the first time or two but after that you'll be a pro and exiting the plane in no time.Compared to other headphones:So, here's part 2 of my controversial statement above and a lot of people probably won't agree...The Bose are *noise cancelling* not *noise blocking*. For years, my daily headphones have been a pair of Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 Pros ear buds. I love this style of ear buds. They do not provide noise cancelling -- they *block* noise. Lots of noise. They also provide all of the sound benefits that I mentioned above. In short, I believe that in-ear earbuds provide superior sound compared to the Bose.HOWEVER, the Bose are not in-ear. They fit over the ear. Therefore, many people will probably find the Bose more comfortable. This is, of course, a very important thing to consider. I find the earbuds to be very comfortable if I use soft foam cushions but some people just can't adapt to this. To each their own...So, my final thoughts:The Bose are very nice and do what they say. They are *not* "audiophile" products. They are high-end consumer/traveler products. If the highest quality sound is most important to you and you are willing to at least *try* ear buds (quality ones, not those horrid things that came with your iDevice) then try the ear buds. If you just want the noise cancelling benefits with a guaranteed comfort, you can't go wrong with the Bose.

VFirst off, I AM NOT AN AUDIOPHILE - I'm just a normal listener. I can tell the difference between good sound and bad sound, but I can't tell the difference between good sound and great sound, and quite frankly I don't care.The Good:+ MP3 and AAC files from the iPhone sound good+ Sound profile is smooth and easy to listen to+ Poorly encoded MP3's sound acceptable, higher quality headphones would reveal their flaws too much+ NC is very effective+ NC is amazing, actually+ No NC "booming"+ Comfort beyond what I thought possible+ User replaceable battery (the sole reason I avoided the new Beats Studio)The So-so:-/+ Sound is not as bass heavy as I would personally like-/+ The case is small - but there's no real place to put the cord - I would have preferred a slightly larger case with dedicated space for the cord-/+ The entire headset is very flexible - in a rubbery way - it is probably very crack and snap resistant - but it does not inspire confidence-/+ Only comes with a right angle plug, I prefer straight plugs-/+ Ear pressure that is associated with most ANC headphone is present in this pair, but I am EXTREMELY sensitive to this, so it might not affect youThe Bad:- The folding mechanisms contain a very thin wire that bends every time you fold the cups - this reeks of PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE on Bose's part - bend a wire enough and it will fail, probably about a week after the next model comes out- The battery door does not operate smoothly at all - It will likely fail long before the headphones do- The cloth adorning the top of the headband is just silly and serves no purpose other than having another part that will wear out quicklyFunctionally, these headphones are perfect - but I couldn't risk spending so much money on something that I wasn't confident in lasting - I returned themIF YOU BUY THESE AND PLAN ON KEEPING THEM, I highly suggest buying a case made for the QC15, one that will allow you to store them without having to collapse the hinges and bend the wire inside - I also recommend investing the highest capacity batteries possible, to avoid stressing the battery door too often

VThe noise isolation is something out of this world. On par after reading all the reviews, and met my expectations. The sound itself nearly as bad as anyone would say it was on head-fi, I think they're just a bunch of audiophiles. When you turn the canceling feature off, the sound gets bad. I wouldn't know what a "high" or a "low" is, but they sound FANTASTIC to me. I've tried so many audiophile headphones and they're BETTER than some audiophile headphones I own. The noise isolation alone is already worth it.. kinda awesome sitting in a noisy place and not hearing the car move while it's driving when I'm on a trip with family.It doesn't necessarily CANCEL noise, it just turns down the volume in life by about 60-80 percent. Any fans, computers, cars, airplanes, trains... motor noises... it all cancels out by about 80 percent. Which can be a bad thing if you're walking on the street with these. I always like to keep a fresh energizer battery in it. When the light starts blinking, I change the battery out because the noise cancel feature suffers when it gets to that point. They truly are phenomenal.. I cannot recommend these enough. They're also some of the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.Edit: They broke within a week, popping sound in right headphone. The wire is broken and cutting out. Im very unsatisfied with the quality of the construction on these.

VI sit in the most dismal location at work. *START RANT* At all four corners of my cubicle farm pen, there is always someone talking. Right behind me, I have an IT guy making constant phone calls to our call center site, telling some poor joe to get the cheapest Dell promos and trying to finalize some sort of contract. To my right, a big shot manager negotiates left to right with folks who can't seem to get their act together on the other side of the world. To my left, a hippy dippy recruiter asks typical interview questions over the phone to dozens and dozens of hopeless candidates each week. Of course, they don't respond well to the STAR interview questions, so after she hangs up, she vents her frustration by yelling "AGHH!". Now, to the front of me, I have a pair of co-workers who talk like valley girls. Like, y'know Omg! Their conversations are as shallow as a kiddy pool. *END RANT*One faithful morning, I visited my local Target to buy a pair of these headphones, recommended to me by half a dozen of my co-workers. I used my Target gift cards to pay down the cost of tax and with my purchase, I went straight to work.What I have found so far is that it does a good job of canceling out male voices since they are deep in tone. Sounds that I never noticed before such as the whir of the AC are also drowned out. Noise cancellation is at its best when music is playing. However, even with music I can still hear, but not as loud, exactly what my female co-workers are saying. Their high pitch voices are impossible to drown out completely. I could continue to up the volume, but there's only so much my ears can withstand without hurting. Also, if I do up the volume, people can hear what I'm listening to. Not cool.My overall verdict is that these headphones will almost do the trick for now, but I'm still going to be in the lookout for a better solution.

VSince my family now owns both Bose QC25s (wife's in White/Khaki) and Beats Studio Wireless headsets (mine in Matte Black), I feel like I can finally write a completely informed review of the BOSE and give you a comparison of the two products as they are currently the two market leaders in sales and marketing.Testing procedure \u2013 while it's not scientific I spent a lot of time with these products listening to a wide array of music. I left the headsets on my head for hours on end while exercising, doing household chores and flying across the country on commercial airlines. Also, it took me several months to write this review as I continued to test and compare the Bose and Beats with a huge library of music that ranged from Eminem to Emmylou Harris. I used an iPad, iPhone and a couple of different iPods as audio sources since that's what the majority of us use these days. The songs are Apple AAC files sampled at 256 kbps.BUILD QUALITY(Winner) Bose QC-25 \u2013 The materials that Bose uses in the construction of the QC25s are absolutely first class. The plastic feels solid and the aluminum feels like it was intended for use in an aerospace project and the padding on the head band is thick padded velour. One issue is the fabric used on the top of the headband. My wife's headphones are the cool looking white with tan ear-cups and teal accents and cord. The white fabric can get dirty really fast. Bose is very aware of this because when I asked an employee at the Bose kiosk at Lenox Mall in Atlanta about it, they told me, without hesitation, that a Tide stain wipe cleans it up nicely. That area should be leather, plastic or aircraft aluminum, not white fabric. The black version will not have this issue.Beats aren't too far off in build quality but they fall short only because they feel a little more "plasticy" and fragile when folding them for storage in the included case. The shuttle buttons built into the beats logo on the left side feel a little "clicky." Compared to the previous generation of Beats, the new Studios are a lightyears ahead in build quality. While I am testing the wireless version of the Beats Studio, they still come with cords, lots of cords. The one that I use most (to extend battery life or plug into non-bluetooth devices) is the one with the shuttle buttons. The cord is thicker than the Bose and is less tangle prone.COMFORT(Winner) The Bose QC25s are the lightest weighing and the lightest clamping headsets that I have ever put on my head thus making them the most comfortable, especially when wearing them over long periods of time. After wearing my Beats Studios for 20-minutes I put on the Bose and they felt funny they were so light. In reverse, after wearing the Bose for 20-minutes, the Beats felt noticeably heavier.To put numbers on the weight:\u2022 Bose 196.6g\u2022 Beats 260gAnother win for the Bose is the depth of the ear cups. They are deep enough that people with large or protruding ears will not have an issue. In contrast, the Beats ear cups are much shallower. They are so shallow that my small, non-protruding ears touch the foam pad inside the cup. It's a minor annoyance will bother some people.SOUNDThis is what we buy headphones that cost over $300, right?(Winner) Beats Studio Wireless. Beats products are well known for their huge, Hip-hop bass. In early versions Dre and Company made the bass more of a novelty rather than a quality audio asset. Fortunately, they reeled in the bass when designing the Studio models. The bass is now lighter, tighter and so well controlled that it's much more pleasing to listen to across a wide range of music.Bose is not known for bass and the QC25s live up to that reputation. They are on par with the QC15s they replaced but that's not saying much. Where they shine is in the mid range, exactly where the Beats are weakest. The highs and lows sound muffled compared to the Beats but mids are more revealed.Bose produces amazing, but slightly muted, vocals and smooth instrumental tones. Close your eyes while listening to both "Beethoven's 5 Secrets" or "Kung Fu Piano: Cello Ascends" by The Piano Guys and you'll hear a cello sing with such a mellow baritone voice that it'll feel like it melts like butter into your ears. I played "Cello Ascends" for a co-worker to get his opinion of the two headphones. When using the QC25s, he sat there with his eyes closed totally absorbed in the superbly reproduced music. When the song had finished playing he pulled the headphones off and with a huge smile said, "Wow. With the noise canceling on, I totally forgot I was at the office. You can get lost with those things on." I felt that was a solid review of the Bose when listening to songs that deliver mellow, mid-range audio that don't have demanding bass.But, if you go back to Sam Hunt's "Breaking Up In A Small Town," you just don't get the punch that you get with other bass rich headphones like the Beats Studios. Don't get me wrong, these things sound pretty good but they don't deliver the same, full listening experience. They provide detail and precision but without the ultra deep, rich sounds that physically move you and the crystal clear highs. If these are all you listen to, I don't think you'd crave more bass but if you do any A-B testing with the Studios, you'll hear what you're missing and wish for more. They just can't handle the low frequency.NOISE CANCELINGBOSE WINS BY A MILE...or more.My wife and I flew from Atlanta to Hawaii this summer. I got the chance to use the Bose QC25s side-by-side with the Beats Studio Wireless on the commercial flight and with the music playing at modest levels, the Bose QC25s filtered out what I'd call 90 percent of the airplane engine noise. Bose has PERFECTED Active Noise Reduction (ANR). Bose is the reigning king of ANR. Even without music playing they greatly reduced engine noise.In the housework test, yes I'm Renaissance man that vacuums and cleans toilets, the Bose nearly drown out all of the vacuum cleaner noise and help take my mind off of the mundane chores and on the music.A common side effect of non-Bose ANR systems is hiss. Bose ANR produces absolutely no hiss.I was severely disappointed with Beats ANC (Adaptive Noise Canceling) performance while flying in a commercial airplane, or while riding on a Washington, DC subway. While I gave Bose a 90% ANR effectiveness, I'd give Beats 50% at best. I had to crank up the volume to uncomfortable levels to get the jet engine noise abated to the levels that Bose was delivering. Without music playing, the Beats might as well not have had any ANC. This is again surprising since Beats claims to have dual adaptive noise canceling modes.If you want or need perfect ANR performance...go Bose. Period. End of story.WIRELESS(Winner) Beats has proven that Bluetooth can sound great. They have nailed BT with the Studios. I am so spoiled by the BT that I find using a cord to be a tangling, snagging hassle.For Bose, this is an easy one since the QC25s don't come with a wireless option. Bose does make a non-ANR wireless model but they fail miserably in audio quality. Why not merge the two products into one and make a great sounding, noise-canceling, Bluetooth headphone? That sounds like a winning product to me!While doing housework I have to route the cord into my shirt to keep if from snagging on things. Not ideal but it works.CALL QUALITY(Winner) Beats Studio. The call microphone is on the side of the headset. Everything I know about sound leads me to believe that a caller on the other end of the line should not hear me as well as the in-line mic hanging below my chin on the Bose cord. But that is the case. I talk to my brother a lot using the Beats and he tells me that he cannot tell that I'm not holding the phone up to my ear.Bose put a mic on the back of the inline controller that lies right below your chin. It's perfectly placed for great audio pick up but even in the best conditions it has a slight speakerphone sound that disappoints me a bit. It's still clear but not as clear as the Beats.EXTRASAccessories(Winner) Bose comes with a case, two-AAA Duracell Batteries, a cord with shuttle buttons and mic and a commercial airplane adapter.Beats comes with a case, a red mobile phone cord with black shuttle buttons, a black cord without buttons, a red USB-to-micro-USB charging cord and a USB wall plug with folding prongs.Bose wins Accessories for two reasons. First, being battery powered means no extra cords or wall plugs (no matter how Beats spins the supposed benefits of the rechargeable battery thing) and second, the airplane adapter. Beats can keep the straight audio cord and power accessories and give me battery power and an airplane adapter...although there would be nowhere to store them (see below).Cases(Winner) The Bose case is as thin as you can make a headphones case and comes in a very standard rectangle shape that fits into any messenger bag, back pack or suitcase. The small footprint and thinness mean some origami folding of the headphones to get them seated, but Bose solved for that and even embossed a diagram on the inside of the case (thank you). It has a place for a spare battery AAA battery (awesome) and airplane adapter. One oddity is that the pocket for the cord is on the outside of the case. I'd greatly prefer that the pocket be inside. My wife never puts the cord in the outside pocket, she just sets it on top of the headset and zips the case closed. She's afraid that over time the stretchy material will lose elasticity and the cord might fall out while traveling.The Beats case is oddly shaped like an egg. It fits in my Osprey Spin 32 backpack and in my carry-on-sized suitcase but it is awkward to carry in my average Timbuk2 or leather messenger bags. Beats must know that this is an issue as they include a carabiner that allows the egg to be clipped to the outside of a bag. The egg-shape is much harder to deal with and it has NO pockets for cords and accessories. A very strange omission for a headset that comes with THREE cords and a wall plug!POWER(Winner) Bose uses a replaceable, off-the-shelf AAA battery for power and I LOVE IT! If your battery dies, just pop in the spare battery that's nestled in the carrying case. If you forget to replace that spare? Not problem, the Bose will work without power while you make your way to any store that sells AAAs.Beats website says "Dead batteries can kill your vibe." Uh, okay but what if the internal rechargeable battery dies and you can't get to a power outlet? That kills your vibe even more since you'll have no sound. In this case, no charge means no music since the Studios only work with power, just like the old QC15s did. I'm not sure why Beats decided to do this but it was definitely a conscious decision that I will speculate was done because without the powered amp, the tuned equalization and the minimal adaptive noise cancelation working, the Beats don't sound very good.NOISE LEAKBose are so light and the head clamp is so relaxed, they leak way more sound than the Beats.SUMMARYBose and Beats both makes quality, well engineered products for which people are willingly to pay a premium for the brand name and the performance. It's amazing how opposite these headphones are but that fact makes it easier to decide between the two.Listening to certain genres, the Bose sound good enough to justify their price point. Add in the superior noise canceling and they are worth every penny. If you are a traveler that needs ANR headphones in noisy environments and loves great sound, buy the Bose.If you use headphones in more civil environments and love deep, rich bass and crisp, clear highs that accentuate the subtle nuances hidden in your music, get the Beats Studio Wireless. Or you don't mind your music artificially manipulated to enhance today's music and you like your tunes to vibrate your noggin once in a while and can accept mediocre noise canceling, go with Beats Studio.As both brands evolve and develop qualities of the competitive products, the consumer will be the winner.I hope this helps you make an educated decision.

VFirst, I must say that I am a freak of nature in that I am not a big Bose fan or Apple for that matter. Having said that, I was looking for a set of noise canceling over ear headphones. I did much investigating in this area. What I found was NC from many brands was so so and not very reliable as many reviews said the NC stopped working in as little as a day and up to a year. The reviews of Bose QC products never indicated these type problems. I also quickly became aware that Bose dominates NC technology arenas not only in consumer products but industrial and military applications as well. Again, I never thought I would ever be buying a Bose product. Bose and Apple are full of proprietary issues from cables to you name it. So i bit the bullet and bought these QC25. I have not the slightest regret. They are magnificent. I can now sit at my computer on my loft and not be inundated with sound from my wife watching TV with 5.1 just below me. I swear she has hearing deficiencies. Not only does the NC do a stellar job, I am at this moment listening to the new Pink Floyd album on Spotify and it sounds great! Even when I am just perusing the internet with no audio source and just NC they attenuate the sound from downstairs so much that what ever she is watching is a mere whisper compared to sans QC25. I cannot say that I am a complete Bose convert but I damn sure am a QC believer! God bless all of the Bose and Apple fanatics. May they live long and prosper. We must all follow our own hearts. I heart my QC25. Yeah buddy!!!!

To be fair i did enjoy the headphones when they worked - they are comfortable to wear. The noice cancellation is also ok. But that doesn't really matter if they cannot build a pair of headphones that can outlast a pair of my boxershorts.

VI am returning the second set of Bose QC 25 headphones in about a week. I really like these headphones, they are comfortable, the sound is very good and they look and feel great. The problem was the same on both sets, a problem with cable jack or the jack receptical. On the first set the problem developed the first evening. The sound would go off and I would have to touch the cable jack to get sound back, then every time I would move, the sound would go off. The second set this didn't develope until after 4 days use. Amazon has been good about about accepting the returns but regretfully I probably won't try a third set of Bose Quite Comfort 25 headphones.

VThese are great headphones, featuring crystal clear sound and amazing noise cancellation technology. The first time I tried them on I was standing in a noisy store and was actually startled by the sudden silence.Yes, you are paying extra money for the Bose label, but the sound quality, craftsmanship, and sleek design make them worth it in my opinion. I am admittedly not an audiophile, but I know good sound when I hear it. (NOTE: Sennheiser headphones are often said to have better sound at a lower price, but they are, in my opinion, so ugly that I didn't even make an effort to try them out.)For those debating whether to purchase these or the equally-priced Beats Studio headphones, here is my pro and con list which ultimately led me to keep the Bose and return the Beats:Beats Studio:- Nicer packaging (like Apple products, the boxes and manuals are works of art in themselves)- Better carrying case - roomier, therefore easier to store headphones in- Rechargeable battery- Can be found on sale throughout the year (I have never seen the Bose QC 25s on sale)- Has a mute button built into the B symbol on the ear cup- Has an auto-off function when unplugged to save battery life- Arguably more fashionable looking- More pronounced bass--- Build quality feels a bit plastic-y--- The noise cancellation feature creates a very noticeable hissing sound - for me this was the deal breakerBose QC 25:- Superior noise cancellation- Clearer sound--- Never goes on sale (even on Black Friday / Cyber Monday)--- Requires a AAA rechargeable batteries for noise cancellation functionality. They will work without a battery, but the sound quality is greatly reduced.--- Carrying case is small, so fitting the headphones and wire inside is a squeeze--- When music is not playing, the noise cancellation can produce a sensation of suction or of being underwater, but I got used to itGeneral comment regarding around-ear headphones:- These two models are fully enclosed and can make you feel rather warm, similar to wearing earmuffs indoors- If you have longer hair, the headband will mess it up a bit, so using them at work might be a concern. (Tilting them back so the headband is behind your neck doesn't work because the ear cups do not pivot far enough.)That being said, if I were still a teenager (caring more about bass and fashion than simple audio clarity), I'd probably go with the Beats. However, in my mid-thirties, with a wider range of musical taste, and with background noise increasingly compromising my hearing, I decided to go with the QC 25s, and have no doubt that I made the right choice. Hopefully, in the next iteration, Bose will take a cue from Beats and include a rechargeable battery.I hope my assessment is helpful to anyone struggling to make up their mind like I was. Of course, the best way to make a decision with your $300 is to go to the store and try them both out for yourself. Just be sure to using the same song from your own music source (phone, MP3 player). Store audio setups can be deceptive.

VI never write reviews but I have to share my experience with this product so farIt only took 4.5 months for these to break on me, the right speaker went out suddenly.I always placed the headphones in their case for protection because I depend on them for studying in medical school.I've tried multiple computers/phones, replacing the battery, changing the equalizer and more...Only the left side clicks on when turning on the noise canceling feature.Sorry to be a downer but I will update this review once I get the proper response from bose.

VBeware of this model - it is not designed for long term reliability with the new folding parts
p183
sg5
VLong time owner of noise reduction headsets and owner of QuiteComfort 15 which lasted years until it got stepped.  The QuietComfort 25 cost me $300 and lasted for around 5 flights before the right channel (the side that bends sharply to fold up in the small case) started having connection problems and can only work if I manually bend the arm a certain way while trying to listen...which is not an option if you want to relax on a flight.The 30 day window for returns is a joke if you only take flights once every few months.  If it doesn't fail on your very first flight then you're going to be out of luck on at some point.If you have already bought one of these...I would seriously consider storing them in a bigger case where you don't fold the right earphone so sharply.I was very gentle with the way I folded it up each time and alas it did not matter.  They tried to get innovative with making it fold up smaller but did not stress test this .Though great sound quality I have little desire to purchase from Bose again after this.

VBose QC25 Headphones
p189
sg5
VThis is a tremendous product, as fit for purpose as a product could possibly be. There are some better headphones out there in terms of audio quality, but for noise cancellation, nothing even comes close to the Bose 25s. I had the Sony equivalent, which were about 2/3 of the cost (hence my purchase of the Sonys), and they were NOTHING compared to the Bose for noise cancellation. In addition, the QC25s are extremely comfortable for my large head and ears, and I can wear them as long as needed with no fatigue. I use the QC25s to work out on a treadmill and watch a small TV while my wife uses a rowing machine and watches the main room TV at full volume. With any other headphones, or even with the QC25s and noise cancellation turned off, it's a cacophonous madhouse - a giant TV blasting, exercise equipment and fans running, etc. - I can barely hear my own TV at all no matter how loud I turn it up. But when I turn on the noise cancellation, almost all of the noise in the room just ... disappears, and I can comfortably listen to my own TV show at a low volume. It doesn't eliminate "all" background noise; for example, you can still hear voices and some higher-pitched sounds. But it almost entirely eliminates low frequency noise, background hum, buzz, fans, and other constant/ambient sounds. These headphones are nothing short of phenomenal. The price seems ridiculous, but they are worth every penny if you can afford them. In case it's ambiguous, just to be clear I ***love*** this product.I wouldn't even consider getting on a plane without these.

Finally just took them off.  Very irritating!  Will be returning and expecting a full refund.

VI received these as a gift which is why it doesn't show me as having bought them through Amazon. I am not an audiophile but even so I am pretty underwhelmed by the sound quality, especially for the price. The sound is just kind of flat, lifeless, and tinny. My twenty-dollar Sennheiser HD201 headphones sound much better to me. I had my wife compare the two headphones as well without telling her my opinion of them and she came to the same conclusion. The noise-reduction feature doesn't score any points with me either because it doesn't actually work that well. For all the added hassle of keeping a charged battery in the headphones and having to flip the little switch on the side, they barely block ambient noise better than the basic over-the-ear headphones I mentioned earlier.The two areas where these headphones do distinguish themselves are build quality and comfort. The build quality is flat-out awesome and luxurious, and they are definitely the best-built set of headphones I have used. They are also extremely comfortable-- so comfortable that I almost want to forgive them for the lousy sound quality. But not quite. Not for $300. Can't recommend these.

VI love my new Bose QC25 headphones. I am a student with a very busy schedule, and I need my world to be silent whilst I am doing homework. Unfortunately, I live in a not-so-quiet house. I had been trying to use my regular earbuds with only passive noise canceling, and they weren't working so well. I had been considering the Bose QC15 headphones for a while, but I really didn't like how they looked. When I saw that the new redesigned QC25's were released, I bought them, and they are worth the price. The noise canceling feature does an astonishingly good job at blocking out background noise, and they allow me to study in almost complete silence. I couldn't ask for a better pair of headphones. Another thing I love is the fact that you can listen to music even after the battery dies. They have great sound quality, and I would recommend them to anyone.

I'm not mistreating them, and am always careful to put them back into the case after use. Luckily, the Bose store is on my way home from work, so it's easy to return the headphones as they become defective.An average headphone lifespan of 2 months with normal everyday usage is unacceptable. I hope that this time Bose just gives me my money back so that I can buy a pair of Seinheisers.

VWith an impending 10+ hour international flight, I blindly bought this latest model based on all the positive reviews of the earlier model.  I already had the Sony MDR-NC200D which I had used quite a bit, but the on-the-ear design was just too uncomfortable after a few hours.  These was just so amazingly comfortable and effective at blocking out the background noise.  I am usually a Bose-hater (which is why I bought the Sony's a couple year ago), but  have to admit this is one case where they're actually a good product.Overpriced?  Perhaps, but still happy that I've made the plunge.  It made my latest international trip just slightly more bearable.I also like the fold-up design so that the case is relatively flat and can easily fit in my laptop bag.

VOk. Let me first say that Bose Worldwide warranty really works. The story is: I bought my pair in the US and, after 3 months of moderate use and good care, the right phone stopped working. After a lot of hassle trying to contact Bose Support in Brazil (their website is archaic) I managed to do it and they changed my pair (after 2 weeks because they didn't have a new pair in stock). That would be an ok experience if the second pair wasn't defective. Yes. The second  pair they gave me (brand new) had another problem, now in the Noise Cancelling, that would randomly turn off/on consecutively. So now I have to go back to the Bose support, where I'm probably going to ask for my money back, because this is not the product experience I expect from a 300USD phone.

I decided to return it for store credit where I bought it instead.  I'll stick to my QC15s.The pros of the QC25 were the design, comfort and working without a battery.The cons were the build quality, reliability and felt cheap.

VGreat quality noise cancelling headphones, the best on the market
p237
sg5
VThe Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones are clearly the best  Bose has manufactured and choice of most passengers on planes (and certain companies too) when flying. Companies that have the service of offering noise canceling headphones to passengers of their higher classes use this headset.I have had the Bose QuietComfort 15 that is prior to this one and it was amazing model. The only thing that this model has improved is the design that is much more beautiful, the possibility that can be folded to make them more portable and improved noise reduction and sound. The improvement in sound reduction is not decisive or easy to perceive. I consider that it cancels the same amount of noise.Next I will discuss in detail the other changes from the previous version:- Design: The design on this version is incredible. The quality always comes out above the rest of things. Bose has redesigned the handset, compared to the QC15 and the only thing that remained are certain functions. On the outside we can see that the handset can bend as previously mentioned, something that is extremely useful because it will occupy much less space in our bag. Also, the outside of the headset has been redesigned and is now based on a lightweight brushed aluminium that is extremely beautiful sight design. On the inner side we can see that retains the pleasant pads. Now on the inside of the headset shows a letter indicating the ear where you wear them- Features: as previously mentioned the main feature and most important is the ability to cancel the sound. This works with constant noise because it has a microphone that generates an inverse frequency to cancel the sound. It can be used on a boat, plane, train, etc. It won't cancel when a person speaks but you will hear it much lower because the headset itself cancels part of the noise as it covers the ears. It has an excellent sound quality and fidelity which is a Bose feature. It is interesting that the cable can be removed and also has batteries. Uses AAA batteries that last about 10 long-distance flights (in my experience).- Packaging: it comes in a cardboard packaging as we are accustomed  and inside a case that is what we will use from now on when we travel. Inside the case you can put the cable, headphones, airplane adapter and an extra battery in case we run out of battery at some point.I've given it four stars because the headphones are excellent but still have room for improvement. By this I mean the possibility of being Bluetooth, the battery being rechargeable and because they are sometimes uncomfortable if you use them for a lot of time because your ears  will sweat or put pressure (usually on the plane). The price is high but also the quality of this headset is worth it.

VI usually don't write a lot of reviews for things I buy, but I was compelled to write one for these headphones. Not because of how great they are, but how mediocre their quality is in my opinion. I would like to give a word of caution to everyone considering these headphones. I currently own a pair of Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones. I have had to get these headphones replaced twice in less than two weeks because of issues with the headphones. I bought the first pair of QuietComfort 25 headphones just over two months ago from Best Buy. They worked great for two months and then one fine day they just died. Bose customer care was kind enough to swap them for new ones because they were still under warranty. I then got the new ones in about two weeks after I spoke with them on the phone. I had used the second pair for less than a day when I started noticing weird problems with it. The noise canceling would stop when I tapped the headphones lightly or when I tried to adjust the headphones. If I was listening to music the music would stop as well. So I returned the second pair in less than two days of receiving it. Bose customer care was kind enough to swap them again for new ones(but this time I was charged a shipping fee even though I received faulty equipment). I finally got the third pair today. I opened the box a few minutes ago and within less than five minutes of using it I have noticed the same problem happening again. The music/noise canceling stops when I lightly tap my headphones or when I move my head or try to adjust my headphones. I'm quite frustrated and I don't want to call their  customer care and go through the swap process again (and who knows what and how much I will have to pay for this time). This is my first purchase from Bose and it has been a less than a pleasant experience. I paid close to $300 for these headphones, and have been quite underwhelmed. The headphones were great while they worked, but I cannot help but think that there is a bigger problem here with their manufacturing.

p247

VWell, I already own the QC15 headsets, and figured if bose came out with an upgrade i'd give it a shot.  These headphones supposedly took 5 years to come out since the QC15's were launched. Most said the sound quality much better than the QC15. Well, these headphones don't even hold a candle to the QC15's as far as sound quality is concerned.  They sound flat, and the voice sounds muffled is the only way I can describe it compared to the QC15's. What I'm amazed is how much better the QC15's sound compared to these. The voice cancellation is about the same on both and the comfort level on the QC25's is good. The construction is okay, no problem, but its all about the sound quality. The studio beats sound better, but are much more uncomfortable than these or the 15's.  For the money save yourself a few dollars and if still available pick up the QC15's, you'll be much happier and save yourself a few bucks. Im shocked that Bose put out such an awful set of headphones.

I don't have time to send them in so i took them apart to see if it was a poor connection, but it turned out that the driver itself had failed, the coil was no longer correctly lined up with the magnet for some reason, not sure why.  I always kept them in the case.  To be honest I noticed a huge quality difference in these when i opened them up.  They made everything soon cheap.  The noise canceling worked very well but the sound quality sucked, especially when you had the noise canceling turned off.  I will never buy a bose product again.  Its just a name, hopefully people catch on to the sub par quality they are pumping out.  I wish more companies were like apple and took pride in quality products.

VDON't get for BUS rides. the vibrations travel through the headphones and ruin the music
p273
sg5
VI have a few very important things to review about this headphone. 1st this headphone does an amazing job at noise cancelling ( especially low constant frequencies) however, the higher frequencies still come through, but slightly muffled. If you have NC on and someone is talking to you, you will here the top upper half of their vocal tone (although muted somewhat) but the lower frequencies of there speech will be gone. If you're trying to block out loud speaking and its a dude, you're going to kill most of the sound, however, children screaming or annoying high-pitched women still come through.the sound is a little sloppy, the base is too loose, the treble is a little to shrill and a HUGE HUGE annoyance is that the speakers tend to distort and crackle at louder parts of your music. this is really bad right out of the box. However, after about a hundred hours of music at reasonable volume, these headphones clean up nicely, the base gets a little tighter, the shrill treble cuts down and the crackling is greatly reduced to a much more tolerable amount. overall, the best sound one can expect is about a B to B+.i got these for studying (I am a collage student) and for my daily bus rides to and from school. for studying alone i would have payed 200 dollar because these headphones are sooooooooooooooo comfortable and the NC is priceless. however, i can not use these on the BUS at all. the bus bouncing causes vibrations that transfer through the seat, up your body and into your headphones. this causes repeated air compressions that make your music very inconsistent and very irritating to listen to so if your getting these for your bus ride (the bumps are the only problem) then don't. but for plain rides i wouldn't get anything else.

One thing I didn't notice before purchasing is that there is an Iphone/Ipod/Ipad version and a Samsung/Android version.  I don't beleive there is a choice.  I have a Samsung but received the Applr version.  The headphones work fine, only the volume and microphone don't ...no big deal.  I purchased the samsung/android line in microphone on their website.

Knocking off one star for music quality.  Maybe it's not possible to have great sound and great noise-cancelling, I certainly haven't found any others that do it better.  These stay in their case for me when I'm on the ground, because I can get a $100 set of phones that sound better.  Most of my flights I spend listening  to podcasts or Audiobooks so it's not really a big issue.

VNoise blocking of QC15, Better Sound
p290
sg5
VThe Bose QuietComfort 25 are amazing.  The sound is great and the noise cancelling is the best you can get in a pair of over the ear headphones.  The sound is really full and unlike many other headphones really busy music with lots of individual sounds doesn't muddy together.There are three minor shortcomings.  The first is that you can't charge them off of a USB cable; instead they only take AAA batteries.  This means while traveling you either have to carry extra AAA batteries or bring a AAA charger.  The battery life is impressive; if you use them 8 hours a day a single battery will last several days, but it's easy to forget and leave them on over the weekend and come back on a Monday to a dead battery.  The second shortcoming is that the bass is only adequate; at this price I would really have hoped for even more bass.  The third shortcoming is the price, which is quite high and price alone may make you consider another model even though you can't find better at any price.Comparison to the QuietComfort 15 (aka the previous best noise cancelling headphones):If you already own a pair of QC15 these probably aren't worth the upgrade, but if you are choosing between the two these are better.  All reviewers agree that the noise cancelling of the previous model Bose QC 15 is the best noise cancelling you can get in a pair of over the ear headphones.  Many reviewers thought that the sound they produced was just OK.  I compared the two side by side in a loud cubicle environment.  I was equally impressed with the noise cancelling of both models, they managed to greatly reduce outside noise, especially constant noise like computer fans.  I think the QC 25 also look a bit more stylish than the QC15, in a low key way.  The styling definitely doesn't say "look at me" like pair of Beats headphones does.  The sound on the QC25 is improved, with better bass (but only adequate), and more distinct sound in busy music.  The overall impression is that music sounds richer and fuller.  I heard things in music that you just couldn't hear with the QC15.  Another win for the QC25 is that if the battery dies on the QC15 you can't listen to music at all, without a battery the QC15 is useless.  With the QC25 you can listen to music even though the sound quality is a notch lower and you lose the noise cancelling.  Without a battery the sound quality is still higher than a low end pair of headphones.  Not working at all with a dead battery is probably the number one shortcoming of the QC15 and it's nice to see it fixed in the QC25.Comparison with Sennheiser:I have a pair of Sennheiser noise cancelling over the ear headphones.  These have better sound than the Bose QC15 but less good noise cancelling.  Comparing them to the QC25 I have to say that the QC25 come out on top.  The audio of the QC25 is now better by a hair, and the noise cancelling is clearly superior.  It used to be that you had to choose sound quality (Sennheiser) or noise cancelling (Bose), but now the Bose QC25 wins on both.

VThis is my third set of Bose noise canceling headphones. I started with the original QuietComfort 'phones with the separate box for battery and electronics. They worked fine, but the electronics/battery box made it a little clunky, especially if you just wanted quiet, and no music.I upgraded to the QC2 (v2) headphones, and have been perfectly happy with those until the "leather" earpiece muffs and headband started to disintegrate. the earpiece muffs are replaceable, but the headband padding is not. Being well out of guarantee, Bose couldn't/wouldn't do anything about it, other than sell me new earpiece covers, or give me a discount (not very much) on a new set of QC15s.I have been living without for a while now, but gave in when I saw the QC25 being advertised.What has improved:Well, the case is smaller, made possible by hinging the earpieces.The LED is less obtrusive (not that it was that bad before).Usable without a battery is ok - but I never suffered from that problem. Just remember to carry a spare battery.The inclusion of the mic and control buttons in the cable is fine ... if you have an iPhone. Since Apple try to ensure that their stuff is always proprietary, and avoid standards like the plague, this, of course doesn't work well with the market leader - Android.The headband is no longer the soft "leather" used previously, so will probably not disintegrate with use.Noise suppression is possibly a bit better than my old QC2.Retrograde steps:The finish and material of the headband padding is, well, cheap.Previous versions had cases with locations specifically dedicated to storing the cable. This one does not, and there is really not even room to just cram it in. I can see lots of these getting lost/damaged.Hinged earpieces ... hard to say if this helps with getting a good fit over the ears. I suspect that it might, but its also one more thing to break. Time will tell on that front. Getting the headset back into the case is definitely more of a task than it was previously, having to manipulate the headset to the right shape, the screw around with the cable.UPDATEI have now had a few flights to evaluate these in the environment I intended them for.The noise suppression is better than the previous version that I have owned. Different on different types of plane, as you might expect.On an A320, the noise is reduced to a higher pitched white noise sound, with the whirr/buzz from the high bypass engines just a background purr. Other sounds are still audible, but you have to listen carefully when someone speaks to you.On an RJ700 is almost just pure silence, smaller engines without the buzz of the A320 engines, and less AC/ventilation roar.Playing music through them, even at a relatively low volume, you won't hear anything.In the hotel, watching video on an iPad they you don't hear any of the normal noises, AC - gone, noisy people in the corridor - gone.I do find the lack of storage for the cord to be a pain, probably more than I expected. I am convinced that none of the designers or Bose execs ever tried traveling with the included case. Given the price I consider this to be a major fault. How hard would it have been to put one of the stick-on webbing pouches they used previously onto the case lid?

VI was very excited to get my first ever noise cancellation headphones. I loved them when I got them, the noise cancellation was really good and the sound quality was good, not the best but good nonetheless. After the honeymoon phase was over is when it happened, after 4 months of use, the left earpiece stopped working and it wasn't like I didn't take care of them, I kept them in the case after every single use. I got the replacement from Bose and I have fingers crossed. TLDR; Good headphones, but the left earpiece had issues after 4 months, cheap  build quality.

p307

VNoise cancelling is very good although not as powerful as that of Parrot Zik Headphones. On the other hand, I find these headphones to be very comfortable to wear due to its light weight. Ear cups are larger enough as well. I got the white version and they look very nice. I am very satisfied with the headphones.Update: After having these headphones for a few days, I feel that the noise canceling is even better than what I felt. There have been career fairs on campus these two days and you can imagine how noisy everywhere is. These headphones almost cancel out all the noise. So, in that aspect, the headphones are excellent.I also find two minor shortcomes. First, to fold/unfold the headphones, you need to twist the earcups. This always gives me the feeling that I will break them. Given the brand and build quality, they probably won't be that easy to be broken. However, it still makes me feel nervous. Second, to put the headphones in the carrying case, I always need to disconnect the cable from the headphones as the case is designed as small as it can be (so if you leave the cable there, it will stick out a little). This is also the case for some other headphones. However, the hole of these headphones is very deep and this makes it a little hard to plug the cable in. This is just a bit annoying for me, but might be a problem for some people. Overall, I would still give these headphone five stars.

VChanged my life on airplanes
p313
sg5
VThis review will concentrate on using these on airplanes. I have seen folks for years with headsets on airplanes, but I have always just used either the ones supplied by the flight, or sometimes my own earbud style. The earbuds however are just too uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Recently, I had to travel to Australia from the US, and that involves some very long flights. Upon arrival in Sydney, my ears hurt and I was pretty tired from lack of sleep. While waiting for a connection, I saw some TKD brand noise canceling headphones on sale for $99 in the airport. I also tried on the Bose QC25, but I just couldn't bring myself to spend $300, so I took a chance and bought the TDK NC 400.The TDK NC400 were OK. The ear muffs were round, so I guess they are knows as "on the ear" style, not "over the ear". The noise canceling worked, but I wasn't overwhelmed by it, and in part that is probably due to the ear muff not really covering my ears, so a little sound gets past the muffs. They also weren't super comfortable. Again, this is the ear muff style, not a brand thing. After a few hours more flying, I realized that a really good noise canceling headset could make a difference. Three weeks later, heading back through Sydney, I purchased these Bose QC25 and wore them all the way back to JFK; about 20 hours of flying. I will never fly without them again.They were the most comfortable way to listen to music or watch the in-flight movies I have ever worn. The noise canceling is outstanding, and I really didn't hear the background noise at all. At one point, I turned off the music and just left the noise canceling on, and I slept for about 6 hours without disturbance. I felt much more rested when we arrived in LA than I ever had after 15 hours of flying.When they are on my head, I can barely even feel them as they are so light and the cushioning is so soft and well made. They are very easy to adjust and don't pinch on your head.I can only compare these to the TDK NC400 that I also had. In my opinion, there is no comparison - the Bose are in a completely different league. Yes, they are 3 times the price, but I have to admit that they are 3 times better.PROS:- super comfortable- amazing noise canceling- really nice carry case.CONS:- not wireless (would be a nice feature)- not even discrete.- large muffs may interfere with your ability to rest your head on a pillow when compared to earbudsIf you are thinking about noise canceling headsets, I would urge you to consider these. Using them for a 15 hour flight made me a believer.

VI LOVE these earphones when they are working. I use them very regularly while studying to reduce ambient noise and enhance my ability to concentrate on the material at hand.But as things stand, I'm currently on my third pair of them (all replaced under the 1 year warranty) in just eight months of ownership. I always keep the headphones in their case when they are not in use. They've never been dropped, etc. Both of the failed headphone sets had the right earphone go out after similar amounts of use, and I suspect this is due to a short in a wire due to the folding mechanism stretching cables. Bose made me pay for shipping on the second pair, but were otherwise happy to replace both defective headphones.This is my second Bose product. The first was an expensive pair of in-ear earphones that broke once during the warranty period, and again a few months later just outside of the warranty. Bose declined to cover the cost of replacement once they were out of the warranty. I want to like Bose products, but the construction quality and/or durable design is just not present. I was hoping their highest end headset would be of higher durability, but this doesn't seem to be the case. I wanted to give this product 5 stars, but I cannot do so unless Bose addresses quality issues. When I pay $300 for headphones, I really expect them to last *far* more than a few months.Pros:-Very comfortable for long periods of wear-Decent sound quality-Amazing cancellation of ambient noise-Fairly compact when in the included case-Detachable audio cable-1 battery is included to get you startedCons:-Flaw in design or product quality has led to two replacements in a short period of time.-$300 (+shipping when they break) is a lot of money for something you will likely need to replace yearly-Shipping is not paid for by Bose when the product fails

VGreat Noise Canceling
p323
sg5
VThese things are awesome! Despite being a bit of a Bose nut myself, I do know there's probably better sounding headphones out there; However, for my purpose (office environment) the noise canceling on these headphones is great. As other reviewers state, you can hear a VERY slight hiss from the noise canceling, but music playing at a really low volume easily covers it up. If you see the picture I've attached, that is my desk, and the big silver thing in the ceiling is the office AC; I literally sit about 15 feet away from the fan unit. Obviously, my office gets annoyingly loud. With these things on and playing music from my Mac at about half volume, I can't even tell if the AC is on or not. Note that you do still hear high frequency noises (other people typing, high heels walking, some female voices talking, etc.), but the noise canceling is great for low rumbles like street traffic, HVAC systems, and presumably airplanes, though I haven't tested that yet.I do really like the removable wire, and that if it fails you can buy a replacement for cheap instead of forking over another $300 for a new set of headphones. I also like that the cord goes only to one side of the headphones, rather than a wire to each ear. These two advantages are the sole purpose I bought these over the QC20i's. I would expect the QC20i's to be more comfortable since they're obviously lighter, but the QC25's have yet to hurt me at all. If you wear glasses that stick far off your head, that might be a problem, but I wear these with what I would 'normal' glasses and it's just fine.Battery life seems to be good, but I've only had these for a few days. I bought some rechargeable AAA's so I won't even have to worry about it.I would DEFINITELY advise looking for a Bose store to check these out at and make sure they're right for you. Also, I did NOT pay $300 for these. The Bose store I went to had a "Factory Renewed" inventory of these headphones. My understanding is that these are products someone has bought and returned, and they go through all of Bose's testing to make sure everything still works. They do say there may be minor cosmetic damage, but these are the second thing I've bought Factory Renewed and they look absolutely perfect, you'd never know; they just don't come in retail packing. All that said, I got these things Factory Renewed for $240 at my local Bose store, and there's a return period as well. So definitely check that out too!

VGreat, but I like the QC15's better, here's why....
p339
sg5
VThe QC25's are certainly great Headphones. HOWEVER. I bought these for my girlfriend for her birthday. I have the QC15's and I think they're fantastic. I was kind of frustrated when the 25's came out because I bought the 15's only last spring... but as it turns out, I actually think the QC15's sound just as good if not a little better, the 15's definitely get louder than the 25's. So, if you like your music good and loud, go with the QC15's NOT the 25's. On the same device with the same song playing, only swapping out the headphones, the 15's are remarkably louder, with great sound quality. The 25's were great too, just not as loud.Now, with all of that said, the 25's are a little sleaker, still come with a great carrying case and still fold up nice and compact for travel. There is one more major improvement in the 25's over the 15's: When the battery dies, and the power is off, you can still listen to music, just without noise cancellation. The 15's completely die when the batteries die.My recommendation: If you're on the fence between the 15's and the 25's, buy the 15's, you'll save some cash and in my opinion, have a better set of headphones. If you're on the fence between the 25's and any other brand, buy the 25's all day.Bose makes the best noise cancellation headphones with out question. I wore mine on a 14 hour flight to Japan followed by a 7 hour flight to Bali, and I don't know how I did it before. I now get anxious just looking at airplanes without my Bose on.

p344
sg5
VThe first time I used the headphones was on a business trip to Europe, at the beginning I was amazed by the quality of sound and the noise-cancellation. After only 10 minutes of using the product I started to notice that the from time to time I lose the sound, completely, for a second and then it comes back again. The headphones comes with '56 in QC25 inline remote and microphone cable' which you need to plug into the headphones. Apparently something is wrong inside the headphones and every movement causes the lost of sound. During the entire flight I was forcing myself to stay in specific angels which didn't caused the lost of sound.I wouldn't expect such an unprofessional assemble and lack of quality assurance from Bose and specifically from an headphones which cost 300$, I am very disappointed!

VFor $300 I expected way more. These headphones lead an incredible amount of sound, which makes them almost useless for an office. In order to listen to music at any reasonable volume I found my colleagues were also listening to my music. The sound quality was pretty good, but the lower frequency range seemed to not be very powerful. The headphones are great, but you can get similar quality headphones for around $150 which is my I'm going three stars here.They work great on airplanes and places that are loud and ideally want noise cancellation. If that's all you want, go for it, but if you plan on using these in your office I would look for something with more noise isolation in the headphones themselves.

sg5
VI have been using these for about 2 weeks now. I really like them overall. They are extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time - I use them bout 5-6 hours a day in a large open office. The noise-canceling does a great job of blocking out what I don't want - and letting me listen to whatever I'm streaming. I wish the bass was a little more heavy, though. Battery life is excellent - and while it's not important, I love the extra battery storage in the case. The case itself is pretty good, but softer rather then a hard shell case. I'd recommend them if you have some gift cards to use (like I did) and work in a loud office or fly frequently. Oh, and get ready for people to ask you about them...

Very impressive!  They performed so much better than I expected and they were quite comfortable for the 3.5 hour trip.  I own other Bose products and have always been impressed with their quality and performance.  I would highly recommend these headphones especially for travelers.

VOut of the box, look good, and first impression of noise cancellation was amazing (first set of noise canceling headphones I've ever purchased, so no basis of comparison). Sound quality, however, leaves a lot to be desired! I'm not an audiophile by any definition (Since my last in-ear headphones went out 2 months ago, I've been using Apple's standard issue headphones with no complaints). I got these for the noise canceling function since I spend 4+ hours in an airplane each week, and that time is usually early in the morning when I could use the sleep.I've heard that they need to be "broken in" over about 100 hours, which sounds crazy to me. I'll just see how they sound 29 days in (1 day before Bose's money back guarantee lapses)Overall, the sound is okay-- just know that you are making a significant compromise for the noise canceling amazing-ness. Since Bose is widely regarded as best in class doe noise canceling products, this is probably the best you can get anyway. Just don't expect rich bass (I don't mean skull wrenching, thumping base: I mean crisp, clear bass).

VMy battery died on on bluetooth wireless Sennheiser MM550 and replacing it will cost me around $50. I am looking into Bose hoping to find a pair to replace Sennheiser better lasting. Went to local BestBuy to pick these up and tried them. I will review these area such as noise cancelling, sound quality, comfort with long use, compatibility. I'll be comparing these to Sennheiser MM550 because I'm replacing them.Let's get to it:1) Noise cancelling - on par with Sennheiser MM550. I find Bose to have less humming noise compare to Sennheiser and therefore less annoying.2) Sound quality - Bose is wired, yet, their quality with battery is okay, without battery, it is horrible. Sennheiser is way superior to Bose. I have them both on high volume and I love Sennheiser more. I'm sorry Bose, you dropped the ball on these. On top of that, Sennheiser MM550 is wireless bluetooth which mean Bose should beat easily but quality dropped dramatically. With SRS on, Bose sounds like a $50 headphones.3) Comfort in long use - Bose is lighter, more comfortable. I used Sennheiser for studying in area such as Starbucks and libraries. They last about 4-5 hrs before battery needs to be recharged. I take them off and discover that I have sweaty ears from these. Bose is a winner in this area. Very comfortable even with my glasses on. Bose sit nicely without squeezing my glass frame into my skull.4) Compatibility - Bose dropped the balls big time when they don't support Android with their remote cord. I cannot use it with my Galaxy Note 4 which run Android 4.4.4. Not even volume control work. I tried plugging into my Surface Pro 2. It does nothing to control musics or volume. Work fine with iOS device.I gave these 3 stars before. They don't work with android, and their sound quality is below average. I am a medical students. I needs headphones that I can wear for a very long period of time to study.

VI bought these to use during flights and recently used them on a trip to SE Asia from the States equaling about 50+ hours total of flying economy, longest flight was about 18 hours.I use them with music on volume 3 or so, sound deadening on. Simply put- they work great:Yes they block out all the great things you hear when flying econ: crying kids, people praying during descents/landings, people coughing, snoring, hocking up a third lung of phlegm, panic melt downs etc.Yes they block out your S.O. sitting next to you as they complain about "blah blah blah" while you listen to your favorite music on a 12+ hour flight in pure bliss; allows you just to smile, sorta nod your head like you heard them.Yes the music sounds great and airplane media sounds good too.Yes they still block out a considerable amount of noise even if the battery is dead or you switch off noise canceling.Yes they fit comfortably and work fine with glasses.My ears did not hurt even after wearing them for 10 hours straight.With no music and noise canceling switched on they still block out 90% of the background. It's eerie really with no music, put the headphones on and turn on the noise canceling, you hear a little "pop" and everything goes quiet.Batteries are lasting about 25-30 hours of use.Overall probably in my top 3 of favorite things I've purchased this year, kept me sane during some really noisy long flights and transfers and blocked out a lot of unwanted jibber jabber.For students, they also work great if you're doing homework, studying for finals, finding extra credit answers on Chegg etc. and need to block out surrounding noise. I use them at work too, helps me ignore my coworkers.Overall great product, thanks Bose.

VBest for 13 hour flight to Taipei
p419
sg5
VI had a few trips lined up this year to Taiwan and Japan. I'm a somewhat frequent flier and I've always disliked the engine noise back in coach and regular ear buds just don't help at all, in fact they make it worse because I have to turn the volume up and I don't even realize how loud they are until after landing, by then my ears are bleeding. Regular headphones work to a point but if I have to be on a plane for over 13 hours I'm going to treat myself. I got to LAX and had a 5 hour layover and sprung for these in white. I had some video content loaded on my iPhone so I watched that for 3/4 of the trip, then fell asleep. First time I've ever really slept on a plane. When we landed and as I was walking to the border control checkpoint at Taipei terminal I realized how good I felt. I just flew for a combined 19 hours and a long layover in LAX and while I can't say I was ready for an evening out on the town, I can say that I've always felt much worse after the 5 or 6 hours of a domestic flight. I didn't have that exhaustion that I always have after even a couple hours flight.These were the best investment I could have made for traveling, and a bargain at $300 given I have 5 more trans-pacific flights to make by the end of this year.For you audiophiles out there looking at these, take note: these are not for you if you are looking for huge bass, perfect treble and perfect balance at all ranges. These are not going to blast your ears off with perfect sound. These are for people who want quiet, and very good sound for music and movies. It's kind of silly to ding a product in a review based on a standard that the manufacturer never intended. Bose does not market these that way so you should not expect it. When the phones are turned off, yea, the music sounds pretty bad. Turn them on and the quiet created by the noise cancelling allows you to really hear the details of the audio without having to blast the volume and make your ears bleed. That's what these headphones are all about, quiet for quality sound.

VA GREAT all-around, versatile set of headphones
p424
sg5
VBeing that I have the Bose QC15, the reviews on the QC25 had me wondering if it would behoove me to upgrade.The long of the short is: I did upgrade. I ended up purchasing the QC25 locally at BB (same price). The factors that I considered in upgrading were: I own an iPhone 6 Plus, the QC25 compact headphone case and more importantly, the ability to listen to the headphones even if the battery dies on you.Using the Bose QC25 with my iPhone has been wonderful. The mic on the cord has three controls. An up arrow, down arrow, and the center button. Up/down arrow for volume control. The center button for manipulating the controls on the iPhone while listening to the headphones. In the music mode, you can skip tracks, repeat tracks, pause, and more - all from the center button. While listening to the music and a call comes in, the music is reduced alerting you to a call, and you simply hit the center button and answer your call. You can hit the center button to end the call and continue your music. You can also use the center button to engage Siri. If you need to make a call, just hold the button and Siri comes on. Tell Siri what you want to do and go from there. It's simply slick and easy to use.One of the problems I've had with my QC15 is that I tend to forget to turn it off which results in a dead battery. WHat do I do? I end up going to one of those Hudson stores at the airport and pay an exorbitant amount of money for some AAA batteries. Now, if I forget, I can just use the head phone for music or movies (albeit, no noise suppression) but I am no longer sitting on a plane with a useless headphone due to a dead battery. Granted, it isn't as loud or clear as it is with a battery but it sure beats the alternative.Others have commented about using this for conference calling. I use it often for conference calls while plugged into my iPhone. Everyone has stated that they hear me loud and crystal clear. All the more reasons I'm very pleased with this set of Bose QC25.Last but not least, the compact headphone case. It's nice that the right ear cup is designed to fold in so that you can put these headphones in a compact case. It doesn't take up as much room in my backpack. Some have commented that it's not as easy to place your headphones in this case, but I've not had that experience. Very pleased with Bose's well thought out design changes and improvements.PROS: Design, compact case, intuitive mic controls, compatibility with iPhones, battery optionsCONS: None noted.

p429
sg5
VI'm not an audiophile (understatement of the decade). I'm not a technophile (my current iPhone 5 is the first smartphone I've ever owned.) I've never owned a pair of headphones before, noise-cancelling or otherwise. I was interested in these headphones for two reasons. First, I wanted to be able to listen to music and podcasts on my iPhone at work without bothering anyone else. Second, I travel some on business and I wanted a pair of noise-cancelling headphones to wear while flying to help block out background noises and to listen to in-flight movies/TV and listen to music/podcasts on my iPhone or laptop. Unfortunately, I haven't been on any trips lately, so I can't yet speak to the performance of the headphones during air travel.The noise-cancelling feature works perfectly for me. It definitely eliminates or greatly reduces background noises, but, while voices are softened, I can still hear them well enough that people can easily get my attention.The volume control on the cord works well and as it is intended to when using my iPhone. It does not work at all when using my HP laptop, so I have to adjust the volume using the volume control on the laptop. In order to get the volume below ear-splitting levels on my laptop, I have to lower the volume almost to nothing, so there is very little fine tuning of volume available when using the headphones on the laptop.I did notice some reduction in sound quality when the noise-cancellation feature is off, but for me the headphones are still perfectly usable even if the battery goes dead. With noise-cancellation on, the sound quality is excellent (by my standards).In order for these headphones to be really comfortable, I have to take my earrings off (even small ones that don't extend below the bottom of my ear lobe). If I'm going to wear them for any length of time, it also helps to take my glasses off.The headphones are well made. They feel very solid when handling them. The hard-sided case is small enough to fit into my briefcase on a daily back-and-forth to work basis, but it's going to be a bit of a squeeze on business trips. I may have to shift a few things that I normally put in the briefcase over to my suitcase. Overall, I am satisfied with these headphones, although I have to admit that having to take my earrings off is a pain and may, in the end, reduce my use of the headphones.

VMy husband gave these to me for Christmas. He has them and loves them. I will say that they provide awesome sound quality and the noise cancelling function makes it an even better experience. However, after wearing these for two days, 4+ hours each day...I have a mild case of vertigo. Wearing these would be the only thing that would cause this. I am nauseous and my balance is all messed up. I read that noise cancelling headphones affect people differently and it seems I am one of those people that can't handle it. I don't think I will wear them again because I feel so crumby. Bummer, because they are very nice.

p439

VThe sound is incredible on these! I switched from regular in-ear apple bud earphones and my music sounds completely different now; the songs come to life when you are using them. I took them on an airplane and you can't hear any of the background noise - it makes it feel like you are not really on an airplane, so it's great for people with flight anxiety. There is also a really loud person that sits near me at work and these help drown them out. Since I don't have to turn the music up as loud, they are probably helping to protect my hearing.I tried out a few different kinds of noise cancelling headphones at a store before I settled on these - the sound on the Beats and Sony versions are also very good but I found this one to be the most light/comfortable. Since I knew I'd be wearing them for long periods of time, I bought the Bose ones.The only 2 annoying things about these are:1. How quickly the battery drains but I'm sure most headphones with noise cancelling capability have a similar issue2. The inline remote doesn't work when you're connected to the computer - only when you are using it on your phone (I have only used them with an iPhone, I am not sure about Android phones).

p445
sg5
VSometimes, to save money or just for plain old exercise, I walk to work. It's only a 3 mile walk but it can be boring without some music and the problem I've had was my music being drowned out by passing cars and trucks with ear buds. I realized it was time to step up and buy some noise canceling headphones so I went with a name I trust and I wasn't disappointed.I don't have to blast my music and damage my hearing to hear the music that's drowned out from the noise of traffic like I did before. I just put these headphones on and I'm immersed in my own little world of music as I walk to work. Death Metal and all the other sub genres od Metal sound great on these headphones, as does Classical, Jazz and Scottish music (I listen to a little bit of everything). All of the sounds of traffic seem so far away and I can actually hear my music without having to turn up the volume so loud. They're also great for using at home if you're listening to music at work during lunch and you dont want to disturb others.The Bose QC-25's may be expensive but they're worth the money, in my opinion. If your going to spend that kind of money on headphones, always go with Bose.

VBuyer Beware-Price Doesn't Match Quality
p467

VI bought these headphones approximately 7 months ago. Within the first 2-3 months I noticed that the sound on the right side would intermittently cut out. Now, 7 months later, the right side is completely broken and will not play any sound. I am incredibly frustrated by this experience. These headphones are not inexpensive. They have been used extremely gently. There is no reason other than faulty production and poor quality for these headphones to stop working in this amount of time.I will be calling customer service to have them exchanged. This is my first time buying Bose and there isn't any way I would buy a product from them again. It's too much money for too poor quality of construction. It's a shame though-the quality of the sound and noise canceling ability is actually fairly nice (when they are working).

VAbsolutely love these. I purchased these based upon reviews from others that say they can't hear plane engines while using them. I never have used these headphones before but all I can say is WOW! I can't believe how much noise it eliminates when you turn on the noise cancelling. It also boosts the audio output so music/audio sounds better.I took these around my office with no source connected to them and had people just test out the noise cancelling on/off feature. Opinions varied on the technology but everyone thought it did an amazing job at eliminating noise in our server rooms and other sources of noise in our office.I never thought I would see so much value in a $300 pair of headphones... I would definitely buy these again and I'm even thinking about a second pair for home!

VI purchased these for long days of studying in the campus library.  Between the doors opening and closing non stop and people taking calls in the STUDY ROOM, I couldn't focus.  These solved my problem!  They give me absolute focus, and I purchased Amazonbasic batteries that work wonderfully.  I read a few reviews expressing concern that they don't block out loud noises.  I can say that extremely loud noises, (as a toilet-bowl flushing), is not totally drowned out but they decrease the noise to a whisper.  They serve the purpose I expected.  I have purchased in ear Bose before, and the cable from a pair stopped working, so I will keep an eye out for this.  I hope this review has helped.  Anyone that needs a peaceful focus in order to get work done, this headphone will work for you.

I haven't even got to wear them on a plane yet! Now fyi, I was plugging the cable into the headphones and walking on the treadmill at the same time when they stopped working. Nothing rough enough to break them at all! Was pretty careful with them... put them in their case as soon as I'm done using them etc. They were awesome while they were working properly, but yeahhh, disappointed. If you need headphones that are reliable, don't buy them. If you need good noise-cancelling and it's easy for you to organize having them fixed when they do break, go ahead

VQC25s are 50 grams heavier and clamp stronger than QC 15s which significantly reduces comfort
p506
sg5
VI rarely if ever write reviews but I felt compelled to write this one as my opinion is quite different than most.  As it stands, the majority of reviews focus on sound quality and noise cancellation, I don't see there is much to discuss here especially in comparison to the QC 15 so I will focus on comfort which is my main concern and I believe it should be that of anyone wearing these headphone for long periods (travel, work and so on).  The QC 15 are definitely more comfortable, why? well for two main reasons: First they weight 145 grams as opposed to about 195 grams for the QC 25, this is a significant different, an increase of almost 33%.  Second the clamping mechanism is harder for the QC 25 which means you feel more pressure on your ears and skull, this makes them less comfortable if your head is above average in size.  It is worth noticing that my head is quite large yet I don't need to pull the retractable part by more than one tick which in my opinion indicates a design flaw for theses headphones.  Bottom line, value for money and in comparison to the QC 15, I regret buying them.

VThe Bose QuietComfort 25 is so awesome.the noise cancellation is almost perfect.the material is so good. everything about it is SO good.though I have few problems:- my ears are getting really warm after using it- when I use it on specific devices like (PS4) the volume is really low.but I totally recommended it to anyone who wants to live in his own head.

VThe 25 is definitely better. The difference would not be very noticeable at first!
p597
sg5
VCompared to my Bose QC 15, this one is not worth the upgrade.Let us start with the GOODS: in terms of comfort and portability, the 25 is definitely better. The noise cancellation also improved slightly.As for the CONS: the new sound signature is not for me. I prefer the 15 over this one. The 25 has a higher bass emphasis which muffled the mids and highs. If you are a bass person, i guess this headphone is for you. If not, then look else where.If you want sound quality, check out Beoplay H6 or H8 (this one has Noise Cancellation).Update 08/2015: I bought this product again due to portable demands that my qc 15 could not offer. Of course, I got a good deal. After some burn in time, I compared the the 15 and 25 again. The 25 has better passive noise isolate and improved lower frequency noise cancellation (try it with the AC and you will see what I mean). In terms of sound quality, the bass of the 25 is still sloppy compared to other headphones I have like the Senheiser HD 598. The problem is I don't feel any punch from the 25. The bass on the HD 598 is a lot tighter. The vocals on the 25 is an improvement, probably because of the more emphasis on the higher-mids. Overall, I enjoyed this product and change my mind that this is worth an upgrade, eventhough the differences are not that noticeable at first. Give it some burn in time and you will be surprised.

VFrom a grad student that has loud and obnoxious undergrad roommates...
p602
sg5
VThis is literally my life saver, and I don't know why I waited so long to purchase this. The price is surely a turnoff for people with a budget, but if you're looking for the best headphones to block out external noises, this is as good as you're gonna get. I was stupid enough to wait until the last minute to get an apartment so I ended up with 2 loud undergrad roommates that seem to not study at all and just gossip all day and night. I couldn't focus on studying and had to leave every time to study elsewhere, and the library is too far away for my taste so I just ended up choking up the money to purchase this.This does NOT block them out completely, because their volume is just over the top. However, if I play some classical songs over their noise, their voices easily become white noise to me. That is amazing, considering their volume (I've tried to get them to quiet down multiple times, but they just don't seem to understand that concept.)The only thing that I REALLY don't like about this headset is how uncomfortable it gets after a while. I have a fairly normal sized skull, I would say, and a decently sensitive head--this headphone gets so painful in a few hours that I have to constantly take it off and chill for a bit before putting it back on. This is great for break time, but when I need to cram, it gets annoying that I can't block out my roommates. If you are going to be spending long hours with this headphone, then maybe you should take that into consideration.One last thing, I'm not really an audiophile so don't take my word for this or anything, but the sound performance is only above average. It definitely sounds better than your normal $10-30 headphones/earbuds, but nothing really extraordinary. I wouldn't purchase this for the sound quality.TL;DR: If you're looking for top-notch noise cancelling headphones, these are for you. If you are going to be wearing them for long hours, it might squeeze your brains a bit. If you are an audiophile and are looking for amazing sound quality, these are NOT for you.

VThe Bose QC25s are excellent headphones. Overpriced? I think not.
p608
sg5
VSo to start off, being a previous QC15 owner, the QC25s are not overly better than the QC15s. I would say that the only reason to upgrade to the 25s might be the new design. However, for those who have never owned a QC15, you will love the QC25s.In terms of sound quality, the QC25s sound very similar to the older QC15s but the bass and clarity is improved on the new QC25s. Everything sounds much tighter with better fidelity.The effectiveness of noise cancellation seems the same to be quite honest.Comfort is still phenomenal on the 25s. The QC15s were incredibly light and comfortable, and the tradition remains. The QC15 was one of the few headphones I could wear for long, long periods of time, and I'm glad that the QC25s continue to be insanely comfortable.In terms of design, I much prefer the look of the new 25s. The 25s look much more modern and youthful, whereas the QC15s looked more executive and business-like.Another great feature with the 25s is that they will still work without batteries. The noise cancellation won't work of course, but you won't be stuck with no audio. In addition to losing noise cancellation, you do also lose some fidelity in audio quality, it still sounds pretty decent.Like the QC15s, the battery life on the 25s are still exceptional. I haven't done any extensive and scientific tests, but it can last quite a while.Overall, the QC25s are great headphones. People criticize Bose for being overpriced, but they really aren't. The QC25s don't sound as good as some other $300 headphones, but they excel in many areas(sound, comfort, design, usability) unlike competing products that excel in only a few(sound only), making the QC25s a balanced and well rounded product, and that's what makes it worth $300.

VExcellent Noise Canceling Headset with Samsung Galaxy In-line Cable
p613
sg5
VWe have several Bose Systems/Devices (i.e. Wave SoundTouch Music System with multi-CD changer, SoundLink Mini Bluetooth speaker, and SoundLink around-ear Bluetooth headphones et al).  In addition, several Apple/ Samsung devices (i.e. iPad, iPhone, Galaxy S6 Edge, iPod Touch et at).  Having just replaced a land-line phone with a Samsung S6 Edge smartphone, I jumped at the opportunity to order the Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones with inline mic/remote for Samsung Galaxy. Currently using a Bose around the ear Wireless Headphones for audible books, taking iPhone calls, especially while watching professional sports (i. e. NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, Golf an IndyCar races). After setting up the QC 25 headset, following the pictorial manual, we tried using the inline mic and remote cable to take Galaxy S6 Edge calls while listening to the audible book "Exile" - worked as advertised. And, in fact just ordered the inline mic/remote cable to use with our Apple devices so we can control the volume, tracks, and voice stuff, plus switch between calls on our iPhone and iPad for  $25.82 with free shipping from Amazon. Note - The Samsung Galaxy cable  will work with any device for listening to audible books/music, its just the microphone and controls that are Samsung Galaxy specific. The Apple cable, I'm told will work with Samsung Galaxy devices for audible books/music, but the microphone and controls will only work with Apple devices.  In addition, we plugged the cable into our Bose Wave System and Samsung HDTV with excellent results.The noise canceling feature is outstanding, the headband fabric is far better than the Bose Wireless Headset stuff, plus the ear pieces seem to fit closer to my head, with R and L sides clearly indicated on the inside of the cups. Unlike the Bose Wireless Headset soft bag this case is small (see attached photo) and easily fits the folded headset, extra battery, inline cable and  dual jack adapter.  Bose indicates the triple AAA alkaline battery should last 35 hours and the indicator light will start flashing when 7 hours remain - nice feature.  Overall, the QC 25 Noise Canceling headset is a quality product, a bit pricey, however, well worth the cost, especially if you fly/travel or are outside the 30 foot wireless range..  Excellent Customer Service at 800-367-4008. Highly recommended.In the box stuff:QuietComfort® 25 headphones  56 in QC®25 inline remote and microphone cable  Airline adapter  Carrying case  AAA battery  Owner's guide (covers all you want to know)Note:I cut and laminated the Manual (English) for ready reference, complete with pics - see photo.

V5 stars: comfort, noise-cancelling, control of audio devices, basic audio with no power. -1 star: storage, unplugging the jack
p618
sg5
VSummary:  5 stars for comfort, noise-cancelling quality, in-line control of devices and ability to hear audio with no battery.  Minus 1 star for the fuss to put the headphones away and the difficulty to remove the jack from the headphones.I've used Bose over-the-ear noise canceling headphones on planes for years.  My last model was QA15 over-the-ear that still works well after many years.I've used the QC15s a couple of times now and they are extremely comfortable, and work well battery-powered *and* not-powered.  Ambient noise canceling requires a battery, but the headphones do provide pretty good noise dampening without the battery.  My opinion is they are as-good or better than the QC15s -- and more comfortable for me.  I can't directly compare them to another noise-canceling manufacturer, but these work very well.  The headphone cord in-line control (play, pause, volume up, volume down, etc.) of an attached iDevice worked well.  The QC25 case looks nicer and is more compact than other older Bose cases (smaller can be better, but be warned if you liked to tuck extra items into other/older cases).  The case has a holder inside for one battery and a 2-to-1 ear jack plug, but does not have an internal zippered pouch for small items.  The case does have an external mesh pouch/sleeve.Folding the headphones up for storage in the supplied case takes practice -- the ear cups twist, then *one specific side* must be tucked in; do it wrong and the headphones don't sit in the case quite right.The cable sits free inside the case and I haven't found a good way to easily tuck it in and secure it (maybe I should use the external pouch/sleeve on the outside of the case).  If this is not your first pair of Bose over-the-ear headphones, compare the new case to the older case; I have been testing if I want to use my old QC15 case with the new QC25 headphones.  My old case *is* bigger, but I don't have to fuss with twisting and tucking to insert the headphones, I have some extra room for other items, and a zippered internal pouch so some small items would not spill out into a dark plane by accident.The cable is a bit difficult to unplug from the headphones with my big fingers.  I\u2019m concerned that I\u2019m tugging on the cable instead of being able to firmly grab the actual plug/jack.  I will update my review if I damage the cable.  The QC25 cable is thicker than any other earphone/headphone cable I have (including the old QC15 cable).  Eyeballing it, the QC25 cable might be up to 2x thicker.

VFantastic upgrade to QC15
p624
sg5
VI purchased a set of these after testing out a pair of QC15 and wanting something a bit more.  The Bose QC15 were good for noise canceling, but coming from more premium type headphones (Sennheiser, Shure, Audio Technica etc.), I was disappointed in the audio quality from the QC15.  They were too punchy on base and treble and mids were very flat.I've read some reviews from some buyers that said they wouldn't upgrade from a QC15.  I'd have to agree for the most part.  Honestly for me, I wouldn't have purchased and kept the QC15, because they weren't good enough audio quality and did take up a lot of space.  The QC25 to me are a very good and needed upgrade from the QC15.I have to say I am very impressed with the QC25.  Not only were they still fantastic for noise canceling (the best I've had from Sennheiser, Shure and Audio Technica), but they were nearly on-par with some of the nicer sets of Sennheiser, Shure and Audio Technica I've had in the past.  Most Bose products I've had in the past are purely for the Bose name, but it appears that the Bose engineers really listened to customers, and got their act together for the QC25.  I don't think they're as good as a set of audiophile cans, but these are probably the best you can get for traveling.  They fold up super compact, have great battery life (I like the AAA battery option since rechargeable have to be recharged if they die, whereas with a AAA, you can just put one in - great for traveling a lot and forgetting to charge your headphones :(), and audio quality is fantastic.  Base is defined, but not blasting your brains out, treble is very clear, and precise, as well as mids are very smooth.  I'm thoroughly impressed with these, and won't be looking for another set of travel cans.  Honestly, these are good - good enough for me to not need a set of cans for the office and for travel.  They block all background noise around me, and have fantastic sound.Get a set - you won't be disappointed.

VWhen it comes to music and headphones, I have never been one that claims to be very much of an audiophile. This changed a great deal on November 25th, 2014, when I flew home first class from Honolulu to Memphis. It was upon this day that I was given a pair of Bose noise cancellation headphones to enjoy on the flight. My tastes in headphones has never been the same since.I began to do much research on best noise cancellation headphones currently on the market (please note \u201cbest noise cancellation\u201d, as this will be important as to why I am giving this product a 4 star review rather than 5). The one name that seemed ubiquitous to all review sites and equally high rated was the Bose Q25.Turn these on, put these on, and the world ceases to exist. They are quite comfortable even on a large head, like mine. If you are a frequent traveler, you know what it is like to try to get thru long flight with a screaming child or overly talkative adults. Not only did these headphones all but banish surrounding noise, but I was actually able to fall asleep while flying, which I have never been able to do.The sound quality, however, is where the Q25\u2019s come up just a little short. It could just be a matter of personal taste, but the bass is somewhat lacking from them. While the overall sound quality is great, I would not call it rich and deep like another pair of headphones that I tried before finally deciding on these. That being said, if you are like me and you place more value on peace and quiet versus deep, rich bass, the somewhat lofty price tag is worth every penny.Pros \u2013Very ComfortableGreat soundExcellent noise cancellationCons \u2013Lacking in bassSomewhat pricey

VBest NC headphone, SQ needs a lot of EQ
p636
sg5
VAfter two weeks of usage, now I think it is fair for me to write a review of this headphone. This is the best noise cancelling headphone I ever own. I have several NC headphones, Sony MDR-NC60, Harmon Kardon NC,and ATH NC. Bose is the best. It simply clears the low to mid-low range of noise out of my ears. There is no doubt Bose is the king of NC.However, I purchase this headphone not only for NC but also wishing to have good sound quality. Unfortunately, Bose falls short in the SQ department. Before I purchased this headphone, I read through "all" reviews on amazon. Almost everyone praises how good it sounds. To be honest, the SQ is pretty bad to my standard. I know it is not fair to compare it with my Beyerdynamic T1. Even my HD 650 cannot touch T1. But the frequency response of Bose is pretty bad, even worse than my low end Sony MDR-NC60. Bass is too boomy, mid to low bass are boosted about 12db! Completely lack of highs except above 10000Hz. Well, I am not an audiophile and I have wooden ears(opposite of golden ears), but I trust frequency response. I measured it by myself! However, if you amp and EQ it, the SQ will be completely different. I found Bose QC25 is quite capable of being EQed. I used Creative Sound Blaster E5 with T1 as a reference. Now Bose sounds very similar to T1.Here are my adjustments:31hz:0db62:-12db125:-11db250:-6db500:-7db1000:-5db2000:-5db4000:2db8000:10db16000:-4dbBy the way, if you are interested in how T1 sounds like, Bose after this EQ is around 80% close to T1. Consider I paid $1,500 for T1, after EQ you can turn $300 Bose to 80% T1! I think it is well worth it. If you like a lot of bass, do not use this EQ. This EQ will only provide tight, solid bass. The goal is to make Bose sound as close to the original recording as possible. Now I can hear details in my music! The sound stage is increased at least 50%(just a guess). You can now hear the "airy" sound, just like my T1! I have to boost 8Khz for 10db, but Bose did not crack, it is a surprise to me.I strongly recommend amp Bose with E5. E5 will be able to drive Bose and at the same time with proper EQ will smooth out FR winkles. This will make your Bose sound much much better.

VI had really high hopes for these headphones, and for the most part, I wasn't disappointed.  I work in a cubicle farm and I wanted a headphone to block out the noise of coworkers and people walking past my desk.  I mostly listen to podcasts, and not a lot of music so I was more interested in the noise canceling than sound quality.  The price on these seemed pretty steep, but when I tested them out in a very busy Best Buy store right before Christmas, I was amazed at how well they blocked the noise.  It felt almost like I had the entire store to myself when I put them on.  I was finally able to justify the cost when I considered that when I'm at my desk, my headphones are on.  This amounts to over 30 hours per week, so I ordered them.The noise canceling feature made me feel like I was the only one in the office.  Without them, I could hear people walking towards my desk from down the hall and hear doors opening and closing.  With these headphones on, it was all but gone.  Even the door right next to my desk was almost unnoticeable and I would see people long before I ever heard them.  Conversations happening a few desks away were barely noticeable whereas before the conversations would drown out my headphones instead of the other way around.As much as I loved what these headphones did, I had to return them.  The main reason I decided to return them was that there was a constant clicking/popping sound in the left ear.  When I turned off the noise canceling feature, the clicking/popping stopped.  If it were just that, I would have exchanged them for a new pair instead of returning them for a refund.  Another reason for returning them is because they applied just a little bit too much pressure to my ears.  I wear glasses and after an extended period of the headphones pressing my ears agains the bows of my glasses, my ears began to hurt.  If the cups on these were a little bit bigger to go fully around my ear, that would have helped.  Another issue I had was that I have a constant ringing in my ears, that is pretty much unnoticeable, unless it's very quiet.  So as good as the noise canceling feature works, it makes it so quiet that I could notice the ringing in my ears while using them.All in all I think these would make a great pair of headphones for most people who can justify/afford the price, but for me they just didn't work out quite as well as I had hoped.

VGreat for concentrating at the office. Greatly minimizes distracting conversations.
p647
sg5
VThese are simply amazing. It's hard to describe the experience of calmness that washes over me when I put these on and turn the active noise cancelling on. I work in an office environment and can sometimes get distracted by conversations around me. While these don't block out 100% of the background conversations it's like it turns the volume on those conversations down from 10 to 2.Yes these are awesome for blocking out low, humming constant noise like on an airplane, I knew that. I did feel like I was taking a risk by buying these for helping me concentrate in the office since that's not really what they're rated for but I think they work great for just those purposes. It's not total silence but I didn't expect that. I expected the ability to focus on my work and these have helped me do that.Active noise cancelling + some music = focus on work. Now my biggest distraction is getting lost in the music. ;-)PROS:* Active noise cancelling works extremely well* Headphones are comfortable* Integrated Apple controls (play/pause, volume up/down)* Included cable is a good length* Included case holds these securelyCONS:* Music sounds good, not great. Not much bass in some of the hiphop I listen to. But I really wanted these for the noise cancelling anyway so this isn't a huge deal to me.* Expensive at list price and tough to find discounts. But these work really well so I can get over that* The whole package is big. Over the ear cans plus case are large but no way to really get around that. I can't fit it in my bag so I'll probably get a carabiner to clip the case onto my bag* AAA batteries. I wish these were Lithium Ion that you could recharge via AC/USB but I guess the convenience of being able to toss a new, widely available AAA in the airport trumps that.Cons are by no means deal breakers and don't stop me from giving this 5 stars.

VAbsolutely amazing noise cancellation.
p653
sg5
VThese are absolutely amazing headphones. They are extremely pricey, and you could buy headphones with arguably equal or better build quality and sound quality than these at lower prices. However, the reason you buy this headphone should be for the noise cancellation. And it does that wonderfully.When I first put them on and powered them up by switching to the noise cancelling mode, my world suddenly became silent. I am a college student in a 'small' dorm room, with my desktop computer sitting right next to me, along with my roommate beside me playing video games, the bathroom behind me, traffic outside, et cetera. I could not clearly hear any of the noise generated from the things/people I mentioned, and even my roommate's extremely loud speech (almost shouting) as he plays video games is reduced significantly in volume, and not noticeable at all if I am listening to something. At one point, even though my desktop's fans were running at low RPMs, they suddenly sounded like jet engines when I took the headphones off.I do also own a Sennheisers headset that is was around the same price when I first purchased it (it has depreciated since then), and unless I focus a lot on the sound, I simply cannot tell the difference in audio quality. However, although this headphone is technically a headset with its built-in mic, I cannot use it on my PC as such, as the audio cable is a single 3.5mm meant for devices like iPhones. I currently have these headphones connected to the Sennheiser headset's USB sound card (with 7.1 virtual surround sound), which could have an effect on the sound quality I'm getting. Even so, it's excellent in terms of sound quality. Audiophiles might notice more about the sound quality, but it is top-notch for me.The build quality is good. The headphones fold up very nicely and fit into a fairly small, rectangular carrying case that could probably fit into any average backpack easily. The carrying case is very high quality, and also has little slots for a battery and airline adapter (both included, though you'll have provided battery inserted into the headset). Also, the earcups themselves are metal, with very nice earpads that are a great balance between being squishy and being firm. I wear glasses, and these headphones do not put so much pressure on them that it hurts my head. The headband is also comfortable, even with its tiny padding. However, it is plastic. It does feel sturdy, but it would have been nice if it was made of some kind of metal like the earcups.Overall, they are expensive headphones, but you are paying for some comfortable, well-built, compact headphones with amazing noise cancellation with excellent sound quality that a non-audiophile like me has no issues with. If you have the need for noise cancellation, these are amazing. If not, you can get headphones with comparable audio quality, comfort, and built quality for less.Also, keep in mind that with noise cancellation off, the sound quality is horrid. Not that you'd really have noise cancellation off, but still good to note.

p659

VWow! That's all I can really say about these headphones. I'll be honest: this is my first set of expensive over-hear headphones. Actually, it's my first pair of headphones over $100 in general. I first stepped up to the game of better portable audio when I started commuting to work via public transportation. I take a very noisy train every day for 30+ minutes each way. I needed to get something that cancelled noise so at first I got some in-ear monitors (Shure SE215's) which were pretty great, but the way you had to put them in your ears quickly became annoying and also started to hurt my ears over a prolonged period of time. The final straw came when the right earbud crapped out on me and I had to go and search for a suitable replacement. I saw lots of people on the train wearing over-ear headphones so I figured I'd look into and I found these new Bose QC 25's getting rave reviews all over the internet.I've always been a fan of Bose audio when I would listen to it in a store or at someone's house and never really got when people would say they were "over rated" or "too expensive". After receiving these headphones, I can safely say I am still a fan of Bose. Actually, I can say I've become a much bigger fan of Bose now. First off, the noise cancellation is insane. It blocks out just as much as my in-ears did, if not more. If you have music at any decent level of volume, good luck trying to hear anything unless someone is actually shouting at you from close by. Second, the sound quality is absolutely superb. I thought my in-ears were great but I can hear even more details with these that I never heard with the in-ears. Everything seems pretty well balanced to me, and the sound feels like it's surrounding you. When you have the NC on (which you should always have on to get the best sound quality), it feels like you are literally in your own world with your favorite music surrounding you.Anyways, I'm not the biggest expert to compare these for you to the QC 15's or other over-ear headphones but you can take it from a skeptic that I am heavily impressed. I read all the good and bad reviews and just decided to take the plunge which worked out greatly in my favor. If you're on the edge, just take the leap. After all, you can always return them within 30 days if you don't like them. I have a strong feeling that a vast majority of people who buy these will NOT be disappointed (I mean look at the reviews these have already). I will be much more open to buying future Bose products after my experience with these headphones.

VWearing Headphones Again After So Many Years
p665
sg5
VI chose these headphones from a list of items as a service anniversary gift from my employer.  I knew that Bose makes awesome products, as I have owned a set of their high end speakers for 30 years and I still haven't found any that sound any better.Took these on a recent business trip to see how they performed on an airplane.  I sat in the window seat right next to the wing near the engine exhaust to put them to the test.  When the aircraft started the takeoff roll, I flipped on the headphone switch and the roar of the engine faded away.  I could still hear it, but at a very low level (reduction of about 80-90%).  Started playing music through them and I could hear every note, even at a low volume level.Later in the flight, the captain came on and made an announcement.  Even with the music playing and the noise cancellation in operation, I could hear every word of the announcement (although at a very reduced sound level).  Aircraft noise was still at a low level...thought this was good, where the noise was almost gone but I could still hear announcements in case of an emergency.  Throughout the flight, I was oblivious to the normal sounds around me (sneezing, mindless chatter, crying babies, complaining to the flight attendants, etc.).As the title of this review says, I haven't listened to music with headphones for over 20 years, because I haven't found a set that did the music justice.  Now I have, and the headphones are part of my musical enjoyment once again....These headphones will be in my travel bag every time from now on.

VI have older series for several years, but age happened and I had to buy another set of Bose. While these new headphones are more comfortable, I still prefer the old ones.Here are my thoughts:--Bose cheaped out and put fabric at the top. Everything is plastic and leather until you reach the top, then its fabric.... really? I have white headphones, how long do you think the white fabric will remain white. Why did Bose have to go cheap and get rid of the leather. With leather it was easy to clean and maintain. The under part that touches the head is also fabric, again overtime will get pretty nasty dirty.--The cord has a funky texture that doesn't glide easily when rubbing against other material like my jacket. Because of this, the wire tends to snag a lot.-- The hi-lo capability not really missed unless you can't figure out how to use your volume button.-- Not much of a difference in sound quality-- Not a big impact with the change in case design-- Bose cord still doesn't interface with android devices (while the stop/play button work, volume cannot be controlled through the cord provided unless using an Apple product)-- Really liking the ability to listen to music even when battery is low. The noise cancelling ability is fully dependent on battery power.Overall 3 stars. Would be lower if it was still dependent on battery power for music. If you have the older QuietComfort, don't upgrade.

VI purchased the Bose QuietComfort 25 just before Christmas.  The noise canceling was nothing short of amazing!  The sound of silence blew me away.  Then like a nut,  I started reading reviews about other headphones having a better bass sound and such craziness.  I returned the Bose and then  went on the hunt for affordable, "better than Bose" headphones.  Like a dingbat, I bought the new Beats Studio (great bass and comfortable) Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (great bass and soooo uncomfortable, heavy), and then the August Bluetooth Wireless (ok is sound, comfortable and light)Outcome: I still have the Beats Studio (put away in the box), I returned the Audio Technica as quickly as I could, and every now an then I like the freedom of the August Wireless,  so I still use them.I have since received my new purchase of the Bose QC25.  YES...I bought them a second time and absolutely love them, just as I really did the first time around.  The sound is great and the comfort level is an A+.  They are very light and it is as if you have cotton around your ears. I have learned that it is all about personal taste. What I find comfortable and pleasing to my ears is what I like, not particularly what others recommend.  In this case, make me the exception. :-)  I highly recommend the Bose QuietComfort 25.  Take my word for it.  It may have taken me 2 times to believe my ears but ....this is the best $299 I have ever spent.  Worth every single penny.

p699

VWhere I work (doing various IT related activities from programming to problem solving to project management), the office is a very noisy place.  I often say it would be quieter if I went over to the local day care and gave all of the 2 year old kids a pound of candy and a can of energy drink.  Ever try to take a calculus exam at a frat party?  Welcome to the modern cube farm courtesy of those in the ivory tower.  If any CEO's are reading this... if you wonder why your productivity and morale is sinking?  Noise and open office plans are largely to blame.  If you have an open office plan, you should equip each and every one with a set of these headphones.  I wear mine practically 9 hours a day, 5 days a week (except when in meetings -- although I would probably get much more out of most meetings if I had these on).  I often just put them on and turn on the noise-cancelling.  I don't even pipe music through them most of the time.  They are comfortable and lightweight.I also own the QC-15's which I used in the office from 2010 until a couple of months ago when I bought these (I use the QC-15's at home now).  The QC-15's and the QC-25's work great.  When I do play music through them, the response is very good.  I listen to a wide variety of music from Classical to Jazz to new music.  As a musician myself (classically trained), I have to say that these reproduce the sounds well.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending these to anyone.

VMy QC 15 headphones were stolen on an overseas flight and I've been using Able Planet noise cancelling headphones. The Able Planet headphones do the basic job, a little noise cancelling, but with a slight background hiss. The Able Planet headphones were a little fragile and I had to repair them several times with super glue. The Able Planet headphones were also a little uncomfortable. But, the Able Planet Headphones were cheap. You could go through 4 sets for the price of one Bose set. I finally replaced them with these QC 25 headphones. Delivery was remarkably fast. Price is a little high, but it's consistent with everywhere else for these Bose headphones.They're very comfortable, the noise cancelling is clean and works well on planes. I've read reviews where the user commented the volume was too high and couldn't be adjusted as low as they wanted. I don't see how that's possible unless they want the sound barely audible. The volume range is good. Definitely not too loud. They seem sturdy and they fold a little so the case is smaller than my previous headphones. The downside of the smaller case is that there isn't any extra room in the case to keep an ipod, spare batteries, and hardly enough room for the cable. Overall, very good headphones. They're much better than the Able Planet headphones, but I'm not sure they're worth 4 times as much.

VI am a frequent flyer (6k-10k miles per month) and I formerly used Audio-Technica M50s. I realized that I was blasting the M50s at full volume to hear over the sound of flying and I know that can't be good for my ears. Furthermore, I started using a headphone amplifier to boost the lows which made them even louder.The noise cancelling is amazing. With the QC-25 headphones, I now find myself listening to my music/books/movies at a level that seems reasonable so that I hear every detail. The funny thing is when I take these off and realize how much louder the drone of the engines are than my music was. I end up unplugging the cord from them and wearing them to the airplane bathroom (13 hour flights) because they are so nice and quiet. I live in a quiet house, but these make me realize how not-quiet it is; if I take these off my house sounds like holding a sea-shell to your ear.The sound is great and they cover all ranges well. I haven't found advantage in using a headphone amplifier to boost the lows. In fact, I almost think that these have abnormal amounts of bass, but that is just personal taste.A word of advice: buy the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AAA batteries. They are pricey, but they are lighter and they last much longer so they end up being cheaper. I have at least 50+ hours on my first one.

VI Am Impressed
p735
sg5
VI have never been inclined to consider noise canceling headphones, for me quite simply "louder is better". Or used to be. I do not give five stars lightly.Rather than take a normal route and experience music through the Bose, I thought it might be more interesting to save that for later.I sat down in front of the game with the remote in hand. Turned on the whole house fan for effect- if you have never experienced one, they nicely simulate an aircraft cabin interior. In addition to the game and the fan, I put an AM radio on a shrill conservative talk show: Bose help me now.When I slipped on the headphones I noticed at once the lightness and smooth, comfortable fit of the headband and leather earpieces. The seal to the ear was so perfect it seemed was this was truly the first step towards noise reduction. The headband was nearly weightless.And indeed the room sounds were softer, a little bit muffled, but still invasive and annoying. I switched to another high end over-ear model to compare- it was nice, but not as nice, and at this point dependent on the music to cancel the rest.Not the Bose. I felt for the tiny switch on the right earcup, pushed it forward. There was a click, a tiny pop and a very slight hiss as the rest of the room faded deeply into white noise nothingness. The change was so dramatic I had to pop the cans off my ears to make sure things were still on. I was amazed.I would say the nose reduction- not total cancellation is at least 50-70%, and seems to be a dynamic response based on the ambient. Or it's just me, sometimes it did seem like all the room noise was slipping away at the same rate even as the volume increased- up to a point..I continued to play with the room noise as I grew unexpectedly impressed by the amount of quiet these could generate. I understand the general principle of active noise cancellation, and for what these headphones sell for, I would say the time is here.And this is without hearing a note of music. May I say, "Well, they're Bose, so what else can I say?"? Probably not much.Without the NR switched on, they sound on a par with many decent headphone I have used. Maybe not as wide in range, perhaps too thin- but I might have been more than a little suspicious to just try these powered off knowing what they cost, and wondering why. Believe me, I have tested $500 cans that had no extraordinary features except a designer brand and a trendiness that performed little better.And that they can. When there is no outside noise, a flip of that switch seems to unleash a very much wider range of sound, it punches up the bass without muddying, and keeps the mids and highs clear without any shrillness or hiss. So now tack on that busy airport lounge, airplane cabin, cross-town taxi-ride- anywhere you have a need to step out while standing in- it is hard to believe how well it works.With battery out or dead battery these still sound great, but the more you get used to the electronic enhancement you will surely miss it that much more if you lose it. I noticed the noise cancellation feature does not automatically time out after a period of inactivity, and while I did not test the battery life to failure, it is rated at 35 hours. Further testing revealed that after being inadvertently switched on at least that long, they seemed to go to sleep. Cycling the switch turned the electronics back on, but with the green light flashing. I imagine this is how they handle the power conservation issue; considering the cost of a long-life AAA these days, it makes good simple sense.I spent much more time exploring the noise canceling in various realms, it seems that the circuitry will track and compensate for a variety of unwanted ambient conditions.Still, I felt, "well, has not turning up the volume to drown everything out always been an option?" True, but no longer. This spares both your ears and the people around you. This means that if you overcompensate to allow a quiet passage to be heard, when it shifts back to louder again you need not worry about riding the volume or risking you hearing.I do not favor using headphones of any kind in public, anywhere, but this certainly does not seem to be a problem for a very large number of individuals. If you are one of them, the Bose QC will be with you at all times. Suddenly the applications are endless and easy to imagine.. .. a hotel room with the party upstairs.. a doctor's waiting room.. social security office..In fact, last night when it was just me and the heat, I ran the fan and tried the Bose as electronic earplugs. I have no problem with the low rumble it creates, in fact it usually wakes me up when it times out. But they muffled the sound so well it was like being a block away. It grew so quiet I could even hear my mild tinnitus kick in. I was amazed how loud the room seemed when I finally switched them off after a bit. I would probably use them frequently for this alone except they do not fit well when lying on one's side.They are quite comfortable and exquisitely crafted. The carrying case has a diagram woven into the inside surface to remind you how to fold the pair for storage. Even though the Bose follow the sort-of convention of having the cord on the left channel, "Left" and "Right" are printed into the inner fabric of each earcup, thereby settling the dispute. A foam block in a corner of the case holds an airline audio adapter and spare battery. It seems small at first, but it so well tailored everything fits perfectly without any need to jam and stuff. That diagram is simple brilliance.The cable is of the removable sort found on most Bose, made of that hard to tangle (or straighten) blue silicon rubber, it could tuck into the elastic pouch on the outside of the hard case, or just be rolled up inside. Also no doubt interchangeable with other headphones of this class.The cord also has the standard Bose microphone/controller a few inches down the line, always handy for rudimentary control of your music and phone. I notice that the volume must still be repeatedly tapped to make a change rather than merely depressed, maybe this prevents accidental use. Some controls allow a "skip forward" feature, my old iPod did not. I do not take phone calls while wearing headphones, but if you do be assured it works the same as any Bose device cabled as such. This one comes with a molded 90° plug at the device end.The QC come by default in black or white; a hundred bucks more will buy you a choice of any combo of any color in the Bose rainbow. I have no problem with Basic Black, but mine as tested were white, case and cans, and that always makes me nervous. Not just because of any implied brand allegiance,  but the long term upkeep of such a light colored plastic and fabric product demands respect, maybe that's part of the Apple mythos. It is indeed a gorgeous package.Whatever your needs may be, I would find it hard to believe you could find a competitor that was even close to being as effective, better priced or had superior sound than the Bose.

VI received this as a Christmas gift as I am the kind of guy who believes there is no difference between cheap headphones and good headphones.As Fonzie never said,  "I was wrong."  These are absolutely incredible.I just had gastric sleeve weight loss surgery and going to write about the headphones in my book about my weight loss.  They are an important tool in getting me out to walk every day.  I can hear songs that I have heard for 40 years in an entirely different way.  You can hear stuff like harps on Jackson Browne songs (I never knew he used those) and the nuance to something like Springsteen is such that you can understand every word and lyric.  I can't wait to get out and do my walk to hear my music.They are also terrific on an airplane and sometimes I put them on just to block out outside sounds.  On the other hand,  I can go on my walk knowing that if I get a phone call,  I actually sound better than in the office.  I have done a number of radio interviews plugging these into my IPhone and the sound quality is better than the mini radio studio that I have in my home.  I HIGHLY recommend them and Bose has gotten me as a longtime customer.They are not cheap but neither is a Rolls Royce.  These are the Rolls Royce of headsets.

VGreat noise cancelling and audio but sub-par build quality
p745
sg5
VTheir noise cancelling and sound quality is great however the build quality is not.I'm pretty good on audio - but I wouldn't call myself an audiophile.  I've set up entire conference audio systems so in regards to music - well I haven't had to worry about using a crossover.I've had two of these so far and both of them have ran into issues where one earpiece or the other stops working unless I press it in a peculiar gentle fashion.This tells me there are loose contact points most likely and or low quality wire which doesn't play well over time with the swivel earpiece.  Couple this with the fact that you have swivel the head each time you store or pull out your headphones.I have been very responsible and caring of these so it always goes in the box when not in use.Although last time Bose took my headphones but never shipped me out a new pair until I called them back.  At that point somehow it was registered that my headphones had arrived but they just never sent them out.  That was taken care of.  But this second headset is running into the same problems.I'm curious if the QC15's had a better build quality because I can still purchase those and for quite a bit less.  Hopefully I can return these for a full refund if it goes bad again.

VI purchased these directly from Amazon, (Seller was Amazon, fulfilled by Amazon) on 12/14/2014 as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She has used them almost daily, that is until they stopped working on 08/27/2015.  I troubleshot them by replacing the battery, confirm the contacts look good, confirming the head cables were seated, etc... But they would not power on.So Friday, 08/28 I called Bose Support.  I quickly (with almost no wait) got a tech based in the US.  He quickly determined they were under warranty.  The only thing I had to do was ship the headphones back to Bose, and they shipped a brand new pair with a new cable back to me.Unlike a previous reviewer that said the warranty is void when buying from Amazon seems totally bogus in this case.  The tech at Bose did NOT ask where I bought them from.  Only thing he wanted to know was the serial number of the headphones.So if you care / are keeping track...I called Bose 08/28/2015Shipped via UPS 2nd day on 08/28/2015 to the Bose depot in Yuma Arizona.  They were delivered on 09/01/2015.They in turn shipped via UPS ground a brand new pair (again w/ new cable), they were delivered to me on 09/09/2015.

VWinner in comfort and noise canceling, hands down
p757
sg5
VTo be clear: I've never owned QC15 headphones before. I'm coming from a pair of AudioTechnica Studio phones.Main reasons for purchasing: Comfort and noise canceling. My previous over-ear headphones have ever-so-slightly better sound quality, but after wearing em for an hour or so my ears would start to hurt. Also, I didn't enjoy the fact that I needed to crank the music to drownout background noise when on a call or just working. I can wear these headphones all day without any pain (And are REALLY comfortable) as well as being able to play music at a lower volume. Will noise canceling block every single noise out? No... it's not a vacuum! That said, it does pretty well with reducing noises that it doesn't eliminate, so really, a non-issue.Only improvement would be with sound quality. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty darn good. I guess quality is affected by construction of noise canceling aspects in headphone.So right: if you want a headphone with pretty good sound AND noise canceling - this is your winner. If noise canceling isn't your draw, probably should look elsewhere.

VThis product is really great. They are very light and very comfortable. If you don't have a lot of experience with noise cancelling tech, you will be very surprised at how effective it is at first. Then after about a week, you will find yourself wishing that it caught more sounds, especially random sounds like voices and clicks and things like that. The tech is really best at cancelling deeper droning noises (airplane engines, hvac noises, and the like). The sound quality is amazing as per usual with Bose.I find that my glasses, which are not really low profile, break the seal around my ears a little which lets in a tad of that otherwise cancelled noise. Not the products fault, just a thought for you glasses wearers.Here's another use for the headphones. I have a two year old that really appreciates it when things quiet down (I'm working hard not to use the expression "sensory kid"). He has three brothers and he just does better in calmer settings. I have to pry these headphones out of his sweet little hands! He loves it!Anyway, it's a great headset. Buy it.

Vexpensive, but worth the price
p767
sg5
VI had had a pair of $70-90 noise cancelling headphones for 7-8 years.  As those were nearing the end of their life, I started looking around for replacements.  I spent a couple of months deliberating if the features of these headphones justified the price.  Still being unsure, I decided to purchase.  After 10 months of regular use, I feel they are worth the price.  The step difference in quality between my sub $100 headphones and these are noticeable.  I fly fairly frequently.  They do a nice job of drowning out engine noise and are very comfortable.  With my old ones, I'd have my ears getting tired, or the top of my head would get irritated from the bar.  I have not had that problem.  I've been on planes where I can hear people shouting complaints to each other about how loud the engine is, but these headphones totally take care of the engine noise.  :-)  That lack of engine noise makes a very nice difference on long haul flights.  The case is nice because I can shove in my backpack without worrying about protecting them.  While the price is high, I feel it was money well spent.  I'd recommend.

p778
sg5
VThere's not much else to say besides that these headphones are unbelievable. These headphones are just that good. Seriously, words can't describe these things. So, I'll try my best. These headphones are, personally, the best you can buy. They look great. They sound great. There built with genuine bose quality. You can't say much more. These headphones truly do cancel out most of the noise around you. However, it must be said that when not listening to anything, just noise canceling, you can still hear some noises, such as people talking on the tv. But if the noise you are trying to not hear is a more constant and consistent then you may not here it at all. And while you can here some noises, they are so quiet, you may need to stain your hearing to hear them. The sound quality is great. Most of my songs are digital, and there are times where I think I need a higher quality song download to truly take advantage of these headphones. It is very good. But, when the headphones are turned off, you do notice a slight decrease in sound quality, but for me, at least, I could care less. Meaning I have heard much much worse, trumst me. This is my first pair of truly good headphones, and I'm a slight audiophile. Build quality is what I would expect from bose, and, quite frankly, for $300. The headphones them selves are made of a high quality plastic but are also capped on the outside with metal. The hinges are also made of metal. The headband and ear cups are made well too. Even the cord is flexible and ever so slightly thicker as well. They also don't have comfort in there name for no reason. These are truly the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. I can were these things for an hour straight and not have any pain on my head or ears. The cushioning is just right, pliable enough to be comfy but just the right amount of stiffness as well. I also ask why people look at other brands because when you want the best quality sound and the best noise canceling technology you should only look at the best. Bose literally invented the noise canceling headphones. While these headphones are amazing, I must not tell a lie. While more my fault, I am a little sad that these don't work with my phone, I mean the buttons. The box and bose clearly state, " made for iPod, iPhone, and iPad" they also are supposed to work with other phones as well but I must just have bad luck. My phone is a nokia lumia 928 Windows phone. Also, the warranty could be a little longer and a little more flexible for a flagship product. But I'm not going to down grade my rating just for that. I hope I helped, and hope you love these headphones as much as I do. I hope to update a little later!

VGreat noise cancelling, apart from when it's windy
p783

VExpensive, but indeed blocks out a good amount of ambient noise. I've only worn it in NYC, but so far so good. It's quiet enough to read in a subway car, but not too quiet when you need to pay attention when crossing the streets.Just a few minuses:- It does tend to cause a bit of a physical headache. I guess from the semi-vacuum ear environment.- It is bulky- Can cause your ear to sweat- Noise canceller runs on AAA, so I suggest you buy rechargeable batteries and bring an extra with you all the time- Sound quality is quite poor without noise cancellation- Since noise cancellation technology is based on having an outside microphone and emanating an anti-sound of some sort, the sound of the wind is amplified as if someone is blowing directly into your ear. But then again, I'd take the sound of the wind over the sound of people and traffic.Be realistic with your noise cancellation expectations. You will still hear things, especially high pitched ones. So babies squealing and sirens can still be heard.

VThese are ok for noise canceling but not too good for music.  I needed to replace my old Bose noise canceling headphones and I looked around for a better replacement but I ended up buying Bose again.  They are for plane rides only, they do a great job of covering up the jet noise.  I would never listen to music if I had a choice though.  They don't sound as good as my 10 year old pair Bose did.  The stuffing disintegrated in those old ones or I would still be using them.  They are not made to last long, 10 years is about all you'll get out of them.  Bose is a heavily marketed company and they don't spend much on making good sound, that 300 dollars a pair has to go somewhere and Bose spends lots of it on marketing I'm afraid.  It's too bad they do that because most people already know about Bose headphones but they also know that sound is not a priority at that company.  No Highs, lots of one note bass, I guess that's what the kids today want, all base and not much else.  Excellent at noise reduction and that's the only reason to buy these.

VI used to listen to Audio technik noise cancelling headphones which were good for the money. I think they were $150 at the time of purchase. I used my amazon reward points and got these for $250.00. Anyways I am not an Audio expert but I do enjoy clean sound. The noise cancellation is awesome compared to what I was used to. They block out voices too.. you can still hear people but it is very heard to understand. All other background noises like jet engines and fans are muted. The sound from listening to chill trap music on youtube during work can be described as having an orgasm to your ears. I have worn these for my 10 hour shifts at work and had no comfort issues. They do not get hot like my PS4 bluetooth surround sound headphones. Cord has a MIC which I havent used but the cord seems thick and durable. I do plan on testing this out at the gym, I don't run often but I do lift, I do like the length because I put my samsung note 3 in my pocket because it would look rediculous on am arm band. I would highly recommend these head phones.

VThese are extremely comfortable headphones. They are very light. Yet they don't have the cheaply made feel. The ear cups fit snugly over the ears without too much clamping force and provides perfect seal.The highlight of these headphones obviously is the effectiveness of noise cancellation. I have compared the QC's with other brands of noise cancelling headphones. They are simply head and shoulders above their competition. Extremely effective in cancelling outside noises. And best of all, these headphones don't generate the buzzing or hissing sound in the background.One thing I'd like to point out is the purpose of these headphones. They are intended to be used for commute and long flights for comfort and quietness, rather than hi-fi headphones. Just think about if you bring your high end open back headphones on a flight, they won't sound nice at all. So if you want a pair of hi-fi headphones, you should check out Sennheisers, AKG's and others. You shouldn't be buying the QC's for hifi purpose after all.

p806

VHeadsets/earbuds drive me crazy after a while - though some have a longer "time to annoyance" factor. I've used a variety of headsets/earbuds in my travels, but could never wear any longer than 90 minutes without the need for a break.I finally decided to see what the hype is about with the Bose QC line, and these have been outstanding, especially for my number one issue - time to annoyance. I'm able to wear these for 3-4 hours before having to take them off for a break, during US Coast-Coast flights and flights to Europe, and even while wearing my eyeglasses and one of those neck ring pillows.Of course, the audio quality and noise reduction are important, and Bose definitely delivers well enough to keep a five star rating - but of course these mean nothing if you cannot wear them comfortably for extended periods of time.I also like the carrying case that stores the headset, cable, and two-prong airline adapter that stores easily in carry-on bags and in the seat pouch.

VI love these! Good fit and helps so much with background noise. Note: Will not block human speech within 6 feet and stands no chance at blocking high pitched sounds like a screaming child. It did reduce it, but is better for lower pitches. Very good for airplane background (was impressed), ambient speaking of a group (think coffee shop studying) and background noises in a bus.The fit is really comfortable and well padded, goes over the entire ear and the headband will not snag hair. (only once on the ear-cuff hinge)Wound up returning to the manufacturer after 2 months. Exchange was painless, the Bose call-in line was fast and did not waste any of my time. Exchange process took less than a week to have a new headset in my hands, no charge for anything except shipping the old one back.The Amazon warranty....Frustrated, Miserable and a Waste of over an Hour, I was trying to buy coverage for the headset I was about to receive from Bose- highly disappointed.

p818
sg5
VPros:- Excellent noise cancelling.  I use these when I'm on a rowing machine, and the earphones manage to cancel out most of the drone.- Low "pressure feeling".  Earlier noise cancelling earphones that I have tried all seemed to create a sense of pressure in my ears which I found uncomfortable.  Although there is a slight feeling of pressure with this model, it is low enough that it rarely bothers me.- Very comfortable.- As noise cancelling headphones go, I think the sound quality is very good.Cons:- They come with that three-section plug you often find with Apple products.  It works fine on most regular equipment, but I've found some that don't work well without you needing to continually wiggle the plug around, and even then sometimes you lose stereo.  I wish they would stop using this plug it drives me nuts.- My experience with the battery is that it lasts a bit less than they say.  For me, a Duracell AAA lasts maybe 16-20 hours.

VAfter using two pairs of Parrot Ziks, the first model and 2.0, I finally gave up on the poor quality after having both replaced.  Knowing that these are consistently rated highly by users and reviewers I decided to give the Bose noise-cancelling headphones a try.  I was first intrigued by their in-ear headphones that I found the build quality to be very high and have not worn after a year of use.  Wearing and using the QC25 I have found them to be just as high quality.  Everything that is included with these headphones is high grade plastics, metals and textiles.  They really do feel worth their price.  What I also like that Bose does is they focus on simplicity.  They keep the intention of the product in their site and strive for the best quality.  The noise cancelling is the best I have used, and even the hinges and casing are of the highest quality I have ever used on a pair of headphones.  The triple black model is also the best looking of the three options in my opinion.

VI've had what I believe to be the precious model of Bose noise cancelling headphones for a year now, and then ordered this pair for my husband. We travel/fly multiple times a year for leisure, and noise cancelling headphones are indispensable. They will not block out all noise, they block out ambient background noise (the roar of an airplane), but not sudden sounds like a baby crying. But because these block out background noise, you can listen to your music or videos better, and with the volume turned down lower, a saving your hearing. For those who don't know, the noise cancelling feature is independent from the headphones. So, you don't need to be listening to anything in order to use it. And it does need a AA battery to operate the noise cancelling feature. The difference I see in these, compared to my older model, is these have a Mic on the headphone jack to use with your phone or when skyping. They also fold up.smaller.

VAMAZING!  This is my 4th Bose QuietComfort headphone.  I previously owned the QuietComfort 15 model.  As a father to two very active and loud kids, and also a student, I need these, and they have been a savior throughout college and graduate school!  I am now  studying for a HUGE licensing test for my profession that requires EXTREME focus and concentration, and these headphones allow me to go ANYWHERE while studying.  I usually go to my local coffee shop, which gets pretty loud (about 20+ people when it gets busy + music in the background).  But with these + YouTube sound effects (white noise, sound of waves, sound of nature, etc.), I cannot hear ANYTHING.  Please note, that is if you put some music or sound effects in the background, it will silence out all noise.  However, using the noise canceling alone will not be enough.One upgrade I hope gets integrated into the next model is wireless Bluetooth\u2014PLEASE!

VI owned my first QC2 in 2006 and it has accompanied me for 10 years of endless travels inclusive of those across the Pacific and Atlantic that gave me some good 4 to 6 hours of quiet sleep in the Jets. Can you imagine that the 2006 earpiece is still functioning well today? But since my son started some of his travel and he conveniently took my QC2 for his travel, it prompted me to get a new one. I didn't hesitate a single moment to get the latest QC25 because I know the value outweighs the cost. Immeasurably more. I am not an acoustic expert, but someone who has used it for 10 years and have owned many other more Bose products, you can bet on his personal preference and experience that is worth more than a cent. I know I will still have my 4 to 6 hours of quality sleep in the Singapore Airline next week when I fly back from LA to Singapore. They belong to the same class of excellence in term of customer experience.

VThis is my opinion and I absolutely was not paid to write this: I just received these today. I have had many other headphones (Beats, Monster, and Parrot) and these are my second pair of Bose headphones. I have the old Bose bluetooth headphones (the original with the big control on one earphone) but they do not offer noise reduction. With these new ones, I really didn't care if they were bluetooth or not, I just wanted the noise-reduction feature since I travel a lot.I can say, with my first time listening to these headphones, I don't know why I didn't stick with Bose from the beginning instead of buying the other brands. The sound is absolutely awesome. My music is clear and I cannot hear any outside noise. This is exactly what I needed. They are also comfortable to wear, unlike the others I've had. The real test is when I travel with these, but I am sure they will not disappoint me!

VI've had nothing but a great experience with these headphones; I've used them while working, commuting, and during airplane travel. At this point, I'd dread flying without my QC25s.  That makes it all the more disappointing when they started failing.I've had these for six months, and the left side of the phones is either intermittent or completely dead - audio and noise cancellation. It seems to be quite common that the internal wiring of the headset shorts out after only months of usage, and if you look at the One-and-Two Star ratings of the product, you'll find that this is their primary complaint.If you buy these, absolutely register them with Bose Product Support to ensure that you receive the full one-year warranty.  While I had to pay for shipping the broken phones back to Bose, they're completely accommodating in sending me a new pair.

VI've known about the Bose Quiet Comfort line of headphones for a while and scoffed at the idea of $300 headphones. I recently took a domestic flight and was sitting behind the wing.  The mechanical noise was so loud that I could barely hear my movie on my laptop.When I returned from my trip,  I decided to take a look at these headphones to see what all the fuss was about.  I went over to my local best buy and tried them on.  At first it felt a bit weird,  and I felt a bit disoriented, but then I heard the difference they made.  I heard a low rumble of noise in a busy electronics store.  It was amazing!I purchased them for a discount on eBay and I don't regret it! I put them on during my latest flight with nothing connected and I was able to read my book in silence. Great travel headphones even if you only use them a few times a year!

Very very comfortable to wear.Why 4 stars?1.  the case does not have an interior compartment for the cord.  What is that about?  you just coil it up and throw in on top, so that when you unsip it on the plane it can fall out.  An uncharacteristically inelegant solution.2. At the time of this posting Amazon only sells the iphone compatible version.  The description could have been a little more clear that there would be incompatibility with android.  $300 bucks and the phone mic does not work.  you can get an android cord from Bose for $30.  The android version is the same price from Bose with free shipping.  So better to buy it there if you are using android.

I edit videos for my job and can wear them for a long time comfortably. The case they come in provides nice protection when they are not being used. I did have a hard time figuring out where the battery for the noise reduction went but eventually I stumbled upon it. The sound reduction works great, too. I work in an office that has much external noise and when trying to edit videos I need concentration. These help a great deal. I notice a good difference when I turn on the noise reduction.

If I want to watch a a movie while my wife watches a cooking show, I just plug into my tablet or laptop and the room noise evaporates.The new model 25's are, to my ear, no better than the older model 15's which are now discontinued but are still available on some websites.

VJust moving to Los Angeles for graduate school I needed a quiet environment at all times to study. Los Angeles has constant noise from neighbors playing acoustic guitars to sirens and horns from street traffic . I figured I would splurge and get these headphones to allow myself to study and take naps. After trying them all out in the store the newest model allowed almost zero noise to get through. They completely cancel all acoustic noise and the only thing you can hear is some spoken words and a little whirling street traffic depending on the music level. I know they're pricey but aren't all good things in life?! They come with a 30 day guarantee so if they don't suit your needs you can always take them back. But I am in love with them!

The battery use is pretty good, like I said I use these about 8hr a day 6 days a week and the batteries last quite a while.  The sound cancelation is great for ambient noise like an AC unit or buzzing noises but only ok at blocking out noises like people talking.  I would recommend theses even at 300$ and can't imagine studying without them but they have a little further to go in blocking out talking to truly be 5 starts.4/5 would buy again

The bass frequencies power through you without diminishing the quality of the higher frequencies, and with these on, it feels like I'm at the movies; at my favorite concert.  And as for the noise canceling, I compared them to my aviation headsets.  Long and short, these were actually as good, if not better than my top-quality aviation headsets!  I am thoroughly impressed with these headphones.  $300?  Absolutely worth the price.  These are the epitome of quality and simplicity.

p902
sg5
VThis is my second pair of high-end consumer-grade noise-cancelling headphones; the other pair being the Monster Inspiration headphones.  These headphones are hands-down superior in every measurement.1) They are more comfortable:  The Bose QC25 put the slightest pressure on my ears, and I can comfortably wear them all day in the office or on a long flight.2) They collapse (fold) into a much smaller pouch.  The Inspiration headphones come in a larger bag, which I cannot fit into my computer bag.  I have to clip them to the outside of my computer bag.  The QC25 fold into a small case, which can fit into my computer bag3) Noise-Cancelling Ability:  I admittedly haven't done any scientific study with either of these headphones, but I must say the Bose headphones just do a better job of eliminating engine noise, fan noise, background conversations, etc, with or without playing musicHere are a couple of topics where it is more of a wash between the two:1) Sound Quality:  Both headphones are a little bass-heavy.  Neither is going to win awards for sound quality, but the sound is respectable.  Definitely better than anything I have listened to that costs under $150.  If I didn't care about noise-cancelling, I'd spend $300 elsewhere.  But, you don't buy noise-cancelling headphones to listen to a high-end home sound system.  You buy them for listening to music on your smartphone while in a plane.  it does justice to anything that your smartphone will put out, and I doubt you will notice any difference with higher-end equipment while listening to MP3s on your iPhone.2) Playable without batteries:  When the batteries run out (or with noise cancelling off), both of them still play music, albeit at a reduced quality.  That being said, anyone who ran out of batteries on a long flight can attest to the benefit of battery-less operation.  This is a big plus over the QC15, which requires batteries at all times.3) Fashion:  The QC25 is astetically a huge improvement over the QC15, which seemed to have an awkward "flow" connecting the band to the earmuffs.  It's hard to describe without comparing them in person.  The QC25 just looks better on my head.  The Inspiration has a more modern look.  I think it comes down to personal preference, so I'll call it a wash.4) iPhone control with microphone:  Both options take calls.  People on the other line can hear me fine.  The Inspiration came with 2 cables (one without phone control), while the Bose only has one cable (with the phone controls).  The Inspiration phone control button failed on me after 2 years (my 10 year old daughter got ahold of it a broke the plastic off).  It still works, but the button is snapped off.  The Bose phone control looks more robust, as there isn't anything to get snagged so it is less likely to break.  I call it a wash, because nothing is 10-year-old proof and the Inspiration did come with 2 cables.5) Both have a detachable cable.  This is a must because: a) sometimes the cable gets snagged on my chair.  I like that it pulls the connector out instead of breaking something b) sometimes I just want noise cancelling without music (like when I mow the lawn).  I can take the cable out, and it still works. c) If I did break the cable (like my 10 year old daughter with the Inspiration; see above), I can get replacementsIn conclusion, the Bose is highly regarded as the best noise-cancelling headphone you can buy, and it doesn't disappoint.  If you are looking for real noise-cancelling headphones, you must give these a try.  They are sure to impress!

VI am an audiophile and enjoy listening to music on the bus, car, train, plane and noisy places. My first priority is noise cancellation and second priority is sound quality. I own the following noise cancellation headphones; Bose 15, Polk U6000 and Audio Tech.7b. The Bose 25 wins for comfort, sound, noise cancellation, and compact case.  The sound on the Bose 25 is a notch up from the Bose 15. The Bose 25 will operate without the the noise cancellation turn-on; Big Plus. The Bose 25 and 15 is the gold standard for noise cancellation. There is articulation in the mid range and bass with the Bose 25 vs 15. The upgrade from Bose 15 to 25  worth every penny. You will not be disappointed.Happy listening!Steve

VThe headphone is great, awesome Bose quality sound, bass and best of the best noise cancellation performance specials during airplane flights - blocks almost every noise completely.My only complain is the build quality of the headphone jack is crappy, mine broke into 2 pieces within 3 weeks and half of the metal part got stuck inside the 2 pin adaptor used for the aircraft (see picture) - this happened when I tried to get up from my seat while the headphone was connected to airplane seat and I ended up pulling the cable slightly off in wrong direction - I did not expect that metal part to come of and break that easily for a headphone with a $300 price tag and from the brand Bose :(

Vgreat set of headphones but like so many other people, the right headphone stopped working for no reason. this is my second set with the same problem. i did not drop the unit and im very careful with handling it, and mind you i dont often use it. i went online and noticed that this is a very common thing and people have suggested fixing it using things inserted into the headphone speaker. it broke literally 1 week after the warranty wore off this time. note that the same thing happened with a previous model that i bought from amazon except i was charged a restocking fee when i wanted it replaced. This is a recurring problem and it was not professional to do that to the customers.

VHave used QC15's for several years plus I also have QC20i's.Bought these on recent trip to USA and wore on the return flight (QC15's outbound)Sound quality much better with noticeable improvement to Bass & separation of instruments.NC also improved. Finish & fit better plus the headphone doesn't stick out so far so looks better.Folds into smaller package.Prefer AA battery to built-in so another plusQC20's aren't far behind and smaller form factor is great for short journeys / street wear.  NC seems better for trains / street noise.Both are excellent choices for NC headphones in different situations.

VBest yet!  I have owned all of the various iterations of the Bose (and many other brands) of noise canceling headphones.  I fly a lot and music is a passion.  These are by far the best that Bose (or any other company) have come up with yet.  I have the "on ear" and cup style (over ear) versions as well.  I would never buy the on-ear again, regardless of claims that might be made.  You just don't get the same sound quality and no even close to the same noise canceling effect.  Buy these, you will not be disappointed, save your money on the cheaper ones or on other brands.  It's a waste... these are the real deal.

VAs the price indicates, these headphones are definitely a premium product.  When i turn them on during my time on a plane, I barely hear the engine, but amazingly, I can still have a conversation with the person next to me.  However, I have one major gripe - the headphone wire frays easily, just like your $10 pair of headphones.  I'm writing this review about 5 months after purchase, but about 2 months ago, I notice that i had to keep playing with the cord to get it in a certain position when music would cut in and out.  They really need to improve on this.  A $300 outlay means everything should be top notch.

VWas highly skeptical of a $300 pair of headphones, but wanted to try the sound suppression to make my office (cubicle city) tolerable after the recent moves.  At first I didn't notice any difference between the two modes.  Checked the battery and found I'd installed upside down! After that-sweet silence.  Listen to music and when the racket gears up in the cubes around me, a simple flip of the switch gives me great silence.  Several in the office who have the QuietComfort 15, have stopped by to give these a try.  They are all impressed that the active supression does such a good job in an office environment.

This was the reason I originally bought them, and it's great to shut out the world while needing to get things done. Also the ability to jump on calls with the built in mic is incredible. Turns off all the other distractions.If you are looking at noise canceling headphones, look no further. Beats sounds a bit better for music, but when it comes to noise canceling, Bose is the answer hands down.

VI was in the market for active noise canceling, around the ear headphones. I was cheap and didn't want to spend the money so I bought some Sony's: they would never charge(they were wireless) cost me $125. So I took them back and got some Beats(wired with active noise canceling)$200 on sale, regularly $300.  I bought them based on hype and ratings. In a nutshell: very uncomfortable, active noise canceling was horrible, sound was, at best, good. I decided to pay full price and buy Bose quitecomfort.  In a nutshell: freakishly awesome!! Sound, Noise Canceling, and comfort is all an A+++.  Wow.

p968

VThe sound quality and noise-cancelling feature is unmatched by any competing brand in my opinion. They come with a nice carrying case for travel, and fold up easily to fit in. They are simple to use and they even come with a AAA battery for the noise-cancelling feature. Don't forget to turn it off once you're done with them! My only complaint about these is in regards to the Volume Adjustment buttons. They are only compatible on Apple devices. If you're using these on a PC or Android device, the sound quality and noise cancelling feature will be fine, but you won't be able to adjust the volume using the headphones. It is annoying that Bose would be that short-sighted, but it is what it is. If the adjustment buttons worked on all devices, I would give this 5 stars. Overall, I would recommend these headphones regardless of the device you're using.

VWow. I have tried, tested but never bought a pair of Bose headphones before. I have experience with ANR aviation headsets from both bose and lightspeed, and of course in that setting they add unbelievable levels of comfort, but I never thought the same would be the case in an office setting. I bought them for travel and flying, to cancel the jet noise when trying to catch some intercontinental sleep, but I love them even more during work days in a chatty office environment. They are just the most comfortable, silent, wonderful pair of headphones I've ever had. Period.

VI bought these cans to be my go to travel companion but they have suddenly become my everyday computer buddies.  I just subscribed to Tidal, the hi res streaming site (a MUST have) and my everyday PSB M4u1's just didn't cut it for me.  They are a very mild mannered polite sounding headphone (very classy and a critic's darling) but to my surprise the Bose 25's beat them to the finish line.  I'm a bit of an audiophile and know the difference after years and years of critical listening.  Right now Steely Dan is pumping into my head as I write this and the bass and overall detail is just pristine!  Sure they are overpriced: everything Bose makes is overpriced.  But you can also pay it off in monthly installments on their site with 0 interest.  So friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears: cover them up with the 25s!

The issue has been the same all three times - the right ear crackles and then goes out (must be a faulty construction in the part that connects both ears).They work great for 2-3 months and then go out. I always keep them in the traveling case Bose provides when they are not in use, I"m wondering if perhaps it would be better not to.Overall, great headphones when they work, but a ton of issues with the durability.

VA-OK on all fronts, but had a couple of gripes that has little to do with sound quality per se1. The adverts don't have as much of an explicit mention that these are NOT wireless headphones. I was looking for bluetooth wireless headphones and incorrectly assumed this was one by looking at the images on Amazon.2. At a relatively louder volume level, the outside of the headphones tend to get noisier than usual headphones. Doesn't affect how it sounds to the listener, but can certainly turn into a nuisance in quiet environments.

The Audio-Technica set makes a terrible noise when the battery runs too low for the noise cancelling circuitry to operate, the Bose headphones simply lose noise cancelling.  These Bose headphones sound amazing, better than the Audio-Technica.  These headphones are far more comfortable than the Audio-Technica.  To my surprise, the Bose headphones also work really well as a hands-free headset for talking on the phone.  The (very high) price is definitely worth it.

Many desktop/laptop computers use a low-end DAC and headphone amplifier to save manufacturing costs.  The E10K allows you to get a much better sound when using your QC25's with a laptop/desktop.

VWow -- I can block out (almost) everything! I have been looking for headphones that will fit my smaller head and these are perfect.  They do adjust to make them bigger if you need more room.  They are comfortable to wear and the sound is AMAZING!  I am not really an audiophile but I let my son try them and he said they are better than the Beats he has. Since the speakers on my laptop died, I have been using a cheap set that came with my Roku - yeah, anything in a pinch, but these even work with the Roku 3 and make everything sound wonderful.  The noise cancelling even allows me to block out my husband and he can obviously see that I am listening to something unlike the in-ear headphones.  I have now taken them on several trips and again they block out most airplane noise except screaming babies.  Once some one developes head phones that can cancel that noise out, they will make a fortune!

VThis is my first pair of Bose headphones.There is no going back.I may not be an audiophile, but I do have have auditory processing challenges, my hearing is very sharp (I went blind from cataracts at age 20 and my ears super-compensated to help me navigate a new city in the months before  surgery), and I have hyperacusis.  My kid has ears that are even more finely tuned than mine and he wears isolating ear muffs to deal with sensory overwhelm but I had not found a workable, comfortable solution until now, and I needed one as even the sound of our dishwasher and clothes dryer were increasing my fatigue substantially,The QuietComfort 25 provides a much needed buffer between me and the world, while I am still present and interacting fully.I wear these without the audio cable attached, and noise canceling powered on.The first day, I wore them on a moderately busy street while waiting for a bus (during daylight, in a safe environment) and instead of feeling my body gradually tighten up from the cumulative sounds of cars, motors, air conditioning units, the buzz of the power lines, the shrill squawk of crows overhead I only heard the teenagers laughing as they jogged by, the birds tweeting at eachother, and a gentle, wavelike roll of automobile wheels as they passed me.I have not felt calm, like this, since I was a little kid, exploring the woods around out home, alone, in an environment without crisscrossing power lines, a/c, cell phones, fluorescent bulbs, etc...  These filter, but do not isolate.For me, these are a miracle.  I do not like listening to music via headphones because I am usually the only responsible adult here and my hypersensitivity to most sensory input means I never even sleep deeply, so escaping into music and not hearing something or someone is scary to me.  If I need to listen to something, I'll either listen over Bluetooth speakers or a pair of Audio-Technica open style studio headphones. Audio Technica ATH-AD700X Audiophile Headphones.That being said, music sounds rich and wonderful, vivid, textured, nuanced.My only issue, with these, is the earcups padding is soft and comfortable but so sweaty after wearing for a relatively short time.  A cooler material may have not offered the same seal, but I would be willing to forego a wee bit of enclosure for a less sweaty, longer distance wear.For now, I'm just enjoying the silence  (and the sweet sounds of the world which filter, gently, through).

VThese are some very nice headphones.Pros:+ The noise cancellation feature is quite excellent. It's miles ahead of my other set of noise-canceling headphones (Sony MDRNC7/BLK). I can hardly hear outside noises when the headphones are activated. They do an admirable job of suppressing noises from airplane engines, open plan office spaces, and more.+ The headphones fit very nicely and are comfortable. I can wear them all day at my desk with no discomfort.+ The music sounds very good. For pure sound quality, I think I prefer my Sennheiser PC 310 Gaming Headset, but these Bose headphones aren't bad at all.+ The on-headphone buttons and microphone work great when plugged into my MacBook Pro. My Android Nexus 4 doesn't seem to recognize the microphone or volume buttons, but the center button works to pause and unpause music.+ For headphones as expensive as these, having the ability to replace the cable when necessary is a very nice touch. With the cable removed, these still work great to block outside noise, you (obviously) can't play any music in this mode though.+ The included case seems lightweight but sturdy. It has a slot for an extra battery and the airplane adapter: another nice touch.Cons:- When the noise cancellation feature is powered off, the sound quality drops off dramatically. For this reason I wouldn't want to use these headphones without an extra battery available.- The noise cancellation feature is really quite excellent. Other people in the same room have to make a special effort to get my attention when I am using these.- The price. I'm extremely grateful to have gotten a free pair of these headphones to review, but I doubt I would be willing to pay $300 for them.Overall, I think these headphones are a winner if noise cancellation is your primary concern. If you just want some amazing sound quality and don't need noise cancellation, you might have better luck with a different model.

VBACKGROUND:  I work from my home basement office  as a software developer, and was looking for something to help eliminate distractions from other sounds in the house: kids running around upstairs and making kid noises; clothes washers / dryers; the furnace; etc.EFFECTIVENESS:  When I first received these headphones I was a little disappointed with the efficacy of their noise-cancellation, considering their price and the glowing reviews from some sites that I trust.  This was my first impression from unboxing them and walking around the house, talking to people.  In particular, the headphones seemed far better at reducing mid/high frequencies than lower frequencies.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that when using them while I worked, the overall impact of the active cancellation is very effective, and I generally am no longer distracted by noises in the house.  In terms of audio quality for their basic headphone functionality, they're fine, about the same as I get from the Sennheiser headphones I bought about 15 years ago for $70.COMFORT AND AESTHETICS:  The headphones are lightweight and comfortable.  The headphones fit comfortably around my ears, and stay in place without being overly tight.  No complaints at all, except for having to deal with the audio cable(see below).FUNCTIONALITY:  The headphones have an inline volume controller and microphone, however these seem to only be effective if the headphones are plugged into an Android or iPhone.  (I haven't tried that feature on a phone; I've always used the adapter to simply plug them into my computer's standard stereo headphone jack.)WHAT I'D CHANGE:  For $300, it would be nice if the headphones had Bluetooth connectivity, for two reasons.  First, the audio wire is a bit annoying to work around.  Secondly, it would let the microphone work with any Bluetooth enabled device (such as laptops), rather than just with iPhones and Droid phones.CONCLUSION:  This being my only experience with noise-cancelling headphones, I'm not sure if the $300 price was necessary to get the quality of noise-cancellation I needed for my work.  But they work well, and let me do my job effectively and without distraction, and that's a pretty big deal.  Overall I'm happy with the purchase.

VTravel Case is Bad - Headphones Work Well
p1164
sg5
VI travel quite a bit and have used a previous version of Bose headset which lasted a long time.What I Like:- They truly do drown-out the noises around you. Will it block out everything - absolutely not! Will they silent a baby sitting behind you and crying to an tolerable level, with a song on or a movie playing on your phone - yes! There is a reason why these headsets are frequently seen by business travelers. Before you take off for your next flight - glance around and count how many headsets you see on business travelers - can almost promise you will see 3-4 in clear site.- They look professional. Clean, elegant, simple. They come in a variety of colors and you can customize for additional money, but I stuck with the all black...just liked them.- Comfortable. I wear them sometimes for hours on end.What I Do NOT Like:- The genius who made the case that you put the headphones in somehow forgot to include a space for placing the cord to plug into your phone?!?!?!? Can't understand that little slip up. This dovetails right into point # 2 I don't like but I have gotten use to...- It takes AAA battery to operate. If you are like me and want to be sure you hear good sound or want to use the noise cancellation feature, then you will need to always carry an additional battery -or- be prepared to buy one in the airport, train station, wherever. Again, the genius who designed the carrying case forgot to include a compartment that holds additional batteries.**** I cannot think of a reason not to include a small little internal pouch that zippers inside the travel case for the headphones. This is truly unacceptable and flat out equates to either Bose thought about this and did not include it - which in my opinion makes me mad ... or Bose did not think about the typical traveler needing to store the cord and batteries when we travel with the headphones - which equates to stupidity. Either way, I'm not happy about it.Summary:Headphones work very well (they should for $300.oo USD). The travel case is stupid and doesn't contain a place to store an additional battery or the cord used to plug the headphones into your phone. All-in-all, I would buy the headphones again, just will need to now get a case that is frequent-traveler friendly.

VPlace a value on how much the noise cancellation is worth to you...
p1170
sg5
VDecide how important the noise cancellation is to you first and foremost.  If you wouldn't pay $125-$150 for the noise cancellation feature by itself, you are overpaying for these headphones, because sound-wise alone, these headphones are on par with others that can be had for about $150 or so.  Not a deal breaker for me because I knew that going into this, and the noise cancellation is worth the extra $150 to me.The noise cancellation works great.  There is a slightly noticeable "white noise" in the background when you don't have any music playing, but it is not bothersome (I actually kind of like it).  When a song is playing, you can barely hear anything else outside the headphones.  Exactly what I wanted.  So as far as the noise cancellation aspect, I would give them 5 stars.As for the actual sound quality of the headphones themselves, I would give them 4 stars.  They sound good, but they are not quite as good as my ATH-M50X's that I bought on here previously, and which are roughly half the price (see link below).Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor HeadphonesThat's why I would urge you to decide how important the noise cancellation aspect is to you.  Do you absolutely have to have it?  If so, look no further.  These are the best in the business as far as noise cancellation.  If the noise cancellation is not worth the $150 premium, I would grab yourself a pair of ATH-M50X's, which sound slightly (noticeably) more accurate and clean, but are NOT noise-cancelling.With that said, I'm happy with my purchase.  These headphones fit the purpose that I bought them for, and they will be my go-to for any situation that I want to use the noise cancellation for.  I will probably stick with my ATH-M50X's when I am in audiophile mode though (when sound quality is more important).  I would have given these QC25's a 4.5 star rating if it were possible, for the record.  Cheers.

p1176

VI appreciate music as much as about anyone else. I also spend a fair amount of time running a noisy power tool to cut trees. I normally use a very high quality pair of Shure earbuds to supply my music while also wearing a set of hearing protection. It finally occurred to me that a set of these Bose QuietComfort 25 Noise Cancelling Headphones would be a great combination of splendid music and hearing protection. So, I ordered a set from Amazon. I will say that MOST Amazon transactions are pleasurable and trouble-free. That was not the case in this particular purchase. However; I will say that the Amazon customer service REALLY rose up and did everything possible to alleviate the problems encountered. I say a hearty "Thank you!" to Amazon's customer service.As to the Bose Headphones...Oh, my! Wonderful, awesome sound. The Shure earbuds were great, but obviously in a different class as far as size and ability to place larger and multiple speakers in each ear cup. Also, the Noise Cancelling works amazingly well for my application. I didn't realize how well until the battery used to power the Noise Cancelling feature lost power as I worked last night. I couldn't believe how loud the machine was when the Noise Cancelling quit functioning.Fortunately, I ran out of battery, fuel, and daylight at the same time and headed back to the vehicle. I installed a fresh AAA battery and the Noise Cancelling feature was back functioning perfectly well. The sound of the music did not appear to be negatively affected, with exception of the tremendously increased volume of machine noise.My fine quality noise protection headphones will now be relegated to "Dust Gatherer Emeritus"My only regret is that I didn't do this earlier.

VBose QuietComfort 25 Noise Cancelling Headphones, Special Edition for Apple Devices, Triple BlackI've had the triple black of these for a few days now and they are just what I expected. Comfortable, good design, good-very good sound quality and excellent noise cancellation. I currently have the Grado SR80s, Audio Technica ATH-M50, Sony XB-9590BT, Sony MDR1NC and generic apple earbuds.Comfort: I use headphones at work, grocery shopping and during travel for extended periods of time and this is paramount. Only these and the Sony XB were the ones that did not put too much pressure on my head or ear areas. The Sony's had big plush leather pads that were prone to oiliness and sweat lot more than the QC25s are. The QC25s are lightweight and provide a good seal around the ears and there is more than enough space inside the headphone cup for your ears to not touch any part of the headphones. The lightness also doesn't put too much pressure on the crown of my head.Design: The QC25s are sleek and look amazing. Apart from the generic apple buds, I wouldn't use any of my other ones in public, just at home and at the office. These look good walking around in the city, solo shopping, travelling and pretty much everywhere. Due to the pricey nature of these, I would not use these at the gym in the fear of yanking, sweating all over them. The case for them is ideal as well, with a space for a battery and airplane adapter. The materials are mostly plastic but they don't feel cheap at all, the headband material is a nice suede which feels luxurious and I can hypothesize that it will probably hold well for a number of ears with good use. I have the triple black model and I have been reading the few negative reviews for these about sound not working in one of the cups etc and I did realize before buying that,they seem to be confined mostly to the black models and some on the white models. Therefore, I surmised that they might have resolved their build quality problems before releasing the special edition triple black model. Sound Quality: OK right off the bat, the sound clarity and stage is not as good as the Grado's or Audio technicas. They are not as loud as them but maximum volume is just silly in headphones. But the grado's and ATH-M50s were uncomfortable on my head for long periods, with the grado's giving me itchy/irritated ears from the pads within minutes. For my taste of music (classic rock, soft rock, acoustic, voice, pop, jazz, instrumentals and classical) they sound really good and the loudness on them is satisfactory for me. The detail and clarity is there as well as the sound stage. This is all in the noise cancelling mode enabled, as with other reviews I do agree it becomes dull without NC enabled, but its better than nothing so that's one up from the predecessor. One CON from these is that there is a bit of noise leakage, we have an open plan office and sit in quad desk formations, and my coworkers could pick out music playing at about 60-70% volume, so I tend to stay at 50-55% and it seems to be okay in that regard. Out in public and at home they are good on higher volume settings but I never go above 75%.Noise Cancellation: These blow the sony NC cans out of the water and are surpass the isolation created by the ATH-M50s at similar volume levels. The effect when you first try on noise cancelling is spectacular, it feels like your ears have popped and everything is silent, you can't even hear yourself breathe. With only NC turned on you can pick up on close conversations but once there's music playing, even at a low volume, it's just you and the music. I still have to use these on an airplane but I have a few trips coming up where I can try these puppies on! the AAA battery feature is neat and a far better alternative to recharging lithium built in batteries and with 30-35 hour rated life on a single battery, it should last all week and/or a few plane rides.Overall, very happy with the purchase and I will update this review later on with more use of the product and after using it on flights.

VThey work great and now I don't have the rash problem
p1187
sg5
VI'll make this review concise.I purchased this headphone back in April. After a few use, I noticed skin rashes around my ear because of the ear pads. I stopped using it because the rashes were rather severe. I was surprised that Bose would use a cheap material on their 300 dollar headphone. This is why I am taking a star off.I've fixed this problem by purchasing a 3rd-party replacement earpads from Amazon for about 10 bucks. They work great and now I don't have the rash problem.Noise cancellation : it's not a fluke. This will probably be the best noise-cancelling headphone you can find out there. My workplace has a lot of source of ambient noise : testing equipment, computer fans, ventillation fans, fans from soldering station, etc (I'm an engineer). This headphone suppresses most of these noise down to 10% or lower. It does not work well on high-frequency sound, but it definitely blocks the lower frequency sound very well.pros- noise cancellation allows hearing music and music alone without being disturbed by the surround noise. It works very well!- very portable. the cable is just the right length, and the cups are not too big so hat you won't look like a teletubby.cons- the quality of the sound is not as good as other 300 dollar range headphones like Sennheiser HD600 and AKG 601. It's not as full or crisp. I think it's comparable to other $150 dollar range headphone if you turn on the noise cancellation.- without the noise cancellation turned on, this headphone sounds worse than my ATH M80 that I bought for 70 bucks. Bose really optimized the sound so that the headphone should be used with the noise cancellation on.Think of this as a $150 headphone with the additional $150 for superb noise cancellation.

VOwned For One Full Year.
p1193
sg5
VAfter having owned a pair for a full year these are my overall thoughts on various aspects of these headphones.Sound quality: 2.5/5 Overall decent sound.  There are better sounding headphones for about half of the price, but they won't have the noise cancellation.  The ear muffs completely cover the ear so these allow you to really focus on whatever you are listening to.  These phones will remove minor distortion in the audio.  This is great for listeners especially if you are listening to old recordings.  However, this is bad for audio engineers who want to be listening to how their audio will sound to everyone else.  Keep that in mind when purchasing.Noise cancelation:  3.5/5 It will remove almost all low frequency noise up to a high db range.  It will block out some of the loudest snoring.  If you live by a busy street with loud cars, and want to not hear any of that, this will cancel that out.  People yelling or being loud a floor above or below you will be cancelled very effectively.  High frequency sounds will pass through completely.  So if the television or radio in the same room, those voices will actually sound louder with these headphones.  I am sure that this is still some of the best cancellation available on the market today, but it still could use improvement in this area.Construction: 1/5 This is where these headphones really fail.  As others have said, the construction feels cheap.  It felt much more sturdy when I first bought them, but since everything feels much more disconnected.  The head size adjustment in the bands move too easily now, and when the ear muffs turn I try to be careful because they feel like they're going to break at some point.  Recently, and this is what has bothered me the most.  A seem in the leather on the ear muff undid so I can seem the foam insides.  I'll have to find a way to reseal this.  Also, the leather on the muffs is kind of thin, so it's starting to crack and develop tiny holes.Overall:  It has decent sound.  I love how these things help me sleep, or tune out the world when that is needed.  However, for the $300 price tag I expect something that will hold together for 3-4 years no problem.  It has only been one year so far.  I imagine these will hold up for another two years, I hope, but that will only happen with some effort on my part.

VNOTE: I am writing a review out of the box with a couple hours play time. These are simply the best headphones I've ever had. I had some Panasonic noise cancelling that were above average. But the ambient noise emitted to cancel other noises our was unpleasant to the ear after an hour or so. With Bose, I can play at loud volumes without any issues with an annoying slight tightness in my ear from the noise feature of the Samsung.I would compare these headphones to a very high end stereo in a room with great acoustics or a concert hall with great sound and acoustics, except the balance across the frequencies in the Bose is far superior with professional mixed music and balanced sound from Bose. Bass doesn't hit too hard but is enough to fill out the sound. Mids and treble are good too. I'm a guitar player so am used to having to adjust the frequencies of sound and Boss is great without any adjustment necessary.The only reason for four stars is that I have read that they require a "break in" of 50 hours to 100 hours. Maybe this isn't really necessary and the sound is excellent. It really fulfills my expectations, but I do hope the music with become a bit more crisp after some break in. It sounds like you are sitting in a recording studio with excellent acoustics, but because it's so balanced a little extra drive (power) coming out of the speaker might make it sound more rock and roll. This could certainly be great out of the box for very nuanced classical music which requires such balanced and well engineered acoustics. Maybe this is just my ears and what I'm used to, but I do think the break in idea may have something to it. I expect they will probably get better with more play time like many speakers and guitar amp components like tubes.The noise cancelling is excellent. It can put compete a loud Yamaha 5.1 audio receiver and speakers. I haven't tried it on a plane or something yet but expect it would work well. I just bought them because I appreciate great sound engineering and work in a noisy office cubicle.Another thing to note is that I agree with reviewers about the design. I like how they reduced the size and made them more attractive. Big headphones are outdated and seem very 80's or 90's. I opted for the white, tan, and aqua blue cord. I think it looks classy like a white BMW with tan leather and don't mind the lighter blue as a guy. It evokes a sense of avant garde design and makes moderate sized headphones more attractive looking which is important to me. Nobody wants great sound at the expense of looks. And the Bose brand name is well respected. Who wants some Dr. Dre beats crap that's supposed to be "cool." Nowadays, great sound and classy design are what I go for. They are comfortable and the carry case is nice. I'm not sure whether I wish it was larger like the former model with room for more than one extra battery yet. If you don't use the plane adapter then it appears it's possible one extra battery will fit possibly.

VDeep tones suffer...
p1204
sg5
VI'd like to start by saying that I wasn't looking for new headphones, and in fact I loved my QC15 to death, but accidents happen and my old pair were destroyed. So I called up Bose and they gave me the discount to upgrade to the QC25's. I've only had them for a little while, but I've definitely noticed some things that are amazing and not so amazing.Portability: Probably the best new feature is these headphones are made to fit into a smaller case. Not a bit deal, but for air-traveling folk that pack light (like myself), the smaller the space required, the better. And it's a bit weird how they do it, but it works. The headphone's can twist into place to make them fit the smaller case. Overall, impressed, but hoping this doesn't affect the life of the headphones.Accessibility: I'm calling it accessibility, but in all honesty that's my way of saying that these things work when the damn battery dies. Awesome. I hated getting on a plane and learning that the battery was dead in my QC15's and being stuck without music. I will add though that the sound is MUCH more muffled... I think this has been a common criticism from others. So just keep that noted.Comfort: Felt the same.Music Quality: This is the part that bugged me. I plugged in and started listening to Adele's new single "Hello" when I realized something sounded off... It came to me a moment later, the base sounded wrong... just completely wrong. So I broke out another set of headphones that are lower quality to see if it was just me or it was the QC25's. I could hear the deep tones so much better. I got onto my surround sound system and did the same thing, and sure enough it was still a much richer set of deep tones. Disappointment, but I did find a simple fix for other's out there that use iTunes or have an iPhone. Go to the EQ option on your music and turn on Deep. It'll fix it right up.I hear from others that there's a burn-in factor and after 100hrs it starts sounding better. I'm wondering if it's a burn-in factor or an adjustment. Either way, I can't get rid of my deep tones, those are (apparently) what make the songs for me.

VI purchased these using my wife's Amazon account so unfortunately it won't say I'm verified, but that's ok. I want to tell you how much I love these, anyway.I work in an office that's mostly quiet, but at times, because of the quietness, when a few people get talking, it can become distracting. I've become so used to the quietness that anything beyond that is jarring. I felt I needed a good pair of headphones I can tune everyone else out with, and I think I found them.For the $300 I paid (MSRP), I had high hopes and I mostly am satisfied. I have a couple nitpicks I want to cover, though.First, the good:The QC25 is great at cancelling voices, office noises, and other consistent sounds. When switched on, they sound great and I have a feeling I'd have a hard time even hearing the fire alarm. I've had people stand literally right next to me, try to talk to me, and I have zero idea they're standing there. With no music or other audio playing, they don't 100% cancel, but rather roughly 90%. I can hear things, but it's super muffled and almost non-existent. Even if all I want is a quieter environment and don't want music, I can put these on and flip the switch and get just that.At first, it was tough getting used to the near sound vacuum the headphones create. I can imagine it's what it feels like to go 100% deaf instantly. It's off-putting and kind of uncomfortable for about the first ten minutes, then you wonder how you got by without the silence. You think your space is quiet? You don't know quiet.I've worn these bad boys for an entire work day (about eight hours) and had zero complaints. I wear glasses, and as anyone that wears glasses knows, over-the-ear headphones can become uncomfortable in no time at all. The ear cups are so incredibly soft and the spring of the head band is so gentle, I don't think I could ever go back to a cheaper headset.The microphone works well, but it's hard to talk with the noise-cancellation turned on as you pretty much cancel out your own voice. It's hard to tell how loud you're talking, to be honest. I didn't buy these for the microphone so it's not a deal breaker for me.The case they come in is great and I use it all the time to store these cans. For the price, I couldn't imagine NOT keeping them in their case.Now, the not so good:The battery life leaves a little to be desired, but it still does well for using only one AAA battery. I find myself frequently forgetting to turn them off. One thing I would like to see is instead of a switch, it has a button or combination of both that enables an auto-off mode if no audio is playing with an override for those who just want silence.When they die, they go out in a blaze of glory. The QC25s will try to suck every single bit of juice it can out of the battery, and as such, will turn off and on when the charge is all but depleted.Neither of these things are enough to warrant knocking off a star, because I could just as well pay more attention to the green indicator on the switch.I'd recommend these to anyone who travels, works in a shared workspace, or just wants to hear nothing but the audio being pumped into their ears via physics.

VAwesome ANC, good but not perfect sound
p1214
sg5
VI'm now working in a relatively noisy open landscape environment where they pipe in music I don't particularly like. Since the music started, everyone is donning headphones so I thought I'd upgrade from my Apple earbuds.While I may not be an audiophile, I think I have fairly sensitive hearing and like well balanced frequency response curve and can note subtleties in soundscape and distortion, especially compression induced distortion.I've had a pair of Sony 7502 headphones many years ago and liked them, but they were uncomfortable being on the ear headphones.I've been able to sample a variety of cans at work including, Audio Technica 50x, Sennheiser 280, Sony 7506, Sony MDRV6, Sennheiser 202. Bose QC25.Most important to me is a relatively flat very broad frequency response curve with good extreme lows and highs. If the sound is colored at all, I tend to prefer a gentle boost at low bass, <50hz, I dislike mid to upper bass, and like clear highs.In my survey, the Sennheiser 202 sound awful. Its well outside of this price range at $25, so maybe thats why.The rest I think sound excellent. My personal favorite is the Sony 7506. For $80 its hard to beat. The frequency response curve does not seem to be ruler flat to me but where it deviates it does so in the way that pleases my tastes. It suppresses bass from around 50-200hz, then has a slight rise on the high end to make the cans overall sound brighter than the rest.I would have stayed with the Sony's except that their noise isolation is not very good in my office setting. A worse problem for me is that the Sonys cup material squeaks against my glasses making a disastrously loud sound when I'm trying to enjoy some music.My next favorite is the Sennheiser 280s. They have much better isolation, similar feel to the Sonys with the same slightly deflated mid to upper bass around 50-200, strong low bass and pleasant but not overly bright highs. They're ok comfort wise but seemed a little tight on my head.The Audio Technics seem to be a favorite online and in the office, but I found them flatter sounding. They also exhibit a dip in the bass but it extends farther into the mids, roughly 60-1khz. They sound fine, but I prefer the others and the other cans are less expensive.However... I also purchased some Bose QC25 so use as a benchmark. My initial impression of the sound is that its blander than the Sony. I ran audio tests on audiocheck.net with all these headphones. With the Bose, to my hearing they have a completely flat frequency response curve all the way from 20hz up to 10khz.But the sound isn't quite as appealing as the Sony 7506. I've spent some extended time trying both headphones at home and at work and have been surprised by my findings.I originally started out looking for the best sounding headphones, but after a while I discovered that I actually valued quiet even more.Basically I've fallen in love with the idea of noise cancellation. The Bose are so amazingly quiet. An incredible cone of silence. I can hear all the little nuance of quiet music that simply isn't possible at my hectic and loud office and home with several active growing boys. I found myself listening to music at lower and lower volume. At one point I realized I was listening to music at a lower volume than the background noise in the office. That was amazing to me.The sound of the Bose is very good although less than ideal for my personal taste. However I notice very minor tweak on an equalizer, only a couple of db push on the highs and a couple of db reduction of mid bass, maybe a little push on 30hz bass and its perfect. Its also very listenable without any equalization.Its possible that I sometimes here a little distortion introduced in certain frequencies and scenarios, but I haven't been able to confirm.The headphone itself is extremely comfortable. More comfortable than any of the others I've tried.Bottom line, I don't really have any complaints about the Bose other than the shockingly high price. I can't believe I've gone from considering $25 headphones to buying a $300 set of headphones.My dilemma now is if its really worth the money. Ive decide that the quiet is more important to me than sound quality. So ANC has become a must. There are Sennheiser 450s, Audio Technica ANC7, 9, 70. But reviews on all the others don't sound as good as the Bose, so I'm very tempted to just stay with the Bose. Excellent class leading noise cancellation and very good although not perfect sound.

VThe QC25 is brilliant. I'm new to the world of ANC headphones, but I have used Beats before (which are sort of the runner ups) and they don't compare; price wise, as well as comfort and quality. First of all, the QC25 is the most comfortable headphones I've tried on. I even went to the local Best Buy and compared all the other NCs available like the Bowers, Seinheisser, Harmon & Kardon and Sony: the bose were absolutely the best fit for me. They're light, yet durable and they don't squeeze your ears which can be extremely headache-ing. They sit right over your ears. As I mentioned, the sound quality is exquisite. Now, it's not as ostentatious and loud as Monster or Skull Candy or even Beats, but the sounds that come out of the earphones are pristine, transparent, and crisp. You won't miss a single note or bass thump. The Acoustic Noise Cancellation is amazing... I bought these to silence my surroundings and they do just that. I can be in a cafe, a restaurant, or at a park and when I put these on I am alone with my computer or iphone. I can focus directly on my music and/or my project. I will say though, the ANCs sort give you the sensation that your eardrums are being sucked out, but I got used to it quickly. I'd like to think that it just adds to the legitimacy of the NC anyway.Basically those are the pros. Here are the cons: Not as loud as other wanna-be's. It is wired, BT would've been nice. Single AAA battery, instead of rechargeable lithiums. You won't get to hear your girlfriend when she says sweet nothings while you have these on, which is fine because you're listening to your music, but when you realize that her mouth is moving and she in fact is looking at you saying something with a smile on her face... you'd have to lift one phone up completely just to ask her what she said, but then she won't tell you because shes a girl and girls do that. Just sayin'.

VExcellent Headphones
p1224
sg5
VAlthough these headphones are pricey, they are well worth it. They are a marked improvement in sound quality and design from the QC 15's. Prior to the QC 25's, my primary headphones were the Bose AE2 headphones, which I absolutely loved. They sounded great and they were very comfortable, however, when in a loud environment the sound quality diminished greatly. With the QC 25's. this simply is not so. The 25's provide excellent sound quality no matter how loud it is around you.Design:The design of these headphones is absolutely superb. They plastics feel very sturdy, and they have yet to be scratched. I never worry about these headphone getting damaged simply because of how solid they feel. The headphone cups rotate to lay flat when around your neck, but they only rotate about half that in the other direction. This has never been a problem in any way for me. One thing that I really like about these headphones is that when I use them just for the noise cancelling, there isn't a massive gap on the side of my headphones where the cable plugs in. It does not effect anything except for the aesthetics. The outside of the headphone (with the Bose label) is made of some sort of metal, presumably aluminum. This also adds to the overall aura of quality that surrounds these headphones. Another thing that I really like about these headphones is that the headband no longer has leather wrapped on the top. While it looks and feels great at first, after a few years this leather starts to break down and flake off. Again, it's not the end of the world, but it doesn't look the greatest when it happens. The cloth on headband of the 25's feels very high quality and seems like it would be very easy and simple to clean, if need be. Although these headphones are slightly heavier than my old AE2's, even after 6+ hours I can barely tell that they are there. As is with all Bose around-ear headphones, there cups feel heavenly, and are easily replaceable. These headphones definitely feel like they are designed to last.Sound Quality:As I mentioned earlier, these headphone are a marked improvement in terms of sound quality over its predecessor. They don't feel "closed off ", as the 15's do, and they are definitely louder. When the noise cancelling is off the sound  quality definitely drops, but it is still better than a lot of headphones on the market. The biggest difference between having the noise cancelling off and on was the volume of the music. I would definitely recommend listening to music with the noise cancelling on, otherwise, what's the point? Overall these headphones sounds great. I am not saying that they are the best sounding $300 on headphones are the market, but they are way up there. An important note is that while there are better sounding headphones out there, none of them can boast the level of noise cancelling that the 25's do, and that is a huge deal when yours on a bus or plane, or somewhere generally loud.Noise Cancelling:When compared to the 15's you would be hard pressed to notice a difference with the noise cancelling. Not to say that the noise cancelling needed improvement, but if you're buying these headphone just for the noise cancelling you might want to consider the 15's if the $300 price tag seems just a tad too high. That being said, I love the noise cancelling on these headphones. They block out all of the low frequencies, and drastically reduce the volume of higher frequencies. The result is that you will most likely be able to have a normal conversation with someone while wearing these (no music of course). I use these headphones at work when I am down in the shop, and I never cease to be impressed by these headphones. When I traveled to London a couple years ago my girlfriend and I could have a normal conversation while wearing these (she has the 15's), when no one else could hear us. I also wear these headphones a lot in the car (not when I'm driving, of course), and they make a long car ride a heck of a lot more bearable. Also, as I mentioned earlier, the greatest thing about the 25's is that your music always sounds great, no matter how loud it is around you. When is comes to noise cancelling, Bose is the best.Battery and Case:As for the battery, I seem to get right around 35 hours on a AAA. The case also has a very convenient spot for a spare battery. The case is the perfect size, and it fits almost anywhere just perfectly. It is much better than the QC 15 case. It is a semi-hard case, which is good for finding a place to put it, and since the headphones are so durable themselves, the case definitely does not need to be hard.Overall these headphones are great. The design, sound quality, battery life, cable and case are all superb. I would definitely recommend these headphones for anyone who loves music, and ever has to be in a noisy environment (i.e. everyone). This is definitely one of the best purchases, and I look forward to using these headphones for years to come.

VGenuinely Extraordinary Noise Cancellation

VI love listening to music, but am not an audiophile.  Consequently, I don't keep separate headphones around for travel and for listening in different scenarios.  I want one pair of headphones that I can use at my computer, on an airplane, or sitting on my couch.  The QC25 excel in all of these settings.In terms of comfort, they are light and fit my large head snugly without being obtrusive. They have the solid feel and excellent build quality we have all come to expect from Bose.  I could easily wear them all day.Sound quality is, to my (admittedly untrained and unpicky ear) outstanding.  I listen primarily to acousitc singer-songwriter and folk music, so I care primarily about mid-range vocal clarity, and I found that to be exceptionally good.  Bass response sounded great to me, but I've never been able to muster the passionate opinions about bass that many headphone reviewers.Where the headphones blew me away, however, was the noise cancelling.  I've always considered noise cancelling to be something of a gimmick.  Not so with the QC25's.  The difference as soon as I switched it on was astonishing.  If you work in a noisy environment, and need to filter out as much of the background noise as possible, these are the ones.  Expect to swap out the AAA batteries every few days, but it will definitely be worth it.In terms of accessories, the headphones come with a minijack cable, an airline adapter, and a well-crafted, slim (for full-size headphones) case.There are many headphones with which you absolutely do not get what you pay for.  The Bose QuietComfort 25 do not fall into that category.  In return for your $300 you will get an outstanding pair of headphones with exceptional noise-cancelling capabilities, great sound, excellent portability, and solid build quality.  Although they are clearly meant to be used on-the-go with your Samsung (or, presumably, any Android) phone, I think that for most folks they would make a great choice for daily use.  I highly recommend them.

VDon't overthink--Effective sound cancellation, brilliant sound quality, very comfortable and perfectly fine storage
p1235
sg5
VBottom line: Very comfortable, even after many hours. Effective sound cancellation. Truly astounding sound when listening to all types of music. Convenient and adequate storage. Now for a few details. Despite the many details offered on other reviews, take it from this discriminating traveler: the Q25 is a definite upgrade from the 15. Sound cancellation may be the same, but quality of the sound is much more brilliant. After a couple of hours of wear on flights, the 15 gave me headaches because felt like it pinched my head. Wore the 25 for five hours straight and never felt discomfort. Forget the complaints about storage and hypothesized problems with folding the unit. The 25 feels sturdy, even as you fold it, and fits snugly into the square case, which I like better than the headphone-shaped case of the 15. The case has the same external compartment for storing the headphone cord and an extra battery or two. The hard plastic insert for the airline adaptor and an extra battery is nice touch. I don't understand the complaints of other reviewers. The rectangular case fits better inside my luggage pockets than the 15's case. Finally, the 25 is more streamlined--I feel less conspicuous wearing these phones than the 15. For me, the 25 is step up. Although I appreciate the head-to-heads offered by other reviewers, I feel like they were overthinking. Without bothering to make a comparison, these are hands-down amazing phones. Compared to my 15s, I'm glad to have made the purchase. Long, previously boring flights (because I couldn't stand wearing the 15s for more than an hour or two), are now more comfortable. I do agree with others that an important limitation is that the cord controls only work with iPhones. This is truly a shame, and the *only* negative I can find with this unit. I would probably consider using these phones more frequently than only when traveling on flights if I could use the controls to communicate with my Android phone, but I am still very pleased with these phones.

VThese over ear Bose QC25 headphones are great
p1241
sg5
VI will not attest to being an audiophile, nor will I claim these are the best headphones on the market...I owned some old Bose headphones a few years ago, but they were not noise cancelling, and, overall, these are a good step up.These QC25 are extremely comfortable - I could wear them constantly for a very long time. I will really be putting that to the test on an upcoming transcontinental flight that will run over 8 hours...The noise cancelling functionality is really great. It's fun to play around with too... obviously  it does not block out everything completely, particularly unpredictable noise patterns, e.g. conversations, but it does just enough so that you can enjoy your audio content at very moderate or even low volume settings.Regarding quality, the hardware quality is great. As I said before, the ear pieces are very comfortable, and they appear well designed and built. I know they are relatively fragile because I did in my last pair by accidentally sitting on them, but i wouldnt expect any more from lightweight thin plastic. However, those old headphones did not have foldable ear pieces like the QC25, a feature which i believe would have prevented my last pair from breaking like they did. It also makes for very convenient/compact storage.For sound quality, they are great. Again, I don't want to go into audiophile land, but given that these are compact, noise cancelling, and have very minimal noise leakage, I think the sound is great across the board. I'm a bit big on bass, and these provide the punch I am used to in my car with my subs. The only other headphones I've seen people reference as having better overall sound quality and bass cannot compete as a full package on the three things I previously mentioned: size, noise cancelling, and noise leakage.Overall, I love my Bose products, and, unfortunately for Bose, I hope I can go on to enjoy this same pair for decades to come!

VNoticeable improvement over QC15
p1247
sg5
VWe live in a house with an open-floor plan, which highlights and magnifies every noise.  So for the past three years I have used both the Bose QC15s and Sennheiser PXC 450s on a daily basis.  I used the QC15s to listen to music at bedtime (and drown out my wife\u2019s white noise machine) and I use the Sennheisers for watching television.  Both have served me well, though the Sennheiser\u2019s inferior noise cancellation limits its usefulness in our bedroom setting.Recently, the ear pads on my QC15s wore out and, although I replaced them with genuine Bose products, the new ones kept popping off.  Thus, when the QC25s came out, I thought I would try them.  Right out of the box, the improvements in sound quality and noise cancellation were noticeable.  The QC25s sound much brighter, more precise, more sensitive and spacious than the comparatively muddy sounding QC15s.  Furthermore, they cancelled out the white noise machine noticeably better than did the QC15s.  Both distinctions were instantly apparent and do not factor in any burn-in of the QC25s. Also, the QC25s are more comfortable and more substantial than my QC15s, which I kept and still work.Now, some users may not find these improvements to be dramatic enough to plop down $300 to replace functioning QC15s--especially if you use them infrequently for travel.  But if you use these headphones on a daily basis, I recommend the upgrade.As per the Sennheisers, they still are better for television viewing for two reasons: They don\u2019t totally blank out all ambient sound, which prevents me from being startled; and they are better built, which helps them better survive being tossed around the TV room on a daily basis.  What are the sound quality differences between the Sennheiser PXC 450s and the QC25s?  A close call from my perspective, it comes down to taste\u2014I lean toward the QC25s.  But the noise cancellation is not close at all, the QC25s are VASTLY superior, plus the Sennheisers eat batteries, even when NC is turned off.

p1253
sg5
VI was looking for a comfortable pair of headphones to wear (over glasses) for several hours in a shared office space.After comparing to other competing products (I ended up narrowing it down to these and the Sony MDR10RNC), I found these to be the most comfortable to wear for several hours, the least compromising on sound quality, and with the most effective noise reduction (combination of the electronics and acoustic isolation).Comfort: the moment I put these on, they felt way too comfortable (too comfortable only because it would be difficult to justify buying cheaper headphones after having felt just how comfortable they are). I usually get headaches after less than an hour wearing headphones on top of my glasses, yet I can wear these with no headaches for 2-3 hour stretches. Any headphones I compared to these on comfort came up unsatisfactory (only because the Bose comfort was my benchmark).Sound quality: noise cancelling headphones are going to be a compromise in sound quality compared to dedicated wired headphones (a good pair that is). Having accepted that sound quality will not be perfect (especially being plugged into a laptop headphone jack... and not one with good audio processing/circuitry), the Bose did a good job. The mids were very clear and not muddy (the Sony were much muddier in comparison); the lows were clear, and the highs were very light and springy. All together, the sound quality makes it easy to listen to a wide range of music (from orchestral, to electronic, to folk, to metal, and most anything in between). More importantly for me, I could listen to music without fatiguing my ears - which was important to drown out any typing noises that were defeating the sound isolation and noise reduction.Noise reduction: I was as happy as possible with the overall noise reduction. The padding, shape, and pressure of the headphones provided good sound isolation, and the circuitry took care of any background noises. The only problem was that these made the annoying typing of my office mate even more distinct. The only way for me to drown that out was with music, and the sound quality made it easy for me to listen to music without having it be too overwhelming (nevertheless, rock music lacks some umpf no matter how I tweak the EQ).All together, I wish less expensive headphones would have been satisfactory, but the comfortable feel of the Bose really spoiled me, and made it a rather unfair competition. Added to that, the sound quality is easy on the ears and versatile enough for prolonged listening. The noise cancellation does what it needs to do (if they would magically silenced my maniacal-keyboard-bashing-neighbor, that would earn these a 6th star).

VIncredible Headphones for Focusing On What Matters
p1259
sg5
VAbsolutely incredible headphones.Noise Cancellation: Almost supernatural. While I have not had a chance to use these on a plane yet, I frequently use them in a busy noisy Starbucks to study. With just noise cancellation, ambient noise is reduced almost to zero, and peoples voices become muffled and duller. If I turn on the music at a decent volume, I can pretty much fade away into my zone. Very little sounds gets through if you are playing any genre of music including classical.Sound quality:With the noise cancellation on, these sound incredible, but have a bit to be desired in terms of base. That said, I have noticed that the sound quality of these headphones have been improving with use a bit, so there may be a bit of a burn in period. Either way, you ears are in for a treat. The interesting thing about these is, with the noise cancellation, you can make out sounds you may have missed in the music before. This is especially true when I compare them to my Bose Over-ear Soundtrues these replaced.tl;dr, People that are audiophiles may find a bit to be desired here, but for the average listener using itunes, or spotify, these will do wonders. That said, you buy these for the noise cancellation, not necessarily for the sound IMO. The great quality sound is a plus!The above review about sound quality is not true when the cans run out of battery. They sound very muffled, and probably around the same quality of a cheap skullcandy headphone. That said.. it's nice to have the feature either way.Build quality: My first reaction when unboxing these guys was "wow". They have a beautiful minimalist design, and seem to be much sturdier and more attractive than the previous QC15. If you are getting these to stand out, these do so in an elegant reserved way. Classier than the beats in terms of looks IMO.Definitely recommend!

p1265

VI haven't made it onto the plane yet for my maden voyage since upgrading from QC15 to QC25, but can already see the difference between the new Bose QC25s and the old QC15s. The QC15s were great at blocking the engine noise, and similar sounds like air conditioners and other mechanical hum or roar. These QC25 block everything. I can't hear anything at all except for the music and an occasional voice that is close enough or loud enough to get through.  It is kind of eerie how well they work.I used to tell people who asked about my Bose QC15s that there were cheaper alternatives that were just as good. I don't think that is the case with these QC25s. They are absolutely amazing at blocking noise and sound, and the audio quality of the music you are playing is phenomenal.This is my fourth pair of Bose Quiet Comfort Headphones. I bought each previous version, upgrading each time there was a new one. These QC25 are much better than the earlier models.  This is the first time that I don't think that there is still room for improvement. I use these about 8 hours a day in a noisy office, then at home to isolate me from the noise from TVs and other family members, and about once a week on flights. They excel at all three of those uses.  They are tuned to almost completely remove the noise that comes from airplane engines, air conditioners, and noisy offices.I highly recommend this headphones for frequent fliers and for people that have a difficult time concentrating when there is background conversations or television. They are well made and do a very good job.The long battery-life and new compact folding design are also big improvements over previous QC headphones.  They are also more comfortable.Basically I like everything about these.

VThese Bose 715053-0020 QuietComfort 25 Headphones are absolutely amazing in every regard! I have many pairs of good headphones, but none that compare to the features and sound quality of these Bose headphones. Here are my observations:Includes; Headphones, "AAA" Battery, 3.5mm Audio Cable, Airline Adapter, Case, Instructions, Quick Start Guide, Warranty Card, Safety GuideSetup; Install the "AAA" Battery in the "Right" earphone and connect the audio cable between the "Left" earphone and your device. Turn on the power switch on the "Right" earphone and enjoy.Note: The headphones will work fine with a dead battery, but you will not get the active noise cancellation+ Physical Quality; these are very well made with high quality materials and good construction+ Audio Quality; full and rich sound across all ranges, I have never experienced better+ Comfort; these adjust for every head size we tried them on, from small to very large+ Noise Cancellation; exceptionally good at negating fan and air conditioning noises, very good at blocking talking and normal background noise+ Phone; the audio cable in-line volume controls and mic worked great with my iPhone 5+ Marked Earphones; it is a small thing, but I like that each earphone is clearly marked on the inside for the correct side with either "L" or "R"The included airline adapter makes these compatible with the in-flight entertainment systems found on most modern airplanes. I do not fly much these days, but did a lot for my previous career and would have really appreciated the active noise cancellation that seems to tuned for the low level hum that permeates airline cabins.These are absolutely wonderful headphones!Highly Recommended!CFH

VPeace on flights? Yes!
p1292
sg5
VWow, just wow! I purchased these headphones primarily for air travel and family road trips. I'm an anxious air traveler. I'm not afraid the plane is going to crash, I just feel trapped. The constant noise of the plane and fellow passengers increases the anxiety.I was absolutely positively blown away by how much peace I had on two flights last week. I felt more air-travel relaxed than I have in over a decade. The headphones completely block out the plane sound. You can hear voices, but they sound muffled and far away. There was a lady sitting in front of me who talked non-stop from the moment she sat down, all the way through the flight, walking through the jetway, and into the terminal. Something like that would have normally driven me nuts, but it didn't bother me at all.With regard to sound quality, I've heard better, but it's still very good. I'm paying $$$ for noise canceling. For a good portion of the flight, I just had the noise canceling turned on with no audio playing. When I watched a TV show, it felt like I was watching it at home in my living room. No need to crank up the volume to hear dialogue or music.One thing that I hoped for but didn't achieve was blocking out my snoring husband. The only way I could block the noise was to use the headphones combined with earplugs and a white noise app. For me, the best solution for a snoring spouse is to move said-spouse to a sofa in another room, preferably a far away room.Overall, even though they are expensive, I am extremely satisfied.

p1298
sg5
V**When plugging in the headphone cable to the headphones, apply extra force until you feel it click into place. It feels like to much force but it's not! This will fix the audio cutting out in right ear cup!**Build quality- These headphones have a metal outer ear cup, and high quality plastic trim. The headphones band is strong, with premium cloth on the top and padding on the bottom. They are a very well built pair of headphones.Audio Quality- I'm not an audiophile by any means, but these headphones have amazing audio quality. Highs and mids are highlighted a little, but are balanced with lows.You can find better sound quality at this price range, but these are noise cancelling headphones, and you will be very pleased with the audio quality.Comfort- These headphones are among the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn. The light weight, soft headband, and comfortable ear cups allow you to listen as long as you want, with out getting fatigue.Noise cancelling- I'll get straight to the point with this, it is the best noise cancelling you will find in a pair of headphones. It completely cuts out low noises such as airplane engines, air conditioners and traffic. High pitched and sudden noises cannot be totally cut out, but they are suppressed.Extra info- The headphones come with a very premium feeling carrying case, along with a aaa battery and an airline adapter. Make sure to get the right pair for your device too if you want the in-line audio controls and mic to work.

VGreat Headphones
p1303

VI read the 11 one-star reviews before reading the 264 five-star reviews prior to ordering the QC25 headphones.  It seemed apparent to me that some of those 11 one-star reviewers, who purchased the QC25 headphones or similar, had either false expectations of "noise cancelling" capabilities or fell prey to the inevitable lemon that awaits that unfortunate buyer.  I have several other Bose products, including a pair of A20 (aviation/pilot version with noise cancelling) headset and have yet to be disappointed or receive a bad product from Bose.Noise cancellation is not a magical process, where all noise is cancelled out.  The electronic process of noise cancellation is limited to the band/frequency of noise that particular device is designed to cancel.  I have found the QC25's I have in hand perform as advertised.  The headphones do filter out a lot of background noise, especially at the lower frequencies such as aircraft cabin noise, automotive exhaust, and similar.  Higher frequency noise such as voice, fireworks, doors slamming closed, and similar are muffled-  not cancelled.  There is a distinguishable difference in noise level with and without the noise cancellation active, while the headphones are properly worn.  Another one of the 11 one-star reviews made mention of the detachable cord/cable as being cheaply made.  I do not see the cord/cable as a problem, unless one is using it to hang upside-down suspended only by the cord/cable.  Comfort and fit, and performance of the QC25 is great in my experience.

VI didn't know how good it is until I buy Sony.I travel a lot which makes me think buying nice headset is necessary for a good rest on flights, Actually I had QC15 but I don't like the "pressurized" feeling while turning on NC (btw if NC is off you hear nothing on QC15), by chance I tried QC25 and found that the bad feeling is gone and sound quality is much better, and also I can still listen to music if NC is off on QC25, so I buy it myself.Until one day I found Woot is doing discount on Sony MDRZX770BN which also have NC and good review, better part is Sony uses bluetooth so i could cut the wires,  it looked to me that Sony charges also 200$+ so the quality should be somewhere in par with QC25.But it didn't, NC on Sony seems not working at all from my point of view, comparing them side by side, I could simply tell that QC25 blows off ZX770 on NC, bass and simply built quality, it feels cheap and sad when I turn to ZX770, that's the time I realized that QC25 is so awesome.Worst part is that I purchased ZX770 from Woot, it took them 7 days to "prepare shipment" and another 7 days for Fedex delivery, and I wasn't able to cancel or return it 15 mins after I placed the order, purchasing from Woot is not fun at all.I guess what I really want to say is QC25 is the best, and never buy anything from Woot.

p1326
sg5
VThese headphones are great for the price. They lack the audio quality of my Polk Ultrafocus 8000's, but they're a bit less expensive, much lighter and smaller, and more comfortable. I tend to agree with reviewer comments that the noise cancellation is better on the Bose QC 25's, but it's a subtle difference. The difference in size isn't subtle though: the Polk UF 8000's are too heavy and large to travel with, but the Bose are not a problem. I've worn the Bose now on several California-to-Europe flights (~10 hours) comfortably, which I could not have done with the Polk's.However the audio quality of the Polk's really is quite a lot better, particularly in the depth and clarity of the lows. The Bose seems comparatively thin in the lows and overemphasized in the mid range. The Polk's to me seem much more neutral across a very wide spectrum. Don't get me wrong, the Bose sound great if I listen to them by themselves, the differences become more apparent when I A/B them.Have been delighted using the Bose on my flights and for long home use, but I still prefer the Polk's when I'm at home for shorter (eg < 1 hour) listening stints.I've used both to make phone calls with an iPhone and through a computer with skype, and both seemed to work equally well. For that, the comfort of the Bose is a win since the audio quality doesn't matter.

VI'm not and audiophile. I just like to have a decent pair of headphone to listen to music and watching movies/videos on my devices.Pros- Comfortable. I can wear this for hours and won't feel any strain on/around my ears.- Quiet. It dramatically reduces low frequency noises like airplane hums or background noises in coffeehouse.- Detachable cable. If the cable fails for some reason, all you have to do is purchase just a new cable, not the entirely new pair of headphone.- Crisp & clear sound. Usual for Bose, sound profile is leaning more towards mid and higher frequency while giving out a very nice/tight base.- AAA batteries. No more proprietary battery like QC3.- Looks nice. I prefer this look over the older QC15/QC3.- Smaller case. Easier to carry around when traveling.Cons....I can't think of anything.Honestly, I can't find anything that I'm not happy with. Unless you like a bass heavy stuff, QC25 should give you everything you want. A crisp and clear sound with decent amount of bass. The noise canceling that block out background noises (not everything though).Again, since I'm not an audiophile, I can't really critique the sound profile of QC25, but as an average consumer who cares about sound quality, this was a great buy.PS. The box redesign is also amazing.

VExtremly Comfortable with Excellent Noise Cancellaiton
p1338

VIve tried a a couple of noise cancelling headphone before I bought these. The bose qc15's and Harman Kardon Noise Cancelling headphones. Both were very good in terms of comfort and noise cancelling. I tried these and have been using them for last 5 weeks and I can say they are much better in just about every aspect. I can easily wear them for more than 6 hours continously without any problems. I wear prescription glassses and dont experience any problems when using these headphones. Also my ears dont get hot like they used to with bose qc15's or the Harman Kardons. The noise cancelling is superb, they block out alot more noise then the other two models I owned. The headphones are also the lightest of the 3 headphones. The sound quality is much improved from the previous qc15 model. They sound more balanced now, with just the right amount of bass and treble. I like the fact that I can still use these headphones even when the battery runs out, although the noise cancelling wont work. The only thing I can say that I noticed that is different from the qc15's is that these headphones dont come with a second cable and there is no longer a switch for high or low noise cancellation. I also like the new look and improved built quality of the qc25. I highly recommend these to any one who spends a long time listening to music or travels alot, you wont be disappointed.

VNot Really An Upgrade From QC15s (just over-hyped marketing)
p1343
sg5
VI expected to be really impressed with these headphones.  I'm not and it's been a month.  3 stars for an average feel. The video reviews and audiophiles like me seem to love them.  They are nice.... but not really a step up from my old QC15's.  These reviewers must be paid by Bose to amp up their reviews.  Which is annoying for real consumers like us.  We want real answers, not "sponsored by" answers.  I probably wouldn't have bought them with an honest review about the difference.  So with that in mind, consider this......The TRUTH - it's more like a step sideways for those upgrading from QC15s. Here's why:1. Ear cups are a bit stiffer - not as soft as the previous version.  Maybe for durability, but don't claim they are more comfortable.  They are a little LESS comfortable than the QC15's. The look is nicer though and less corporate looking.  But that's not worth the price difference - this is for sound, not style.2. Noise reduction is good - always good, but hardly different from the old ones.  And worse, now people can hear my music from the outside.  I liked how silent my old ones were.  Now these are very obvious when I am listening to loud music.  So much for being stealth with my sounds.3. Sound level tops out - WTF?  These do NOT get loud.  I've maxed out the volume on many different sources - there must be some volume cap, which sucks.  Sometimes it's nice to kick it up to serious levels when you are in the mood.  And dammit, you can't do that with these.  Weak.4. Sound quality - people used to complain the Bose sound was 'flat'.  I never agreed.  They sounded great to me.  Now these claim to be SO much better with sound.  Um, please.  Not really - they are essentially the same thing, no matter how many marketing terms they print, they only have a bit more depth and separation, but its extremely subtle.  I went back and forth between old and new with the same song and, eh, who the hell hears the difference?  No one really.  They are blowing smoke if they say they are.Overall, while I like these headphones - don't be fooled.  Don't get too excited.  You can get the older QC15s and be just as happy.

VBest headphones I've ever had. Noise-canceling function is excellent, impressive!
p1349
sg5
VHi, this is my very first product review on Amazon. I don't usually write reviews, but after buying theses headphones I find that I need to share my opinion, hoping that could help someone who's considering to buy. Pls excuse any English faults since it's not my first language.I'm not a Bose-maniac, I've own different headphones from Sony, Audio-Technica, older Bose models.... The last one I've got is the Sony MDR-1R. I was very happy with the Sony MDR-1R, they sound excellent with very strong bass, clear voice and they work great with most music genres. Well, nothing to complain about the sound quality of the Sony MDR-1R. However, these Sony headphones make me a little tired when listening to music too long time (I usually wear headphones at work (office), almost all the working time). Therefore, I'd like to change them for some more comfortable ones.I've got a pair of Bose Supra that I've been using for almost 6 years. I like their sound very much, however they lack some low (bass). So I wanted to try newer, higher-class Bose ones. I had hesitated quite a lot when considering these Bose QC25, since they are quite expensive, and I had never owned noise-canceling headphones. I did not want to go for noise-canceling because I don't travel much (noise-canceling is not mandatory for me).Moreover, I thought that it was a kind of trade-off between noise-canceling technology (that costs money) and sound quality (meaning with the same amount of money, you can get better headphones without noise-canceling).Anyway, I decided to buy these Bose QC25. And now I have to say that this is a perfect choice! Talking of the sound quality itself, it's "Bose-class", with very clear voice, gentle, balanced mid & bass. These Bose (these new QC25 and the old Supra) do not make me tired quickly as the Sony MDR-1R.And finally about the noise-canceling function: It's excellent and impressive. When I turn it on, I hear nothing else but my music. At home, the headphones eliminate the noise of the refrigerator, of the AC running, of the surrounding ambient noise from the environment. In the office, it can eliminate about 90% of ambient noise. I'm so happy with the noise-canceling function that I wear these headphones when driving my car! On the road, it can eliminate about 70% of ambient noise; it's like I'm driving a super luxury car with top noise-proof technology (mine is a BMW 325i - 2005).However, the when turning on the noise-canceling function, you'll feel some pressure on your inner ears. I mean real pressure, air pressure, it's not so comfortable at first. But maybe because it's the perfect silence that I had never experience before! But if you turn on the music, you won't feel that pressure anymore.Finally, sound quality is much better with the noise-canceling function turned on. It's really better sound quality, not just because you don't hear the ambient noise. Even the users manual says that the headphones "Still sound" when you turn off the noise-canceling switch. Therefore, you might one to turn on noise-canceling function all the time.So if you are considering buying these Bose QC25 headphones, go ahead and buy them! You will not be disappointed. These are the best headphones I've ever had. Especially for the noise-canceling function as described above, it's worth the money. Even if you don't travel much, having these Bose QC25 will bring you a completely new music experience in your office or your home.Thanks for reading. I hope my review could help.

VTerrific Headphones
p1361
sg5
VThese are the best pair of headphones I have ever owned. I tried the Beats Studios and, while they sound great in the store, once you get them home and they aren't playing specific songs EQ'd to perfection you realize how bass heavy they are. So, I returned them to get the Bose SoundTrue Headphones. However, they felt extremely flimsy compared to the Sound Comfort Headphones next to them. So, I tried the Quiet Comfort 15's on display and was absolutely blown away at the noise canceling capabilities. I decided to buy the QC25's since they were the newer model. Seriously, as stated in other reviews, I have to remind myself how amazing it is each time. I work in a Biochemistry Lab and hated that I can always hear the blowers that pressurize the lab over everything. Sometimes I just turn on the headphones without music so that I can just hear nothing. The sound quality is balanced and terrific. If you are a basshead, it probably won't wow you but I listen to the "Electronic Study Music" and "Chillstep" Playlists on Spotify daily, and have yet to feel that the bass isn't enough. I listened to "Cinema" which has one of the lowest bass drops in my collection at full volume and it sounded perfect. With these headphones I can lay in bed at night and literally escape to another world in the music I am listening too. I know that these are expensive, but they are worth every. single. penny. Just give them one try. If you have a Best Buy near you, go try out the Quiet Comfort there and make sure to run the demo, if its the same at all stores, it replicates the sounds of an airplane taking off and you literally are completely oblivious until it has you take them off. I was hooked. Enjoy Your Purchase!

p1366
sg5
Vthese work great--as long as your expectations are realistic. They are very good at canceling background sounds that are constant and even. Any sounds that are momentary come through loud and clear. I use these while driving a tractor which (due to the hydrostatic drive) runs at full RPM all the time. These headphones cut the engine sound by about 2/3. However, any other sounds are still just as loud (rocks being hit by mower deck, etc.) Listening to music is super clear, even in that loud environment. In fact, i'm hearing words in old songs more clearly than I ever have before... (Apparently, Benny and the Jets have electric "boots"...  Who knew?)My wife tried using these headphones while mowing lawn on a zero-turn mower. They did not do as well in that environment because the background sound changes so rapidly (engine sounds, hydraulic wheel drives, etc. are not smooth and even levels or pitches.) for that environment, she prefers to use drummer's headphones. Those don't have active noise cancellation, but they are better at passive isolation.I had a pair of bose noise canceling headphones about 5 years ago. I didn't like them--when active, they audio sensation felt like a kind of 'pressure' in my ears. This new model doesn't feel/sound anything like that. Much better technology.

VI seriously love these noise canceling headphones. I bought these for my first international flight to the Philippines. The flight was 17 hours total and I was worried about trying to sleep with the engine noise. These headphones entirely eliminate the engine noise in an aircraft. I wore them the entire 17 hours while I was in the air and my ears never felt crushed or sensitive. The headphones are incredibly comfortable to wear for extended amounts of time.I flew on the Boeing 787 for one leg of the journey and while wearing these head phones and watching a movie in the LED display, I even forgot I was on an airplane for a couple hours. The comfort and effectiveness of these head phones made my flight almost easy. My girlfriend loved them as well so I'll be buying her some of these for our next long flight.These headphones satisfied all of my needs, but I want to be clear about what they won't do. These headphones won't stop you from hearing a crying baby. They won't stop you from hearing your seat-mate talking. The headphones seem to most effectively cancel our consistent noises such as fans, engine noise, or keyboard typing. Noises that spike such as conversation, knocking, or coughing can still be heard. Albeit, even these noises are slightly dampened.

VThese headphones are light enough to be part of my EDC. I use them not just for listening to music, podcasts or movies, but also quite a bit for noise cancellation.The key word here is 'cancellation' not 'elimination'. These aren't perfect, and I didn't expect them to be. But they're very very good. Sometimes I just put them on to take the outside noise down a couple of knotches. The busy IT room or super-loud data center now becomes a quiet talk in a doctors office waiting room. These cans can entertain you and help you maintain your sanity.Whereas earbuds in the office send the message of 'I'm ignoring you (and probably listening to Pandora)'  wearing Bose in the office are more, 'I need to hear something important' from a messaging perception. That 'something' could be Stone Temple Pilots, or just 'a lot less of your co-workers' need to check their voicemail while on speakerphone'.Bose aren't a fashion statement. If you need bling, look elsewhere. And these aren't audio perfection either, so audiophiles begone! And they're not cheap. Without a doubt, there *are* better sounding headphones on Amazon for less money. But I dare you to find a more comfortable EveryDay Carry set of cans that travel this compactly, are this comfortable, sound this nice, and put a mouthful of cotton in your co-workers mouth at this price.Bottom line: A Leatherman is not better than a dedicated knife, pliers, file and screwdriver, but it's a whole lot better than shoving all those tools in your front pants pocket. The Bose QC 25 are the audio equivalent to the best Leatherman.

VThere are many great and informative reviews for these. This will not be one of those, merely an additional endorsement for how excellent these are. They do an amazing job at blocking out ambient noise, most notably on airplanes, but even the hum of refrigerators, lights, etc. I also use them when mowing the lawn - it's great to be able to reduce the sound of the lawnmower as well as listen to music.One surprising thing for me is that they don't eliminate speaking voices. In fact, on a plane (even a prop plane!) where the ambient noise is quite loud, once you eliminate the noise, you can hear conversations quite clearly that are not understandable without the noise reduction.In a house with normal household sounds, putting these on is like a little vacation. You don't have to listen to music or even have the cord attached to enjoy the quiet these provide.The only con I've noticed is that sometimes when I first turn them on, they add some pressure to my ears. Not horribly uncomfortable, but just slightly so. Also, it's good to avoid having wind hit these in any way, as it causes some strange distortion.Wrapping up: I love these! They are expensive, but worth every penny.

p1408

VWore these on a 15 hour flight from Newark to Mumbai.  Could wear these the entire trip without any discomfort.  Noise canceling is very good. I  upgraded from a very old sub-100 pair of Sony noise canceling headphones.  I know that that is an unfair comparison, but the Bose are a least double the quality and triple the comfort.  I listen to music at around 60% volume and movies around 40-50% volume ... there's just very little background noise to compete with.Sound is good.  I mainly watch movies and listen to common music.  As has been written many, many times, the headphones won't give you audiophile grade sound (whatever that means).  For me, they sound great.My only beef is with the moronic marketing folks at Bose.  They actually trademarked the misspelling of the word "canceling."  Bose is an American company.  The American spelling is "canceling" not "cancelling."  (Just like traveling, unraveling, etc.) Bose, in its infinite wisdom, decided it would be good to trademark the common misspelling of the word.  Wow.  Just ... wow.  So, it's accurate to say that the Bose QC-25 Noise-Cancelling headphone is the best noise-canceling headphone in the market.  Ugh.

VSurprising Noise Cancellation and Pleasing Sound Quality
p1414
sg5
VA longtime audiophile, I've owned phones from the $100-$1000+ price range (AKG 701, Sennheiser 600, Beyer Dynamic T1 and Audeze LCD 2). While it would be unfair to expect the Bose QC 25 to deliver the detail, air or sound stage of the more expensive cans it does a surprisingly fine job of noise cancellation while delivering pleasing sound. Many audiophiles will dismiss the Bose line due to their market position and marketing budget. Some criticism is justified yet their noise cancellation line is almost universally recognized as without equal. Used these with my iPhone for the first time on a flight from NYC to Milan and was more than satisfied in the isolation. During the 3 weeks of travel on trains and the return trip the phones functioned on a single AAA battery - ~ 20 hours - another surprise. The battery survived a subsequent (3 hours each way) flight. I'm sure there is a spec on battery performance but it was a bit of a serendipity. While more expensive than their competitors it really delivers exceptional isolation coupled with very acceptable sound quality.  While I didn't compare with the others I did extensive research and chose this over brands I trusted and with which I had prior experience.

VExpensive, and well worth it.  My office has an "open plan", and hires computer savvy college students for piece work.  At times it is like working in a day care center, and at 73 I am about 40 years senior to nearly everyone there - totally different work ethic and working style.  These headphones let me isolate myself from any noise and enjoy good jazz or classical music.  I get 50% more work done, and my stress level is reduced 80%.  I told my manager I thought it was better to use these headphones than grab some punk by the throat and tell him to shut up.  He agreed. ;*)Some reviews say these do not produce sound as well as some others on the market, but they seem fine to me (aging ears ?) and I have not tried any other brand as these were rated highest on noise isolation.  An added bonus is they still work as headphones even if the battery running the noise canceling circuit runs down.  First battery (standard alkaline AA cell) has lasted 10 days so far. They have transformed my work experience for the better.  I would buy them again in a minute if they are stolen.  Being Bose, I expect them to last a long time.  Quality build, fit and finish.  Light and comfortable.

VThis is the first  Non-Verified Purchase Review  I have posted on Amazon. when I first bought these head phones  I thought they where horrible after some light use They started to bother me, the Noise cancelling felt like my ear drum's were being sucked out of my head :~o  The nosie cancelling is extreme I was not used to this But after a couple more day's of use.  I realized These Bose Quiet Comfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling head Phones are just plan and simple the best I have ever owned! I am sure it's because  I am not used to Quality headphones. Mostly do to  always wearing skull candy ear buds $19.99 a pair in the past. They are so soft I cant even feel them on my ears or head! All my music sounds awesome. But for some reason My iPhone doesn't get max sound like I get from the PC. All in all I would Recommend these Headphones if you want a quality headset. P.S. I ride the bus to work and back home. It can be very loud on the bus!  baby's crying and yelling 15 or so people talking the bus break's and stops,etcetera.. with these bad boy's I see the baby making funny faces peoples mouths moving and nothing but the awesome sound of my music..

p1431
sg5
VBottom line first: Disappointing. Really? Yes. Sound was a trifle muddy and highs/lows not as clean. I put this set to the test in comparing with my QC 15s. I was surprised to say the least. They've massaged the sound to soften it a bit but went too far. The QC 15s are bright compared. Yes, maybe too bright but I much prefer the clearer highs and lows. Mids are even clear. The 25s, seem to dull it down a bit. All functions work well and the phone operation works well. Volume is too low and must be turned up on all devices whether computer, audio source or phone. While the 15s don't have a phone feature, we really like the dual volume mode which the 25s don't. For the first time in my experience with Bose products, I can not recommend this product. That bothers me because they've been consistent over the years. There's nothing really wrong with them but why spend so much money when either the 15s or comparable product will do just as well for much less money. We not sure if it's because they've not been designed as well as the 15s or that they're made in China. Either way, they were a bit let down and I really feel, not in the Bose tradition.

Vgreat cans for music and movies not so much for phone calls
p1436
sg5
VI like this headset very much.  I gave it five stars but there were two minor things that I would like to see changed.  First, the case does not have designated place for the cord as others have mentioned and this could lead to lose or failure from jamming the cord into the case to keep it with the headset.  The second is the folding design.  the wire connecting the ear piece to the headband is forced to bend to reduce the footprint of the headset for storage.  I can't help but wonder how many times can I bend that wire before it fails.  My guess is just enough to be out of warranty when it fails.The sound is great, they are the most lightweight and comfortable set I have used for over the ear style cans.  I like that they are compact but with the above qualification of the folding problem.  It's weird to use it for bluetooth phone calls because it is noise canceling and it muffles what you hear of your own spoken words which makes you speak too loud or over enunciate your words.  This is not a flaw but inherent to any NC headset used for phone calls. On the plus side the person I called said my voice was crystal clear and loud.Edit...I mentioned Bluetooth phone calls in this review. But as pointed out in a comment below this is not actually a Bluetooth headset to be clear.  I meant to say when connected to a phone call using the speaker on the wire it affects the phone call as described.

p1447
sg5
VI have been using the qc25 for about a month now. Put in a lot of thought before deciding to buy an expensive piece as such. THis is my first BOSE equipment and am very impressed by its performance. I had a Sony bluetooth noise cancelling headphone before that and was happy with its portability and bluetooth but reading all the qc25 reviews I thought I should give it a try.1. Noise cancelling : Astonishing. You will know what silence means when you turn the ANC on.2. Sound performance: Decent. Not the best for listening to music but if you are listening to quieter type like meditation or study music it's very good.3. Battery: I love the fact that the battery is removable. AAA usually lasts few weeks with a few daily hours4. Comfort: This headphones feels so undetected and light. You won't feel the pressure on your ears and that heat that develops in your ear with other over ear headphones.5. Build: The earpiece is made of very soft plush material and exudes quality.6. Convenience: Easy to carry with the new foldable design.I bought it for a deal for $179! got lucky I guess...

VI've been a fan of Bose for a long time.  My ten year old pair bit the dust and I turned to Amazon to overnight a pair before a trip to Asia.  I'm so glad I did as airplane noise and I are not good friends, especially on my flight which had numerous small kids who were struggling to fall asleep and spent their time calling for their mom who was one row back.  It was with relief that I turned these on.  Bliss!!I was lucky enough to be bumped to Business class on Cathay Pacific where they provide free noise cancelling headphones.  I compared the two and it was no contest.  The Bose headphones cancelled out much more noise, were lighter on my head, and fit nicely over my glasses with thick side pieces.  The fact that you can cancel noise without plugging these in is a terrific feature.  I've taken to using them at home when I am trying to work.Music sounds clear and compelling, as you would expect from Bose.  I'm not sophisticated enough to suss out all the details of the sound, but these are Bose for cripes sake.  You can't go wrong.

Vthey are not "noise-canceling" as i anticipated and didn't quite understand why one would want to turn that feature on and off.  i realized immediately, though, that they are much better than the earbuds i wore prior to receiving these.i now love that i can turn the noise cancellation on and off as i please - sometimes when i'm studying too long with that feature on i start to feel like i'm in an airplane or in some other pressurized, confined space.  when it's crowded and noisy turning on the noise cancellation really makes a big difference!  i can still hear people, but their voices are muffled in the background in such a way that it is far and away much easier to focus.i actually like the bulk of them because it's a much clearer indication to folks that i'd rather not be bothered (than wearing my earbuds) and the way they fold into the carrying case is nifty.  walking around the med school campus, it seems most of us have invested in these headphones.  so thankful that my husband purchased these for me - i think they are great!

VCarefully consider how you will use these headphones before you buy especially if you have non-Apple devices
p1482
sg5
VThere are two variants of the QC 25 headphones; one for Apple and one for Samsung devices.  The only difference between the two is the cord - the headphones are identical.The headphones themselves are excellent.  Good range of sound and the noise cancelling works very well in office environments and on airplanes.  The thing to watch out for is "the cord".The Apple variant, due to the way that Apple designs their devices, will have more limited functionality when using it with non-Apple devices and you may experience that the microphone and the additional button do not work.  For me, the buttons were not an issue, but an inability to use the microphone when connected to other devices was a major pain.My solution was to return the Apple version and purchase the Samsung version which, despite it's name, works well across a broader array of devices (like my Xbox).  I spent the $25 on the Apple cable, if I ever want to use the Microphone with my iOS devices.

The audio quality on these headphones aren't as bassy and high quality as other headphones that I own, but with the mac app Boom, I am able to make it sound a bit better.2. The noise cancellation is wonderful, I can barely hear anything when I am wearing these only the occasional person who is very loud and is yelling I can hear them when my music is low.3. This blocks out bass from neighbors.4. The cord is long enough and the microphone works great.5. Very comfortable, even though it feels somewhat heavy, it is not heavy to the head.6. Works with glasses on, the headphones seal properly with glasses on.7. No replacement headband?8. Battery will drain if accidentally left on, but not too significant.9. Would be nice if it were a bluetooth version, I would pay more.10. Great build quality, hopefully it lasts.

VBose has made an excellent Noise cancellation Headphones. When you enable the noise cancellation switch only then you realize that all these days you were living in a noise polluted environment. It cancels 90% of the ambient noise.BUILD: The headphone is very light weight and I think the BOSE engineers have focused mainly on the portability factor. The Ear cups are very soft and I do not see any clamping force while wearing it for more than 3 hours continuously.SOUND QUALITY: The sound quality is perfect only when the noise cancellation feature is turned on. If you turn it off, i would rate it as only average sound quality.Over all I am very happy with my purchase especially when you want Noise cancellation feature.I would strongly recommend this product and you will not regret for your purchase.In fact i have purchased 3 of these headphones for Christmas deal  of $269

VI went into this purchase really not wanting to spend a car payment on headphones... but being an audiophile, I caved in. These bad larrys are awesome. The sound quality is incredible for anything from Katy Perry (yeah, I said it) to The Rolling Stones. Battery life is great. I went through a week of wearing them at work, successfully blocking out any haters (hooray noise cancellation!). Not to mention the fact that I was quite comfortable wearing headphones for 8 hours straight every day. The ear cushions are made out of the same leather applications they use in those supercars. Those are all pretty strong "pros" for buying the QC25s. For what it's worth, the only con I can think of is that you get that "headband" indent in your hair. It's just kind of inconvenient, but clearly outweighed by the other awesome qualities.TL;DR they're expensive but totally worth it.

VI bought these from another store, but I think this might be helpful for anyone looking for noise cancelling headphones. I was looking for some thing that would let me do yard work while listening to music. I wasn't so much concerned with audiophile quality so much as drowning out most of the yard equipment noise, which can be quite loud. I tested them out by pulling my Billy Goat yard vac out of the garage and cranking it up. This thing is loud. After I got it running I put the headphones on and with the noise cancelling off I heard a the music pretty well but with an (expected) drone in the background from the vac engine. I turned the noise cancelling on and was very pleased with the music quality I was hearing, and the amount of engine noise that was eliminated. I think I am going to be quite happy with these although rain today is preventing an extended test.

VThese headphones are actually amazing! I live in a rather noisy area - loads of ambient noise (people, cars, appliance) - and these cut out nearly everything completely. It's a great way to get a little piece and quiet!They also work well with music, though that was my secondary reason to get these (mainly I wanted a good noise canceller!). I'm definitely not an audiophile, so can't really speak to whether these are "good" music headphones or not. They work well for me, so that's all I care about.Also I love that you can use the NC feature with or without the headphone cord attached. Makes it nice when you just want to sit in the quiet and think/study/read. I plan to try them out at work tomorrow (I just bought these over the weekend), and am hopeful that they will provide better thinking space in my buzzing office environment!

VVery limited review, ordered it yesterday, got it this morning. First thing I did after unpacking it was check to see if the active noise cancellation worked. After all, that's why I bought them.  Put the head phones on, with the ANC off, noticed a little quieter in my Apt, but road noise from traffic on 6 lane road and other household noises, including my furnace still noticeable.  Then I flipped the switch to on, all the background noise disappeared except for the furnace which was running and about 8 feet away, the sound of it was just audible. Turned the ANC off, and the background noise returned.  I am currently doing a break in, as suggested by another poster, of the headphones.  Should my experience change, getting ready to go on a plane flight, I will make another post. FYI, having high freq hearing loss, and tinnitus, background noises are an issue.

VIf you are looking to buy these head phones and you fly a lot you should just pull the trigger. I work as a flight medic and that means I can be in the air from 3- 30 hours straight. There is nothing like the noise canceling ability of these head phones. If we have a patient on board I can use the headphone just for noise canceling and still have a conversation with the flight nurse, patient and pilots. If we don't have a patient I can plug the headphones in to the iPad or iPhone and listen to music or watch a movie. It is hard to describe just how much back round noise the headphones are bale to cancel out. My wife gave me a hard time about purchasing these until we took a commercial flight together and she used them. She agreed they were fantastic and they actually reduced some of her anxiety about flying due to the decrease in noise.

VGreat for the Plane
p1565
sg5
VI use these on the plane and they are amazing.The sound quality is great for all types of music. The noise-cancelling feature really does the job on the airplane, but you can somewhat hear a buzzing from the loud engines. Other than that someone could be talking very loudly right next to you, and you would just see their mouth moving. Even when the noise-cancelling feature isn't turned on, the headphones sound great and still provide some noise-cancelling on their own.The case is very functional, and the headphones fold into the case a lot easier than the last model. There is also a slot for an extra AAA battery so you can always have a reserve if your battery runs out mid trip.The only small downside is that the headphones are a bit pricey, but I really do believe that they are worth the amount.

VWe fly a lot and I HATE it! My wife bought me a pair of these several months ago and they are worth every penny. I've tried other types and nothing compares. I returned the favor and purchased the white/tan pair for her. Now she's a believer. Comfortable, light weight, long battery life, and best of all....silence. Hook these to your iphone, hit the switch, and it's like you're setting in the recording studio with the artist. Blocks out all the screaming kids, the boisterous drunks, and your seat mates. No, just because we are sitting together for the next 4 hours and you're dying to tell some stranger about your vacation, doesn't mean I want to listen. Thanks anyways. I have too many friends as it is. I only wish Bose made smell canceling headphones as well.  If you fly a lot, bite the bullet and buy these. you won't be sorry.

VThese headphones are simply amazing. Period. You'll no doubt see a slew of reviews by cranky audio perfectionists who complain about the audio quality, and they're either blessed with superhuman hearing or silly enough to shell out money for 0.0000001 percent better sound. The sound quality is awesome, but it's what you don't hear that really puts these headphones in another league. I was perfectly happy with the QuietComfort 3s, but I can honestly say these are noticeably better. The noise cancellation is beyond outstanding, The over-the-ear fit is quite comfy. Some may complain about the use of AAA batteries, but you can find them anywhere. No need to worry about carrying around a charger and finding a power outlet when you're out of juice. Yep, the price is steep, but these headphones are worth every penny.

VI travel on a regular basis and these headphones are a definite game changer. I've had the next level down of Bose headphones for a few years and have always been satisfied with their performance. It took a while to pull the trigger on the Q25's but I have to say that it was the best decision I could have ever made. I also own other Bose products and can say that I have never been disappointed. Bose always provides an incredible listening experience and they have come through once again. As far as the battery life, I've had no issues whatsoever. I'm currently on week 3 of flying and have yet to change it out. When needed, there is a convenient slot for a spare battery in the case. The comfort factor is incredible. If you have contemplated purchasing these headphones, do yourself a favor and get them!

p1588
sg5
VLots of reviews here, but I wanted to post one more. The short version is I could not possibly be happier with this purchase. These are expensive - but worth every penny. Probably the best listening experience I can remember in a long time. Just tried them out on a maxed Southwest Airlines flight with a crying baby sitting in the seat directly in front of me. Silenced the whole thing allowing me to enjoy a great movie on my iPad. These are great for all types of music, but also great as a noise cancelling device with the chord disconnected at the headset, which is what I use them for in my noisy office when I need to concentrate. Extremely comfortable. Superb build quality. Really nice case. Works great as a phone headset (iPhone) too - nice in-wire phone controls. Overall, big time thumbs up here!

VDid about a month of research before I decided to get these. Previously owned Audio Technica ATH-ANC23 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling In-Ear Headphones which were wonderful but not suitable for long flights. Sound quality on the Bose QC25 is pretty good but i won't say amazing. Saw a few people talk about a 'burn in' period. So will update after.The Noise Cancelling feature is far superior to anything that i've owned or tested. It won't block out a screaming baby but it will silence the engine noise from a large airplane. Voices also become muted as well. I tried these on a recent flight and honestly, I had the best sleep in a while.Lightweight construction and very comfortable on ears. Case is a bit bulky but i'm not complaining. Overall, no regrets buying this.

p1600

VThis is one thing I had buyer's remorse over right after I purchased them, I thought how could I spend so much just for some headphones. I've purchased actual stereos with speakers that cost less but when I got these I realized, given how much I use my headhphones and how much I hate noise these were actually worth the price. I often use them without even having any music on, when there is noise coming from the apartment next store I put them on with the white noise and they really do an amazing job blocking out the noise so I can focus on reading or working. As for the actual sound of the music it is amazing. I've been going back and re-listening to stuff I haven't heard in a long time just to see what it sounds like with these headphones. They are expensive but for me worth the cost.

Please note that I am in no way an audiophile so I cannot comment much on the audio quality.Pros:- The noise isolation: I can see that this headphone will help me during my studies at the library. The silence is amazing.- Build quality: I was actually tempted to buy Bose headphones because of my friend qc15. IWhen I was searching at amazon I realized that they have a newer version (this one).Cons:- The price is quite steep.Overall, I would definitely recommend this headphones for someone who are looking to get a noise cancelling headphones.

VThis is my first noice-canceling device. I have had very good experience with this headphone at home. Up in the air, while flying, it was also amazing with very good noise canceling performance. However, after the flight, I had a bad headache, I just thought that noise-canceling might not be working good for me. In the next flight, I tried this one more time. Again my ear and brain were uncomfortable with this. I tried a couple of things:1. turning off the noise-canceling functionality. I still had the problem.2. turning on the noise-canceling, but gave some air flow between my ear and the headphone cup. comfortable.I think the problem with this headphone for me is that it creates some kind of isolated spaces inside the headphone cup and the pressure to the ear up in the air is uncomfortable, causing some headache.I wish it were a noise-canceling, ON-ear (not around ear) type headphone.

VI ordered these headphones thinking they would be a good quality product with high quality audio and noise cancelling capability. However what I found is that they are poorly made and are priced WAY higher than they should be. Even with the noise cancelling setting on, I can still hear plenty of background noise-this includes noises such as office chatter as well as cars/airplanes/lawnmowers etc. Save your money and buy another kind of noise cancelling headphone such as Symphonized NRG Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Mic.In addition, the noise cancelling setting went out within three hours of usage. The entire sound will cut in and out and I can no longer use the noise cancelling setting. I do not recommend these headphones.

VI purchased both this and the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7B for a recent international flight I took. It wasn't clear from the reviews which one was better. After testing both headphones for almost 10 hours i can report that the Bose are by *far* better than the AT headphones, in almost every category. They have a smaller case, they fit much better on the ears, the overall build quality is better, and, most importantly, the noise cancelling is simply superb. There was a big, noticeable difference in noice cancelling quality between the QC25 and the AT.  If you're just a casual user for an office environment, then perhaps the AT are good enough. But for any serious use, especially flights, the Bose are significantly superior. Are they worth 3x the price. Yes!

VI've always wanted a pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones.  These certainly do not disappoint.  It's amazing how it drowns out the noise when the noise cancelling is turned on.  It's not a complete "dome-of-silence", you can still hear people talking to you if you aren't playing music and just have the noise cancelling turned on.  But with constant humming noises in the background, like air conditioners, it does an excellent job of cancelling that noise almost entirely.  I have not used on an airplane, but I trust that is really helps with the noise of the engines.Even some naysayers of the Bose noise cancelling headphones were impressed when they actually tried them.I also love the hard case and the remove-able cord.

VI wanted to give these five stars for quality of sound, quality of materials, good looks, superb packaging, and excellent noise-cancelling.  However, what the description does not warn you about is that certain people who have inner ear issues cannot wear them.  Like many others (I found out later, in researching this issue), I became extremely dizzy and nauseous after a mer 20 minutes of use.  What is more, you would think I would feel better as soon as took them off, but I stayed dizzy and sick for two days after.  I had to return these, but it hurt me to do so because these are otherwise fabulous.  So . . . if you have no issues with motion sickness, dizziness, inner ear issues, or sinus trouble, these will be a five-star set of headphones for you.

I have to say that any video or review might fill you with confidence about making such a large investment it will never beat just putting them on in a noisy environment and letting the world be behind you. To try to but it in perspective it's almost like going to a large indi-car race and putting on heavy duty hearing protection. So all I have to say is try them, I did and now I love them and being a student going back and forth on a very noisy bus I have to say these are the best investment I've ever made.

As to the sound quality, I do not care I am not the guy that would hear something that makes them wors then any others.If you are looking for noise cancellation do not look any further QC 25 is the one for you.

VI have read some of the reviews here and I'm not sure if Bose made a change in the cable but mine has a high/low switch built into it.  This is my first pair and won't use them for a few days yet (flying to St. Maarten) so I guess that will be a good test.  I bought Bose because my brother-in-law and his fiance both have the QC-15's and love them (they are both pilots) so I am sure that I will also!  I may not be as picky as some of the other reviewers (about the bass "hearing the strings being pulled across the instrument,") I was looking for good noise cancelling and good sound, and I'm pretty sure these will deliver what I want.I bought them at Best Buy because I wasn't sure they would arrive before my trip...(I just returned from St. Maarten where I used these on the airplane coming/going and all I can say is wow!!!  All of that engine noise is totally gone...amazing!  Well worth the $299 I paid for them...I was able to listen to songs on my iPod and slept all the way...perfect!)

VI'm a frequent flyer, serial commuter, and do extensive studying in coffee shops etc. With these headphones you forget that you are sitting on a train/plan etc. It blocks out conversations from people who are near you too in coffee shops, and other public areas. They are hands down the most comfortable headphones I bought. I had the beats pro before this, and am so glad i bought the qc25. Much more comfortable, and easier to travel with. IMHO (in my humble opinion) the sound quality on the qc25 is much better than the qc15. Deeper bass, richer sound, and better built overall.If you are looking for comfy headphones, with excellent sound quality, and the ability to tune out planet earth look no further. Thx bose!

VLost my QC 15's last week on the plane. Naturally I reflexively needed to replace them immediately as I am a frequent flier. This is my third set and I remain a fan. Noise reduction is great. The sound quality is a tad better than QC 15 (which was already good) difference is the detail and soundstage. I like the slimmer case ( which is why I lost my 15s ) which I can now shove into my briefcase.  I have no reason to believe that with proper care, they will last a long time. (Unless they are stolen or lost like my last two pairs). CNET says these are still the gold standard and I agree. Now I cross fingers that my beloved IPod classic and QC 15's are returned as United has promised. The 25's will become my travel phones.

VEverything I love about Bose.Used them for work, travel, block out gardening sounds, works to perfection. Only thing that could be better is the battery life. Definitely eats through batteries much faster than my old noise canceling pair, but this can be altered by just keeping that function off, as they still function as non-noise canceling headphones when not activated (pretty clever!). The ear padding is definitely a step up from my older model and they changed the head padding to a pad that doesn't degrade with use. I hope the ear pads last longer than the older models because they are probably around $35-$50...just guessing based on what I paid for the old model ones at the outlet. Highly recommend and love.

Not only does Bose offer a superior product, I discovered through this purchase that it offers excellent customer service. It was one of those days. I bought these as a Christmas present for my husband, thinking I was getting him the blue tooth head phones. Not only did I buy the same not-blue-tooth ones he already owned, but he actually wanted the smaller ear buds which fit more easily into a carry-on bag. Having experienced first hand the pain involved in returning something to Amazon, I took a chance and called the Bose store in Chicago. Incredibly, the manager allowed me to do an in-store exchange, easy-peasy. Thanks, Bose!

VFew things that may not have come up in past reviews.  First, the microphone and volume controls do not work with my Samsung S4. I knew this before purchasing that this could be the case.  Next, anyone who recently bought these or plans to make sure you burn in your headphones before judging sound quality.  I typically do between 60-100 hours of use.  Bose tends to sound better over time.  Finally many of the reviews mention the sound quality is not great if you do not use a battery.  I agree with listening to music, the battery is a must.  However, I watched a movie and TV shows while not using the battery and the quality was more than acceptable.  The headphone still blocked a lot of surrounding noise.

VI have been using these while flying twice a week since October 2014.  They are very comfortable, with excellent noise cancellation- they even block out almost all of the sound from crying babies on planes.  These headphones make flying on a commercial plane a much more tranquil experience.  After 8 months of use the speaker in the left ear suddenly failed (as I have seen other people complain about).  Because I bought directly from Amazon (and not a reseller) I was within the 1 year warranty and 5 minute call to Bose got them to send me a brand new pair of QC25s for only $9 shipping, and the new pair has another 1 year warranty.  Overall an excellent product, with very good customer support.

Those comments are right.  You start to hear things in music you didn't know were there before.  These headphones are great.The only negative comment is that it doesn't completely filter out "the world" when used without audio, but it reduces the noise by at least 90%.  Good enough to allow you to relax in the noisiest of environments.

VI was hesitant to spend so much on headphones, especially since I was hoping for wireless. I didn't really think I would use the noise cancelling except for travelling/planes - I was wrong. I use these headphones, and the noise cancelling option ALL the time. They are super comfortable for extended periods of time, and the noise cancelling is really amazing. I work in a busy office - loud air conditioning, people on phones, etc. and these have been a life saver. Decent sound when just listening to music, and super light. The carrying case is really convenient as well! I wish there was a wireless & noise cancelling option from Bose, but I am so glad I have these.

VYes, I balked at the price.  I have used other noise cancelling headphone in the past, and was pretty much satisfied with Etymotic ER4 and 5's with the foam inserts (the only way to go with these in my opinion).  However, the noise cancelling and isolation is EXCELLENT with the QC25.  Of course the sound is also amazing - very flat and clear.  I am amazed at the lower volume I use with these and although have ALWAYS cranked up the bass and treble, seem now to prefer everything flat.  Never thought I would...  This could be a function that I generally use these on my Fiio X3 and X1 hi-res players, but also in that these work so well with those devices.

VAmazing. Much nicer than Beats Studio
p1736
sg5
VI bought the Beats Studios because I fell in love with the all black matte finish. I get home and open them and they were horrible. The sound cancellation was a complete joke with the hissing and the earmuffs leaked way too much sound, making them not good for me to use while studying at the library. I took them back and exchanged them for the Bose QC25 in the white. They may not look as nice as the Beats but that's the only part in which the Beats are superior. The sound quality on the Bose is amazing. The noise cancellation does wonders! There isn't any sound leakage unless it's on full blast. I'm definitely sold on Bose from here on out!

VPerfect fit for my small head
p1741
sg5
VI have a small head and these fit perfectly (hurray).  Very comfortable.  But, for the price Bose should've used memory foam in the head band & ear pieces instead of regular cheap foam.  Other than that, I don't consider them cheaply made; they are nice & light weight, which helps with the comfort in wearing for a long time.  Works really well for noise cancelling, which is the reason I tried them.  I first ordered the Audio Tech ATH-ANC9, but they were too big for my head; too much play @ the top (otherwise I probably would've kept them).I gave it 4 stars cause they are way over priced; definitely paying for the Bose name.

VThese headphones are everything I expected from Bose for noise canceling and sound quality. In general, they're fantastic headphones. The compact case is a wonderful way to keep your headphones safe when traveling. There is, however, one major flaw. The headphones do not come with an android compatible in line cable . Instead, the included cable controls only work with Apple products. Apparently, Bose did not get the memo that Apple now owns Beats . Maybe now they will open up their platform to the vast majority of phone users who have Android phones, not Apples. It seems incomprehensible that you spend $299 and a pair of headphones and the cable comes with proprietary controls. If they fix this, I'd give then give them five stars.

VIt is fair to say that I am a bit of a novice when reviewing headphones.  Quite frankly, I have gotten accustomed over the years to using iPod earbuds or grabbing my kid's Beats by Dre.  However, after putting on the Bose Quiet Comfort 25 Headphones, I am hooked.  Whether you listen to music, audiobooks, or watch shows with the headphones on; you cannot go wrong with these headphones.  They are comfortable, light, and feature an exceptional noise canceling ability.  I have not gotten into the fancy features of the headphones yet.  I know there are other features, and I may or may not every take advantage of those.  Right now, I am greatly enjoying the fantastic quality of these headphones.  I rate them a strong 5 stars!  Enjoy!

VThese are nice looking headphones that don't hurt my ears. They are lightweight, yet don't feel or look cheaply made. As soon as I put them on, even before I started the drama I was watching, I noticed how they muted the sounds around me. This is a feature I really appreciate, as I tend to turn music or movies up loud enough to drown out my environment, and this isn't the greatest thing to do for your hearing, long term. While the headphones didn't grant me complete silence, I didn't have to blow my eardrums to ignore the lawn mower right outside the window. The sound quality wasn't blow-me-away perfect, but it wasn't awful either. And it's definitely better with the noise cancelling turned on (which was not a surprise).

VI will never travel again without these headphones.  I don't know how it works but when you turn them on it's eerily quiet.  I bought them before my trip to the UK because my previous flights have always had noisy people and crying babies.  I tried them out first in the airport and couldn't believe how much noise they blocked!  My music sounded amazing. I've since used them for audio books (audible by amazon) and love the sound quality and fit.  I've taken phone calls and feel like I'm speaking so quietly because they pick up so much of my voice I don't have to talk loudly.  Love love love these things.  Worth the money.

VI love these headphones. I just went back to school and have a lot of online content that I need to view for classes. In downtime at work I pop these bad boys on and can focus on lectures without a single interruption! At home I have a cnc machine that is incredulously loud and when I wear these I am unaware that it is even on! The one downside to them is that when I use them at home my girlfriend frequently gets mad at me as she has to text me to ask me questions when I am using them. So, if you are easily distracted, are tired of loud noises or, if you're having problems at home these are the headphones for you!

p1774
sg5
VI exchanged these for the in-ear version largely because they were too large and obtrusive for regular use, the fact that they needed externally bought batteries, and in the end, the surprising realization that I think the in-ear version worked better for me (perhaps because in-ear silicone physical noise blocking layers better with the active cancellation.)Caveat: I'm not an audiophile. I just live and work in noisy places and have to travel a lot.All said, they were comfortable, folded down well, and worked as well as noise canceling tech can, but the in-ear just works much better for me.

VFantastic for sound, comfort and sound cancelation. After 8 months the right ear stopped working. I can't use these now so I can't rate them more than the minimum star(s). For $300 I expect durability as well as quality. We'll see how the warranty process goes (one more thing I need to deal with). I  purchased this set through Amazon.On a related note: I purchased the Bose SoundSport In-ear phones for working out (bike riding) and within a month they developed heavy static. Again, another Bose product failing on durability and another task on my todo list.I expect more from this company.

VHad been holding out for many years because the price was a barrier.  But after I borrowed a pair for a plane ride, I was hooked and bought my own.  Everything people say is true and well worth it especially if you fly- even if just occasionally.  Previously I would feel extremely fatigued after a flight but after using these headphones, I actually felt refreshed.  I'm eager to use these on a long international flight.The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound is very good.  You feel as if you are in a quiet room and all you hear is what is playing through the headphones.  Highly recommended!

VThis is a life saver. If you are sensitive to noise like myself, you really should consider getting one. I don't like getting disturbed by noise outside whenever I watch or listen to something through my headphones. Even something like fan or air conditioner noise can disturb me. This really blocks a loud fan and air conditioner noise, and most ambient noise outside my room. As for blocking such noise, it works and feels better than earplugs that are rated with ~30 NRR. Trust me, this will solve many problems associated with noise among college or other roommates. This is one of the best purchases in my life.

VI bought these the other day and really like them. Their sound is good and everything is great but I'll cut to the chase:I wanted the in-ear version (QC20) but I have a cat who loves to chew through wires. In this version, the wire that connects to your device/headphone is detachable so that if a cat chews through it or it breaks you can just get a new one.Also, this version uses a AAA battery which means, ultimately, you don't have to worry about a non-replaceable battery going bad after a few years.I've used both and didn't really notice a sound quality difference.UPDATE January 2016:After two years of regular use, the left speaker stopped working. Very frustrating, since my product was out of warranty and I wouldn't expect this from a Bose product. I went to a Bose store to see what my options were and the lady working there said this headset has a known issue where it can fail and, regardless of warranty status, they are to do an exchange free of charge.So, I have a new pair of headphones, with a new warranty.Excellent customer service.

VMy girlfriend got these, and at first I was pissed. I'm not a huge audiophile (active musician though), and for the price tag I would have preferred she got some nice open back over ear headphones with an amplifier for the best soundstage/audio quality. That's what I thought until. . .I put these on. The active noise cancellation is science fiction like in its performance. Dishwasher, refrigerator, washing machine, passing cars, all of it muted to a degree that feels impossible. For this feature alone I give it five stars. Everything else is definitely 4 stars or better, but I'm so seriously floored by the noise cancellation that these are getting a five stars. Absolutely magical.

VThese headphones are amazing. I commute to work on the bus and when I take off the headphones it sounds like a hurricane. I can vanish into the music and ignore all the noise pollution around me.Only possible complaint is that it does require a AAA battery, but I can't feel the weight of it. These headphones are perfectly weighted (and light).I also love that that headphone cable itself unplugs, so it can be replaced if needed (I had to toss a $250 pair of Beyer Dynamic Pro headphones because the headphone cable broke after my kid walked away from an ipad while wearing them).

VMy last Bose headphones were the QC15s and I mostly got these for their looks and smaller folding size. Passed on the QC15s and am very happy with these. The sound is terrific, they are fabulous on a plane, and I must say I feel much less dorky wearing them around ANYWHERE than the big black/gray old ones. Of course the noise cancelling of these headphones is amazing. I really dislike the feel of in-ear (bud style) headphones and I'm really glad that even though there are new tiny in-ear noise cancelling Bose headphones that I went for these. I bet they are better for preventing hearing loss too!

VI bought these headphones since i travel so much for work. When I first put them on, i thought they might be defective because I could still hear people around me talking. But then I took them on the plane and realized that they cut out the engine noise almost completely but not all noise entirely. They make listening to music and watching movies on the plane so much easier. The over-the-ear design is very comfortable and i can wear them for the entire flight without any discomfort. When i see everybody else in business/first class wearing bose headphones, I know i made the right choice.

VI have now gone through two pairs of the QC-25's in under a year. Originally the right speaker went out after about 4 months (Bose did replace no questions asked). Now my second pair the right speaker went out after about 6 months. I am a relatively heavy user with a lot of international travel but I don't listen to music at full volume or mess with equalizer settings. My expectation is for the headphones to last longer than a few months for the price point. Because I've had the same problem two times in a row my assumption is there is a design issue and this isn't a one-off problem.

Headphones have been improved all around, and appear less cheap than older ones.  Have "L" and "R" imprinted on inside of phones.  Switches and plugs redesigned, and seems to be a little more comfortable.  I purchased because my older pair needed replacement seals, and were starting to look worn.  Don't notice any significant improvement in audio quality. Recommend if you are frequent traveler like I am.

It blocked out my noisy dishwasher, the loud overhead fan at work, I could hear my music while mowing the lawn. While flying it almost completely eliminates the engine noise.  I turn on my music, flip the noise cancelling switch and feel like I'm in my own quiet world.  My wife was mad the other day because I couldn't hear her talking to me....perfect :-).  I'm tempted to have one pair for home and one for work.

VPros: High quality noise cancellation with very little background sounds bleeding in. The fans of my computer, my house's heater, and my air conditioning are all silenced out really well. Nice foldable design for portability.Cons: Requires a AAA battery rather than having a rechargeable one. Not much of a con, really, I should just get some rechargeable AAA batteries.Other Thoughts: No regrets, been wanting noise cancellation for a few years since I tried one in a store. I use them as my main gaming headphones for really great immersion.

It doesn't sound like much of a hassle but really is in real life. Beats has similarly capable ones with Bluetooth but the earpiece is not large enough to enclose ears, I like the Sony Bluetooth ones at less than half the price of this at Costco that actually has better controls for music and phone.

Be sure to have a spare battery in the wonderfully durable case that comes with it.

While it obviously doesn't remove 100% of outside noise (a good thing if someone is trying to get your attention), there is such an amazing difference when you take off the headphones. I can get a good rest even when there are crying babies around.Probably not the best studio headphones, which aren't the point of these, but seriously consider buying if you want noise cancellation

Over the ear comfort is great and the noise cancelling is ideal for airplane travel.  I use them frequently without music too, just to minimize the background noise on flights.  They do go through batteries so I try to make sure to turn off the power when not actively using them, and take the battery out in storage to avoid accidentally turning them on.  A little expensive, but well worth the purchase.

V- Clamp too strong, gives me headache after 1 hour- After 5 months the left speaker stopped working there is a design flaw with an internal electric cable that comes loose for a lot of users. So far I could replace the product for free, but it will be useless after the warranty expires. You can temporarily fix it by inserting a piece of paper inside the faulty speaker to restore the electric connection, but the sound vibrate with bass and the noise cancelation reverberate.- Awesome noise cancelling though.

VWow. The sound is unreal. It's incredibly crisp, clear, and perfectly balanced. The noise cancellation is unbeleivable. They've also improved the structural integrity of these headphones from the last model. I especially appreciate the solid metal hinges. Great feature. Improved folding design for stowage and better case. The whole package is amazing. If you're hesitating because of the price, I will say it is a bit steep, but I can also assure you that you're going to get every penny's  worth out of these babies.

VThis is for the QuietComfort 25 set:  I'm sitting here in my extremely noisy open office environment and I'm in utter bliss while wearing these headphones.  I only have the noise- cancelling activated right now and I'm not listening to music.  The only thing I can barely hear are very loud co-workers, and even then it's a very quiet muffled sound.  If I start up some quiet music it completely shuts everything else out.  These headphones are like an "off switch" for the environment.  I couldn't be happier.

VThese headphones are very comfortable and have amazing noise cancellation. I go on frequent business trips and these are a must have. It blocks out most of the airplane noise and my music sounds amazing. The battery life is long lasting as well. The only slight negative is that the controls are not the easiest to use (there's a lot of clicking of the wire buttons) and the headphones are not wireless. These aren't enough for me to give less than 5 stars though. It's a very worth while product that I'd recommend.

VI work as a "surgeon" and I must say, these headphones are incredible! I don't even bother with anesthesia anymore! It's not necessary with these, cause I can't hear a thing! The patients keep emphatically mouthing things at me, which I assume are things like "those headphones look beautiful" and "where can I get a pair" but I am too busy listening to the amazing sound quality these headphones provide! Just make sure you bring an extra battery! Nothing is worse than your music being interrupted by the angry screams of a man in a back alley with his chest cavity open while you search for another battery among his possessions.

VJust wow.  I spent some time researching acoustic noise cancelling headphones, and the Bose are the only ones that come on top.  They are great and really remove all the background noise.  Sometimes, you can even hear conversations better because there is no more noise.  You have to understand how the work to really appreciate them.  And more importantly, know that they will remove only the CONSTANT noise, NOT loud noises or voices.  It all depends on the frequency and loudness if you want to keep it simple.

VI ordered these hoping the QC-25's were an improvement over the QC-15's I currently own. Don't get me wrong, I really like my QC-15's, I was hoping a 6 year refresh of this model would bring improvements. Overall, this was not the case. The non-battery sound quality is lack luster and the sound quality when running with Noise Cancelling on doesn't have the clarity of the QC 15's. Noise cancelling on the QC-25's are a bit better but not by much. These headphones, like most products these days, are targeted toward Apple products and smartphones, Bose did away with the extra non-phone cable that was included in their QC-15 Special edition earlier this year. Though it works fine with a standard MP3 player, the cord is shorter than previous versions and you are stuck with an inline Volume/Mic controller. And as per usual the controller has more functions with Apple products than Android. The QC-15's are the best Headphones I have ever owned. I have not found anything that comes close. I might by another pair of QC-15's before they go out of stock. Let's hope that Bose refines the QC-25's performance and features. They definitely didn't do their best on this release.

At first I put them on and I was instantly impressed, but then I turned the noise cancelling button on and the change was unbelievable. These are very quiet and comfortable. The quality of the sound is outstanding. The Bose name means quality and these headphones don't disappoint. If you are on the  fence about purchasing them, go ahead and make the investment, you won't be disappointed.

VWear comfort great, sound quality poor
p2003
sg5
VFirst of all, the reason I gave QuietComfort 25 2 stars is the quality of being the "best" noise canceling headphones out there in the market, when you compare with other headphones, but not by my standards. When I turn the button on, all the white noise such as cars passing by, lawn mowing machine sound, etc. magically disappears BUT I can clearly hear the talk of the people around me, or I can hear the Television or Movie being played. So, it is not a good noise-canceling device but others suck more than Bose out there, when it comes to noise cancellation.The comfort of wear is extremely plausible. I could not feel it at all even after wearing for more than 2 hours.Now, where did the other 3 stars go:When the battery dies, the sound quality deteriorates to unimaginable depths. A $5 headphone from RadioShack would sound much better than $299 Bose when you operate it without the battery. What a disappointment! I was excited to see an upgrade from 15 version but at what sound quality?With battery and noise cancellation on, the headphone still fare worse than the other headphones I tried that use a cable with the music device. For instance, a $269 V-Moda headphone has 10 times better sound quality over the wide range of music than Bose. I am sorry to say but my $89 Sony MDR7506 gave me better pleasing effect of listening to music than Bose QuietComfort 25.Moreover, the +/- buttons on the wire did not work with my Samsung Galaxy S4 device, as expected. It is an Apple pro headphone. I could not get the cable buttons to work, except the middle one that pauses or resume the music.These are loud brothers. Even if I kept the volume to 7 (out of 1 to 12 scale) on my phone, others around me could listen easily to what I was listening to.Like I said, comfort wear is beyond the expectation. Awesome! But I could not give it more than 2 stars in my honest opinion.

I had high expectations for these headphones and all were met except for the noise cancellation. Without music, you can hear quite a bit of background noise. No headphones are 100% noise cancelling, but I expected a bit more with the upgraded QC25. These are very comfortable over the ear headphones with fantastic sound quality and great noise cancelling (once music is on).

So if you put your head in a pillow with these on, you hear a loud whistle like a microphone feedback.  Then one ear stopped working.  No thanks.

I have tried the QC15, and the older QC3's, and it's been a while, but the sound quality definitely sounds better than past iterations of these headphones.

VIncredible headphones. These headphones are so comfortable and fit well on my head.

Let me say no one could get a word correct even though they were right in front of you. The only con to these headphones is the price, $300 will put a small dent in your pockets.

VHeadphones are very comfortable. I use them watching movies on the iPad late at night and they do a nice job blocking out the sound of my wife watching TV. I also use them with my PS4, I ply them into the control and get very good sound and are comfortable for longer play sessions.  The couple times I have used them in an a plane has been good. Blocked the sounds around me and made watching movies much better than using the earbuds.

VBought these from Best Buy, and love them.I had the Beats Studio Headphones before which had good sound quality, but were not noise cancelling. When I active the noise cancelling on the Bose, I can not hear anything other than what I am listening unless I focus on the sound. Sound is good, not the best when you don't have the noise cancelling activated, amazing sound quality however when you active the noise cancelling

VThe Bose QC25 are a pair of noise canceling headphones at a $300 price point. High quality sound with proper noise canceling to match. However I found that too much surrounding noise causes the headphones to skip, which is highly frustrating and their fatal flaw. Also for $360 with insurance the materials don't seem premium, which I would expect. Sessions over 45 minutes cause these to feel a bit uncomfortable, so I returned mine.

VI like the headphones, a lot. Noise canceling is solid, though not as perfect as I was imaging. Using the noise canceling feature without music, you can hear a faint hiss which is hardly noticeable unless you are already in a quite environment. Sound quality is great and adequate for my needs. These are the first over the war headphones I've owned -- the comfort is excellent. Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase.

VGood noise reduction. Very light and comfortable. Perfect clamping force. Portable and well built. Highs are just right, smooth, clear. Mids are good except in lower mids. More on that later. The bass is nearly perfect. Extended, big, not boomy. There is a low mid issue. That rings about inside the cup, for a sometimes boxy sound. There needs to be more and better damping in there to prevent that. With or without noise canceling on, this happens. Noise cancelling makes the sound worse (it's harsh and artificial). It's better off, which defeats the purpose of these headphones. Keep working on it.

VWell worth the price. I don't know a lot about technical musical jargon, but these are nice. The noise canceling sounds like noise canceling, I don't use it but my partner does and apparently it's good. It sounds like noise canceling to me. It isn't going to drown out a plane engine no matter how much you want it to do that.

VJust the right size for me! The design is sleek so it does not give me the 'nerd' vibes. The sound is more balanced than the QC15 version, but I noticed a huge difference in the bass which can be heard more than the QC15. It really lives up to the name 'noise-cancelling' headphones! I would totally recommend buying these!

VI bought these because the general consensus seems to be that these have the best noise cancelation on the market and I am satisfied with that aspect of the headphones. They have many other awesome features which I shall enumerate.-Material quality is quite good-Very very comfortable-Excellent noise cancellation-Replaceable cord-AAA batteries (this is only a good feature if, like me, you always have a million of these guys lying around)-Padding is comfortable and durable.They also have a serious problem. These have really bad sound quality. In general if I am trying to asses sound quality of upper tier headphones I have to do a side by side comparison with a pair I am familiar with, and try multiple genres of music before I start to notice any real difference at all. With this pair I was shocked by how dull the music was the instant I put them on. Without noise cancellation on the sound quality is truly bad. Not just bad for this price range, but bad for anything that costs more than $20. With noise cancellation on the quality improves dramatically, but only to the point where it doesn't actively bother me. My current primary pair of headphones are Sennheiser HD-380s which sound excellent. They sound so much better that switching between the two is an almost painful process. The Bose pair sound so bad with noise cancelation off that I can't even use them in that mode, making them useless if I want to listen to music, but also would like to be able to hear my surroundings at all. The bottom line is that if I didn't need this level of noise cancelation I would not have purchased these. They are FAR too expensive for their abysmal performance. If you don't care about price or sound quality then go with these. Otherwise a good pair of Sennheisers and portable ear plug are the best alternative.

p2604

VExecutive Summary (Based on my ownership and experience with the following three headphones)===============Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones  -  Apple devices, Black - Wired=>Bose QC 25: Buy for Noise Cancelling and you are not big on Bass. Caters to the airline traveler.Beats Pro Over-Ear Headphone - Black=>Beats Pro: Buy if you like your music loud and with a kick of Bass. Caters to the folks that like Bass.Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones=>Audio-Technica (ATH-M50): Buy if you like balanced crisp sound (both in Highs, Mids and Lows), don\u2019t care about sound controls/mic on your cable, or the cable being detachable and are price sensitive. Caters to price sensitive folks that like balanced crisp sound, with few compromised features sets like not having sound control + mic. on cord and not having a detachable cord. With that said, do note if sound cord gets damaged then this will impact your TCO-total cost of ownership as you will have to repair/mod headphone unit.Key Personal Findings:===================Bose QC 25:- Noise Cancelling technology and performance- Comes with a nice travel case vs. cloth case on the beats- Lighter due to materials used in its construction; with that said both headphones are fine for in regards to comfort, but this is subject to your own level of comfort tolerance.- Comes Airline adapter for airline carriers that require you to have two jack connectors to connect to your airline seatBeats Pro:- Sound quality will cater to the folks that like their music loud and with kicking base- Solid aluminum frame construction- Great ear padding aid in ambient noise reduction- Comes with two modular wires, one (red) for typical connection to your music device the other (black) for connecting to devices that require a ¼ inch connectorAudio-Technica (ATH-M50):- Wonderful balanced clean-crisp sound at a great value- Comes with a ¼ adapter- Coiled Cable good quality and is longest in length than other two products, but is NOT detachable like the Beats Pro and Bose QC 25; so it means that you will have to go MacGyver status to fix this thing or get a new pair of headphones.- No inline sound controls and micOther:- All Three are solid head phones and I enjoy owning all three of them and I use them as following:o When on airline travel, I take the Bose due to the noise canceling and nice travel caseo When working in the office/home, I use the Beats Pro for the deep bass accentuated sound or Audio-Technica/Bose for the crisp soundo If you listen to the music loud, then all will block out your ambient noise just fineo If you want to take your sound to the next level, invest in a FiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier (I have the E7 version, but newer versions/models with features catering to your needs may be a better fit for you).

VAllow me to start by saying I'm not a headphone connoisseur. I'm not necessarily an audiophile, but I do love music and I have synaesthesia for what that's worth. I can't really be biased towards or against them as such...I've never owned anything Bose related, and my only experiences with Bose have been limited to store tests and my grandfather's sound system. I have upgraded to these headphones from a pair of Behringer HMP100s BEHRINGER HPM1000 that have served their purpose well. (Yes, it's a significant jump) I have worked with pretty nice headphones before, some mid-end Sennheisers and the like, but never Bose.I work with video and audio mixing/editing, as well as manage a podcast, so all I really look for is clarity and comfort. Needless to say these are very comfortable. They're soft while tight enough for them to feel like they're not going to fly off, so that's a plus for me. (I do tend to go out for runs, and the haven't so much as shifted on my head.)So, as far as sound quality goes, without the switch on, they sound as good (If not better) than the Behringers, while sounding massively better with the cancellation and amp on. I'm noticing little nuances in music I have never heard in music I've not noticed (or been able to hear) with my other headphones. Though if you have the amp on, there are occasional times where I can hear a slight ticking with bass, but it's not consistent with every kind of bass I've heard, it's rather hard to describe. A lower-quality song with a more direct bass will case a slight rattle, but a higher-quality version of the same song won't have the same rattling. Also there is a small amount of sound-bleeding at mildly high volumes, but it isn't loud enough to hear outside of arm's reach. I'd say at 3/4 volume, the radius of being able to hear sound leaking would be around 6', give or take.The cancellation: Alright, I always like things that have noise isolation. Isolation is nice, but I've only owned one set of active noise cancelling headphones and they were 'meh' at best. They wouldn't quite filter out road noise, while these will block out things like a generator running, construction noise, dogs barking (Provided they aren't right in your ear), and so on. I'd definitely recommend them on that basis alone. There are a couple of little quirks I've noticed with the cancellation, nothing dealbreaking or anything... like for example, if you're sitting in a car, and someone opens and then closes the door, the resulting 'whoosh' does seem to confuse the cancellation a bit as whatever I'm listening to will stutter for a second.Comfort: I haven't noticed any sort of fatigue or unwelcome pressure even with glasses on. They are also secure enough not to fly off, even with rapid head movements. They also feel rugged enough to take a drop or two without shattering, and that's always a plus for me.So, all that to say: As a first time Bose owner, I'm satisfied. They deliver on everything advertised, and met my expectations.I'm not sure I'd recommend them to someone that's just looking for a minimal good pair of headphones for the price, as they are to meet a specific criteria. If you can spare the cost, enjoy music, and also enjoy quiet to the extent of considering them, I'd say go for it. If you're just looking for something expensive for bragging rights... well, that's entirely up to you.A couple of things to note: if you have lower quality MP3s, you will definitely notice. And these do NOT play well with any sort of bass boosting. They have a good amount of bass on their own, but if you add in extra bass they may very well start rattling like crazy.Oh, and if you're the kind of person that tends to shout when you wear headphones, I'd approach with caution. With the noise cancellation on, it's pretty hard to hear your own voice. I'm softspoken, and never really talk loud to begin with, but I let some relatives try it on and that resulted in yelling worthy of a sports stadium... Then again, that's not really Bose's fault, and just a bit of a personal note.I hope this helps. (If I missed something, I'll try to answer questions as best I can)

VOutstanding Noise-Canceling; Solid Music Reproduction
p2615
sg5
VI work in a hipster loft-style open office with about 80 other people. For those afflicted with FOMO (fear of missing out), it's a dream come true -- you get to hear everything everyone says and does. For an introvert like me who does intricate work that requires extended periods of concentration, it's a nightmare. These phones saved the day. They are comfortable to wear for long periods (at least on my kind of large, square head) and the noise-cancelling function is stellar; a flick of the switch and -- whoosh -- ambient sound just drops down into near silence. I still can hear some voices, but they are muffled and distant. If someone approaches and speaks to me directly, I can hear them and take off the phones to continue the conversation. The dull roar of the office HVAC system (which I didn't really notice until I was able to "cancel" it with these headphones) completely disappears. I have yet to try them on a plane, but riding a subway is amazingly quiet. Just me and my music at a comfortable volume. Even with the music turned off, the surrounding sounds are masked. I'm finding I have more energy even at the end of the day when I use these phones and don't have to fight the ambient sound monsters to concentrate.On the music reproduction side, I'd rate these as good headphones. They don't compare to audio-only headphones in this price range, but are more than adequate for MP3 or streaming listening. When I listen to CDs (mostly classical and jazz), I the stereo imaging and spaciousness is lacking somewhat. There is tight, compressed feel to the sound. But nothing particularly annoying; these phones just lack the musical detail I'm used to in my high-quality audio-only phones.  You can listen to audio if the battery goes dead, but that is only a last resort; the sound is distant and muffled. I wouldn't recommend it.There is a large L and R in the speaker mesh of each earpiece so there is no mistaking which side is which. Nice touch!The case is useful and not a throwaway. It is semi-rigid and would offer reasonable protection against moderate drops and jostles. It  has a diagram on its liner to show you how to fold the phones for a perfect fit. There is a storage compartment for a spare battery and an airplane audio adapter jack. It takes up more space than just cramming the phones into a backpack pocket or whatever, but it is light and not so huge its awkward to carry in a pack or laptop bag.In summary: the noise-cancelling capabilities of these phones are outstanding. That's what you're paying for and it's worth it. The sound reproduction is quite good, but not the primary draw. The entire package shows thoughtful design elements and they are a joy to use.

VI recently purchased a pair of Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones for school. I have enjoyed several Bose audio products over the years mostly because they typical have few faults. However, despite my experience with the brand in the past, I am going to attempt to look at this product with a little bias as possible. Thus, here is my review of the Pros and Cons of the Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones.PROS\u2022 Sound quality\u2022 Noise canceling feature\u2022 Build quietly and comfort  The sounds quality is much better than some of the other headphones that I have been using recently, made by Sony and Beats. The audio is crisp and clear without over exaggerating any of the lows, mids, or highs. Which makes music very enjoyable to listen to. Whether you are an audio editor or just an average music fan, you will not be disappointed with how these head phones sound.  I am happy to report that the noise canceling feature does not disappoint.  I purchased the Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones because I recently moved into a new apartment and have some noisy neighbors. College students, such as myself, will find this noise canceling feature is extremely useful to help find a quitter place to study. Even If listening to the headphones at a low to medium volume, you will hear almost Zero outside noise. A feature that can be very useful when in noisy environments.  Lastly the build quietly and comfort are both deserving of high praise. The sturdy build makes them feel very premium and aesthetically pleasing.  The soft, leather material ear cups help to be able to wear the headphones for several hours at a time without any major discomfort.CONS\u2022 Price\u2022 Auxiliary cord There are some drawbacks of the Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones. For instance they are quite expensive at $299 US, too expensive for most people that are on a tight budget.  They also use a strange auxiliary cord that will not be easy to replace if lost or broken. The battery life of these headphones is decent, however, be sure to remember to turn off the noise canceling feature when you\u2019re not using them. If you don\u2019t mind spending quite a bit more than a typical set of headphones, then the QuietComfort 25 are a fantastic way to make your world a little quitter.

p2626
sg5
VI procrastinated in buying these because, honestly, I don't like Bose's products in terms of sound quality (my Sennheiser HD 380's sound way better and these days are $120 or so) and hate that there are never any sort of sales on these headphones. I think a more fair price for these is $200.However, I finally caved considering I work at home with a stay at home wife and our new baby daughter. I also now live in WA state, which means open windows and lots of noise outside as long as it's not cold outside. I did my research and Bose has the best noise cancellation out of everyone. I very much wanted any other brand due to sound quality, but I was after noise cancellation and these are the best, so no sense going anywhere else.Some things that I think everyone should know before buying:-They only cancel out low range sounds - your wife's voice and kid will not be drowned out by these and in certain scenarios you may be able to hear both better (if there is a lot of noise in the room). They are perfect for: traffic, washer/dryer, washing machine, space heater, airplane rumbling, etc.-They don't sound awful if you're afraid of that. They're relatively detailed, but not neutral sounding like the Sennheisers that I like. They are around the sound quality of a $60-100 pair of headphones, IMO. You're paying for noise cancellation here.-You can wear these without the attached cable and use them just to drown out sound. I find it much easier to concentrate with these on, no matter what I'm doing.-They sound worse than anything I've ever heard if you have the noise cancellation off. I don't think I'm using hyperbole here, at least in regards to products that have been made in the last 15 years. I guess this is a trade off - they seem to have designed the sound around the idea that noise cancellation would always be running.-The included cable appears to be meant for Samsung phones only - my Motorola Droid Turbo doesn't understand any of the buttons at all, but the microphone appears to work.For me, they are almost purely about work. I want to be able to concentrate even when there is so much going on around me. For real listening pleasure I go back to my Sennheisers.

VThese headphones are awesome! I had never used noise-canceling headphones before so I wasn't sure what to expect.PACKAGING: The package and the headphones were smaller than I pictured. These come with a really nice, sturdy case that will protect them and has a compartment to store an extra battery for the noise cancellation.BATTERY LIFE: I wasn't sure about the 30 hour battery life advertised so I purchased some rechargeable batteries to cut down on cost. I have been using them for several hours and have yet to run out of battery so we will see how many days before I must change the battery.QUALITY:  I read some reviews that suggested these were cheaply made compared to previous models. I have never owned anything from Bose but these seem very well made for headphones. I wouldn't throw them around and expect them to last but that isn't really part of their use. The headband is made of plastic with metal screws holding the components together. The piece that attached to the ear cups swivels so that it can adapt to different sizes and shapes of heads.COMFORT: I put these on my 1.5 year old and the ear cups fit comfortably on his head. The headband is too large for him but if he was sitting they were comfortable. They do fit on my 4 year old and he thinks they are comfortable. I have been wearing them for several hours at a time and the ear cups are barely noticeable. They are very soft and mold around the ear to form a seal. Unfortunately, the top of my head has been a little irritated where the headband sits so I have been moving it around. The headband has padding on the underside at the top but even so, these feel heavy and were not comfortable after hours of use. When the noise cancellation feature is on it feels like there is an increased pressure in the ear cup which takes some time to get used to.SOUND: These sound like well made headphones. Like I said, I haven't used high quality headphones before this set but I am happy with their sound quality. The noise cancellation feature is really great. I am in college and have to study while my children are playing which can be really difficult if they are playing loudly. The ear cups block out maybe 20% of the sound without noise cancellation. When the noise cancellation is turned on, things are 60-70% quieter. I can still hear everything around me but it sounds more distant and less distracting. This is perfect for me because I still want to hear but be able to focus on lectures. The input for sound works whether or not the noise-cancellation feature is on. I made a phone call with my iphone and had no issues with hearing or being heard.I am so glad I bought these for school work and I wish that I had done so earlier.

VI rarely rate products and of that subset i rarely give any product a 5 star, but these QC25's deserve it.I am a huge headphone guy, i've probably spent over 10000 dollars on headphones in my life (i'm only 30), i have dacs, i have amps, i've had tons and tons of pairs. I'm not a "super audiophile must have flat response or it sucks" guy. I'm a guy who goes to work at a desk for 9 hours a day, goes home to play computer games at night and then goes to bed.I was a big fan of the q15's, i had 2 pairs, including a limited edition pair, but i had a few issues with them. The QC25's have solved all but one of these problems. Let me explain.The QC15's and QC25's have noise canceling that can sometimes be over whelming, if you're in a very windy environment, or in a super loud construction zone, the way the cancellation works, it actually can hurt my ears. The QC15's had no ability to use the headphones with the active noise cancellation (ANC) turned off. That was beef one. The second was the cable on the QC15's was so long, obnoxiously long. So long. Like long. And finally the QC15's did not have bluetooth wireless capabilities.So, as we know the QC25's do not have bluetooth either, but because of the other issues being resolved, i'm looking over this, and solving this problem by getting a small battery powered bluetooth adapter, many can be found on amazon for under 30 dollars. This is not a perfect solution but it works.In other words, the qc25's do allow you use them when they're off, granted at a degradation of sound quality, but honestly its not so insanely crappy sounding with it off that if your head is just a little pressed from the ANC or you just want to listen to talk radio or something, i find this is an excellent feature, that and if your battery dies you can still listen to your entertainment.The cable is MUCH better, out goes the huge clunky headphone side which is replaced by a thin connector, as well as a much more reasonable length. Its a huge improvement over the QC15s.The ANC is so amazing, at the office, its like i have my own office in a sea of cubicals, at home my window AC unit that has to run 24/7, disappears. Literally, its gone.  And they're so comfortable. I can wear them for hours and hours without pain or pressure points, and i wear glasses, so this is a hard task to achieve.If you're looking for ANC headphones that are comfortable sound good, ANC can be disabled while still using them, just get these. Get them. I love them, i really do, and i paid full price. I just love them. Thank you Bose.

p2642

VThese headphones are amazing in loud or moderately noisy environments, but not great in very quiet environments.  In very noisy settings like airplanes, the active noise cancelling works wonders, and allows you to hear your audio at a normal listening level.  In a setting like an office, where the sound level is moderate, these headphones are great and the way they're built provides a reasonable level of noise reduction even without the active noise cancelling enabled.  However, this is actually an issue in very quiet environments, like a home office or library.  There are two problems.  One: because the headphones do such a great job of passively blocking outside noise, in very quiet environments you can actually hear your heart beating and your jaw moving, which can be distracting.  Two: with the active noise cancelling on, there is a constant, low volume white noise.  This white noise is imperceptible when used in loud environments, but can be easily heard in quiet ones.Regarding comfort, they are rather comfortable.  Though they can be worn comfortably for a few hours at a time, your ears my get warm, because they are so well sealed off.  All of the padding is nice, and they headset is very light weight.With the active noise cancelling turned off, sound is neutral, which can seem bland to some people, but overall there's nothing to complain about.  With the active noise cancelling turned on, Bose also turns on an EQ which makes things a little punchier, but never strays far from neutral.Overall, if you plan to use this in moderate to very noisy environments, they are wonderful and I would highly recommend them.  If you are looking for a new pair of headphones to use in quiet environments, the sound quality isn't worth the price.  For the same price, or cheaper, you can find better sounding headphones.

VIn many ways I really want to give the Bose QuietComfort headphones 5 stars... but I have tested way too many other, equally excellent, headphones that were sold at a much lower price to just stamp 5 stars on to the Bose. The thing I really struggle with is that despite really enjoying the Bos QuietComfort 25's.... I think I still prefer my VModa M100's (which at the time of this review.... cheaper). However, the Bose definitely have a couple of advantages.Notes/Observations  (I am using the VModa M100's as a comparison)Sound performance - The Bose QuietComfort 25 are nice and clean.... they are neither boomy or bright. This is where they get a bit of an unfair comparison to the M100's which has a unbelievable sound stage. This one of those concepts that is tough to explain, but the M100's just seem to have more of a 3D effect and all of the instruments/tones have greater depth. The Bose are not bad (quite good in fact) but they are no match for the M100's. The sound stage does improve with about 20 hours of break in.Noise Cancelling - Probably the best I have ever used. The M100s do not feature active noise cancelling (which is the reason for the lower price point).  In my book they beat my Velodynes and a few other pairs of noise canceling headphones that I have tried.Comfort - The fit is excellent and they are not too heavy - however - noise canceling does cause a bit of a (what appears to be) a positive pressure inside the cans. Not a big of a deal, but it can give you the feel in your ears that you are changing altitudes. Some people find this more annoying than others.Case/Footprint - I love the fact the fold into a neat case that is the size of a small paperback (and it is rectangular). Unlike the M100's they fit very nicely in a backpack or travel bag.Look - not important to me.... but they look professional. They do not have that hip - going to the club look - of Beats or even the M100's.Final vedict - My go-to choice of headphones for travel because of their superior noise cancellation and reduced footprint. However, for my day-to-day listening I reach for the VModa M100's .... Honestly, you really can't go wrong with either!4 1/2 Stars

p2652
sg5
VI wanted to give these a real try, but I don't think I'm the right demographic for this item. First thing's first--the noise cancellation feature is quite an accomplishment. It cuts down the drone of an AC to low whirr. It's like you have a switch to turn a room into your own private library. But unfortunately the sound experience takes a nose dive afterward. If I had to place sound quality of the QC25s in a range, I'd say they sound as good as a pair of $25-50 over ear headphones. They have very little resolution, the frequency response is cut off at both ends, and the midrange is very thin. Is this Bose's fault? Hard to say -- it's probably due to the constraints of noise cancellation technology. Unfortunately there's also some quality control/design issues with the jack or the detachable cable -- if the cord is turned just the wrong way, one of the channels will cut out. This was within 2 hours of use, and I decided to call in that amazon refund.The quality and styling is very attractive and nicely understated. Comfort is excellent--I have slightly large ears and the circumaural fit was perfect for me. I wish my ATH-M50s were as comfortable and light as these headphones.For the record, my favorite headphone sound signature is consistently the ATH-M50. They're possibly the most basic audiophile headphone experience, but they're damn cheap for what you get and have the resolution and slight V that makes them enjoyable all-rounders. I know, the QC 25s aren't monitors, not by a long shot. They're a consumer product at their core. They are definitely a niche item and maybe the best noise-cancelling headphones out there. But I think that as much as Bose tries to market them as good sounding headphones, they're quite poor performers. I'd rather just replace the earpads on my ATH-M50s with ones with more isolation than pay double the price of the ATH-M50s for a thin-sounding experience in a slick package.

VQC15's or QC25's in flight review.
p2658
sg5
VI own both the QC15's and QC25's.This review is based on the noise cancelling functionality of these headsets in flight, my main use for these headphones is to stop the low frequency drone that is prevalent in aircraft.I travel frequently doing approximately 6 international flights of longer than 10 hours duration per year and I have owned a myriad of noise cancelling headphones over the years.  I won't bother describing the other noise cancelling headsets other than saying that they were Sony's, Panasonic's and Sennheiser's. I did not have a problem with the sound quality of in flight movies or my iPod music with them, but as far as noise cancelling functionality they are not up to the level of the Bose QC's ability to attenuate the low frequency aircraft drone.I do have a laugh at times when I read reviews about noise cancelling headsets and their sound quality. You are in a noisy jet engined aluminium tube, this is not the ideal environment to be comparing audio. These are not designed as audiophile headphones, their job is to reduce that monotonous drone and allow you to arrive at your destination less frazzled.If you work in an office that has loud HVAC these will also attenuate most, if not all of that noise, it really depends on the environment.In my opinion both the QC15's and QC 25's are about the same for noise cancelling, you could be picky but there's not much in it. There are some feature differences with the 25's, you can still hear audio when the battery goes flat and they pack into a smaller case. I also carry a couple of spare AAA batteries with them, there is no point in having active noise cancelling headset that have flat batteries.I still use the QC15's and my wife uses the QC25's, the reason for this is that I carry less things on a flight than she does, so with her limited purse space they are a better fit.Comfort wise I have no issue with either and find them comfortable to have on for three to four hours at a time, by then I'm ready to get up and stretch my legs anyway so I take them off.I do need to note I do not use these around the house or office I have better headphones (Senneheisers) for listening at home which do not require batteries.Build quality looks and feels good to me, I have not broken any headphones (yet), if you are gentle with them, don't sit on them or drop them excessively in my opinion they will last.

VSome concerns about the folding design, but otherwise, good performance & sound
p2663
sg5
VAfter a very disappointing experience with the poor engineering of the Sony MDR-NC60 headphones, I have pretty much had a "once-bitten, twice shy" attitude towards standard-sized noise-cancelling headphones.  When it comes to noise-cancelling headphones, I have used the in-the-ear variety rather than the traditional cans, so I was curious to see how these would perform.So far, so good.  I have noticed very little distortion in either ear, and the noise cancellation works pretty much as advertised.  I have found that the battery has held up well after almost 2 weeks of continuous use, so I am guessing that Bose's claims of a 35-hour lifetime is fairly accurate.  For spoken word, I generally don't use the noise cancellation as it isn't all that necessary, but for acoustic music, if you don't use the noise cancellation the sound is just awful, as though the musicians were playing in a closet.For me, the balance is good; no overpowering bass, & the treble is serviceable.  If you are wanting booming bass, then these aren't the headphones for you.  Also, if you are looking for headphones for a stereo, it is worth noting that these are designed for handheld devices and computers only, and will not work well with a stereo amplifier.I do have some reservations, and I can see why there are as many 1-star reviews as there are.  The folding design makes me nervous, and the carrying case is just ridiculously small.  If I folded them up the way it is recommended, it wouldn't surprise me if something malfunctioned before too long.  I am using a larger carrying case and treating them carefully.  This is definitely something to consider.Obviously, it is too early to give a fair assessment of how well these headphones will hold up after extended use.  Only time will tell, but for now, I am quite pleased with the performance, which seems commensurate with the price.

VI've broken my review up into the different aspects of the QC25:FUNCTIONALITY: They fit my head well. The ear cups fully surround your ears and make a complete seal that helps with noise reduction. It creates a bit of a pressurized sensation that I have gotten used to. The cups are contoured to fit each ear, and they're labeled with a large "R" or "L" inside so they're easy to put on correctly. I use them to listen to music with my smartphone/computer when I need background noise reduction (flights, when neighbors are noisy), and so far they've been great. The in-line controls are straightforward for the main functions like answering calls, pausing music, changing volume, etc., but for other functions, like fast-forwarding/rewinding, they get a bit convoluted ("Press Answer/End three times and hold"). The cable is 5 feet long, perfect for use with a smartphone, and it has an 1/8" jack that works with all my devices. It's detachable, so you could install a longer one for other applications. The power switch lights up with a green light so you don't forget to turn them off when you put them away. The enclosed manual has VERY small print; the PDF of the manual at Bose is much more convenient.SOUND: Without battery power, the sound is adequate for voices, but poor for music. With power, however, I like the sound quality. These are not neutral-sounding headphones, but the balance is pleasant and probably helps to block noise.NOISE REDUCTION: Word on the street is Bose has the best noise reduction. I listened to music on the QC25 for several hours next to an A/C unit on full blast, and they blocked out the majority of the noise, reducing it to a faint whir behind the music. I expect they'll do the same with airplane noise.QUALITY: They feel substantial and well-made, and the earpad material looks long-wearing. I don't hear a lot of Bose users complaining about their headphones breaking, so I have high hopes. I'll update my review if there are any problems.COMFORT: I listened to music on the QC25 for most of one work day with no discomfort.CASE: The case has a diagram in it showing how to fold the headphones to fit inside the case, which is very helpful -- that's exactly the kind of thing I'd have trouble remembering if I was only an occasional user. The little slot for storing an extra battery is handy, especially as I use rechargeables, which Bose says won't last as long with the QC25 (28 hours versus 35 hours for an alkaline). The case seems strong and sturdy, however, I would have preferred something a bit lighter. It weighs almost as much as the headphones (6.8 oz with accessories, compared to 7.2 oz for the headphones).Overall, a great product, well-designed and easy to use.

VBose Quiet Comfort Noise Canceling headphonesModel: QC 25 for Samsung Galaxy and Android  phonesAmazon price: $299.00Bose is known for its high-end audio equipment. Their noise-canceling headphone products are among the best available. The Quiet Comfort 25 headphones include Bose noise-canceling, Active EQ, and TriPort technologies. The combination produces stunning audio results.If you\u2019ve never experienced noise-canceling headphones, you won\u2019t believe your ears the first time you try them. You put them on and the sound around you is muffled a bit but you can still hear it. Switch noise-canceling on and all you hear is a breathtaking, inky silence. The best place to experience this is on an airplane. The drone of the engines in the background simply disappears. Now start playing some music and you hear it with clarity without any noise interference.The QC 25 headphones have padded over-the-ear cushions that are soft and comfortable. The adjustable band that fits over your head is also padded. I find that wearing these headphones for extended periods isn\u2019t at all fatiguing. Some headphones feel too tight after a while or make your head and ears hot. Not so here.A single AAA battery fits inside the right ear cup to power the noise-canceling feature. It will last up to 35 hours. There is a small pocket in the case for an extra battery. A thoughtful touch. In the same pocket is a two-prong plug for in-flight entertainment use on some airplanes. The phones fold conveniently into a  very nicely designed case. It\u2019s a semi-hard-sided, flexible case with a zipper. The exterior has a handy elasticized pocket.On the cable, there is an inline control module the contains a mic for answering phone calls on your Samsung Galaxy or Android smartphone. The buttons perform the usual functions: Volume up/down, Play/pause, Phone call answer and end. Other functions are accomplished by multiple button presses: Next/previous track, Fast forward/rewind, Ignore a call, Switch between calls, and Voice control.Tip: The only difference between the Samsung and the iPhone versions of these headphones is the cable. If you switch to an iPhone in the future, Bose sells an alternate cable that will allow you to continue using your Quiet Comfort headphones with the iPhone.The signature Bose sound is very natural without the boomy bass that characterizes many current headphone models. To my ear, the bass and treble ends of the spectrum are slightly boosted and the mid-range is slightly reduced - both in a good way. The resulting sound is natural, clean and, crystal clear. The headphones work with the noise-canceling feature turned off. However, the sound quality is a bit muddy. Acceptable, but not as sparkling as when it\u2019s on. The noise-canceling feature can also be used with no cable attached to give yourself some peaceful quiet time; sleeping on a plane, for instance.Being a music and audio nut, I\u2019ve owned many headphones and these exceed any of them for sound quality and comfort. To my ears, these QC 25s are about as good as headphones get.

VNoise Cancellation that Really Works!
p2678
sg5
VWow! I've owned and tested quite a few headphones over the years and a number of them have implemented noise cancelling technology, but these Bose QC25 headphones are light years ahead of any I've ever put over my ears. Full disclosure compels me to say that most of the headphones, including NC varieties, have not exceeded the $200 price point, so that needs to be considered. If the extra cost involved in truly eliminating ambient noise has been the missing link in my previous experiences, then I am a new convert and a real believer. What I'm saying is this: the extra cost is well worth it. These headphones are at the top of the list for this feature set.But, how do they sound? They sound great. The noise cancellation helps to set the foundation to hear what you want to hear and not be in competition with other sounds or noises. You start with a "blank canvas" and you get the most pure of pictures...you see the "colors" you paint unobstructed by competing "colors." The sounds you hear from these headphones are very similar to that illustration. I have other headphones that are more bass driven, but those headphones cover some of the mids and treble sounds that color the music I want to hear. I suppose personal preferences are going to be the driver here, but I am very, very excited about what my ear is being treated to with these Bose QC25 headphones. I am super impressed and excited about a brave new world I've not experienced before.Comfort and fit are what I would expect from Bose. These are not middle shelf equipment and Bose delivers a finely crafted headset and very comfortably fitting as well. Nothing seems cheap or cost-cutting in my estimation. Bose has also included a nice semi-hard case for carrying the headphones when not in use. The case is surprisingly compact and fits nicely in my backpack and messenger bag. Also included is a airlines input jack converter for the traveler (I  can't wait to try these out on a flight as I usually have to crank the volume to unsafe levels to drown out the horrendous ambient airline noise).Final thoughts: These are the real deal and worth every penny. If I'd known noise cancellation could work at this level, I'd have been all in a long time ago. This is no gimmick folks, Bose is paving the way for me to venture into a whole new experience...one I'm glad to go along for the ride.

VBest headphones I have ever owned - problem is, now I can't hear the wife telling me dinner is ready....
p2683

VIn writing this review, I can't compare it to previous experiences with noise cancelling headphones, or anything of a similar quality, but I will list the other products I have owned for the sake of having a point of reference. Additionally it is worth mentioning that I have headphones on most of my working day.The previous two headphones I have owned have been in the $50-$100 range and were thePanasonicRP-HTx7-G1 $50Sennheiser HD 212pro ($100)While I really liked the previous headphones mentioned above, I now realize the gap in quality now that I have the Bose headphones. My review includes the following sections - Audio quality, Build quality, and Comfort.AUDIO QUALITYFirstly, the noise cancelling capabilities are ridiculous (in a great way) . Even without switching on the noise cancellation, the headphones do an amazing job of eliminating sound from around you.  I did 3 tests of the noise reduction without any audio input.#1 beside my tower computer (which has 3 large fans) - result = silence#2 beside my air conditioner - result = silence#3 beside the washing machine and clothes dryer (both running) - result = silenceTo do a fourth test I asked my son to stand in the laundry room with the headphones on while I had the noise cancellation switched off.  Then I turned it on and I watched disbelief and joy sweep across his face, as I am sure it did when I had done this test moments before.Secondly, in relation to the audio reproduction, I wanted to assess the quality in 3 areas - Bass, mids, highs.For the reproduction tests I went to Youtube on my computer for videos with test audio with the search term Headphone test Music.The first test was with the video - "Sound Test for Beats by Dr.Dre - SkillGamingHDI"This video has a strong bass component but weak mid and highs to speak of.  Despite that, it still does an impressive job of giving the headphones a workout.The second test was "Bass and surround sound test" Nice results but I feel the audio itself is not high quality.The 3rd test was "Beethoven's 9th - Ode To Joy | Dolby Headphone 3D sound from Immortal Beloved HD 5.1" Gorgeous quality audio source file and gave each range of the headphones a workout, where they all excelled.The 4th test was sorely focused on the low end response and was validated through playing the track "Ultimate Dubstep Bass Test"Lastly I decided to bring up a favorite artist to reach for extreme bass, while still having a balanced range of mids and highs to assess - for this I listened to Deadmau5  4x4=12 (Continuous Mix) .Since the majority of my daily use is movies and not music I then went to Netflix and looked some movies including some of the most recent releases (for potentially better audio content) to test. Here are the results but remember, results are also dependant on release date.Black Hawk Down - Release date 2001 - Dialogue 9 - Action Sequences 9 - Music 9- Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 9Marvels Daredevil - Release date 2015 - Dialogue 10 - Action Sequences 10 - Music 10 - Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 10The November Man - Release date 2014 - Dialogue 10 - Action Sequences 10 - Music 10 - Atmosphere (distant rain, breathing etc) 10Overall a score of 10/10From my LG android phone the audio was not as brilliant, but that is a function of my phone and not the headphonesBUILD QUALITYA typical area of concern for me in headphones is the build quality, especially around any joints or any area that moves.I was delighted to see metal hinges which are embedded in rather thick plastic.  I do not anticipate any breakages in normal use of the product.Fabric covered headband - while this black fabric feels nice  to the touch, I think I would rather leather or another material to reduce the potential for the accumulation of dirt either from hands or hairOverall a score of 10/10COMFORTAgain, for me I wear headphones for many hours a day, so this can be a deal breaker. These fit perfectly, and in no way hurt my ears or present any negative elements from a comfort perspective -  they are a joy to wear.Over all a 20/10PROS AND CONSProsSound qualityBuild QualityComfortIncludes Headphone adapter for inflight entertainment that requires the two prong connectorIncludes a battery so the unit can be completely operational straight out of the boxIncludes and beautiful carry case that accommodates the headphones when they are folded upInline volume and play/pause button for controlling audio on the phoneInline mic for phone calls provides great clarity for the person listening on the other endConsNONE...In conclusion - for me the Bose Quiet Comfort 25 are completely wonderful, and I cannot wait to travel with them on my next flight to enjoy some inflight entertainment - until then, they will be in daily use here at the house.

VSimply fantastic noise-cancelling headphones
p2688
sg5
VFirst, note: these are identical to the regular QuietComfort 25 headphones apart from the cord, which has an inline remote whose volume control works with Samsung and Android devices. Apart from the volume control, every other aspect of the headphones and cord will work fine with any device, from Apple or any other manufacturer; considering how minimal the difference in function is, it's probably best just to shop on price and buy whichever model you can find cheaper.Having said that, the QC25s are a simply fantastic pair of noise-cancelling headphones, among the best available, and a great purchase for any regular traveler. They are comfortable, convenient, portable, sound great, and have great noise cancellation.The packaging and presentation are nice as always with Bose products; an attractive cardboard outer box contains nothing but some minimal foam padding, manuals, and the headphones and cord themselves, packed in their carrying case. You'll find a single AAA battery nestled into a dedicated spot in the carrying case alongside an airline adapter, with the spot for a backup battery making immediately apparent how well thought out the whole product is. Speaking of good design decisions: the choice to run on AAAs is really far more convenient, and a much better idea especially for use on long trips, than the fiddly USB-charging built-in batteries in many competitors. The semi-hard carrying case is flatter and boxier than most, with the headphones folding asymmetrically sideways to fit into it; it takes a bit of getting used to, but an illustration within the case shows you how to pack them (another nice touch).The headphones themselves are well made and comfortable all around. They have large, cushy over-ear cups, whose padding sits lightly against the head, not the ears, and felt lining inside (as well as over much of the headband). I found I might've liked a bit tighter headband, actually, to keep them in place while moving around. All the materials seem relatively durable. The cord is very high-quality, strong and soft; the inline remote and some of the outer plastic are perhaps the only slightly cheap-feeling portions.Sound quality is excellent, at least with noise cancelling on. The marketing materials claim they don't need to be switched on to listen to music, but the sound quality switched off is terrible, very quiet and muffled and dead. Even switched on, they need to be driven quite loud -- I had to crank most of the devices I plugged in nearly to maximum volume for satisfying music listening, and still couldn't always get it quite loud enough. Anyhow, I found their sound well-rounded, full, perhaps a little bit bright and trebley but full of detail and midrange while being warm and bassy enough even for hip-hop and dance music. Details pop out of well-mixed recordings, from the piano in a jazz ensemble to the backing vocalists in a loud rock song, almost as well as they do with my favorite in-ear phones (Ultimate Ears). There's a nice isolated feeling that comes with the noise cancelling, as well. These headphones simply sound great, just as headphones.And the noise cancelling is unbelievably effective, too. I'd heard that many judged Bose's headphones better at quieting ambient noise than other noise-cancelling headphones, but the difference is really dramatic. I compared these directly to Creative Aurvana Platinum, a similarly priced noise-cancelling set, by switching on a loud fan in a small room, and found the Bose noise-cancellation removed far, far more of the ambient mechanical noise and hum; switching the Bose on feels like entering a library, not like muffling a noise. I'd certainly pack these over the Creatives when travelling!All in all, this is just a great set of headphones for frequent travellers. Everything about them is first-rate: the sound, the convenience, and the noise cancellation. Recommended.

VExcellent Noise Cancellation, Compact for Travel, Quality Construction
p2693
sg5
VFrom the moment you see the box that these headphones are in, you will know that you are dealing with Bose quality.  The external packaging is so nice that I'm tempted to keep it!  The case for the headphones is a nice quality, sturdy black pleather design.  The headphones themselves fold up neatly into the case - making it easy to slip them into a backpack or briefcase for travel.  Although they fold up, they are made of a very sturdy design that appears to be able to hold up well for a long time.In terms of sound quality, the headphones are on as I type this review.  The only time I can hear anything from my otherwise loud keyboard is between songs when there is only silence (and even then it is a very light clicking)!  The Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones seem to provide outstanding noise cancellation, and in a very compact package.  I'm not likely the best judge of overall audio quality, but the music I am listening to seems to be very high quality - I'm thoroughly enjoying these great headphones!  Plug them in, block out the world, and relax into your music or movies!DEVICE COMPATIBILITYAlthough these are advertised as made for the Samsung Galaxy, that is really only relevant to the volume/mic that is embedded into the cord - and even then, they will likely work fine with many devices.  I'm using them with a Nokia Windows phone at the moment.  No problems at all.  Volume controls work fine, as does the pause/voice command button.  I believe the mic works fine too (I can't quite tell if Cortana hears my voice thru the phone which is only a few feet away, or through the mic).  In any case, even if the controls didn't work, the headphones would be great and at about the same price as headphones that don't have the embedded controls.-----UPDATE: After using these for a month, a few other things have become apparent.The noise cancellation isn't quite perfect.  I've used other over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones that seem to do a somewhat better job.  On the other hand, those other headphones seem to be much bulkier and still aren't perfect.  These headphones drown out most noise and, with even light music playing, almost all other sounds become inconsequential.Although these travel well, I now also use the Bose in-ear noise cancelling headphones.  The sound quality and noise cancellation in the over-ear model is clearly better.  But the in-ear ones are still quite good, and are perfect for traveling - when you don't want to bulk up your luggage.The only issue I've seen with these is that there is no auto-off feature.  On more than one occasion I've stopped using the headphones and forgot to turn off the power.  The next time I went to use them the battery was dead.  A small annoyance and I'm not sure if anything can be done about it, so I'm leaving these with a 5 star review.

VI'm not quite an audiophile, but I've given enough headphones poor ratings to think I at least have some taste, and these headphones are the best I've ever used--at least when in active, battery-draining mode. My usual strategy for testing is to start with a track with a lot of dynamic range; I have a 'Mastered for iTunes' version of Holst's 'Mars: The Bringer of War' which has enough fine detail and highs and lows to give headphones a workout. In the past, I've been happy with my beat-up passive Sony cans, but they sound muddy next to these active Bose headphones. Now, whether that is real, accurate recreation or flashy over-processing I can't quite tell, but it doesn't seem distorted and is extremely clear. Same deal with a wide variety of other musical genres.As for noise canceling; these do a credible job. I wore these practically non-stop on a non-stop flight from Boston to Oakland and back again, and while I could still hear cabin noises, they were much less oppressive. The difference between switching noise canceling on and off was night and day in terms of quiet. I just did not want to take these off, they made that much of a difference, especially on the red-eye return where I was desperate for some sleep. The noise canceling does bring a sort of "pressure" which I think is the unheard white noise; it's more of a sensation than a sound and isn't unpleasant, but it's always there.These are the Android/Samsung version. It comes with a cord that brings media controls to Samsung and other devices, although they don't seem to do anything for the Nexus 7 or old Kindle Fire tablet I have on my desk. They do work, quite nicely, with the new Samsung 12.2 Note tablet. The cord is detachable, and you can buy an optional iOS version of the cable--I bought one in a contrasting cyan so I could tell the cables apart, although the Samsung cable has an 'S' below the microphone. While otherwise externally identical the iOS cable will allow you to control iPhones, iPads, and Macs, whereas the included cable will not. Thus a multi-device family could share these headphones, or a Samsung phone user with a Mac could leave the iOS version of the cable attached to his computer. I've been mainly using these headphones with my Mac Mini, and it's been great being able to change the volume, pause iTunes playback and use the microphone for online conferencing.The multimedia controls on each cable are conveniently findable a short distance below the headphones.Microphone input is quite clear for a microphone rubbing against your shirt.For being over the ear headphones, these are comparatively light, and true to their name comfortable, after adjusting for my head size, I can wear them for hours, nor does my hair snag as it has on other cans. It took me a while to figure out where the 'L' 'R' labels were, hiding in huge letters on the fabric covering the speakers.(The can with the cable is the left one.)The carrying case if a classy sort of thing, made of quality materials and having a spot for the airplane adaptor and a spare battery. It is on the bulky side, so I'm not sure where in my computer bag it will fit during travel, but I will be babying these headphones so I will find a space for it. You will likely find that spare battery useful, and you should keep it restocked, as in less then 2 days of sitting with the noise canceling on, you will have to replace it. You might want to think about getting a pair of rechargeable AAAs.I am impressed by these headphones, and I highly recommend anyone in need of sonic isolation give them a try.

VBetter than the Beats Studio . I bought the Beats Studio about 5 months ago. They sounded good but they added a lot of clumsy noise in the top three volume bars. Felt like all the music was just being thrown at you at once without proper clarity. and I use my beats for work out and at work only in 5 months the head band had broken and I fixed it using a tape and my wife is using them. they are soo expensive and not reliable at all. But just today I bought these Bose QC 25 headphones and they are a class apart. They produce crystal clear music with precision to each and every note. Even at high volumes you can hear every note very clearly.And the best part is the LFE channel. I tried the dolby 7.1 channel test (video in youtube) on both the Beats studio and the Bose QC25 and guess what.....the Beats headphones could not even produce the LFE channel sounds at all where as the QC 25 totally nailed those effects. The 10.2 channel effects tests also sounded awesome. I can listen to my music and not hear any noise from where I am (usually a subway or a commuter train). I can listen to the most subtle instrument played and enjoy my music. QC25 is very reliable and sturdy, just to check them i tried to twist the hadback almoy 90 degrees and nothing happened. they are very light weight, i use for 4-5 hours at work and i do not feel i have something on my head.The only reason I bought Beats instead of Bose QC15 earlier was because I am a bass lover and the QC15s are not the best for bass. But the QC25 totally conquered that area too! The bass these produce is quite amazing. I am off to return my Beats Studio headphones! The Bose QC25 headphones are too good to be true! Definitely another masterpiece from Bose!

p2708

VNot an audiophile per se, but I happen to enjoy my music and have a need for good noise cancellation, regularly working with an air compressor and sandblaster. These were bought to replace/work alongside a set of Shure SE215's (that I now just keep in my handbag for on the bus.) I have to say that the Bose's cancel more noise, but are a little susceptible to vibration when you fall asleep and rest your head against the headrest whilst on a plane wearing them. I wear them also in the studio against the aforementioned industrial noise and they work great, better than the Shure's which I used to pair with a set of ear muffs over the top. And of course, nothing beats them on an actual airplane (while you're awake!)That is, aside from one little quirk. Lets say you're on a US Airways configured plane, and your headphone jack is on the end of the arm rest and sticks out into the feet-well area, leaving your cable a little bit prone to side-passing traffic as people the shuffle past to the corridor. The alternate configuration, on say, oh, perhaps something like a Qantas flight, the headphone jack is in towards the seat area, pointing towards your own hips from the side of the arm rest. My partner and I managed to shear both our pins from our cables on a single 'US Air' flight, rendering both headphone sets useless for the rest of the trip, whereas I'd been on and off many 'Qantas' flights with no incident. (Unfortunately Italian airports did not yet carry replacement cables.)Which brings me to an appreciation of Bose's customer service experience, for which I give them another ***** (5 stars) and big Thank You for replacing both cables under warranty. That was much appreciated.And so again, fellow travelers, be careful of the pin that goes into the jack when traveling. ALWAYS pull the cable out before moving out of your chair, or you might leave part of your pin in the jack on the plane...

VFive EFFECTIVE Stars! One Year Later: still one of the very best sets of headphones available. These very comfortable white and silver-colored QC 25 Acoustic Headphones use Boise's active "noise cancelling\u201d technology which is applied by ouching a switch and also has passive noise canceling in low noise environments. They are advertised as made for iPhone, iPad, iPod and have pivoting and swiveling headphone cups. The headphones expand 2 inches on each side of the headband for users with larger heads, or have more hair, if possible. They are powered by one AAA battery which provides for up to 35 hours of playtime and beyond in the case of unpowered use. Some characteristics areaa; internally marked Left (L) and Right (R) headphone cups, "on/off" switch on the right cup, padded areas where the headphones touch the ears and head, ear cups which are made of very soft material and can pivot inward to form a smaller side-by-side storage profile to fit flat into the nicely-appointed, zippered Bose case. It also comes with a 58 inch long audio cable with one end specific to the Bose headphones and the "L" end for plugging into the transmitting device or plugging into the airline seat audio feed using the provided 2-pronged black plug (which has a compartment in the zippered carrying case and room for an extra battery.In a room with a loud radio playing, the noise-canceling feature cut the sound by more than 90% of the original sound which makes it actually "deeply-reduced sound" instead of being totally "noise-cancelling" headphones, but again it certainly cuts the unwanted sound/noise way down.On listening to different music genres, there is a very wide frequency response with an unadjustable booming bass quality to the lower end of the sonic spectrum and clear, sharp upper spectrum sound. The sound quality must be adjusted, outside of the capability of the headphones, by using the transmitting source equalizer or pre-am functionality, if available. The stereo separation is sharp and the sound quality is high, revealing some music sounds that were hidden or masked when listening to normal speaker sound across the room. When listening to music, the noise dampening feature is still in effect, playing music while lessening sounds outside of the headphones.These headphones come with a specific blue-colored audio 58 inch long cable which has a volume control pod near the user's hrs chin area that includes a microphone, separate up and down volume buttons and telephone center call "off" button.These are excellent headphones are smaller than many headphones used on home audio systems and outstanding for reducing noise or listening to music or receiving phone calls. Bose quality audio product. My Highest Recommendation. Five QUIET Stars! (I pair of Bose QC 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, 58 inch long headset to transmitting source audio cable, a two-pronged jack for Airplane audio plug-in, included AAA battery, and zippered soft protective carrying case. 1 year warranty for original purchaser.)

V***Update 3/10/15While I still find the noise cancelling performance of these headphones outstanding, they are no match for a couple of toddlers who over the course of a 5 hour flight find the accommodations of a 767 confining yet acoustically pleasing for shrieks and screaming.***Update: 9/5/14Checking the Bose website, it appears my distress about color clash can be avoided via customization of the headphones at somewhat of a cost premium.***Eventually, I may talk about something relevant in this review ...or not. Right now, however, I'm trying to decide what might work best to remove salsa stains from the textured white/gray mesh carrying case. I've only had these headphones for a short time and I guarantee you it will not take a forensic team to find my smudged fingerprints. I don't know who the comedian was on Bose's design team but beyond the challenges I will confront in keeping headphones and case clean, I can see where folks with some of the crayon colored iPhone 5c's are going to look like a Mardi Gras float as they walk through an airport. Even with my device's boring black otterbox case shielding me from obvious derision due to the clash with the blue plastic body, for those with the pink or green versions I can only image how special the contrast will be. I know, if I had shelled out the additional bucks for the 5s I would have less to whine about. These headphones may be a slight for users of non-apple devices but the real aesthetic joke just might be on those of us who took the cheaper of the iPhones copout route. Nevertheless, I just might fly somewhere this weekend just to profile as these surprisingly lightweight headphones will not be ignored...on any level.The real deal here is "what is the audio performance and how effective are these headphones for noise reduction?" and in both cases these headphones excel. Across a moderate range of musical formats (jazz, R&B;, classical, rock) there was not a single instance where I was left wanting with respect to tonality. I didn't detect any hint of distortion in any quality track. For those who demand brain rattling bass tones this headset may fall a bit short but I prefer a balance and found them preferable to models from other manufacturers where the low end is emphasized. As far as noise reduction is concerned, I wouldn't suggest walking around in areas where sensitivity to environmental conditions is paramount because you're not going to hear a stray sound with cancellation activated and music playing. For dedicated noise reduction only, external sounds are muted significantly but not eliminated.The adjustable headband works well for me at the lowest setting and is expandable by an inch and 3/8ths on both sides so even the most inflated heads should be comfortably accommodated. The soft cushioned camel colored ear cups fully envelope the ear. I find them comfortable over extended wearing periods, although measuring only 3 ¾ inches from top to bottom with an internal cup of 2 ¼ inches, the larger eared of the listening world may find them irritating over longer sessions. From my inquiries of others, there doesn't appear to be any hint of bleed issues with the ear cups, either. Foldable into a configuration to fit a conveniently sized storage case, the left headphone features a recessed 3.5mm jack for attachment of the audio cable and is removable when the only objective is noise reduction. The design of the jack seems to reduce the probability of cable damage. A dual output jack for airplane use is also provided.The right ear cup has a hidden slot for insertion of an AAA battery (rated for 35 hours in the case of an alkaline battery, 28 hours with rechargeable NiMH), and also is the side where the noise reduction on/off switch is located. When powered on, a discreet green lamp is illuminated does not appear so intense as to potentially annoy other passengers. Audio playback is possible in powered down state although there is a distinct difference in sound quality, like you couldn't decide whether to listen to the performer or attempt to suffocate them with a nice thick pillow.The slightly over 4 ½ ft. cable has controls for audio adjustments with some iDevices and houses the microphone. I had mixed results with an IPod 4th generation and iPhone 5c. I could adjust playback volume and answer incoming calls however I was less successful in getting fast forwarding and track switching to work. I felt voice quality of the microphone phone was very good while listening to myself over a call to another mobile device. The manufacturer notes not all controls will work with all compatible iDevices let alone other smartphones.So, all things considered, while a revisit to the classic look of the QC15s might have been my preference I'll find a way to keep the Cheetos stains to a minimum and maximize my enjoyment of a superior competitor to the "Beats" of the music world. It will take a while to determine how durable they turn out to be but at initial investigation the overall build quality appears to be solid.

VIf you are familiar with Bose equipment then you know what to expect - quality. Quality sound, fit, comfort and use. This may sound like a marketing ad but I really do love listening to my music with these headphones.First is Bose construction and quality. The head adjustment itself is smooth and tactile but solid and along with the over the ear cushions make these headphones so comfortable. I don't feel any pressure at all. And even though they are sturdy and well made headphones they are also very light.Without the battery or noise cancelation turned off you will notice very little external noise. With noise cancelation turned on it's like being in another world. It's amazing the difference it makes; it's like a brick wall is formed around you. Be careful you might be singing too loud! You can barely hear your own voice.The headphones are universal; the cable can be removed and replaced with one compatible with other devices. This one came compatible for Samsung and Android devices. However, the controls do not work at all with our Kindle Fires. It does pause and start music on our iPods and MacBook Pro. For about $25 you can get the compatible cable which includes microphone to answer phone calls. But really, these headphones are so good I wouldn't want my music interrupted!Noise cancelation is turned on and off with a little switch on the right side. Bose systems do not have sound adjustments but with some songs you may notice slightly less base with noise cancelation turned on which I actually prefer.Overall, I couldn't be happier. The sound is what I care about. Having the ability to control the device is a nice feature but not one I rarely use.

VGreat update to QC15s
p2735
sg5
VA friend had these headphones for a review, and was nice enough to lend them to me for a week to see what I thought. I have owned the QC15 headphones, the SoundLink around-ears, and the AE2i headphones. I also have a half dozen or so cheap over-ears of various makes that I use for recording. My go-tos are SkullCandy Aviators.I found the QC25s an improvement over all the other Bose I've used. First, the noise-cancellation is just great. The real reason to get these headphones is the cancellation. The previous Bose I've had were fine, but these are far, far better. I noticed no hiss, no distortion, no real change in frequency of the source sound. I was really impressed, even when comparing it to older Bose headphones. And, crucially, they still sound great with noise-canceling off.The headphones were very comfortable as well. They were good for wearing for at least a couple hours, unlike the QC15s, which I found to be irritating after an hour or so. They were maybe a little less comfortable than the AE2i, but that's a pretty high bar.The sound was great, but like all Bose, the bass was boosted significantly. Most people like this. I prefer something a little flatter, but I can't fault the Bose sound, either. The bass boost was particularly useful for spoken content, which was clear even in noisy conditions.The headphones come with a nice case, into which they fold up very nicely. The cable is detachable, which I think makes them last much longer. They also come with an airplane adapter, which I suppose is a nice touch. There are two version of these headphones, one for iOS and one for Samsung/Android devices. The Android version controls do NOT work with iPhone.

VFirst, I am a music junkie... I have bought countless ear buds and headphones for my android and apple devices through the years... always on the search for better sound.  I listen to mostly rock and classic rock...so keep this in mind when reading my review.  Most digital music is highly compressed to start with, approx. 90% of the data is lost during compression to device format, vs. a CD.  So its quite impressive such good sound quality can still be had by these devices... however, improving on sound quality for in-ear devices has limitations.There is some incredible ear buds for $50 - $100 that deliver sound quality almost on par with these headphones.  However, they are ear buds...they require very little power to produce sound, as the bud is soooo close to your ear drum.  Good for reduced power drain on your device, but, bad for your ear drums.  Also, with ear buds, since the sound is so close to your ear, certain sounds can become overwhelming, while other sounds appear to soft.....this is a consequence of having the source so close to your ear drum, its just the physics of sound fall-off, .... then, the buds slip in and out of your ears constantly, changing the sound profile...the cord can get yanked, jerking them out of your ear, or changing the direction they face in your ear... all in all... ear buds offer the smallest size listening apparatus, with the biggest sound, for the lowest cost... .PERIOD!However, not everyone enjoys ear buds, I am one of those.  I much prefer headphones for both comfort and I prefer the sound NOT so close to my ear drums.  But to generate equal sound volume to your ear drum with headphones, the power draw required is significantly greater, as sound volume falls off by the inverse of the square.  This is significant.  In the past, makers of headphones had to limit volume, otherwise the device would have its battery drained too fast, and customers would reject such a product.  So while I have bought many pairs of high end "device" headphones, one thing they all lacked was volume... if u don't like it loud, this is a non issue.  However, loud is not "head banging loud" with these devices, instead, its just normal kind of loud.  So while I "like" many of the headsets I own, including several Bose models, (Bose has been hit or miss with me with all their products in the past)  ....  they ALL lacked in volume... so it was a love / hate relationship for me with headphones for devices.  Till now.....The Bose Quiet 25 raises the bar, and IMO is the top-of-the-line listening apparatus for devices.  Bose engineers seems to have thought of everything with the Quiet 25 headphones... here is what I love about these headphones....1)  Volume - is as loud as any ear buds, as they use a single AAA battery in the headset to provide the added power required to raise the volume without compromising sound quality and draining the devices power!  The battery is NOT required for use, however, the volume and sound quality is noticeably less without the on board AAA battery.  Battery life is in the 30 hr range, and has an on/off switch on the headphone.  A green light advises u its switched ON!  Not only is the volume louder with the battery power on, the sound profile changes from old fashion stereo, to more of an arena feel.  SUPERB!!!2)  Sound Quality -  with the battery in and powered on, the combination of added power and noise cancellation.... it simply provides the BEST and loudest sounding quality sound I have heard of any device listening aparatus... hands down!!  I am spoiled for life!!!  While good ear buds can match the volume, they can not match the range of lows and highs, as the buds are simply too close to your ear drums....so that added 1.5 inches of distance makes all the difference in this regard!3)  Noise cancellation -  under the right circumstances, its very effective.... ur mileage may vary with this...but its the most incredible technology...not perfect, but very helpful.  For example a kid screaming next to you on a plane, u will still hear the scream, assuming its short.4)  Comfort -  most comfortable portable (device) headphones I have every felt... love them.  On par with $300+ headphones for audio systems (non device type).  Super soft leather around your ears with deep sockets so  your ears are not smashed.....speakers set back far enough that gives the sound an arena like sensation!5)  Cord is plugged into the headphone via standard jack.... ever yank the cord by accident?  You will not ruin your expensive headphones, as the cord will simply pull out of the headphones vs. being severed.  Also, it comes with airline adapter as well...6)  Cord controls -  Finally, Bose got it RIGHT!  Yep... full music control, pause, song advance, song reverse, fast forward, rewind...and with the same 3 buttons, it serves as phone answer, switch caller, hang up, etc.  Of course, the volume control is also the top and bottom button.... so 3 buttons do a lot... so u have to learn the sequence to achieve all the possible functions, but its kinda intuitive.  Controls were always better on Apple devices, but NO more, Android users are now on par, or have superseded Apple controls on the cord.7)  Appearance -  these headphones are expensive, and they look expensive, ultra modern sleek design with very high quality materials.8)  Ergonomic adjustment -  super easy left / right height adjustment with detents (click movements) to hold the desired position.  The top has a super soft foam to avoid pressure on the top of your head, specially for those with shaved heads, or balding.... ultra comfortable.9  Carry Case -  superb, leather like, small footprint, made to carry and protect your investment... a very high-end look.Well, I can't seem to find a flaw with this headset ...it has has every feature I always previously bitched about for device headphones through the years... Kudos to Bose design engineers for making such a high quality, WELL DESIGNED product for Android users.It's not just me...the 5 people I let try these....were also blown away by the sound quality and comfort.....UPDATE -  If you leave the switch on, the battery will drain fast.  When the battery drains to low, the sound will click on and off.... the fix, you turn the switch to OFF, and it resumes to continuous sound.  U will crave having a replacement battery, as the sound improvement with that battery is greatly missed when the battery died.

VEscaping Cubicle Hell...
p2769
sg5
V(First four hours)I just overnighted these out of desperation due to increasing less than considerate and clueless office cubicle neighbors. Mail clerk dropped them off at my desk during a conference call, and immediately skipped customary unboxing ceremonial procedures, and switched them out from my ear buds. The transition was eerily comforting, granted I went from a ten dollar pair of earbuds to my first set of noise canceling headphones. The radio behind me and the high pitch gossip giggles across the hall were immediately silenced, not just deadened but actually gone.Main reason I chose the Bose over similar models was the fact they can be used without the battery and the cord has the inline mic/remote. I wanted to go bluetooth, but didn't get a good feeling based on reviews and specs from different models. Plus I am accustomed to have the remote controls in line with the cord. Also, the size factor was important. Beats, Samsung, Plantronics comparable models all seem ridiculously huge, like its a status symbol or something.One odd thing about using them to take a phone call, I couldn't hear my own voice over the noise cancellation, so I had to switch it off and move an ear cup whenever it was my turn to talk. Proved to be a little awkward during a conference call, but imagine this will be a non issue during one vs one calls.After my conference call I had notes to write, so I turned on a White Noise track from my Spotify and was able to turn the volume down really low and found a sweet spot....In short, these are worth the extra dollars if you have the funds. I am sure they are great for music and travel too...

VSixth Bose Product But Had To Return
p2781
sg5
VI really am sold on most everything Bose that I've bought over the last ten years.  I recently got the Bose SoundTrue and love them.  I paid substantially more ($290) for the Bose QC25 and loved the comfort, audio sound, and build quality.  But for the past month or so, I have to take them off after a half hour or so as the pressure on my eardrum starts to get a bit painful.  I know Bose says it really isn't pressure, per se, but I do feel it like some others do.  Most people do not have this problem.  After I don't use them for the rest of the day, my ears recover.  I try the next day and they start the pressure again.  Some of the electronics magazines say that is why Bose has a  30 day return policy.  My retailer gives me 90 days to return them even if they have been opened.  Since I got them, I've read that unless you are really going to use them for what they were designed for (airplanes, trains, office noise) they may be of limited use in your house and might not be worth having if noise-canceling is not a major concern.  I thought everything about these were great, but the pressure was just too much.  I figure at my age, 68, I don't need anything that might accelerate any hearing loss so I will be returning these before the 90 day limit.  My other Bose products (SoundDock, In-The-Ear headphones, and SoundTrue) I would rate tops as is Bose Customer Service.  I have found that by adjusting the EQ in iTunes, I can make my SoundTrues, In-Ear, and my Klipsch Status all sound better.  I hope others don't have this problem, though some do.  These are a 5 star product; but for me I have to give it 4 stars as they just don't work for me.

VI am not the target demographic for these headphones; they cost more than my stereo receiver and I never would have even considered buying them.  That said, my demo may have shifted because these sound so good I\u2019m not sure I could ever go back to plain old earbuds.  The sounds these headphones produce is rich and hits low bass and high treble without being loud.  They are extremely comfortable and fit snugly over the ears without feeling tight, although I will say that given they are padded and fit around the ear, they do start to make me feel hot after a while, but they are effectively earmuffs so that is hardly surprising.The headphones work in two modes powered (requires a single battery) and unpowered.  The unpowered mode produces excellent sound, but in my layman\u2019s terms seems somewhat less crisp.  The powered mode produces a much richer sound and also actively dampens ambient noise.  I decided to stress test this mode by wearing them while I mowed the lawn with a gas powered more.  I\u2019m not going to say that I couldn\u2019t hear the mower, but it was dampened enough that I could hear the music I was listening to, something I could never accomplish with earbuds without completely blowing out my eardrums.  I would imagine that the effect on an airplane would be comparable, and probably filter the bulk of the cabin noise.There\u2019s no denying that these are high end headphones, and I can\u2019t say that they are for everyone.  But if you are a serious audiophile I can say that you will not be disappointed with the Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones.

VVery nice, but is it worth upgrading from the QC15?
p2807
sg5
VI have owned a previous generation of these headphones, the QuietComfort 15, for several years.  They have been fantastic and have met my needs extremely well.  I bought this pair of QuietComfort 25 headphones only because we have need of a second pair in the family, and my conclusion is this -- yes, the QC25s have superior sound to the QC15s, but only a very, very, very little bit.  Should somebody who owns a pair of "15s" upgrade?  No, I certainly do not think the tiny improvement is worth the investment.  Ergonomically, the "25s" have a couple of advantages.  First, they can be stored in a much smaller space -- the case for the QC15s is pretty huge.  Next, the connection of the audio cord into the QC25s is less prone to wear and tear than that of the QC15s ... after a lot of use I have noticed that the cord is fraying just past where the audio jack leaves the headset on the QC15s, badly enough that I have purchased a replacement cord.BTW, you can use the Bose QuietComfort headsets for almost anything.  I think most people think of them for things like listening to music on an airliner, or silencing your surroundings when you are trying to concentrate.  Yes, they work extremely well for those things.  But I have also used them for more extreme activity such as listing to music or podcasts while mowing on my lawn tractor.  We have a small single-engine airplane, and small airplanes can be pretty loud.  My five-year old has used them for the last couple of years to watch Disney videos in the co-pilot seat while Daddy is flying the airplane.

VBought these as replacement for my original Bose QuietComfort 15. I used the original Bose for over 5 years on many international and national airline trips. I passed those down to my daughter and picked this up as a Christmas gift for myself!So how does Bose improve upon something that was already very very good? It did so in the following ways:1. The biggest change is that you don't need to turn on the noise cancelling feature to listen to music. So what, you say? Well, if you are on a long plane ride and you run out of batteries, you are out of luck on the older Bose headsets. But on the QuietComfort 25s, the show doesn't stop!2. The case is a little bit more compact and symmetric than the previous one. Why does that matter? It fits well inside backpacks and or large purses. The inside of the case has a nice holding rack for the airline plug adapter and an extra battery3. The headband has a softer cushion which makes it a bit more comfortable to sit on your head.4. The cushions over the ears are also made of softer material and make for comfortable long-term use. There are times when I use these for over 2 hours straight and they are quite comfortable.5. The cable is a bit thicker than the older one. This means fewer tangles when taking it in or out of the caseBut most importantly how do they sound? Are they an improvement over QuietComfort 15s? I think so, but the 15s themselves were so good that any improvement will be marginal at best. That being said, these sound absolutely amazing.

VON TESTING THE BEST
p2854
sg5
VI used the Bose QC 15 earphones until the ear pads and the head cushion fell apart (about 15 years).  The 25 is definitely a considerable improvement in all ways.  The price is high, but, look, way back when I paid $150.00 for the previous Bose earphones.  These items have never been cheap.My assessment is purposely based upon what I consider an ultimate test -- a monaural disc of a 1952 recital by Rosalyn Tureck playing Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, Books 1 & 2.  With the 15s the middle-to-upper notes sounded rather tinny.  This does not happen with the 25 -- the notes in question have the "woody" sound of a great piano that they should have; also the piano's base notes are much deeper and richer.  I am especially pleased inasmuch as I consider Tureck to be the greatest Bach interpreter of them all, and the Clavier Books are, along with the Goldberg Variations, THE quintessential keyboard Bach.  Other classical recordings sound superb, as well.I will also add that the ambient sound reduction is certainly better.  I tested this by standing next to a rather noisy furnace with the sound turned on, but with no music playing.  The 15s did block the noise fairly well.  The 25s blocked it entirely.I think those who review equipment like this should provide information about the sound source and the kind of ambient noise involved.  As far as I am concerned, those listening to anything other than classical music need not bother to review earphones of this quality at all.

VI've had a pair of Bose AE2 'phones for a few years that I've been fairly happy with, so I got a pair of these new QuietComfort 25's from the local Bose store because I wanted the noise cancelling feature. They worked fine for a short while, then I noticed that when noise cancelling was switched on, the sound started cutting in and out with a popping sound. At first it only seemed to be when the headphones were rubbing against something like a jacket collar or a pillow, but then it got worse and happened all the time, even when there was nothing touching the outside of the earpieces. Switching the noise cancellation off took care of the problem, but I bought these specifically for the noise cancellation. The problem continued to get worse to the point where the sound would cut out completely (no music at all) for several seconds at a time. The Bose store was good about exchanging them for another pair, even though I'd had them for a month, but the second pair I got began doing the same thing after a few uses, so I ended up returning those and getting my money back. With the noise cancellation off, the sound was not as good either; like the high end had been cut off, similar to the  Dolby effect that we had in cassette players from the 80's. On the plus side, these were very comfortable and the earpieces surrounded my ears much better than the AE2's. When the noise cancelling did work, it was very effective... just wish it didn't have this problem, as I would have loved to have continued using them.

VMy favorite headphones I've ever owned!
p2889
sg5
VThese headphones are amazing! They're the most comfortable pair I've ever owned. You can wear them for hours and your ears won't hurt even slightly. The noise cancelling feature is also incredible. Even without it turned on, they still naturally cancel quite a bit of noise because of the seal the ear cups have when you put them on. They don't make you totally deaf of course, you can still hear some muffled stuff. But that's normal and obviously you're not gonna find headphones that make everything totally silent.As for the sound quality, they're amazing in that regard as well. Although I've never owned $300 headphones before this, so I don't really have anything else high-end to compare them to. But I can't imagine them sounding any better.I noticed a few reviews on here mentioning one of the ears going out (usually the right one) either right out of the box or very shortly into their lifespan. I have yet to have this issue (or any for that matter). If you are having this issue, make sure your cable is plugged into the headphones all the way. It's kind of an awkwardly-angled port. It has to make a clicking sound or it isn't in all the way.Anyway, no complaints as of yet. I've only owned these for a week, so unless something goes wrong with them, my general opinion is: BUY THESE RIGHT AWAY! Awesome sound quality, awesome noise cancelling, very comfortable fit, and they feel very durable yet lightweight. I definitely recommend these!

VMy two problems with the QuietComfort 15s have been solved! The sound quality with these is now good, and you don't need battery power to listen with no noise canceling. And so far they seem to be just as comfortable as the 15s after a few hours of use. Additional bonus, the headphone cord is more universal, as it has no custom plastic mold. Nice!I've tried many brands of noise canceling headphones, and they've all either sucked or have been not very good at canceling noise, except for the Bose QuietComfort series. It's really amazing how good of a job these do.And now they've managed to even improve the audio quality enough that I'm using them as a daily set of headphones at my computer when I'm not using them to demo a very quiet and subtle videogame on very loud show floors!As far as I'm concerned, there's no longer an excuse to use anything else, unless you want great sound quality with just a little noise cancellation. In other words, if you actually care about noise cancellation, get these. It's as simple as that.One last thing: the only design thing I'd critique these on right now is they added folding to the ears. I'm a little concerned the cabling might wear out after a couple years with a joint that bends this much, but it is nice to see some good reinforcement in the joint, complete with a channel to keep the cabling centered in the joint so it doesn't get pinched. I'm hopeful it'll last.

VPros: The headphones are great and sound awesome, when they work. Seller shipped promptly.Cons: Failed after only 2 months (possible loose connection in right ear). I contacted Bose and the sent out a brand new pair for replacement (awesome). Took around 10 days to get the replacement. Two months from then, the second pair failed (left ear intermittently working). Contacted Bose on Oct 20th and they authorized a service replacement this time around. Today is Nov 2nd, and the new pair hasn't shipped, I called Bose to verify everything is alright and I'm informed that everything is good, they received the defective pair, but there is no stock available and it won't be until around Jan 6 that shipments go out. Two and a half months to turn around a service call is unacceptable, and these headphones seem to lack durability.My use of the headphones is approximately 1-3hours per day, and they are always stored in the case otherwise. I gave my dad my old QC15's and they still work (after 4 years). My suspicion is that the new way that the headphones fold causes excessive wear and tear, or possibly the soldering during manufacturing has poor quality control. Either way, this experience may deter me from purchasing another pair down the line, given the lack of support and construction quality that only holds up for 2 months at a time. Here's hoping my 6 year old ear buds can hold out until I get the replacements.Update 3 Nov: Called Bose again per the comment. The representative I spoke with this time told me that there is no date he can give me in terms of when the replacements ship, but they are on backorder. I asked if it is possible to go to the store and pick up a pair to use and return within the 30-day "trial" period and he told me that I would have to call in to Bose to do an RMA, and that Bose will not accept open package returns. So as it stands, I have paid $300 for about 4 months use of headphones, I have no idea when I will receive the replacements, and there is nothing at this point that instills confidence in me that the "new" headphones will even work longer than 2 months. I will update again when I receive the replacement pair.Update 11 Nov: I received my replacement set. Seems to be brand new instead of the refurbished set that customer service told me I would get. I am upgrading from 1 to 2 stars because this is well ahead of the January estimate I was given initially. At this point though, I went ahead and purchased a set of AudioTechnica M50x's and they surpass the QC25's on every level, except noise cancelling. I'm sticking with those since they are only half the price, I don't have to worry about batteries, and sound much better overall. My new plight is that I can't resell the brand new set I just received from Bose back on Amazon because that is a right reserved by only a few authorized retailers. This is something to keep in mind for anyone looking to purchase in terms of later resale value as you'll have to turn to Craigslist/eBay/etc. or settle for the (current as of 13 Nov 2015) $180 Amazon credit and take the $120 hit, assuming they are in perfect condition.

VI am going to give this product 5 stars despite having to send it back for a defect connector that was place crooked in the l-shaped rubber housing, that is, the end you plug into your device. I returned this set in exchange for the very same item. I love the clear, concise, balanced sound of these headphones. That defect was just one of those things that is a rare case, so no big deal. And I also have a pair of Klipsch Bluetooth Image One headphones that are also awesome. They are on the ear rather than over the ear like the Bose, so sometimes I need over the ear phones as I have cervical disc damage that leaves my neck up to my ears in pain a times. So now, I have the best of both worlds. Now to my own fault of missing a detail, I thought the Bose were Bluetooth. But they are not. I wish they were. However, the sound is so good, even without Bluetooth, I still rate them 5 stars. I have had Bose headphones before. These are made even better, more comfortable and sound just awesome. I am a heavy music listener and I also write to music, so good headphones are paramount to me. I realized different sets of human ears hear differently, some hear more detail, some less. So really, you have to just try some sets to see what your ear picks up best. For me, my Klipsch Bluetooth Image One and these Bose QC-25 sets are both great and balance out my needs for both kinds. Happy hunting for what suits you best. I hope this review helps

p2930
sg5
VIf you travel by plane often, you will see many people using these or Bose's previous model as the de-facto standard for noise-cancelling headphones.  The good thing about these vs. the prior generation set is that they can be used as normal headphones without the need to invoke the noise cancellation features and/or the need to even have a battery.  I'm in Afghanistan and use them as standard headphones with good dynamic range for music, movies, and gaming.  I usually leave the noise cancelling off unless the constant drone of helicopters landing next door get on my nerves.  Then it's heavenly.  The NC circuitry is quite extraordinary, and will drown out almost all unwanted noise.  Sound quality improves as well when NC is active.  Audiophiles will appreciate the dynamic range but if you want utmost sound quality, then different headphones way out of the price range of these is what you want.  I personally think the sound quality is very good.  Bass is not as strong, but all ranges are nicely balanced and very crisp in quality.  The design is understated and refined.  Very very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.  I have not used them on a plane yet, but other reviewers seem to swear by them.  If my experience so far on a busy/noisy base is anything to go by, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.  I think the price is also very good compared to what these things used to cost 10 years ago.  Very happy with them.

p2954

VAlthough we are not frequent fliers, we do make about one long trip per year, often to Europe, and the engine noise is stressful and very tiring. A friend on a recent flight had a pair of Bose QC 15's, which she raved about since she was in the military and made countless flights. I decided to take the plunge despite the very high cost. The QC 25's are very comfortable, light weight, fit snuggly over the ears and come with a very sturdy and compact carrying case. Tried them out with our riding lawn mower. The lower frequency roaring was effectively cancelled out and the higher frequencies reduced considerably. These are much, much more effective than both ear plugs and headphones. And I could listen to my mp3 player at normal volume levels. We are very impressed. One can use an external player without the cancelling turned on (e.g. no or dead battery) but the sound quality is a bit muddier. Best to use the SC mode to provide great bass and clear, crisp highs. We bought a pair of QC 15's (discontinued by Bose) from Costco a week after buying the 25's. Same sound cancelling performance, similar comfort but slightly different fit on the head and somewhat larger carrying case. And one must turn the sound cancelling on in order to use the phones with an external player.  We have been using the QCs now while mowing the lawn. We expect both will be worth their high cost on all of our upcoming flights.

VI have been a life long audiophile and luckily for me I have always had careers where I could indulge my interest.  So when I am using a graphic art program at the office a good pair of headphones are worth their weight in gold.  The Bose QuietComfort is most certainly a good pair of headphones with many outstanding features.  It's compact folding design reduces the size of the durable hard shell case making it the perfect size to be tucked away in a briefcase or messenger bag.  The sound quality is superb, of course, and the noise cancellation does a nice job filtering out quite a few annoying background sounds while letting you still be able to hear a ringing phone.  The only nitpick I have is that the plug can be easily partially detached from the headphone causing a mono sound effect, but this is a small complaint.  Although these headphones were calibrated to use with an android device, meaning the inline switch can control the volume, the QuietComfort can be used with ANY and ALL devices but you will have to adjust the volume through the device itself; the inline switch will not work.  If you are like me, most of your listening pleasure is stored on a mobile phone or tablet.  A good pair of headphones can make any high quality MP3 file sound rich and lush, and the Bose QuietComfort is certainly a good pair of headphones by far.  Greatly recommended.

VInitially I thought these headphones are overpriced, but every time I walked by the mall and tried them, I was amazed! I read online reviews and some people were complaining about the sound quality that is not as good as the previous model, or that they are not that loud. After I tried them many times at the mall, I decided to buy them. This was the best decision I could take! The sound is absolutely amazing and maybe it is not that loud compared to other headphones, but this is the point of the noise cancelling feature: being able to fade off the background noise so that you don't have to crank them up and harm your ears. The noise cancelling feature is incredible, I just turn it on without any music playing and I am able to work in a loud environment! You can still hear if someone is talking loud but it does not bother you, and you can always put some music to totally cover it.Another reason I bought them is the advertisement they are doing about how well they work in the plane and I saw many people in the plane wearing them. Well, it is totally true. I fly internationally pretty often and I spend around 15 hours in planes. With these headphones on I don't get ringing ears or headaches anymore! Regarding comfort I can wear them for hours without any problem.I am very happy I got this product and I highly recommend to give it a try!

VLiked my Bose QuietComfort 25 headphones for now 1 year of use.Pros:1) I like the noise canceling technology.2) I like the length of the cord, just the right length.3) Materials are of high quality.4) Cushion on top is great!Cons:1) I always forget to switch off the noise canceling feature, so my batteries always die soon. I bough couple of accumulator batteries, however sometimes I forget to charge them. All of these are such a pain, I think it would be great if Bose will add some sensor that can switch off the battery or at least send it tot sleep mode (I understand there are some technical issues might be).2) After some time your ears start sweating, especially if you are in a room with 75+ degrees (F). It's uncomfortable. Sometime I put some materials, so sweating on my ears become a bit less problem. Is there are a way to solve this? Maybe to use other material, or put some holes with ventilation, but I know that could affect noise canceling effectiveness. Please Bose engineers solve this, that would be so cool!Other than that, guys I highly recommend this piece of engineering. I have AKG K702, Sennheiser HS170 (wireless phones) and Apple's standard white phones. Sometimes I prefer the last, it's good at sound, and has no problem with sweating issues :)Piece! ;)

VThese headphones are absolutely great. Let me preface this by saying that I am not an "audiophile" or whatever these crazy headphone people call themselves. I'm a simple college student that bought these headphones to study with and also to listen to my collection of music. I made a tough decision (for me) against the Beats Executive headphones in favor of these. I had used the QuietComfort 15s before and loved them, but compared to the Beats Executive, they felt cheap. The Executives are no longer sold by Beats, but at one time they were the top of the line product for Beats, with noise canceling and stitched leather and metal finishing. They were on Amazon for $200. I decided on these because of their sound quality. I tested these vs. the Beats Studio in multiple stores. The Beats Studio are currently the only Beats model with noise cancellation. The Beats had a noticeable hiss when on and could be heard even with music on. The QuietComfort 25s are even better at noise cancellation than the 15s. In the end I decided on these headphones and I am really happy that I did. The physical quality of the headphones can definitely be beat by other headphones, even cheaper ones. That being said, the noise canceling feature can't be beat and the sound quality is superb for all my music that I listen to--everything from classical to rap.

p3047

VI have been bouncing back and forth between Beats and Bose headphones.  I must have spent half an hour going back and forth between the Bose and Beats demo display.  Hands down this Bose QC25 is mind blowing...  I never thought I would spend more than $60 on headphones, but the performance of the noise cancellation is... well unheard of.If you have the money to spend to buy these headphones, and you use headphones often, I encourage you to take a listen to these!The first thing I did when I got them out of the box was turn up my car stereo.  I installed the battery, turned on the Noise cancellation, and to my amazement the music in my car dramatically dropped in volume.Start playing music through these, and it feels like you are in a sound proof room with nothing to hear other than your music.These are very spendy, but the durability and performance justifies the cost.  The bass is noticeably less than Beats headphones, but music sounds so much better through these than Beats.  I also think the frame on these are much more durable than Beats.  By comparison, they are more flexible and seem least likely to crack under stress.Now these are not the headphones you would wear doing extreme sports, but they are fantastic for airplane travel, car travel, bus travel.

V Highlights of my Video Review:1.  Beautiful and well made2.  Comes with a great carrying case that is just the right size to fit everything in a nice trim package3.  Comes with airplane jack adapter4.  Cable has controls for volume and to answer calls.  With this model (Samsung and Android Devices) - if you use this with an iPhone 5S then the volume controls don't work and the middle button activates Siri.5.  Great adjustments for perfect fit for a wide range of sizes - extremely comfortable6.  Noise Cancelling feature runs off of 1-AAA battery that is included.  The battery compartment lid is a little on the flimsy side and I worry about it breaking - a little care is needed.7.  Sound quality is great after the break-in, Noise Cancelling works very well too.Note:  I think the unit I have is defective because when the noise cancelling feature is on, if I touch the headset (like if I'm adjusting it while wearing it), the music cuts out.  I don't see anyone complaining about this, so it's probably just mine.  It doesn't happen when the Noise Cancelling feature is not on.  Not a huge issue but because of this and the flimsy battery case lid, I couldn't give it 5 stars.  Love this product otherwise!

VBought for noise cancellation - Love them!
p3057
sg5
VI haven't been this excited about something in a long time. I checked this out on amazon but since they added shipping costs with a week delay but the cost the same everywhere, I drove down the street to my local best buy and picked one up. I work from a home office apartment and am surrounded by so much outside noise (!) that it has been driving me crazy, literally, while I try to concentrate. I couldn't go on but then remembered how the engineers in my work office used these to cancel out the noise around them. I have known this for some time but the cost seemed out of reach. Heck with it I decided whats worth more than my peace of mind? These filter out almost all the underlying lower frequency noise (like air conditioners, pool filters, people talking etc) though you can still hear bits.The sales rep said it's also good to have some music on low as the ear is trained to hear higher noise frequencies and will be drawn to that and away from the high pitched noise outside. Works like charm and makes the music sound great too. You only need 1 AAA battery for the noise cancellation and then plug cord into laptop, ipod etc. Make sure the connection is tight or you'll only get one side coming through.Why did I wait so long to get these??! Such an improvement to my day.

p3074

VThese headphones came with a case that has an elastic pocket big enough for an ipod, or phone, but not an ipad.  The case is hard enough to protect, but soft enough to fit easily into a backpack or bag.  Also included is a cord with an inline microphone for calls, another connection for airplanes that might connect differently, and a battery.I haven't used them on a plane; however I have used them with a saw, nail gun and other construction equipment less than twenty feet outside my window.  I couldn't hear any of them when I had the headphones on and I think they are probably louder than any plane.I listened to many different kinds of music and I could really tell a difference.  The music that really convinced me about the difference was university bands.  The drums were clear and it was even possible to tell the different drums.  It was also possible to clearly hear the drumsticks keeping rhythm.  I also listen to recorded books. They are clear and distinct.I really like the convenience, the sound, and the comfort of these headphones.Edit - My kids, who travel more than I do, were here this weekend and they really like the inline switch which controls volume, but which is where you control the noise canceling feature also.

VAmazing Noise Cancellation For Traveling & Great Audio Quality Overall
p3085
sg5
VI am a business traveler and spend most of my life on planes and in hotels. I am also somewhat of an audiophile (I rip all my music from CD to Apple Lossless). The noise cancellation on a plane is phenomenal as well as in noisy areas like airports.And possibly even more important is the comfort. They are very light, fit my ears perfectly and don't make me sweat. I wear glasses and they are very comfortable with glasses.I came from a $400 set of Beats headphones (won them for free at a company Xmas party). The Beats were heavy, had poor noise cancellation, poor sound, were very uncomfortable with glasses and made me sweat.What I also love is that compared to the Beats, these QC 25s are compact and they lie flat in the case. The case is great because it carries an extra battery as well as an adaptor for older planes that have dual prongs. The case is also very slim and is super easy to travel with.They also work even if the batteries die, but the batteries last a long time and the battery compartment is pretty easy to use.If you travel a lot, or just want great noise cancellation and great audio quality, these are the headphones for you.

p3096

VI have been waiting a different color version of Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones apart from Black/Grey and the White version. I would lile to mention that the first impression is amazing. Triple black is a color in between gloss and varnish. The headphones look amazing on the outside. The package covers a very nice protecting case, the headphones, airplane jack, a battery for noise cancelling function and its original black wire. I am using an Iphone 6 Plus. I am downloading musics both from Itunes or I am uploading from my personal library. Therefore, the sound quality varies from one to another. However, the noise cancelling function does not. It simply cancels the noise all around you. You can even get an idea about this function before putting the audio on by simply the turning the green button on. The noise lessens to a great extent and disappears immediately once you start listening something. In the making of making a comparison, I also have Beats Studio 2 and AKG Quincy Jones on Ear Headphones. Both of them are quite amazing headphones and I am quite happy with either of them. However, the noise cancelling option puts QC25 one steap ahead of these two ones. Dont even think for a second and get it by putting aside all your doubts.

VNot a huge fan of the price, but it does what it says. Flew on a plane, and while you could still slightly hear the noise of the plane, I'd guess it was about 1/40th of what the actual sound was. The flight attendant actually had to tap me on the head to get my attention because I could't hear her from 6 inches away when she asked if I wanted something to drink.I haven't tried the ear bud version of this that bose sells, but keep in mind that one has a battery that can not be replaced, and I find that unacceptable for a $300 item. The one advantage I would say ear buds have is if you watch netflix or whatever on your tablet while lying down, you can sleep on your side and watch. You can't do that comfortably with these headphones (though it's still not that uncomfortable).To me, the price is worth it, particularly if you fly or you're around loud noises a lot. Or maybe you just want it for the holidays so you can have some quiet time while the family is all over at your place. These headphones work, and they work well. The only real question you need to be asking yourself is if you will get $300 worth of use out of them, and that is something no one can answer but you.

VThese Will Make You A Believer in Noise Cancellation
p3144
sg5
VI just bought the competing Harman/Kardon version of these headphone. They'll be here tomorrow. But today, I was shopping at Target and saw the Bose QC25 on demo so I thought I'd give them a try. First, all these noise canceling headphone are hideous. They look like those giant jogging headphones from the 80's. Didn't Anchorman have a pair? Second, the noise canceling REALLY works. The demo pair I tried was by 50 TV's in Target, all blasting tv shows really loud. I thought there was no way the Bose headphones could block all that out. I was wrong!!! The noise canceling is superb.Frankly, it was kind of peaceful. Like this moment of zen in Target. Just complete absence of noise. I have to admit, I thought noise cancelation might be a gimmick, but it's legit.I also tested the Beats Executive series with noise cancellation. ALL the reviews you've read stating that the Beats headphones buzz are ALL true. The Beats headphones buzz non-stop, even without any music playing. So Bose is the clear winner here.If the Harman/Kardon set isn't as good as the Bose, I'll definitely return them and get the Bose, even though I got a Warehouse Deal on the Harman's for $170 ;)

VBefore I tested these, I thought noise cancelling headphones were just an expensive auditory scam..... I have always wondered what the "noise cancelling" headphone phenomenon was. I mean, don't all over the ear headphones muffle noise while providing sound from the speakers?  Well, yes, but that's not the key to noise cancelling headphones.These Bose noise cancelling headphones are remarkable.  They emit a series of sound waves that neutralizes background noise frequencies.  I tested them in an airport and on a plane.  Without them, there was significant background noise.  When I put these on, it was slightly muffled.  Then I flipped the switch and turned them on.....quiet.  blissful quiet.Not perfectly silent, but SERIOUSLY reduced background noise.  There is a feeling of a little increased pressure caused by the sound waves that cancel.  Some might find it an adjustment, but I didn't have a problem with it.These are expensive, but now I know why people rave about them.  I cannot speak for any other noise cancelling headphones, but these really are impressive.If you can afford it, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

p3183
sg5
VMost comfortable over-the-ear headphones I have ever owned.  The soft cups totally enclose my ears without squishing and I do not get that familiar headphone fatigue that comes with the sideways pressure.  I prefer this type to buds as my ear canals get easily irritated.The headphones attenuate outside noise to a remarkable level.  The only residual noise appears to be a low-level high-frequency sound say from air-handling equipment in the environment.  You are still aware of your surroundings.My wife recently spent a night in the hospital ER for treatment for a migraine. I put these on her and switched on the noise cancelling sans the detachable cord and she managed to get to sleep and let the drugs work.The audio is very good.  They can be driven very nicely by a tablet and PC speakers and were exquisite off my Sansui G-5000 receiver (Better than the pair of legacy Pioneer headphones I have).  They come in a well-designed padded zipper case for travel.I will leave the audiophile and engineering analysis to the experts but this is quite a well-performing package of noise-cancelling and headphones, $300 notwithstanding.

VI received these headphones as a Christmas gift from my parents and instantly loved them. I am not an audiophile, but I listen to a lot of Audible books, Beats music, Youtube videos on my iPad and these headphones are amazing. It's a great experience to turn them on and shut the world out. It's my first pair of noise canceling headphones and all I can say is that I love it.Our laundry room is on the second floor next to our bedroom and few days ago I had the dryer running late at night; after a few minutes I lifted my headphones to check that it was still working, because I couldn't hear any background noise. And yes, of course it was.I also like that I can use regular (aaa) batteries to charge the headphones. My father has a previous model which uses a proprietory rechargeable battery and he says it takes a few hours to charge them.My headphones feel light and comfortable and I can wear them for hours without even being conscious that I am wearing headphones. The microphone is build-in and therefore I can also use the headphones for FaceTime calls - the speaker quality seems to be very good, too.Finally, I love the colors.

VThis is my first set of Noise Canceling headphones despite logging about 1 million miles of travel. I'm generally happy with these.The good:- small size case. Some people complain about the case size but I don't have a problem with it. It easily fits in my messenger bag with my laptop, tablet, e-reader and light jacket.- sound is okay. Not great but not terrible. I can use it with or without NC active and the NC definitely cuts down the drone of a highway road trip or trans-oceanic trips.- comfort is good. I generally don't like headphones for long periods of time. They generally hurt my ears/head. However, these were comfortable for the 4-6 hours at a time.The bad:- cord. This is really disappointing given that I haven't encountered audio cutouts from the cord for years or using my iPad/iPhone. On the return of my second trip with these headphones, the audio started to cut out. I was able to turn the cable where the jack meets the headphone to restore stereo audio. It only happened a few time but it was annoying and I now worry about this problem getting progressively worse with use.

VA worthy successor to a worthy noise cancelling headphone
p3236
sg5
VI have a couple of QC-15 headphones which have accompanied my wife and I on numerous *really long* International flights over the years, and we consider them essential travel items as they are both comfortable and make it actually possible to use the airplane's entertainment system - or an iPod/iPad - for 12 hours or more.  You can actually hear what you're listening to in comfort, with Bose QC headphones, and not simply listen to the annoying combination of the noise of jet engines and the air rushing past the cockpit intermingled with the faint whispering of whatever it was you were actually trying to listen to!  The airline-provided headphones are simply no comparison.Anyway, I recently acquired a pair of these newer QC-25 headphones, and while I have yet to take a long flight with them, I can say they're definitely and clearly improved.  The case is flatter and easier to stick in the back of an airline seat, the overall headphones are thinner, more comfortable, and the quality of the sound is higher.  Overall, a truly worthy upgrade to the venerable QC-15!  Now I just need to buy another pair for my wife...

VWish these were wireless. Thought they were but no. Weight perfect. Noise canceling perfect. Sound quality pretty good. Problem wired. I bought these because I got Beats Studio 2.0 as a gift and thought the Bose were better. Wrong! The Bose is way better in noise canceling no question about that, but if you are playing something not so much. Sound quality is better  with the Bose if you are comparing wired vs wired connections. But if you compare the Bose wired connection to the Beats wireless connection there is no clear winner. Beats are optimized for wireless. It is the controls and wireless that makes you buy Beats. No cord , volume up, down, mute, fast forward, back, All on the ear phone easy to find and reach. On the Bose on a small cord up down and mute  good luck finding it. I really wanted to find the Bose superior because I thought I wanted noise canceling most but after hours of listening I found the Beats the better value. If you are looking for quite only buy the Bose. No question they reduce background noise better. But I bought the Beats.

VWell worth the $100 upgrade
p3254
sg5
VLike many new owners here, I previously owned the Bose QC15 and just upgraded to this new QC25. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. This is another great quality Bose product. Personally, i find that the sound and overall noise canceling performance is just slightly better than the QC15. The biggest difference for me though was the design. I wasn't a huge fan of the original QC15 design... Looked very plain and the silver resembled too much to their old home theater systems which I find quite outdated now.The QC25 is a lot more stylish. The blue mesh with the BiG L & R printed on the inside of the ear muffs  help you quickly distinguish between the 2 sides of the headphone. Very clever design. With the QC15, I always had to look for the small printed L & R letters before putting them on.So you might ask, where did the "$100" in my headline come from? So here's the story... I posted my old QC15 for $200 on craigstlist, and was lucky to find a buyer within 3 days. After the sale, I immediately bought these. For a mere $100 more. I couldn't be happier with this upgrade.

VThe noise reduction and the sound quality.together make a big difference.  As I listen to these headphones now in a Starbucks in find myself enjoying a story from selective shorts and various pieces of popular and classical music.  I never need headphones at home per my hi end sound system.  At home I do not have all the noises of the road. I am sure other headphones I have from Sennheiser have a better sound in a quiet place.  It is just that that place is not available outside of the home, work or a Hotel room.  These headphones are nearly as good and the noise reduction allows me the means to enjoy the music when the rest of of the world chimes in too much around me.Issues to consider, not much heat buildup.  They are compact enough to sow in a backpack but not a suite.  They perform best and as intended with noise reduction on.  With flawed records of out music, you will notice the weaknesses on the recorded music more.  I would not walk on the streets wearing such effective noise reduction technology; use in a coffee shop on a train or at work and such.

VGood for noisy environments
p3283
sg5
VI had compared it with the Samsung (wireless) but decided to go with this based on the many reviews.I sometimes work is a very noisy environment, so I wanted noise cancellation. After careful research I finally bought this. It works great for just noise cancellation and for music. I would rate it 4.5, not 5, because of 2 reasons.a) Batterly life - I actually got maybe 6.5 days (x 8 hrs) use out of 1 AAA battery.b) Ear sizing. It's still not large enough to cover my ears (and I am average) so after 8 hrs of wearing it, my ears are somewhat sore.Both of these are common problems with other headphones as well, one reason I bought these are because it's bigger than say the phillips headphones I had earlier. I have seen bigger earphones at work. The cable is too long and not coiled, so I tuck them into a shirt or jacket pocket.In a noisy environment, you can still receive and hear phone calls clearly, but the noise will make it difficult for the other person to hear you when you use the microphone, so really you have to leave that room to talk clearly

VOverall fantastic, comfortable noise-cancelling headphones
p3294
sg5
VIf you're looking at these headphones, there's a good chance you're looking for the perfect noise-cancelling headphones. After months of research and trying them out, I can confidently say these are the ones for me.The sound is crisp and really doesn't require any "burning in". The bass is resonant, and music is clear, as far as I'm aware.The noise-cancellation, on the other hand, is fantastic. The best place to test these is on flights -- as soon as I wear these, I immediately fall asleep, comfortably listening to my music while barely (and I mean, barely) hearing the plane's engines. Thankfully due to new TSA regulations, you can now wear these during the entirety of your flight.The adjustable headband is comfortable, and can be easily be worn for long periods of time. While the weight may be of concern to some (196 g), I believe it is negligible enough and similar to its competitors.Overall, these are a great pair of headphones. If you are looking for good, noise-cancelling headphones, look no further.

VThe king of noise-cancellation headphones
p3300
sg5
VI have had this headphone for two weeks and I can't find any fault with it so far.You will learn to appreciate how good the noise cancellation on this thing is. Granted, it won't block loud dialogues spoken near you, but when you are on a plane or a train or in a crowd with background noise, put this headphones on and you will be able to enjoy your music in a silent bliss.It is very comfortable even for listening up to 6 hours straight. The battery life is not that bad, and you can generally enjoy up to three days of normal listening. The concept behind using one AAA battery is that you can easily buy a replacement battery at a convenience store if you ever run out of battery during travel. For home users, I recommend rechargeable Panasonic eneloop batteries.If I am forced to report one thing I don't like about this headphone, it is the non-glossy plastic feel and the mesh texture at the top of the head band. It kind of gives a cheap feeling, but I think it is used to make the headphones light and comfortable on your head.

VMy dad and I both purchased the QuietComfort 25. I use mine almost every day and for the price of $300 bucks I take EXTREMELY good care of them! I always fold them back into the case carefully and take care of the cord. After less than 2 months my pair just one day stopped working on the right ear, the side which must be folded to be put back in the case. I was so upset that my dad let me use his while we sent mine in for replacement. After less than another 2 months of use THE EXACT SAME THING happened to my dads pair! Thanks to the warranty Bose has sent us replacements with minimal hassle so I give them 5 stars for their customer service, but the product design (including the storage) of these headphones is absolute garbage. I am a professional musician who listens to everything from classical to rap, and travels on airplanes frequently, I would say that the bottom line noise cancelling and sound quality of the QC is comparable to the Sennheiser PCX450's. Unless Bose improves the build of their product I won't be buying from them again.

p3339

VI really wanted to like these, but I wasn't so lucky.  I even paid for the super fast Prime shipping cause I was excited to get them.When I turned on the noise canceling these was a very high pitch sound that was barely audible.  It kinda sounded like when you leave on a CRT TV with the source set to Input (I'm sure this will make sense to someone :)  It also felt like I was in a high elevation.  After about 5 minutes of use, I started to get a headache which lasted for a while even after taking off the headphones.It did cancel the sound of talking and TV really well though, so it worked as advertised.I guess these just aren't for me, such a bummer.  I've ended up returning them.

VNot Comfortable at all
p3345
sg5
VThe QC25 headphones are not very comfortable to wear for a long time, as the ear cushion pieces aren't big enough to cover my ears - they are just directly pressing on them. After a while, my ears start to get warm. Also, I think the bridge arc is too narrow, and it makes the headphones very tight. The combination of these 2 problems makes the experience unpleasant. If I were to adjust the arc, the ear cushions would slowly slide away from my ears (again, because they press on the ears, not covering them).I don't know about other happy users of the QC25, but the noise cancelling function is very annoying and uncomfortable. When it's on, (and I have to adjust the ear cushions so they "barely" cover my entire ears; otherwise some noise would still "leak in") it feels like my ears are under water with tremendous pressure.I had tried the QC15, and they certainly didn't feel like this. I cannot recommend these QC25 headphones.

VGood Sound/Noise Canceling But Some User Issues
p3351
sg5
VReplacing an old pair of Bose QuietComfort 2 headphones which sound quality remains but because of less than perfect design, the plastic parts of the headset broke after a couple years. I have glued and taped them with electrical tape and use them only at home.The design of the 25s did not improve on this weakness which disappointed me. Because of this design, I would counsel anyone who buys the 25s to handle them very gingerly when taking them in and out of the case. After a couple years, check closely for stress cracks in the headset parts. If any appear, glue and/or tape them up. As far as I know, Bose doesn't sell individual parts for replacement. Re the 25s, I use these for flying travel. I do like the noise cancelling quality which continued from the QC2, and the quality of the sound is good. One slight drawback of performance for the 25s vs the QC2s is that the plug-in into the headset is not as secure. It detaches too easily. The QC2 plug was more secure. Overall, I am glad that I bought the Bose replacement.

VSo, I was super hyped by all the positive reviews, and couldn't wait to have my mind blown...meh, it didn't happen.Let me just say I have a pair of NC Panasonics and another of AGPtEKs, and while yes, the QC25s are superior ONLY in SOME categories (noise cancelling [A+], and volume[A]) in other categories the grading was actually the same (range, sound quality, crispness, fidelity).The bottom line for me is, if I'm going to spend 300 bucks on something this small, it better blow away the competition by a long shot, not just slightly...slightly is not worth the extra 270 USD!!...yes, you read that right, these are 10x the price, but deliver 1.1x the wow factor.Aesthetically they look great, but I was looking for sound quality not aesthetics.All in All, these are OK, but definitely, in my opinion not worth 300 bucks.If you travel a lot you may consider paying the premium for the Superior Noise Cancelling...I don't, so I sent them back and will do something more productive with the $$.

VThere is honestly so much that can be said about Bose and the quality of their products, they have honestly always been at the top of the game. Nevertheless, they have always been worth much more than the actual value from other brands like Sony and Phillips. But nevertheless, they do just as strong of a job at getting the sound well when it comes firmly down to the quality of their electronics. This set of headphones is absolutely no exception. This set of noise cancelling headphones, which operates nicely via bluetooth with smartphones, and Apple Iphones. But honestly, you do get a sound which you do get sound that sincerely rivals what other brands like Beats by Dr. Dre sound like overall. What I do not like though about these headphones though is that they do not work the classic Ipods from Apple, and overall could've also been wired as well. Nevertheless, if you love Bose electronics, than you'll absolutely love these headphones.Price: C+Quality & Sound: B+Overall: B-

p3368
sg5
VHaving used these for some time now, I'm delighted with their performance. The difference in perceived noise on flights is remarkable. They seem to cancel noise even more effectively than previous Bose models. They're comfortable on long overseas-length flights. It's hard to imagine how others travel by plane without this technology, although I can understand if the price puts people off. In truth, I can't easily afford them, but I make room in the budget because they're simply essential for travel. I tend to adapt to major shifts in time zones much better than most. I credit part of my resilience to the welcome silence produced by these headphones. One star off for poor functional design of the carrying case. Hard to believe Bose is so unsophisticated or penny-pinching on this high-end product that they couldn't be bothered to figure out what practically every traveler would need. The absence of a small, fifty-cent pouch attached to the lid to store an extra battery is an obvious and hard to justify flaw.

VI had the original noise cancelling Bose headphones and really liked those.  On a trip this year the headphones died and never came back to life.  Knowing I had some long flights coming up over the summer I picked up the latest headphones, the QC 25.  The noise cancelling is great on these, as it was on my previous model.  I can't say I noticed any improvement in the noise cancelling but I wasn't looking for any improvement over my last ones as they were already very good.  I'm still not 100% happy with the music sound on these, compared to my original Bose headphones.  The sound is good with regular music but they seem to struggle more with Heavy Metal and Hard Rock.  The base sound seems to be bit off and I find myself having to turn up the volume more to get better sound, then I did with my other Bose headphones.  The QC 25 does seem to have better clarity as I can hear individual instruments more clearly on these than other headphones.  It is just overall, the sound isn't what I was expecting.

VFirst off, fantastic sounding headphones. Great sound quality and the noise cancellation is terrific.My problem. The jack that connects to the headphones themselves. While listening I noticed that my arm caught the cord only ever so slightly and the music cut out completely in the right ear. The headphones themselves didn't even move out of position. I thought I just didn't have them in all the way and after attempting to push it in further it became apparent it indeed was in all the way. Some research online turned up some YouTube videos of the exact same problem where the slightest touch of the cable knocks out the right ear and you have to just faintly push it in again.Sorry, I'm not going to constantly do this not for $300 pair of headphones. If you're not moving and just sitting or laying down listening to music they're fantastic but soon as you start moving forget about it even just walking with them in bumps it out.Returning them tomorrow for sure.

VI bought these headphones yesterday and will be returning them today. I am BEYOND disappointed. I have been a loyal Bose consumer for a long time, and these do not measure up to previous products they've produced. Yes, the noise cancelation is impressive, and YES they are comfortable. If those are the only two things that matter to you, then these are perfect for you.However, the sound quality is very tin-y and you have to turn them way up in order to even get a half way decent sound. Once you've turned your volume up to about 80% the sound leakage is ridiculous. Sure, you won't be able to hear the sounds around you, but someone sitting next to you will hear every note and every line of your song... Embarrassing if you feel like entertaining that side of you that has a sudden need to rock out to KE$HA.Minor thing: If the cable isn't in the exact right spot on the headphones, the sound will buzz and cut out.These are not worth the money, sorry to say.

VThis is not one of those good sounding earphones out there, certainly not for its price. A couple headphones in the $100 range would easily surpass this in terms of sound quality, but who buys a Bose for that?I personally don't use this headphone that much. I usually use a Audio Technica W5000 or a STAX system at home, but none of these would perform in noisy conditions. I also have a couple portable ones like Sennheiser IE80 and Beyerdynamic T5p, but those don't work well in certain circumstances.That's when the Bose comes in. I fly international long flights a lot, and Noise Canceling headphone is a must for me. You just can't find a better headphone to use on flights than this Bose. I previously use a Bose QC15 and QC20i until I lost them. This QC25 just takes it to the next level. It's got similar comfort like the QC15, but the noise canceling is on par with the QC20i.So if you find yourself in noisy condition quite a bit, definitely consider this.
