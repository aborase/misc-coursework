VI looked at all the reviews for these headphones and there's an obvious trend. People who give them positive reviews get insulting emails and negative replies to the reviews, plus the reviews get a ton of "not helpful" votes. Why is this? What is everyone so afraid of?  People with negative reviews get a pat on the back from fellow Monster haters, and positive reviewers are treated like pariahs. It's simple - these headphones sound great. They are not all plastic, as some have claimed (making an all plastic headphone is impossible.) The "guts" of the hinge and ratchet mechanism for adjusting the size are stainless steel. I've yet to see plastic coils anywhere. Read the negative and positive reviews - you'll see the trend. People with negative reviews claim to know the manufacturing cost, always have "better" headphones, and the reviews sound similar - to the point of being scripted. People obviously despise the Dr. Dre history (that ended years ago) and seemingly over-priced cables.  Many of the negative reviews are by people that admit to not owning or even using the headphones! Use common sense. Don't listen to the headphones on your iPod when the EQ settings are for your in-ear headset.I tried these with my THX certified computer sound card and my 7th gen Nano. Both sound fine. I have a couple of pairs of in-ear Sennheisers, and these sound just as good.  No, I did not measure the frequency response, and, no, these have not been broken in yet.  If you try a pair at a retailer, you can pretty much take it for granted that they were played way too loud, way too long without being broken in. So that's not a fair test.  I listened to classical, rock, dance, opera, you name it. These headphones are designed with bass in mind. If your iPod has the EQ preset, you may have to adjust it. I know I did. I had the EQ set to "dance" - with that setting, the highs were harsh and the bass overdone.  Setting it to "none" cleared that right up.Real-world examples: Carmen Suite No.1 was difficult to listen to. The highs were way too shrill. Turned off the "dance" EQ on the iPod - perfect.  Brahms Hungarian Dance 5 - 3/4 volume, iPod Nano 7th gen. Way too loud - but still sounded great.  No distortion, crisp.  Rob Zombie's Dragula was too shrill on the default EQ setting and at 3/4 volume deafeningly loud. 1/2 volume, much better all around. Would sound better with less high end, the bass was fine. Living Dead Girl sounded fine. Sticking with the iPod and 1/2 volume. ZZ top Sharp Dressed Man. Noticed many new aspects to the song I had not heard before, especially in the high symbols. Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Relax. A little too much on the high end. Cyberfunk Music Group, Believe (my favorite jogging song) was perfect. Oak Ridge Boys, Elvira. Quieter, a little tinny. Rocky Horror, Timewarp. Kick butt good - and that one has a lot of highs and lows! Continuing to browse my iPod tracks, Mumford and Sons, I Will Wait - perfect. Laibach, B-Mashina - also great - perfect highs and lows. The KLF, What Time is Love? - sounded great. Hugo Montenegro, theme from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Great. Even the very high notes. Fun, Some Nights. Perfect. Evanescence, Haunted. Sounded even creepier than I remembered. The Doors, Riders on the Storm - amazing. Dethklok, The Lost Vikings - again, sounded great. Rammstein, Fauer Frei - surprisingly, a little light on the bass. Queen, I want It All - a little mushy. Pink Floyd, Pigs - sounded great. Jean Michelle Jarre - listened to several pieces, and all sounded fantastic. Jarre wants his stuff played on high end equipment - he even makes the most expensive speakers in the world. No, I'm not saying these compare - I'd have no way of knowing - but this is the best I have ever heard Jarre, period.I could go on. Wagner, James Brown, Herb Alpert, Handel, the Beatles, heck even Devo, Daft Punk and Lmfao. The point is, they all sounded good, most great. I listen to almost anything - the key is the EQ settings, and that's true of any headphones.  With a totally neutral EQ setting, these are the best sounding headphones I have ever heard.  Most people won't be playing Rob Zombie, followed by Wagner, then Rammstein and Jarre.  If you listen to a specific genre - rock, classical, etc., you should set your EQ accordingly. Play a variety of music? Find a happy medium - I found this to be no adjustments at all.Do they look cheap? That's a personal preference. Some people buy a car because it's a pretty color, others because of the performance. As I'm writing this, the headphones are sitting next to me, still at 1/2 volume from my 7th Gen Nano. They even sound good a foot away from me. The headphone pads and head pad are soft and comfortable. They are light (they weigh 6 oz, but feel lighter), but I would not wear them at they gym - I tried - way too "sweaty." The two plastic, fake Chrome inlays on the head rest look cheap. Overall the headphones do come off as cheap looking and too flashy. But that's the style of the thing. Look beyond that to the actual quality of the headphones, the comfort and the sound.The ear pads are not replaceable, so if you tear one it's a problem.  The glossy paint job collects finger-prints - but does NOT scratch easily (I tried.) They fold up nicely, and the carrying bag is a plus. They also block out most of the surrounding noise.Also included - a storage bag with carabiner, cleaning cloth, and two cables. One for non iPods and one with controls for an iPod/iPhone (including a mic for answering calls.) The other cable can also be used to daisy-chain headphones together. Each earpiece has a cable jack. You can connect the cable to either one. You can then connect a 2nd pair of headphones to the other earpiece! Kinda cool to share music while laying around.

VThese are honestly the best sounding headphones I've heard in a while. I've tried beats and thought the bass was too overwhelming. I tried a good pair of sennheisers and thought they sounded great, but didn't like the way they looked or felt. Then I found Monster DNA's and knew these were the ones to get. It's truly an all in one package: DNA's sound amazing, look hella sweet, and they're comfortable as a tempurpedic pillow. And for all the people who rated this 1 star because of the price.. you guys need to relax. They're still dope as hell even if you've "heard better". I'm happy with my investment because I'm gonna be using these every day and I know for a fact that they out perform anything else that I've tried. And the white on black tuxedo style is freakin sexy.

VThese ARE by FAR the best headphones i have ever used, they are stylish, comfortable, versitile & sound great!What else is there? ok, the price.....apparently that & that alone is the cause of the negative review effect. As i would wager that if those who wrote negative reviews had paid a bit less.....then they would be singing a different tune.Yes these are awesome.....they are lightweight, yet deliver heavy hitting sound, great sound definition. They are THE most comfortable pair i have ever worn....& felt so good when i 1st put them on i did not want to take them off.They have audio in plugs on either ear so no more wires across the throat.....nice. Also it comes with 2 plug in wires ensuring you have a plug in for all your needs. And so these work with just about anything.....my PC, Iphone & old cassete players, tablets ect ect...AND the wires are of a higher than usual quality, very unobtrusive...love it :)The earpieces are so soft & cushy it is like they are made of marshmellows. I believe i could actually fall asleep while wearing these.Also it comes with a high quality carry bag for the headphones.....which fold up into themselves for storage.The plug in wires come with a carry pouch & tiny little velcro ties to keep things neat....nice :)Also....the colors are awesome....i got the cobolt blue.Y'know....these will not make you bleed from your ears...but guess what...that works for me....these are JUST RIGHT.Getting back to price, yeah it IS alot....but you do get alot of quality that will provide for an above average and thoroughly enjoyable experience every time you use them for many years. There ARE alot of much cheaper headphones....yet thet are NOT alot of much better headphones ;)

VIf I could give this a lower review I would.  This product is garbage ...for spending over $100 for this product I thought I was buying quality.  The material that they use to cover the padding around the ear is so thin after only 1 month it started to tear. I have headphones that I spent $5 on that last for years and i have never seen something like this before.  I called Monster and was on hold for over 1:30  before speaking to someone. Their best offer was to replace the One Junk for the same junk product.  I tried to explain that the product is defective and provide me  with a refund or a different product that will not break.  I would stay far away from this product.

VDon't listen to the Monster haters. Just because it's Monster doesn't mean the product sucks. For the people who are conscious on their spending: $200 for these headphones isn't a bad deal if you are willing to pay for style. These are worth it especially if you get them on sale for around $170 like I did. If you want to spend <$50, get the EarPods. They have the best price to quality ratio ($25 for sound quality that's worth about $100).The DNA headphones stand out and sound great. Mids and highs are clear. Bass is just right and not overpowering. They have a balanced sound and are on par with the V-MODA M-80. The sound quality of the DNA and Mixr are very similar but the Mixrs have more bass. Additionally, the music sharing feature is also a nice plus and the build quality is better than Monster's Turbine line. The only slight issue I have with it is that the ControlTalk buttons are a little hard to press, but that is a non-factor compared to the quality of the DNAs.The DNAs look cooler and sound better than most Beats headphones. Give these a shot; you won't be disappointed!

VUPDATED REVIEW: I purchased a second pair of these for my son on Amazon when the first pair became unusable after 18 months due to the ear pads falling apart (see picture and original review below).  The new pair was purchased on Amazon and after six months the ear pads are already coming apart! I expect these will be like the last pair and become unusable within 18-24 months. These have great sound but my son uses them daily and they are not designed for durability. Not a good value for $200! I will NOT buy again.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought these for my teenage son last Christmas and he absolutely LOVES them! There has not been a single day that goes by that he is not using them. He uses them for listening to music on all his portable music devices (phone/ipod/tablet).  It works well with his iphone for taking calls and listening to music. Works with his iphone, android tablet (Nexus 7) and with his laptop (Alienware PC). The only downside and why it is 3 stars instead of 5 is because the leather around the ear pads is falling off and the hing to collapse them broke so it does not lock into place. These issues do not prevent the usage but is disappointing from a quality stand point. I wanted to send them in for Warranty service but I lost the original receipt and Monster is not accepting any warranty service repair without the receipt from a "Qualified Reseller." I bought them at Best Buy but that does me no good as I lost the receipt.

VOn second set which is also defective - different defect than the first. The warranty policy, which I am now dealing with, confirms the low quality of this item by only being 1 year from original purchase and 30 days for replacements within 1 year from original purchase. Since I am 1 year and 1 month, they will send a 3rd set as a courtesy but with no warranty.  Two defective pairs with different defects offering a 3rd and no warranty - no thank you. Pursuing other options for a refund. For those curious, 1st defect was within 45 days of purchase, 2nd defect was within 3 mos of low to moderate use.  (Yes, I took a little time in placing the 2nd warranty replacement thinking I had a year from receipt date of the 2nd pair.)  1st couple of pictures is the original headphones, 2nd is the replacement.

p59
sg5
VI purchased these headphones for about 75 dollars during the Black Friday sale on Amazon.  I'll be writing this review without the benefit of any burn-in (the benefits of which are still dubious).  I will be comparing these to the Beats Solo HD, Ludacris Soul (available for around 70) and the ATH-M50 (available for around 100).  The DNA, Beats, and Soul are all on-ear headphones while the ATH-M50 is over-ear.  I include the M50s in this review because it's the one that is recommended most on audiophile sites for budget headphone consumers.I am a very amateur audiophile who has begun collecting different headphones and so will be giving my non-expert opinion.I was not very optimistic that the quality of these headphones would be anything impressive considering the poor reputation of Monster Beats headphones.  However, since the headphones were available for about 1/2 the price that it's normally available, I decided to make a leap of faith.Build Quality:  As soon as I unwrapped them and started handling them, I realized they were on a different level as the Beats.  The build quality is much higher than the Beats; while the Beats can creak when you handle them, the DNA has no such give or creak.  The plastic seems very solid and not as flimsy as the Beats.  It has a similar build quality as the Soul, which also has a plastic body.  The ATH-M50s beat all three in build quality though.  It seems more solid than any of the fashion headphones and there is virtually no creak or bend to the headband.Lows:  I would say that bass is the reason why most people would buy these headphones.  They are NOT for audiophiles who like a neutral or flat sound signature.  The bass comes off strong and punchy, although muddier than I would like and tends to overwhelm the mids and highs.  The bass is about as clear as the Ludacris Souls, though it is tighter than the Beats HD, which sounds to me as very dirty and messy, though probably more impactful than either Souls or DNA.  Again, M50s are the most neutral in this category; its bass doesn't overwhelm the highs or mids nearly as much as the others in this category.  However, the M50s also have less "punch" and you don't feel the vibration in the jaw nearly as much.Mids:  I think the mids here are the weakest part of these headphones, as in the other three.  The Soul's mids sound clearer than the DNA, though the DNA isn't awful.  I would say the mids here are very comparable to the Beats.  They're loud but can get muddled and lost and it is difficult to differentiate different instruments in this range.  While the M50s have less punchy bass, the mids are much clearer.Highs:  the highs are pretty great and aren't drowned out by the bass.  It handles highs better than the Soul or the Beats.  The highs twinkle and are clearly differentiated from the rest of the music.Conclusion:  While the M50s are the clear winner with my listening tests, the DNA holds up well.  I think they compare well to the Souls, though probably would be useful for different music.  While Souls would be better for hip hop, I think the DNA would be better for EDM music.  The M50s are a great middle of the road compromise for people who listen to all sorts of music, including jazz, classical, etc.  The M50s have the best sound signature, but are also the least attractive, imo.  If you're going to get a "fashionable" pair of headphones that you'd like to travel with, I recommend either the DNA or the Souls.  The Beats are far too expensive for the price, and I don't think any of it really is an improvement over its competitors.So:for travel:  go with Souls or DNAfor home use:  go with ATH-M50for all genres of music:  go with ATH-M50for EDM;  go with DNAfor hip hop: go with SoulsPS:  one awesome benefit to these headphones is that it features an extra headphone jack so you can share your music with a neighbor!

VThis was the first pair of "expensive" earphones that I've ever purchased at the $150 price point. I fell in love with these when I compared them to other brands and models in the store. After purchasing the Black and Rose Gold pair I continued to fall in love with the way they looked and sounded. The design is extremely comfortable and the sound is amazing!! After every use I cleaned them with the wipe cloth and put them away in the great velvet bag that Monster sent. I was shocked one day to take my earphones out to use them and discover that both ear cushions have completely peeled away from the ear plate disc. This happened unexpectedly and right after my earphones were out of warranty :( Upon calling Monster customer service I found out the ear cup parts can't be replaced and they won't do anything for me. I'm really bummed about this entire thing and I'll never purchase another Monster product.

VIt's pretty clear that Monster is aiming this product at users of portable music devices (iPod, iPhone, et al.) who are looking to "move up" from earbuds to something that will provide them with "better" sound that's stylish and portable. In this regard their production and marketing strategy is similar to that of Beats by Dr. Dre, which is not surprising either, since Monster manufactured that product line beginning in 2009. Now that Beats has not renewed its agreement with Monster, the Monster folks have developed their own line, but decided not to compete directly with their former partner. As Business Week reported in January 2012, Monster CEO Noel Lee "is targeting athletes, women, business professionals, and others who haven't yet been persuaded to spend hundreds of dollars on headphones." The anonymous author of Wikipedia's entry for Beats assumes that is also an "older demographic."Full disclosure: I am not a female, not an athlete, not a business professional. Although I am part of the "older demographic," (probably older than Mr. Lee's new target demo) I am also a classical musician and an audiophile. I'm going to keep this report as objective and useful as I can, but bear in mind that I'm not the shopper Monster covets.I compared these headphones with two other personal listening devices in my home: my reference Sennheiser  HD 600 Open Dynamic Hi-Fi Professional Stereo Headphones (Black) and a pair of Klipsch Image S4i - II Black In-Ear Headphones (earbuds) that I use when I travel. I also own Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone with Dynamic Bass and Surround Sound, very convenient when I need to move around the house. But I didn't use those for this comparison, because I figured the HD600s and the S4 earbuds provided an adequate range for simple evaluation. I used the headphone output from my OPPO BDP-105 Universal Audiophile 3D Blu-ray Player and my first-generation iPod for source material.The Monster DNA headphones are attractive and seem durable. They are easily folded for storage in the ultrasuede-ish, lined bag provided, and could presumably be stuffed into a purse or shopping sac for easy transport around town. When I expanded them to their largest size, they accommodated my fairly large head, but only just. The pillowy earpads don't completely cover my ears; instead they rest gently on them. All of this suggests that female consumers are the focus. Monster provides two short cables with 1/8-inch miniplugs. One is meant for an Apple device and includes a built-in volume control, mute button, start/pause, track skip, phone answer/hang-up. The other cable can be used to connect directly to a headphone amp or music player, or to share your sounds with another headphone user -- you just connect one end to your cans and the other to your friend's. (The DNA `phones have two cable terminals, one on each "ear.")Sound-wise, Monster DNA is a mixed bag. The `phones offer an easy load, which probably helps when you're connecting to an iPod. If you are connecting to a headphone amp, you'll probably want to reduce the volume. It's LOUD. I found that even after I had reduced the gain so as to make a reasonable comparison with my Sennheiser and KIipsch gear, the DNA `phones still created an impression of higher SPLs. That's because the bass, especially mid- and upper-bass regions, is boosted considerably. This adds a familiar punchy or percussive quality to bass lines in typical pop, rock, or jazz tracks. You may like that. The boost is engineered skillfully enough so that it doesn't bleed into vocals, which would give singers a boxy or darker sound. But it does make everything seem louder and superficially more lively. I preferred the more natural bass of my Sennheisers. When I checked for bass response on the Klipsch S4s, incidentally, I found that acoustic bass lines were still quite "there" and clear, but they lacked the oomph of the Sennheiser bottoms. The Monster DNA excels in oomph, both real and concocted. You could say their Squid Platter comes with extra tentacles.I found that it could also sweeten some harsh high-frequency sounds, for example sustained violin pitches that on the best playback equipment can sometimes sound strained. So for casual and/or lengthy listening, especially to mp3 files on mediocre playback gear (and the 50-cent DACs in iPods make them a fairly mediocre playback system), these Monster DNA headphones might be a good choice.Quibbles: In spite of the trendy, Apple-esque packaging, there's no user manual, not even a simple plug-it-in-here set of pictures. Good thing it's not hard to figure out how they work. There's no 1/4-inch plug adapter either, which for me was slightly more annoying. Also, these babies won't keep out much environmental noise, because the pads aren't big enough to cover your ears. And, as I mentioned, the cables are quite short -- not a problem for iPod users, but otherwise, your headphone amp had better be right there on your desk. Finally, the big question: are these really worth $200?If you've decided to move up from earbuds, it would make sense to check out competitive gear like the Grado Prestige Series SR80i Stereo Headphone before taking the Monster plunge. You won't get a cool carrying bag, but you will get more accurate sound -- if you like that sort of thing -- at half the cost.

VI'll start by saying I am not some music fanatic who can tell you how much bass and treble and whatever I am hearing through the headset. BUT I do love my music and have been using various renditions of ear buds and over-the-head sets, and haven't been knocked out by any of them. They fall out of my ears, slip off my head, and hurt my little ear sockets after a while. The Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones knocked my socks off.The sound is amazing! And outside sound is really well muffled. I wasn't expecting that, so it's a totally added benefit. I can slip them on at work, plug them into my computer, and I DON'T hear all the chatter...I listen to my music and can write without the usual distractions. I was surprised that they also fit right into my Ipod Nano and Ipad too, so they're usable.I'm really pleased with these and highly recommend them.

I have several headphones form Ludacris, soul, 50 cent's streets, Bob Marley's, V moda , V-80, true blood edition.Bose and quite a few others. I will say I'm no audiophile expert but I love good quality headphones. I like to hear the highs crisp and clear and the mids smooth and the lows with a nice bass punch. Now with that being said if one is looking for a well balanced sound weather it's classical, blues, jazz,  r&b;, pop, rock, or hip hop you can't go wrong.  In closing I have one word for the headphones kudos....

VI am EXTREMELY happy with this product.  Brought it 2 wks ago from Apple store, from where I bought by Beats SOLO HD, in last Dec.  So the Beats were is-under warrenty and the company is generous enough to replace the Solo HD red twice.  I am v happy with Beats customer service, so folks want to get good customer service, Beats is certainly a recommended one.  Also I request others to see too much into this statement, means, I do NOT intend to mean customer service with other brands are any worse.  I am just merely expressing my expressing my experience.I read the 1-STAR reviews, I have issues with those reviews.  How somebody brands their products or positions their positions are Merketeering theory, NOT on the Production COST.  The PCs (laptops), those are <500 dollars to buy.... takes somewhere between 40-70 dollars to produce.  Let's NOT get into that.  Pricing 101:  Production cost is a v small part of the pie in order to price a product.  Having said that, some products creat the HYPE, others NOT.  V rarely v CHEAPLY priced things creats the HYPE...!!!  So go figure....  and good luck.Now let's get back to the review.  I tried this product (Monster DNA) with other 200.00 dollar worth products, namely Beats, B&W;, Bose, Senheiser.  And keeping every other things Non-variables.  Means same song, same 'gain' in my iPhone, same part of the song for 10 mins.  I was amazed that DNA OUTPERFORMS all of them.  In Clarity, Resolution, Sound Imaging and NOISE- Canceling.Then I went to the other table in Apple Store, where all $300.00 and up headphones, so-called professional headphones are.  This 200 dollar-DNA OUTPERFORMS them, PERIOD.  In all the above categories!My only surprise were that it was BETTER that B&W.;  B&W; is a mighty audiophile company & v well-respected world-wide for making speakers, a lot higher quality speakers than Klipsh.  Senheiser, I expected better, because their mics and headphones are their best products.Some people brought Sony headphones in the equation for comparison.  Sony was NEVER a audiophile speaker company.  They sell everything, if they can.  i am sure they would NOT mind put a stamp of SONY in Watches and Cars too, if they can...At the end, I tried this one, after listening a 12 yr old's recommendation, who had Beats, before they split up with Monster.  And this 12 yrs old has value!  Kudos to him.  This DNA is a genuine product and hook you up to audio, be is music or movie in laptop or wherever.  Enjoy

VHighly disappointed in these headphones and customer service. I purchased these in May 2013 and the ear pads are tearing at the seams in 3 different places. I take very good care of my headphones and I'm disappointed that they have ripped already, with no outside trauma to the pad. I called customer service and the warranty has expired and they don't sell replacement pads. They are really stylish and the sound is good, but will not purchase from Monster again. Would rather shell out more bucks for a higher quality product with a longer lifespan.

VThe sound is beautiful but the quality of the headphone's material itself is the bane of it.This is so disappointing. I bought these for Amazon's Black Friday, November 29. They came Nov. 30 thanks to the beauty of Amazon Prime and I was immediately enamoured by their simple yet bold aesthetic. I noticed that a part of the headphone came off but I remember seeing earlier in a Monster DNA review video by EPICSKATENYC on Youtube where he provides the ultimate stress test by basically being really violent and careless with the headphones and that specific part came off which he snapped back in with ease so I thought that part coming off was fine.So I thought.That part would repeatedly come back off so I always handled my headphones with care. They provide great sound quality and this is my first time buying headphones that are a bit more higher end- this is a reviewer who would use Skullcandies before. Yeah, forgive me. However yesterday, I took these headphones out of their included pouch and once again, that part came off by itself. I thought that it was fine so I tried to put it back in, but one of the headphones completely detached. I was a little worried so I set it down carefully and tried to put it back on.. and it unfortunately would not click back on. I took a closer look at the part and it turns out the reason why it would detach from the day I got it was because some of the grooves that help the part lock into place were chipped. -__- And now it wouldn't attach at all because it somehow got chipped again!If this thing had this issue that I failed to notice from the very moment I got it, either I was sent a defective pair or this thing was so fragile, it was damaged while being delivered! I am SO disappointed because it is not even the end of December yet!I have only had these headphones for SIXTEEN DAYS. 16 days!! Two weeks and two days and this thing has already failed me. It's so sad because I think the quality of the sound it provides is BEAUTIFUL! Maybe not as bass-heavy as I'd like it to be, but nevertheless, beautiful. Yet I already have to return it because it broke on me. It's VERY comfortable too and has a very attractive and unique look- I'd easily receive compliments from total strangers whenever I adorned these on my head. I could wear them for hours with no ache and appreciated the 1-inch adjustability of the phones especially since I am African with natural, thick, and dense kinky hair so that extra space is necessary for me to enjoy any pair of headphones.I'm not sure if I can get a refund since I no longer have the original box (stupid of me!!) but if I can return this, I am getting a refund, period. Had the build of these headphones been far more durable and could have at least withstood being mailed, I would have easily given five stars. I'm hoping if I have to keep it, Monster will at least have a warranty.5 stars for sound. But ultimately 1 for quality of the headphones' build.I was really hoping all of the negative reviews of these headphones were just the "Paid Monsters Haters" some of the more popular reviews are talking about so I initially took them with a grain of salt but I believe those negative reviews now! My god, even Skullcandies lasted longer than this!Other than the built of these headphones, I do believe they are worth it. However, Monster really does need to improve the quality of the build of these headphones because this is unacceptable, especially to the buyers paying full price for this. I got this on Black Friday so at least I only paid $80, but imagine how much worse I'd feel if I paid $200 only for the headphones to come defective and fully detach two weeks later.EDIT 12/18/13: So I decided to keep the headphones because honestly, the sound is beautiful and the headphones are delightfully comfortable. There is no denying that and I don't like to have a naked iPod so I've decided to keep it.Buyers of Monster DNA, I STRONGLY recommend you consider the risk that some parts of these headphones are sadly quite fragile as my experience has shown. The inner plastic mold that houses the metal part where you can adjust the headphones has unfortunately cracked but because I wanted to keep these and not let them go to waste, what I did was buy some Loctite super glue and fused the plastic mold together.The glue has provided a bond that has truly strengthened the headphones and I know I no longer have to worry about my headphone falling apart. I even did a little stress test.So ultimately, it's really disappointing that these comfortable and beautiful sounding headphones are so fragile, but if you want these, please either be prepared to fix the plastic parts when they come off OR even better prevent this from happening by using some strong glue to seal the plastic shut permanently. The loctite glue I used was so fantastic, I even did a little stress test of my own and the headphones are truly durable now. :DI keep that little bottle of loctite in my headphone pouch just in case, haha!Edit: 3/15/14So I gave the DNAs one more chance after I ended up returning the pair I did my original review on. I'm usually gentle with headphones but my prior experience with these headphones compelled me to be even more gentle. I had the headphones for a couple of months and everything was going smoothly! Then one day, I prepare to put my headphones on my head and I hear a small "crack!" I'm confused wondering what just happened and what I did wrong and I see it: a little crack in the saaaame place my original pair came broken in: the left casing that hosts the metal headband part. I know what horror was to come so I quickly get my loctite glue out and glue it praying the problem doesn't worsen. The next day, despite my gentle and careful use, the crack split and a chunk of that same plastic part outright broke off. I used even more loctite glue and was even considering using gorilla glue because I was so tired of this particular part giving me hell. I contact Monster asking for help with this.. but they ignored me multiple times. Now that I'm putting in this edit, I see that this color has been discontinued which may explain their total ignoring of me.Anyway, the loctite is holding the left part of the headphone together. I'm still pretty disappointed, especially since I gave this pair another chance and the same problem occurred. But its still playing music and the sound quality is still good.Since this is a consistent problem and Monster has outright ignored my requests for help, I think the cons are outweighing the pros and I'm giving one star.

VCoolest kid in the cube farm
p102

VWhen you work in an office, in a cube farm no less, it's vital to have a pair of headphones to drown out the chatter and the ever-so-annoying cubemate speaker phone conference call.  I've been through countless types of on-ear headphones over the years, and these Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones are fantastic.  They're not the cheapest, but they're definitely not the most expensive option on the shelf.  Maybe it's because rappers and NBA players don't wear them, who knows.  I used the two-toned cobalt and gray headphones, and I gotta say, maybe they don't make me look like a rapper or an NBA player, but they do still look pretty cool with my business casual officewear.Pros:- Audio - First things first, these headphones are loud.  Loud in a good way.  Loud like I can already hear my music when my iPod volume is at 1.  And more importantly, I can't hear anything else but my music.  Even more important than that, no one else can hear my music.  Those are probably the top 3 things I'm looking for in a pair of headphones anyway - my music is very loud, I can't hear any outside noise, and no one can tell how loud my music is so they can't tell me it's too loud.  As for the sound quality, they presented a well-balanced sound.  The bass isn't nearly as booming as Beats headphones, but when paired with high-quality mp3 files, the bass, mids, and treble are very clear.- Construction - The most unique feature of these headphones is the fact that they fold up for easy transport and storage.  One of the biggest issues I've had with on-ear headphones in the past is that you don't just want to shove them in your bag or leave them hanging off the strap.  These fold up nicely and come with a convenient storage bag.  They also have a shared audio feature, so you can basically daisy chain two sets of headphones together, which is pretty convenient when traveling.  The headphones are also very comfortable for long periods of time.  They're cushy on the ears and can go the whole 8-hour workday.  As I mentioned above, they're loud, so you can even wear them with one ear off (like a cubicle DJ), and they're still pretty comfy.  One of the two cords has functional AppleTouch controls to pause and FF/RW tunes when using an iPod or iPhone.  The supplied stereo cords are also of the tangle-free variety...a nice touch!Cons:- There's not much I didn't love about these headphones.  It would have been nice if they were cheaper, since I feel like $200 is a bit much, but it's par for the course since you're getting sounds a stylish looks.  The shiny cobalt blue plastic looks really cool, but it's a fingerprint magnet.  The Monster folks are aware of the problem though, and the headphones come with this little piece of fabric to wipe them down with.  It seems silly to have to polish your headphones, but they look a lot nicer without my smudgy paw prints all over them.All in all, I give these a 4 out of 5.  They're sturdy, comfortable, loud, and they look cool.  If they were $50 cheaper, I would have given them a 5 out of 5.

VAs the title states, don't.  I purchased my original pair of DNA's in February of 2014.  Very light use overall, wore them around the office and home, the most intense use during the life of this set was wearing them to the gym on a couple of occasions for lifting.  Keep in mind, I did no cardio on these visits, the headphones were under zero stress other than standard wear.  In January of 2015 I noticed that one of the ear cushions was torn nearly half of the way off on the outside, I took a closer look and realized that they were separating from the rubber insert. A light pull peeled the cushion the rest of the way off.I contacted Monster Support the next day, and after some delays I received my RMA information.  Please note that I had to speak to 3 representatives before I got someone that actually had a clue how to process the RMA.  The next day I shipped the headphones back to Monster, at my cost (expected).  It would be nearly 3 weeks before I received my replacement headphones.Fast forward to today, 7 or so months later.  I have literally babied my replacement pair for fear of having to go through the same process and wait time I experienced the first time.  They have been assigned to home use only, no travel whatsoever, and have had even lighter use than before.  AGAIN, the ear cushion has fallen apart.  Exactly the same way it did first time.I immediately stopped what I was doing and called Monster Support.  After being left on hold for 20 minutes I had to call back in.  The next representative that I spoke with took my SN info and informed me that my headphones were out of warranty.  I initially thought that couldn't be right... but then he explained.  If Monster has to process an RMA on your product and sends out a replacement you are still under the same warranty window as your first product, which in this case was 1 year.  If I had waited to use my replacement pair until mid February or so, which in all likelihood could have happened, and found that they were dead on arrival, Monster would not have replaced them.  They quite literally do not warranty the replacement products they ship out.  Couple this with the fact that they DO NOT offer replacement ear cushions and you basically have a $150.00 pair of unserviceable headphones with mediocre sound and extremely low build quality.Stay far away from this garbage.  I'm so disgusted with this situation I'll no longer be using their cables, either.I highly recommend if you are even glancing at these to go look at a pair of Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's.  2/3 of the price, much higher build quality and sound, and they sell replacement cushions as well.

VDisclaimer:  i DO NOT work for Monster, or Amazon and have NOT been paid for this review.  I am just a customer.I purchased the limited edition "Ink Master" DNA with artwork by well known tattoo artist Chris Nunez (Specializes in traditional Japanese tattoos).  I bought the headphones direct from Monster.The artwork by Chris is pretty stellar, and gives the DNA a one of a kind look that turns heads.  People do a double take while I have them on in the office and the gym.Okay, now for the headphones themselves.I usually get over the ear headphones, but decided to take a chance on these on the ear style.  I am surprised at how comfortable they really are.  I fond I can wear them for a few hours with minimal discomfort.  I have a small head and find most headphones to not fit well.  Not so with the DNA!  They come with adjustable straps that work very well on my small head.  The stainless steel sliders are very sturdy as is the rest of the headset. Additionally, I was pleased at how much outside ambient nose is blocked.  I have a pair of noise canceling headphones and the DNA seems to rival them on a number of frequencies.  I have a trip to Taiwan and will use the DNAs on the flight so I will compare.Okay, finally the sound quality. LOUD!!!!  I find there is no loss with the DNAs, I actually have to turn the volume down... I am not an audiophile, but I know good sound.  The DNAs deliver great base along with crisp upper and mid frequencies.  The sound is crystal clear!  You can tell the difference between these and most other headphone and ear buds...  DNA delivers the sound.Right now it looks like the DNA is going for a hair over $100 on Amazon.  That is a great price for these headphones.  Many folks complain about Monsters pricing as they have premium pricing but sometimes the quality is not worth the price.  I would not pay $200 for these, but at $100 you can't go wrong.  Just be aware that customer service from Monster sux.4.5 stars1/2 star ding for the crappy customer service from Monster.  I tried emailing them and calling them with a question and never got a response.

VThe Monster DNA on-ear headphones possess a custom-made look that you can't beat.  They're well worth it if you want well-balanced earphones with a simple yet gorgeous design.  They also provide an incredible listening experience.  From my first wear, I fell in love with the comfort of the headphones (soft and cushiony).  There's even a cool case to carry and store the headphones.My husband enjoys the headphones as much as I do.  I thought about purchasing the white and teal set for myself.  At the moment, they're a bit costly for my taste.  I guess I don't mind sharing the headphones for the time being.My only objection is utilizing the headphones on public transportation.  Unfortunately, this sort of item is as sought after as the iPhone.  Nonetheless, they'll be greatly put to use in the gym and the comfort of my home.

VI'm not an "audiophile". I'm 70 years old with hearing deficits from listening to loud popular music in the '60s and '70s with headphones. Lately I listen to my music on an iPod Classic and a 2d gen iPod Shuffle using high quality buds. My taste in music is eclectic: '50-'70s Pop, Motown, Big Band, pre-WWII Jazz, Blues, Western Swing, Bluegrass, Native American Flute, some musicals, African American Gospel, and Classic. It all sounds brilliant, clear and detailed with these headphones. The best test for me is listening to Bach Organ music and I cannot recall hearing it so well before.The headphones isolate sound extremely well. My wife cannot hear the music to which I'm listening and I can barely hear that she is talking on the phone in the same room.It came in fancy packaging with an elegant pocket for literature but there was not an Owner's Manual, not that it is too complicated to operate. One of the cords has a switch that allows the wearer to increase the volume by pushing the + sign, lowering it by pushing the - and turning the player on and off by pushing the o. It does not work with all players, does with my Classic, doesn't with the Shuffle.I'm absolutely thrilled with these and can find little wrong with them. However, I have NOT listened to other headphones in this price range so cannot compare them. Perhaps those of you with much time listening to high end stereo systems and high end headphones won't enjoy them as much as I do but I recommend them wholeheartedly.  I recently found a good deal on less expensive Sony MDR 7506 Monitor Headphones about which I've read nothing but superb reviews. I expected to hear how The DNAs were put in their place but was very surprised to find out that I prefer the DNAs. I don't know how to explain it but listening to classical music the sounds were flat through the Sonys and rounder through the DNAs. The DNAs may be less accurate than the Sonys to a true audiophile but the DNAs are more enjoyable to me.Revised 2/21/14:One very significant Con: The cushioned ear pads are small and do not surround my ears but, rather, sit on them and,cause my ears to hurt, badly. The Sony's fit better. DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU HAVEN"T TRIED THEM OUT FOR AN HOUR. I find them excruciatingly painful if worn for more than 15 minutes. Your ears and head may be different. For your sake I hope that they fit well because the sound is excellent. I cannot wear them.

VA friend got these for Christmas and I tried them out. They had been fully broken in, but not overused. The sound was literally horrendous,higher frequencies sounded shrill and unbearable. The bass was also pathetic, and was airy and almost non existent. Also, after being treated lightly, the hinge became extremely loose and noticeably flimsy. Even before this, the fit was atrocious even for over ear headphones, and the cups felt like awful pleather. The pictures really over exagurate the features on these phones, and within 20 feet of these they look like cheap plastic.I would instead recommend the Ultimate Ears line or Grados, you will most definately get a better deal.I would imagine that these cost around 30 dollars to produce. When you receive them you would definitely agree with me.

VI do not like to put anything in my ears so when I had the chance to get these headphones for my Ipad mini instead of having to purchase earbuds, I jumped on it. I opened the box that arrived and everything seemed high quality. The headphones fold which is nice and there is a nice velvety case included. A cleaning cloth is even included. There are two cords. Not really sure what the difference is yet. Probably different devices because there's a tag on one cord that says some features are only available on certain phones and players." Speaking of high quality, the cords are wrapped in some soft Velcro instead of just twisty ties lol. The colors available are nice, but I hope they make pink and purple sometime lol. As far as the sound, I am listening to music right now with them and it works for me. I haven't tested any other headphones so thats why I can't say these are the best. But I am liking the base on these headphones. I think these are kinda pricey. I'd be more likely to purchase these at $100 than the listed $200 but if you can afford these and are an avid music listener, I would recommend these. It would be worth your while to test other brands since you are investing a decent amount of money in headphones but I don't see anything bad about these. They are soft and comfortable as well. I agree that something funny is up with the reviews for this product. I recommend only reading the reviews listed as Vine Reviews. Vine reviews are posted by REAL, UNBIASTED people who own this product.

p142

VAh, the age old audiophile argument over which brands are overhyped. Monster definitely bears the brunt of many of these arguments, with their line of remarkably pricey A/V cables, power strips, and other A/V accessories.  As I am amongst those that don't usually see a reason for paying a premium for Monster branded products, I was skeptical of the claims made about these headphones. I'll gladly admit I was quite wrong. These are by far the most comfortable, well-built, and best sounding headphones I have ever owned.The remarkable part of the sound that these produce is that it feels very much like you're in a large room listening to finely balanced speakers, and not listening to two small speakers directly on your ears. The highs are crystal clear, and the bass is deep and natural with absolutely no distortion. Listening to live performances makes you feel as if you're in the audience. It's amazing. A headphone that can handle classical orchestral music and bass heavy electronica equally well is truly impressive.These phones feel very high end. Nicely built, and fold up for travel in the included suede pouch. The flat cord is velvety soft to the touch and is truly tangle free. The ability to plug the cord into either the left or right earphone is a small detail, but so nice to have to option of switching ears.  The unused side can be used to plug in an additional headset for shared listening.The only feature I have not had a chance to try, is the iPhone capabilities, but will add to this review once I get a chance to utilize the iPhone functions.All in all, I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great sounding, quality-made, portable, and stylish set of headphones.

p147

VDid lots of research on headphones in this price range.  Sony, V-Moda, Beats, Bose, etc...  I tried them all at our local electronics store.  Beats were semi-comfortable but WAY base heavy, almost muffling the sound, and they really leaked.  Bose was extremely comfortable but didn't have enough base response.  They just didn't look like they were built well.  V-Moda was comfortable as well but leaked and weren't really noise cancelling.  I didn't really care for the look of the headphones (I know, not important for sound..)  Sony was one of the best sounding ones, but the pads were really annoying.  Not really over the ear...  Not really around the ear.  Just didn't feel right.  Then I stumbled on these, the Monster DNA on-ear headphones.  I was originally looking for an over the ear headphone, but these were just so comfortable and blocked so much of the outside noise I really liked the fit.  As soon as you put these on the outside noises just seem to go away.  And the pads were the most comfortable out of any I tried, even the Bose.  The sound is incredible!  Stand out highs and mids with a base low enough to feel but doesn't destroy the rest of the music.  These headphones don't leak either.  They are VERY loud, meaning that the volume at 50% is plenty loud enough.  I don't dare turn the volume up all the way, I'll pop my ear drums.  And during base heavy music, the base is tight and solid and does not distort at all.  Very impressive sound response.  The look takes some getting used to, but I actually find them pretty sharp.  They fold up small and travel easily.  I'm glad I took time to research these and feel I made the definite right choice with these.

VFirst, my favorite feature of these headphones:  Jacks on either side, so you can pick which side the wire comes out of.  Maybe that's available on other brands/models, but I think it's absolutely brilliant.  The DNA headphones fold up nicely, which is good for packing them away, and I think will help prolong their life.  They're comfortable, adjustable, and for being my first pair of on-ear headphones, I think they seal out ambient noise (though they are not noise-canceling) very well.  I'm still on the fence about the sound quality.  While using them with my laptop, they seemed to distort bass at low to mid volume.  I haven't yet tried them with my receiver (cord is too short, haven't ordered an extension yet), and maybe they'd do well with a standalone DAC/Headphone amp.  Overall, I'm happy with them, and will continue to use them.  I'll update this review should I get the opportunity to figure out if that distortion is related to the source or the headphones.

VI tried out these headphones and the Dr. Dre's Beats headphones. I found these DNA headphones to be a lot more comfortable on my ears for a long period of time. Keep in mind that these are on-ear headphones and not over-ear headphones, so after awhile, a little soreness is inevitable for most people. The sound quality is great, especially with music that has a nice bass. I would recommend these headphones to someone looking to buy a modestly-priced pair. They are hard to break, but if you have a chance to buy insurance for them, I would recommend that too.They come with an awesome-looking bag to carry them around in. Although this bag is not a hard-case means of protection, I carry them in the bag attached to my backpack and despite being hit around a lot, the headphones have not broken in the year that I've had them.I love these headphones.

VI wanted to like these headphones but after a little over a year of medium use the ear pads have all but torn away.  I wear them while I work but I'm very careful with them, I take them off and put them back on.. In other words I'm not running around in them and dropping them on the ground all the time.For the cost of these headphones they have really great sound and are way more comfortable than ear buds. However, for the price they should also last a few years of moderate use.2 stars for sound and comfort.-3 stars for Cheap design, overpriced, both ear pads falling off and the left rail extension broke and does not clutch.No more DNA for me.

VThe sound quality isn't bad, the sharing/syncing feature is very cool but man are these poorly constructed and there is absolutely ZERO support from Monster regarding their products. I purchased my set at Best Buy and within three weeks the headphone cups began to rip off (very basic use, I foresee this happening to most DNA users..) and after 3 replacement requests I get denied each time.. why? You're asking me... I question the legality of denying a request for no reason but yeah.. I'm stuck.. I wanted to love these headphones, the sound is decent but they are not well constructed, they will break, and when they do you'll be SOL with a company who does not care about their customers. Go with a better set that's half the price, like a nice SONY set. Something that will LAST and has decent customer support. Don't give them your money.

VThese headphones are by far the best headphones I have ever used, especially with electronic songs and songs like Five Finger Death Punch creates. These headphones can also get very loud they actually sound like speakers it's insane.Some Pros:ClearGreat sounding in all genresComfortableVery durableThe cord has never actually tangled for meNoise leakage is a minimum (I've noticed it varies from person to person, maybe the size of their head comes into play?)Mids lows and highs don't overpower one anotherCons:If your ears are shaped sort of outwards these won't be comfy for over an hourish of usageEvery person I have showed these to has loved them, even a beats lover has said these are better. And one has ordered a pair. Great all around!

VI was reluctant to spend this much on headphones but these are well worth it. Besides, they were a better price here than on the monster site. I Am impressed with the comfort, the noise cancellation and the sound. I know there are critiques out there who say otherwise and use lingo to sound as if they are sound engineers or something...but bottom line is if you are a regular person liking to enjoy your music...monster DNA are excellent.

VI wanted a headphone comparable to the Dr. Dre Beats but at a little less of a price. They have excellent sound quality but if the volume is down just a little bit you can still hear things around you which I really do not like, so I usually have to have the sound up fairly loud. They are very comfortable and do not bother me to have them on all day which I normally do for my job.

p215

VI honestly expected more for the money.  I purchased these from J&R in Manhattan (before they unexpectedly closed their store).  I liked the design and I wanted something different, because everyone in NYC wears BEATS headphones.  The sales person at J&R told me that these are the same headphones as BEATS, but sold by Monster.  She explained that Monster actually manufactures the BEATS headphone line.  So they re-designed the outside of the headphones, and branded them as "DNA."  They are the DNA of the BEATS line.... get it.  Well, I though they were cool and the sounded great when I plugged them into my IPOD at the store.  I bought them.  The package was great.  They come in a cool looking box.  Inside of the box is a nice carrying bag, two quality cables, and a cleaning cloth.  They felt good on my head, and they sounded great.Why Not 5 stars?The main knock on the headphones are that they are not durable enough for my daily commute on public transportation.  To really stand up to the commute, the headphones have to withstand weather (NYC gets wind, cold temps, rain, and snow).  They have to withstand going in and out of my book bag and/or coat pocket on a regular basis, and they have to withstand the cord being pulled out as you jostle with a bag among the millions of other commuters.  These did not hold up. My first pair of headphones broke after a few weeks.  After calling Monster and going back and forth for a long time, they agreed to replace the headphones.  The only problem was that they did not have the pair that I originally bought.  So I settled on a different color, and accepted the replacement.  Several months later, the second pair broke.  Same process, and got them replaced.  Eventually, I decided to keep the headphones at home.  Now, I use them to enjoy my laptop or music a home while the family is asleep.  The sound is great, though.The second problem is that the headphones made my ears hot when I was commuting with them.  I attribute that to the style of headphone more than the quality or build of this specific model.

VShort version: if you want comfortability, durability, and the best bang for the buck...Skip these headphones.Long version:I got these about 10 months ago and have exchanged these once and will again. Why? Because both my old and new pairs broke in the exact same spot! Right above the steel extension part. I have read that this part of the headphone breaks easily and won't affect music playback, but it makes it easier to rip out the headphone when you pull too hard. 150 dollars for this product? Should be worth only at most $60. What you actually pay for is about 12% for the actual headphones and 88% for advertising and production, which doesn't even cost a lot. So basically, your helping Monster brainwash more people to buy their overpriced products by helping them pay for celebrity endorsements and all that. Now I'm not saying they can't use celebrities to advertise, but they shouldn't make it so expensive for a cheap piece of plastic and part metal and make it seem like "All the cool celebrities have it so I should too." The celebrities don't even pay for these they get it free anyways.These headphones look awesome, only reason I bought them. But if you are using these at home mostly, don't get them just because they look cool.When you put them on for a short amount of time (few minutes or so at the store) you don't notice anything. You might think that it will be "alright" if it only hurts a little. Let me tell you this, if you are using these for long term listening, don't get them at all. They hurt, a lot. In fact sometimes I have to use my ear buds instead. Especially glasses wearers, stay away from these.In the end, if you can get them around $50-$60, I would say go right ahead. Otherwise, purchase another pair.

VI bought these headphones for my wife and my personal headphones are the Bose AE2's, which are also very nice. This review will discuss these generally as well as make comparisons to the Bose, and will discuss our primary concerns - use on an airplane, comfort, and sound quality.We were initially looking for some headphones that would be good for use on an airplane. We had taken several trips and attempted to listen to music or movies and other headphones we had were almost impossible to hear, even at maximum volumes.After testing numerous sets, we were the most interested in the Bose noise canceling headphones (both the in-ear and over-the-ear are AMAZING). However, we both wanted a pair of nice headphones and couldn't bring ourselves to drop that much money. I decided on the less expensive Bose AE2s and my wife chose the DNAs.  We got both sets for less than even the refurbished price of one set of Bose noise canceling.On a recent plane trip they both performed well. Neither of these pairs are noise *reducing, but they do *isolate the noise fairly well, and both were able to be heard clearly in that setting. The daisy chain feature of the DNA's (which allows you to share the audio connection of the DNAs) was very useful. The impedance of these two sets is not the same, meaning that even though we were connected to the same device, the two sets played at different volumes. This was not a huge issue and would be improved if we both had DNAs (probably the manufacturer's intention).Comfort - these headphones sit on the ear, which is not my personal preference (I prefer the over-the-ear fit of the Bose), but they are very comfortable even for long listening times.Regarding sound quality - on my device they have a slight buzz even with no music playing. This is not the case with the Bose, and that noise is still audible if you listen for it while audio is playing. The effect is a less-clean sound than the Bose, but overall their sound quality is still very good. They also have a much stronger bass than the Bose headphones.Anyway, my wife loves these headphones and they have met our needs.

VOutstanding headphones for a non-audiophile listener
p231
sg5
VI will preface my review by saying that I love listening to music (and TV and movies) through head phones.  I will also say that I am not an over the top audiophile.  I never owned a reel to reel tape player.  I consider good quality digital recordings with a nice equalized sound to be good enough.I like the clear sound and the removal of other background noise that is achieved by wearing these headphones.  The sound quality is quite good (again disclaimer - that's coming from me not a sound geek) and I find these to be very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I also really appreciate how these can fold down to a fairly small size as compared to how large they are when worn.  The volume control on the cord is a nice extra touch that I find myself using all the time.Overall I consider these to be a perfect pair of headphones to wear while watching something on a tablet or listening to something on an MP3 player in a room where others don't want to hear what you hear.Highly recommended.

VFirst Time spending $100 on headphones and I couldn't be happier!
p236
sg5
VI've always bought cheap clip on head phones spending no more than $20. I was one of those snobs that thought $100 was a waste of money just meant to show off status and not really about quality. But having a good job now and a cell phone that wouldn't accommodate the jacks on any of my headphones, and seeing as the market for headphones now heavily favors the high end brands, I was practically forced to save up for $100 headphones.So I did a bit of research into brands and headphone design and the like because if I'm spending $100+ I certainly don't want to regret it. My coworkers were complaining about my "loud" music so I decided on-ears were needed since they deliver better sound quality since they get to interact with your whole ear unlike in ear styles it allows a more natural and full listening experience (thus not needing to turn up the volume) and better noise isolation so the music doesn't leak out. Better for my hearing protection and my coworkers all around. I tested a few brands at the store before I bought these on Amazon (saved $60 which is always great).I've been listening to them all weekend and I'm so in love, I'll never go back to the cheap headphones. I will warn though these are NOT "plug and play straight out of the box" hardly any piece of modern tech is these days. The bass was over powering and muddled when I first played them on my laptop. I went into the audio settings and turned off the "bass boost" enhancement and everything cleared up instantly. So if you get these home and find the quality is sub-par first check your audio settings, an enhancement or preset might be messing with the delivery. Second maybe you got a bum set (hey not everyone's perfect, there's bound to be a bad set in the assembly line) give an exchange a try first before writing off the brand entirely.Everything is very well balanced, nothing overpowers anything else. I listen to a very wide range of music Celtic, Symphonic Metal, Lindsey Stirling, MC Xander, Blackmore's Night, Pomplamoose, Metric, Abney Park, and Beats Antique just to name a few. Needless to say I've put these headphones through their paces over the past three days. While I get the impression they're marketed towards the hip hop and rap crowd they play everything well. A problem I had with my cheap headphones is if I listened to something like Celtic Woman and Lindsey Stirling some of the high notes would distort to a screeching pitch (I had to turn the volume up to hear them but that would mess with the quality of the higher notes) and would even make my ears ring if I listened to them too long at work. It got to the point where I would have to babysit the volume and just before the high notes came up I'd have to throw the volume down as quick as possible. Obviously it was annoying and in hindsight a sign I needed better headphones.I nearly cried the first time I played Celtic music through these, the high notes don't distort to a screech, the women vocals sound as angelic as ever. The highest I turned up the volume was close to 60% and that was pushing it for my comfort and I haven't turned it out that loud again. I'm currently listening to Blackmore's Night 20% with ease, it's a huge improvement over my reluctant and uncomfortable 100% garbage sport clip on head set.I'm having a minor problem with the headphones pressing the ear rest of my glasses into my head but it's easy to ignore or just takes a minute of adjusting the headphones and glasses to fix. Overall their very comfortable over long term wear and once I make my glasses play nice I hardly feel them on my head. The railing system for the headphones is the best I've ever experienced with on-ear headphones. It's solid and doesn't just slam from all the way down to all the way up with the slightest bit of pressure which makes adjusting and maintaining the preferred size easy.I also went with these because, honestly, the rose gold looks so sexy. I know it's all about function, and these headphones excel in that department, and given the choice I'd rather pay for function than appearance but the fact I don't have to wear something obnoxiously over sized or in gaudy, florescent, or ridiculous color schemes (which for some odd reason other companies make their priority) is a relief.I'm very happy with my purchase, I will leave on a word of caution though, Monster and a few other popular companies have been targets of counterfeiting in recent years. If people bought these from Craigslist or Ebay for example it may explain some of the lower reviews since obviously those headphones are of lower quality. While it might be tempting to buy from other sites to save money Monster keeps a list of licensed dealers for their products to ensure customer safety. Because these headphones had such a steep price difference compared to Monster's homepage I actually went out of my way to find out if Amazon was a legit Monster dealer just to be safe which obviously they are, here is where you can find the list: http://www.monsterproducts.com/counterfeit/authorized.asp

VI've had these headphones for a  few days and did a comparison with some of my other on ear style headphones.Pros: Deliver good bass and are lightweight. I've worn them for 4-5 hours at a time and they don't feel heavy on the ears or on my head.They do a great job of noise isolating and I have to turn the music off at times to hear people attempting to talk to me.They are a little low on the bass side which is great and not so great for some of those songs that I do like to hear rich bass against. This is also great for being able to hear the mids and highs for some of the other songs that I enjoy listening too. The bass when it does happen with songs isn't so overwhelming that I have to turn the music down and have my ears ringing after songs.When you are playing music it doesn't blast out and you have upset coworkers or cubicle neighbors hearing your music (just don't blast it is my recommendation).Cons: Price are a bit high for what I would compare with other brands that are more established (Sony, Bose, etc).Overall, I am very satisfied and would use these in a work environment, and at home when I am doing things around the house. I sense that these will be great for use in the gym when I want to drown out the background noise and want to focus as well.

VUPDATE 1/12/15After using the headphones, for like 3 months or so, I finally see a crack at where the slider is supposed to be, this is such a dissapointment, I actually enjoyed these headphones apart from the annoying press on the ears, they sound pretty good, I take back what I said about the bass, these are Good sounding headphones BUT the build quality is horrible, if you want these to last you a couple of years, DO NOT buy these.The headphones look great, the shipping was quick and the item came as the image. Came in it's own box, very big, with it's manuals, a cleaning cloth and two cables.I'm only dissapointed on the sound quality from these, the bass is pretty out of reach.I'm amazed on the Noise Cancellation on these, when the muffs close on your ears, nothing can be heard outside, and at max volume, little to no noise, only if you come very close to the headphones, will you hear anything.The earphones after some time of using, like 20-30 minutes or so begin hurting my ears, extremely annoying, might just be me but I'm disappointed.The slider to increase it's height is harder to do on one said than the other and one side falls open when closed so easily.Except from all that,UPDATE:

VNot sure what the confusion is all about.  I have been using shure headphones for the last 10 years and will continue to as they are one of the best. So why did I give monster's DNA 5 stars. Simple answer is sound. Let me clarify. I tried DNA and shure with an amplifier and direct plug into my Iphone with the exact same music.With the amplifier my Shure had higher ranges and had more flexibilty to accomodate the frequncy it was being fed and DNA was good but topped out mid range with the exception of the base.Direct iphone plug in, DNA rocked as if it had a mini amplifier built in it and the music was great and that is what the young people want. Shure did well but was limited to what it was fed and it needed an amplifer to boost it becase that what it is built for - professional musicians who use amps.During my travels I do use shure because I dont like carrying bulky headphones but do have to admit after 4 hours of listening to music my ears huth with Shure but it is worth it because I am not going to stuff DNA's in my briefcase and lug it around or wear it around my neck.I hope this puts things in perspective.

The sound cannot be heard by public when you wear it, which is solve me a big problems because I used to listen to loud music while my friend studying beside me and the music was getting out of other headphones to him , So with this DNA monster problem solved,Colors ::: very nice color., the red and black was mine , and all other are well saturated color which make difficult to choose because all are beautiful .The Bad thing ....... I actually surprised to fined this only disadvantage of this Monster which is "The ear Pressure"These headphones are pressure too high on ear and ear lobes which makes headache and ear lobe pain after 1 hour of use. Even the cousins of speaker are well made , but the pressure is harmfull to the external ear and should be avoided .Suggestion?? >>> Yes, "Over The Ear" ear speaker will surly solve this issue.thanks

VI dinged these one star based entirely on cost which I think is a bit on the high side.I compared these to my numerous Vine headphones. (Hey, I guess I'm on the headphone reviewers list.)Simply put, these had the best sound so far even compared to my Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Canceling Headphones (Old Version).  I prefer noise canceling over-the-ear to on-the-ear for long flights.The sound is almost perfect.  The mix of base, mids and treble is spot on.  I'm serious when I say that these headphone will get loud enough to damage your hearing while remaining distortion free.These are also the most comfortable on-the-ear headphone I have ever worn.  The material that cushions against your ear is like a foamy pillow.  I have a minor concern about the durability of this material since it's so soft.The design is clearly geared to look futuristic and in that regard, mission accomplished.  I like the color and the plastic has a quality feel as does the part that opens and closes to fit larger heads.All things considered, these are great headphones and the best that I've reviewed to date!

VUnfortunately, I have to mark these earphones down.  Caveat:  These are nice headphones, awesome color and style and fits pretty squarely on my head.  Mark these to maybe half the price they currently go for, and I could see giving them to a teenager as a nice iPod accessory.  However, I've spent years using different headphones (in-ear and over the ear), and my standards are mighty different than what these headphones are.  Noise isolation is a must.  In a quiet room, I shouldn't be able to hear anything.  In a gym, noises should be muffled.  These earphones do neither.  They cover my ears, but I may as well not wear them due to the noise that remains.  The sound is "okay".  They are decent quality sound, no extreme bass or treble...just "good", but not good at the current price.  I have some Sennheiser HD 380s that sound way better.  I appreciate the different styles and colors these are in, a trait not apparent in the higher end earphones and headphones (one color fits all).  The accessories are great (extra cables, bag); I appreciate a bag versus the square boxes of a lot of different storage cases.Mark these headphones down and they are a great seller.

VI originally bought a set of Beats' Solos and they were OK, but they clicked when I walked and didn't sound any better than my Philips' CitiScape Metro headphones so I took them back.  I tried on the various headphones on display at the box stores such as more expensive Beats, Bose, Sony, Sennheiser, Sol Republic, and Skullcandy, but I wasn't blown away by any of them.  I came across Monster's DNA display, tried them, and noticed a distinct difference: they are more balanced, comfortable, and louder.I decided to get the Laser Blue DNAs for $127, and I am very happy with the purchase!  They sound awesome, don't click when I walk, and they have minimal sound leakage.  Of all the headphones I tried, these provide crisp highs, punchy mids, and explosive lows.  Give these headphones a try when you scope out the different brands because they are a shining jewel in the overcrowded sub-$200 market.

VI've had these for about a week now and I'm by no means a pro or anything but these headphones are awesome! My co-worker has Beats Solos which he let me try as well and he was impressed with these and thought they sounded much better. Because I got them at such a great price at a local retailer, I went back and got me the black and red pair as well. I'm very picky with headphones and was waiting to save up for the Beats wireless but that'll have to wait now. I just couldn't turned down the price I got these for. I've always read about people's "great listening experience" and never knew what they were talking about until I got these. I get lost in the music, and noise isolation works well.  I listen to everything but Country was just blown away. I didn't and don't plan on using these with the Appletalk cable so I can't speak on that. Because I couldn't rate in halves, I really give these a 4.5 star due to these hurting my ears after awhile. But I've always had this problems in the past with my cheaper pair of headphones as well. I definitely recommend!

VGiven the variance in reviews when I did my research from "Amazing" to "Junk", I decided that before I put them under the Christmas Tree for my daughter......I better see if they are the real deal.  After careful evaluation with multiple source devices....I decided I very well may not put them under the Christmas Tree.... as I think I want to KEEP THEM FOR MYSELF!!!  I don't know what the nay-sayers are hearing,  The only phones I've had on my ears that outperform these are in the 300-400 price point, and I have to be honest...given a side by side comparison at purchase......the difference wouldn't be worth the $ unless I had it to burn.  As for the reason for my concern is she asked for "Beats"....but the Beats in this price point are JUNK.  You're paying for the name with generic quality.  A bunch of her friends have the base level Beats....I have a feeling once they hear my daughters DNA's.... they'll lose the brand name arogance..... YEAH..it's that big a difference.

VThese are the best headphones EVER! I recieved these headphones as a birthday gift and I can honestly say it was one of the greatest gifts I've recieved! These headphones are very durable and are easy to store in my bag when I'm on the go. I love the fact that they are not too loud but loud enough to block out any outside noise. They are compatible with all phones including my Samsung Galaxy II and they allow me to talk on my phone with phone cable. There is also a very small feature that you can't get from any other headphone.... The music sharing cable! There is second headphone jack located on the other side of the headphones that allows someone else to listen to what you are listening too. Any type of headphone can be plugged in to that extra jack and you and scan listen to the same music. This works great when me and my wife are taking a 1hr 1/2 long bus ride to Seoul in South Korea. Hands down these are great headphones.... Even better than the Beats By Dre!!!! :)

VI have seen some very hostile reviews of this product.  I don't agree with them.  I think the sound quality actually reflects the tastes of the recording engineer of the particular album.  I have listened to them with a wide variety of music.  On some acoustic blues guitar and voice, they sound dead on.  If the recording engineer wanted things shrill and bass heavy, thats how they sound.  I suspect like many modern audio products, there's some base bump and a treble boost. So, I turned the EQ in iTunes to flat, and where the engineer and the product produced too much treble, that corrected it.  I suspect these are not aimed at the same market as Grado or Sennheiser--they are not for classical music aficionados.  For popular music, rock, blues, vocals, they are fine and give you what the studio engineer wanted-even if that engineer's choices were not so hot.  I was going to give them 4 stars, but I found wearing them for an hour hurt my ears and that cost one star.

VThese were a birthday gift for my son and he absolutely loves them. First, they are the real mccoy and second they can pump out some great sound. The base is solid, the mid has great range and the treble is clean and crisp.  My son listens to mostly electronica , rap and pop and he said the sound is great. I must agree although I listen to mostly rock and alternative music. These headphones have quite a range for differant genres of music.  My thoughts are add a cool set of lime green headphones with a teenage kid you get pure happiness! Well, for at least a day  or until they say your ruining their life all over again. Why cant they just turn into adults after they turn 12 and just skip the teen years? Oh well Five stars for these.

VSo I went to Best Buy and I was looking around for headphones and I was stuck between beats or the monster DNA. I spoke to the specialist in that department and since they're both the same price he was going to get the same out of me, all I needed was his expertise. Turns out Monster used to make Beats headphones until they parted ways. HTC makes Beats' speakers. HTC the phone company!! Monster is truly devoted to what they do and they do it well! Much more stylish and adult looking also. When I put these on, it's just me and my music. I can't hear anything or anyone. The sound is completely balanced and the cushions on my ear are soooo comfy!! Best headphones to invest in!!

VGot these at Best Buy on a whim. Tried out a number of headphones, and these DNAs are super!  I don't like any one part to overpower-- I don't want to hear just base, or just mids, or just highs. I want the full range of sound.And for that, nothing beats (pun intended!) these Monster DNAs. The Dr. Dre's Beats are bass heavy, and Bose drops out a lot of highs. These give a wonderful range so you hear the full sound the musicians intended.It is true that you need to keep the EQ settings on the device neutral; otherwise the headphones will be biased towards whatever EQ setting you have. But, that's true for any headphone.

I had my Beats for two years, and decided it was time to retire them. I asked around, and these headphones were the most recommended. I don't regret buying these. These are like buying Beats, but cheaper and these are louder. I got mine at Sam's Club for 80 dollars. They have really good packaging (what Monster headphones don't???). I would recommend buying theses highly. Last of all, if I were able to give this product 6 stars, I would give it 8. Great headphones

VThe quality of the audio is fine and it is comfortable to wear for 2 to 3 hours, the product is strong and well made but it is way too pricey. I have used headphones purchased at lower price and they perform well. I compared this product with other headphones ($65) by listening to classical music, classic-rock, pop and blues, the quality was a little better with Monster DNA and the clarity is one notch higher. As some reviewers have noted that the audio quality gets better with music that has nice bass. All said and done; it comes down one simple question. Is this product worth so much $$ compared to other products available in the market? I personally believe that this is too expensive.

VI am in love with my DNA headphones. I'm a weight lifter and as a female I want no one to "offer a spot" or try to talk to me. These have been so much help. Due to the obvious manner of wearing them people won't put you through the hassle of removing them to talk and if they try to while you're listening to music, they will look like an idiot because they cancel out all noise, have AMAZING sound quality and when listening to trap, dubstep, or hip hop is such a blast! The bass is PERFECTION. Do yourself a favor and splurge for a set of headphones that work so amazingly!!!

For a product this expensive, one would expect that they would sound great and be durable. These headphones don't fulfill either of these expectations. Furthermore, the Monster customer service is terrible. My headphones have been broken for over a month and have been sitting in Monsters warehouse while I wait for them to send me a new pair per the 1 year warranty. This product and company is garbage.

VThese headphones are not durable enough to survive basic use. For me, after a mere 1.5 months of ownership, the left earpiece broke through the headband slider rendering the headphones useless. And to those of you who think that by being extremely careful you can protect their headphones from harm, I'll tell you that you are wrong. The headphones broke when, while they were in a bag, the bag fell onto the floor of my car. Twenty minutes later, when I got home, I found that these headphones were not of the quality that their price tag makes them seem.

Personally, I might prefer just slightly more bass for listening to my mp3 player, but the sound produced by these is so clear that I can hear things in the music that I do not hear over the car stereo when playing the  same songs.

VVery impressed, good headphones
p489
sg5
VTo start off this review I wanted to say that these headphones were surprisingly impressive. I have a wide varitey off headphones, a collection some may say. Headphones from skullcandy to top of the line sennhieser's. Out of all the headphones I have, these still impressed me. Not only do these sound good, but they are unique. Unique from the design to the changeble sound signatures.Information- As some maybe unaware monster has an app called "Pure Monster Sound Experience". In this app if you have the monster DNA on ear or DNA pro you are able to customize the sound by selecting a genre preset. You are only able to do this when are listening to music from in their app.  For an example if you are listening to classical simply go into app and turn on the classical option. Without using this app the sound already sounds good but while enabled different music genres sounds noticeably better. I was shocked by this and think it is great idea. The downside to this is the app is only avalible to iOS users free on the AppStore. But with or without the app these headphones still sound good.Build Quality- The build quality on these headphones is the weakest aspect of these headphones. They are made up of mostly plastic with some metal and rubber parts here and there. While these headphones could with stand some minor impacts, if twisted or accidentally bent the wrong way these could possible crack. These also come with a velvet like carry pouch which is nice but wouldnt give the headphones much protection. While holding these I don't get that cheap feeling but like I said build quality could definitely be improved.Comfort- These headphones have extremely soft and plush earpads but don't be fooled! They have a really strong clamping force and you will definatley start to feel something around an hour of wear. With that being said these have impressive noise isolation which does a good job of muffling out most background noise.Design- In my opinion these headphones look great. The triangles over the earcups and headband offer a  sleek and slim looking design. Plus the glossy finish and flashy colors make these things look even more awesome. Monster also includes a microfiber cleaning cloth to easily remove fingerprints on the headband and earcups. Most people because of Beats are under the impression if they look cool they sound absolutely horrific, but this is not the case, for these headphones do both.Sound Quality- This is going to be the longest paragraph yet. And for a quick disclaimer this sound review will be assumed you are using the headphone without the app or any presets. I've been using these headphones for about 2 weeks now and have tested these headphones with all music genres. First of all these headphones are not specifically geared to rap or dance genres. Alright starting off with the bass it is a little over powered but doesn't distort the mids and highs. These headphones have a tight punchy bass with well constructed mids which sometimes makes the highs sound distant. Overall these headphones are pretty much well balanced. These headphones hit highs perfectly with clear sound when bass and mids aren't present. The sound was very detailed and I was able to pick up on all instruments playing in Genres like jazz and classical. Vocals seemed smooth and clear but sometimes sounded like they were hissy. The audio on these would start to disort as I hit about 85%. Acoustics also soundness pleasnt well listening to country.Overall I enjoyed the sound of these very much. These are not bad sounding and somewhat comfortable as well. Definatley not as good as my sennhiesers but definatley gets the job done when it comes to sound quality and design. Thanks for reading, hope this helped you make a decision

VI just got the DNA's a few days ago, so this review will be based off of first impressions.When I first put these on I was pleased with the look. Straight on, the headphones protrude further from either side of my head than I would have liked, but from the side or a semi-straight on angle these guys look great! Truthfully, I think Beats design is sharper overall, but I do have to give Monster huge credit for originality.The next thing I noticed was build quality. These feel very solid. The headband is just strong enough to keep both speakers comfortably pressed against the ears without causing any noticeable pain for the average user. My ears did ache a little bit  after wearing these for over an hour where my glasses go behind my ear, but this isn't too big of a negative for me since I would rather them be too tight than too loose. The hinges, earpieces, and the general body all feel very well put together, built to stay that way. I would like to mention that there is some looseness where the body connects to the earpieces, and they tend to rattle just the littlest bit. Finally, the two cables that these come with are great! The flat wire design assures that these will never tangle,  and the inline controls are really nice (I own an android tablet, so the volume controls DO NOT work for me. The pause/play button does though).Finally, I'd like to give my personal opinion on the sound. Before I owned these, I had a pair of the in-ear DNA's. Personally, I felt that these earbuds had extremely crisp highs, decent mids, but non-existent lows. When I listened to music with these on-ear DNA's for the first time, I wasn't quite so surprised to hear the outstanding high's and good mids that I had become used to; Instead, I was incredibly pleased to hear nice BALANCED bass. The bass isn't the overwhelming headache type but is more of a massaging low rumble. It won't be the first thing you notice, but it also isn't something you will overlook.Overall, I am extremely happy that I purchased these. About a year ago I started to notice these, and almost purchased them for the $150 price tag that they were formerly at, but I was uncertain of how I would like them. When the price went down to $70 a few days ago, I bought them immediately and I am in no way disappointed. Honestly, if I could have experienced the DNA's a year ago, I would have paid the $150 price tag.

VHi. Today is exactly one year that I have bought this headphone. So after a meaningful time of using the device I am going to say my comment about it.Good:The material used to build it is really high quality.The package includes nice to have things all for free and with prestigious quality. It really makes you feel wow when you open the box.The sound quality which is the most important point to me in good and I can say very close to advanced.The durability is awesome since I am always carrying it around and its bag is always attached to my backpack. It has kept almost its first-day\u200b quality both in physical shape and in sound quality.Bad:The feel is not very good if you want to have it on your ears for more than 10 minutes. It really starts to hurt even though I have a middle sized head and ears.The Sound quality is not very professional. It is not as real as Sony MDR V6 wich I use for studio works nor as detailed and clear as Beats Studio 2 which I gave to my wife as a birthday gift. Another issue with the sound is it exaggerates the bass which is disturbing if you are a professional music listener or player.Overall, it is a good deal if you buy it the price 80 $ or so. But not more. Besides if you are a professional and you want to have a very real and detailed music then do not go for it. It is extremely good for nonprofessional people who just want to enjoy listening to music and having some fun and even gain some energy from the strong Bass it produces.

VDo NOT let the Monster name scare you away...
p534
sg5
VFirst off I generally(did) avoid monster products mainly because of beats. Nothing wrong with beats but what you get for the price is a joke. Anyhow Monster and Dr. Dre parted ways and essentially the DNA model was made to combat the Beats Solo and it does an amazing job doing so. The DNA's actually blow the Solo's out the water as the Solo's are a one tricky pony, emphasis on bass. The DNA's are LOUD as hell(and clear), really every genre I threw at them sounded good, rock, metal, trance, rap, you name it and nothing sounded bad at all.The fit and finish are pretty good, comfortable to wear and from what I can tell durable as hell(check youtube) though I am careful with my stuff anyhow. I would say the DNA's are a great buy up to the $150 price point. If you are willing to spend more than $150 you can get better headphones but you would be hard pressed to find better for $150 or under. I actually got my pair for $99 and was so impressed went and purchased the gf a pair also.I have multiple pairs of headphones and some are better suited to certain genres than others. The DNA is a pair I can take with me on a trip or when I just know I will be listening to multiple genres as I know I can't go wrong with them. These headphones actually made me think much more highly of the Monster brand. Highly recommend you give them a listen.Also curious how the over ear version sounds, amazing I imagine but I will wait until those come down in price for now.

VGreat if you're tired of buds
p539
sg5
VI've never been comfortable with ear buds.  I'm not an audio geek, but just a casual listener who enjoys a wide variety of music. I grabbed these headphones just to see if I liked them better than the traditional ear buds.  I have to say that I'm now done with ear buds for good.  These are very comfortable, producing a very nice balanced sound that was consistent whether I was listening to Adele or Tchaikovsky.  They cancel out quite a bit of exterior sound, which is sometimes quite nice when you live in a house with two teenagers.My thirteen year old son who is much more of an audiophile than his mother said that he liked the sound, but wasn't quite ready to turn in his ear buds.  These adjust to a wide range of sizes, with the biggest size setting fitting my extra-large head.  The product comes in a very cool box, and includes a plush carry bag, customer service information and a special Monster cleaning cloth.  They seem very sturdy and really don't look all that nerdy after all.  I will be proud to wear them in public, perhaps scoring a few cool points with the younger crowd.I give these headphones only four stars because even though I will enjoy them thoroughly, believe they produce superior sound and find them very comfortable, the fact remains that they seem to be overpriced.  Each customer will have to determine how much they are willing to pay for nice comfortable surround sound that looks cool.

VI've had these headphones for over about a year now and they are just superb. Since Amazon sells it at a Lowet cost it's a major buy. These have really crisp sounding high,mids, and lows and the bass is very tight and punchy. Overall these sound very crisp for all genres of music. I listen to pop, r&b;, rap etc. These are very durable from my experience and also built pretty solid. They feel very lightweight and not cheap in any way so this headphone is great in about every category.When I first got it they felt really fragile but that wasn't the case at all after using them and getiing used to them. Beats even though they are refreshed aren't that good. The solo 2 are really average when it comes to high,mids, and lows. The bass on the new solo 2 is good but everything else is drowned out compared to monster DNA'S because:Monster DNA: really crisp treble and high, kids, and lows. Tight punchy base.Very loud and doesn't distort from my experience.Looks and design is just new and sleek. It's very portable and small.Very comfortable earcups with pleather or some kind of leatherish earcups.Daisy chaining is a really good feature. This is when there are two input jacks on the headphones one for u and ur music cable to ur phone and another person can plug in their headphone into yours to listen what ur listening to.Definitely worth the buy for a fun music experience with really good audio quality as well as looks, and comfort.

VPotentially Still Useful But Very Disappointing
p550
sg5
VI got these for $50 on a major deal and still feel a little ripped off. I primarily wanted them because of the extra audio jack, which I am hoping will still be useful but it has the following downsides:A) I find them very uncomfortable for extended usage. This might just be a personal preference from being used to over-the-ear headphones.I started off actually somewhat pleased they just sat on the surface of my ears as after a few hours of wearing my other headphones I need a break from them and start shifting them to be on top of my ear anyways. So I thought 'Hey, this could be convenient!' And maybe it still will be, but I can only take about 40 minutes of wear before they become really uncomfortable, which is a lot less than either over the ear headphones OR earbuds.B) The audio fidelity is not great. Everything sounds flatter and more muted. Probably not the technical terms for what's happening but it was pretty disappointing. The sound is carried through to another set of headphones if attached, and there is a massive quality difference between plugging my main pair of headphones straight into the computer versus plugging them into the audio jack of the DNA headphones.At $50, I'm pretty 'meh' about my purchase. But I cannot IMAGINE paying $200 for these and being even slightly ok with what I got.Seriously, how is this a thing? Do people actually pay that much for these?

VAlot of people dislike Monster products because of the hype.....but if you want to hookup your $1000.00 receiver to your $1200.00 set of front towers with lamp cord.....do it. With that said, these are good headphones. I gave them 4 stars due to the price. I listened to Beats by Dre. They are good as well but a little too bottom heavy for me. Sometimes the bass sounded muddied. The bass response on the DNAs is quite good. If you want to argue that Beats are better...do so. But before you make your judgement, listen to several types of music. Not just pop. Or hip hop. Throw in some classical, some blues, jazz, rock, or anything else. When I opened the box and  took these out, I tried them with several genres of music. The clarity was incredible. And if you want to argue about bass, use them to listen to Oakenfold's "Ready, Steady, Go". As for the reviewer that stated these were useless, he either was a kid that doesn't appreciate what he has or he didn't take the time to listen because he is a Beats troll. Also, when something is on display at a big box store, how many times a day do you think these are auditioned? I listened to Beats, Sony, and these. For the quality, they were worth it. I am 50 yrs old and work quality control in the biopharma industry so I do not work in the audio industry. I just appreciate music and I think that Monster DNAs are a good product.

VI Liked, Teenage Son Loved
p561
sg5
VAs a child of the 80s, I'm much more comfortable with headphones than I am these tiny little earbud things.  Strange?  Maybe, but the truth nonetheless.One of the reasons I hate Apple EarPods that came with iPhone is because they constantly fall out of my ears while I'm running on the treadmill or bending over while doing laundry, loading the dishwasher, or any type of housework. So I thought I'd give the Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones a try.Well, guess what.  I actually prefer Earbuds.  Go figure!Now, don't get me wrong, they stayed in place much better than the in-ear speakers and they had EXCELLENT sound quality but, overall, they just felt a little bulky.  For me, anyway.So I passed them along to my teenage son and asked him to give them a try.  He's been using them for online gaming.  And he loves them!  He's not much of a talker in real life so he's total mute in the virtual world, so the lack of a microphone doesn't bother him at all.  He tells me that the sound quality "rocks" and he's never had such an awesome set of headphones.He gives them five plus stars, but it was my product to try and rate, so I give it only four.  Nothing wrong the product, it's me.  I just couldn't "love them" but I really did "like them."

VI originally bought these at my local BestBuy® and THEY SOUNDED AMAZING! I got the white tuxedo and experienced a problem with being able so see stress cracks on the strap because the clear plastic on the top. Monster® sent me a different pair (same color and a newer version) and they never did it again. I went to a friend of mine and listened to his Beats Solo HD and they SUCKED. My sister's $10 Coby Deep Bass Headphones actually sounded the same as the beats did. Due to the Beats's muddy bass. The DNAs sound a whole ton better than the Beats. And, the build quality was better too. The Beats are as cheap as dirt when is comes to build quality. They always have been. The DNAs are way more comfortable and even the DNAs cable made the Beats sound better. ON the DNAs, the bass is more smooth and not overpowering but in still there and is good for all you Bassheads out there. The Highs and Mediums are beautiful. Especially for Rock. I wish they would have a better case. (which is a drawstring bag) The crazy thing is... Monster DNA= $160 (sale) Beats Solo HD= $199. Overall I highly recommend Monster DNAs I hope this review was helpful to you. And if your wondering if you want to buy these. DO IT

VAC/DC to Zeppelin

VThese headphones sound great no matter what music you throw at them, AC/DC to Zeppelin. I have had high end stereo systems for 40 years and really enjoy GOOD sound.These are the best sounding headphones I have ever bought. Most of my music collection is 80's hard rock with ample bass,but of course I also have a wide array of other genres. The bass response is great on these,deep but tight. If I listened mostly to Hip-Hop (kill me now) I would buy the Beats by Dr. Dre Pros for the exaggerated bass. These are highly efficient headphones as everything I listen to through them is louder at my normal volume settings. Protect your hearing! I am also impressed by the fact that no noise escapes these in use,you cannot tell that someone is rocking out next to you. You will definitely hear sounds you never knew were there in your favorite music .Another thing that sounds great is the stringed instruments. Try listening to Avicii's "Wake Me Up" or anything by Marston Smith and some Enya. Do not listen to the nay sayers, There will always be people to criticize anything. I am very happy with this purchase.

p606
sg5
VRight out of the box, these things will beat a pair of burnt in Beats or Sol Republics (in my opinion, for my music). They have all the bass I want and the highs are great too. They may not be quite as good as the rest of the high end headphones, but they are definitely the best "fashion" headphones. And for the price of $150 (what I paid for these), there are no better on/over-the-ear headphones. Comfortable on the ears, and definitely easy on the eyes.Though I am not a sound expert, I can tell when sound is distorted. Up to 70% on an iPod, I have heard no distortion in the high or low end. I must say I do not listen to bass heavy music, such as rap, hip hop, or R&B;, so I am not quite sure how they fare on the lowest of the low bass. I do, however, enjoy rock and music with tenor sax and/or piano in it (both pretty mid-range instruments) and they sound great on these headphones.Overall, very pleased with this purchase.In my opinion, Monster splitting up with Beats may have been the best thing to happen to the fashion headphone market.

VBetter than Beats. 2 Years and Still Sound Incredible
p616
sg5
VI have had these headphones for 2 years now. I used them for walking to class and to run with. Even after 2 years and extensive use, I have never had any speakers blow or had any loss of sound quality. The headphones themselves are stylish with offering a variety of colors and styles.As far as the most important aspect, the sound quality, these headphones beat any in their price range. I've listened to Beats by Dr.Dre and a few other headphone brands like Skullcandy and none of them compare to the quality this one provides for the price. They don't have the greatest bass, but the sound is crisp and clear and sounds amazing to this day.The headphones are comfortable enough that I've ran with them multiple times with no issues. The headphones fit snuggly to your head, but do not grip it to cause headaches or irritation. I can easily listen to music for a couple hours with little to no discomfort.Pros: Best for the Price (always on sale) , Durable, Comfortable, StylishCons: Bass is nothing special.

VThese are really great. I'm pretty picky about my headphones because I listen to my iPod about 10 hours a day. I've had a set of Ludacris' Soul headphones for the past two years. I bought those because they were a bit cheaper than Beats and sounded similar. They stood up well but once I heard these Monster DNA's I realized I'd been missing some quality.  The sound is rich and full of layers.I'm not sure what the people who rated these one to two are doing to them to get them to break. I feel these are sturdy and well constructed. I take good care of them--don't stick them in a bag with things on them, don't mistreat them at all. If they aren't on my head they are hooked around my bag arm straps. Nothing has damaged.I researched headphones a lot before buying these. Consumer reports gave them a high review. And I've read a lot of other good reviews too. I do recognize those reviews cite weaknesses so I'm not saying there aren't better out there but these definitely made me happy with their look and sound

VI bought these on sale for around $70 dollars. I was pretty excited as I have read a lot of good reviews on these headphones and they looked pretty sleek. After a few uses I thought the sound was very crisp and was able to block out a lot of noise. Comfort-wise it was not bad but I didn't wear it for long periods of time so that may be a different story.Within a week the left side just completely stopped working. I tried changing the cords that connect the headphones to the music player but that didn't work either.Luckily I was able to return the item back to the retailer I had gotten the Monster DNAs since they stopped working literally a week. I also wasn't a fan of Monster customer service as far as availability as I shouldn't have to wear 30 minutes for a customer service rep but I'm sure they are fine once you work through the RMA process with them.All in all I thought the sound quality was good but maybe I got a unlucky pair of headphones so this rating pertains personally to me.

VBetter Than Beats
p632
sg5
VI entitled this better than Beats due to the fact that the Beats are the hot item right now. I first owned a pair of beats and for the purpose of them being used as the title suggests (BEATS) they are superb despite the fact that the rubber that goes over my head has now become detached and I did a terrible superglue job. The problem is I am not a hip-hop fan so the majority of the music i listen to doesn't require a large amount of bass. After trying these DNA Monster headphones on at Best Buy I was simply amazed at how crisp the sound was. It was as if I could hear every instrument being played along with the musicians voice being very distinct. I am a male who actually likes the color pink so i was also very satisfied they came in this Bright Pink color. The only negative remark I have about these headphones is they seem to be made for children or adults with a smaller head. When I extend the headphones out to the max it fits perfectly over my ears but if I wear a baseball cap it feels a bit awkward.

VI purchased these last year as a Black Friday deal off another site for only 60$... For that price, these may be the best regular pair of headphones I've ever owned, the comfort, the audio quality, even the fit, I thought they felt kind of flimsy but I've had them for over half a year now, I lost the cord with a mic but that's why it comes with a second one, and any AUX cord will happily take it's place if you lose both of them! Granted like most over ear headphones if you have a lot of hair they won't stay on that well, but that's a given. My only issue with them is when I'm wearing them around my neck and I sneeze and chop myself in the throat with them... but that's not Monster's fault!All in all, I'd rate Monster way better than Beats, I bought the 350$ pair of Beats (The Executives) and they broke within 2 months from regular usage, never dropped them or anything. These I've dropped countless times and there isn't even a scratch on that cobalt finish!

VI think these headphones are really really good.  I had been searching for months, trying to find a good brand of head/earphones that provide solid sound and clarity.  Prior to these, I purchased both Dre Beats Solo 2 and the Ur Beats.  The Beats Solo2 had great sound when it came to playing movies, but when it came to music the sounds was so so.  It was clear so I will make that known, but when you turned the volume up more than low, it became saturated.  The Beats Solo2 could not handle bass at certain volume levels.  The Ur Beats were the same as far as pro and con.  These Monsters are something different.  Surprisingly the noise-isolating is very "noise isolating".  I travel a lot for work and i literally don't hear anything when I have them on, which makes being on a plane easier.  They are good for making calls with and the sound quality is really good.  I would buy these again if/when these ever break down.  I hope this review helps someone.

VCrushing My Head
p666
sg5
VI got these on sale from another store, but wanted to post my review here as well.  The sound seems pretty decent, but these things hurt.  The band is real strong and it feels like it's crushing my head.  I can only wear them for about 10-15 minutes before I have to start constantly adjusting them on my ears, and only like an hour before it's just too much.  After that they always leave me with a headache from the pressure.When not using them I put them on something to try and stretch them out but after 3 days it's made no difference.  To give you an idea, you see on the preview images how there is a gap between both the speakers?  On my headset there is no such gap.  Even after several days they compress right onto each other, and if they didn't get in each others way the ends of the band would probably cross. I don't usually wear headphones, so maybe this is just normal, but it makes them pretty unwearable for me.

VBest headphones by far
p677
sg5
VI purchased these for my son as a Christmas gift.  He really likes them.  They came with an additional jack so that you can share your music (audio) with others.  Your friend can plug into the bottom of the ear piece with their jack and share your audio.  The ear covering material, is silky smooth so you enjoy wearing them.  They are LOUD.  I can hear his music just like he is using speakers when the headphones aren't on his head, but then the audio cancels out so I don't hear it, only he does, when he has them on his ears.  They come with a beautiful carrying case that looks and feels well made.  He said they come with a detachable cord, I'm assuming to keep someone from pulling the cord out and ruining the headphones, making them inoperable, if you forget to unplug them and you get up or they get caught in something.  These are really durable and I'd like to own a pair myself, but I can't afford a pair for him and me.  :(

VI love these headphones. First of all, looks beautiful, the material is plastic but durable. The ears pad are very comfortable. I can use these for hours and not get tired or feel pain. It comes with 2 detachable cable, one of them with mic, and you can use these cable in either the right side or left side of the headphones. It also comes with a carrying bag. The sound is great...to me. It has a strong bass and the mids and highs sound great too. I heard that when one upper the volume  the sound gets distorted. I  did not experienced that on my test. I can compare this to the Beats Solo 2 and I think the Monster dna may have an edge on the beat solo 2. The Beat solo 2 puts a lot of pressure on my ear and the Monster do not. I think Monster has done a tremendous job with this headphone. Thank you Monster. I do appreciate and love your product.

VMy wife uses a self-help CD that that is very relaxing, informative,  and with a calming audio background.  She's had problems with head-phones for this purpose before but last night she tried the Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones and was SOLD.  There was no outside noise with these phones.  I know how that goes, neither I nor the dog are welcome during her 15 minutes of relaxation.  She said that the experience was a more enjoyable and intense than any other head phones she's experienced with (and she didn't even notice that the dog came in).I took my turn only I chose to listen to Polovtian Dances by Borodin. There was a lot of clarity. She's right; They're Wonderful.

p711
sg5
VI don't usually write reviews, but this product has made me start to. These headphones are really good for the price. The design is gorgeous, the build quality is way better than beats, and the sound quality is perfectly balanced. Unlike beats, which are way to bass heavy, these have just the right amount of bass, mids, lows, and highs. Its tough for me to talk about the comfort aspect of these. I have glasses, which with ON ear headphones, isn't the best. Since the padding isnt around my ears, it pushes on my glasses. I can't knock the headphones for this though. Even with my glasses, the headphones are still very comfortable and I get about 3 hours with them on before my ears start to hurt. I would highly recommend these to anyone. If you want to stand out and buy a better product, forget beats and go with these.

VThese headphones are fashion headphones, but really good ones. These are made by the guys who used to make the Beats headphones, Monster but their contract ended and went back to making their own headphones. The Monster DNA's are clearly a competitor to the Beats, and they do a damn good job!I bought these for music listening and they are amazing, they are very comfortable for on-ear headphones and very durable! The sound quality is amazing! The mids are clear and crisp, the highs are amazing and the bass is nice and tight. These headphones are amazing for any genre. From Classical Rock to Deathcore to Rap and Hip-Hop, it's all fantastic!Monster did a great job of making a fashionable headphone without sacrificing any of the sound quality. 5/5! I highly recommend it!

VI'm rather ambivalent about these headphones.  They are good looking, to be sure, but I expected more from the sound quality.  I don't have the equipment necessary to make any specific measurements, but I felt like the frequency response range was limited--not a whole lot at either the high or low range and not much depth to the sound quality.  Just sounded rather flat to me.  Isolation from external sound was okay, but hardly impressive.  Given Amazon's easy return policies, to try a pair of headphones and send them back if they don't meet your needs is always possible.  Next time, I'll go to a store where I can listen to a bunch of different headphones and make a buying decision based on what I hear.  For anyone truly concerned about sound quality, this is probably the best approach.

VGreat sound, cheap build quality
p741
sg5
VThese are some great headphones, with the exception of their build quality. They sound amazing, with a very true flat tone that lets you actually hear the music and not be over-bassed. You can hear almost all the instruments and sounds in a song and live recorded shows (musical) having amazing sound. They also do a pretty good job of blocking out ambient noise around you. People with glasses, they press on the upper ear, so you'll have to adjust your glasses so you don't get a headache.My only problem is that with normal gentle use, they broke. The left side ear piece pulled out of the track with very little force and the chrome pieces on the inside just broke one day off one day with no reason. I expect a lot better build quality for the price of these headphones.

VThere is no doubt that these are a beautiful pair of headphones.  Sleek and classy looking.  They're not TOO large looking on the head like some other headphones in this style.  They come with a cleaning cloth to keep them looking shinning and new and a protective pouch which I love because I purchased these for my 12 year old son.  Although, he is the kind of kid that takes really really\u2026 good care of his stuff.  The pouch will prevent them from getting scratches.  The sound quality is amazing - the one time that he let me listen to them and the best thing about them to me is that when you have them on, and the volume is high, others around you won't be able to hear what you're listening to.  I would highly recommend these.

I used them today at work for 8 hours and they left my ears feeling very uncomfortable, but the main issue i had with them was the sound quality. They were not anywhere as good as my previous headphones, and for the pricetag of 200$ (not on sale) they did not beat my old $80 headphones.I suggest you check try out headphones at a store before purchasing, because i would definitely not have bought these even on sale if i had tried them beforehand.

VI've had these headphones for about 5 months now and I use them all the time; more often than other headphones I've had because they are comfortable, functional and sound great. After using them for a while I am most impressed with the range of music that sounds really good: I listen to everything; Beastie Boys, Vivaldi, MIA, Calvin Harris, Bach, Minor Threat, Daft Punk, Shins, Beck, etc., etc. It all sounds very good with these; not too much base, or too bright either. The dual jacks are a good feature allowing you to choose what side to have the cable, and the flat tangle-free cord really does not tangle. I would (and have) recommended them to anyone. At $150 it is a very good value; this is a quality product.

VGreat headphones right here. The Monster DNA On-Ear Headphones are one of the most stylish headphones out there. As for the sound quality, it's not bass heavy but it is clear. You can listen to any type of music genre with this. If you're one of those bass-heads I recommend having an Equalizer app to boost that bass on the headphones. I certainly did it on my phone and it sounds AWESOME. Now these are LOUD on max volume. I have a pair of SOL Republic Tracks HD and I can tolerate max volume with it but not with the DNAs. And for sound leakage, barely anything leaks out. What I've noticed is that these are more comfortable to wear for a long period of time than the SOL Republic Tracks HD.

When you buy these you also get speakers (Not really) They go super loud.I saw other reviews of this saying the padding wasnt good. But thats only if your in a hot enviroment. Also they cancel out alot of noise. when I have them all the way up without having them on in public the whole city can hear them, but when you put them on your ears it sounds like you just unplugged them to the world around you!

I now have two and soon I will order my third since the release of the Pros. The separation from Dre only helped to improve what Monster had begun to build. Trust me when I say you can't go wrong with these. After twenty plus years in the music industry I know how I want my music to sound and these are just right!!!!

Since then I've flipped over my bike, crashed it, my iPhone has gone flying with the headphones staying put, you name it I've probably done it to them and they still work amazing. I've had to replace the cable for them once but now I've gotta replace them cause the cushion is coming apart and they won't stay on.

Returned them and after hearing from a friend about these I thought to give these a chance. I bought these refurbished which was cheaper than what I paid for the Beats Solo. I'm not a professional when it comes to reviews but these instantly won my vote! The sound is just what I was looking for. Able to adapt to different genres. The bass when needed the acoustic when needed. Light weight. Made phones calls no problems. I'm happy with the purchase and met my expectations.

VNot only do these headphones look great, but they are incredibly comfortable. They expand to great lengths and fit on many different people, and the cushioning prevents your ears from feeling painful or tired (keep in mind, if you listen to music for 10 hours at length, your ears will always hurt...there is nothing to prevent that). Overall beautiful design that gets many compliments and really showcases the quality of Monster headphones. The main aspect is the sound - the quality is fantastic and works well at all volumes. Remember that these headphones are not meant to be noise canceling, but even so provide a good barrier against surrounding sound.

However, the price was far less than what I paid for mine $350.00+).  Would I trade?  No way!  Bose and Beats are still superior, but these are great for the kids at a fraction of the price.  (Got them for $80 on Black Friday)They have some nice perks like being able to switch the cord to either ear, and are compatible with the "i" products (Apple).  You can control the sound and pause from the cord if you're connected to an iPad, iPod, or iPhone.  The kids love them!

VThese headphones are amazing; everything about them. I owned a pair Beats Solo previously and they were pretty good, but after awhile they started to break and the bass started to go. So I started to look around and found these. I was amazed, the way they looked was great so I went out and tested them. They were everything I hoped for and more, the sound Is outstanding it feels and sounds like you are at a live concert. They are great from style, to sound, and easy to transport thanks to the unique way that they fold up. Once you get these you will never go back to beats, these overpower beats by every mean. 10/10

VReally really really bomb headphones. I never have had better headphones. The bass is nice, without compromising the highs and mids. One thing to be careful about is ripping the foam ear cups. Just take care of these headphones and they will not disappoint you. I use them primarily for gaming and it makes the in game audio much better.The dual audio jack is by far one of my favorite features of these headphones. It enables me to watch netflix with a friend through a phone/tablet without disturbing others around us.Great headphones, although that price is a bit steep.

VI love these headphones! The sound quality and bass is better than the Bose Noise Quiet Comfort headphones that I own. The noise cancelling ability on them are also as good.Pros: Great bass, great audio quality, folds up for easy storage, and allows you to hook up another headphone to it so 2 of you can enjoy the musicCon: I prefer "over the ear" style headphones, so these do cause some discomfort on the ears after wearing them for awhile. Key word "some."Overall: I would buy these before buying the Bose Quiet Comforts. Great headphones.

VI would love to give these headphones a five star rating but the truth is the quality of the sets are poorly made. The cushion around the ear piece is separating from the device. Unfortunately, Monster does not repair ONLY replace. And since I'm two days shy of the  warranty they  Are NOT willing to replace them. So...there goes $200! It doesn't affect the sound but it looks very tacky. If I can do it over I would not spend a lot of money on poor workmanship. There are other great headphones out there with better durability. However, the sound is awesome.

VI'm an audiofile. I've tried a lot of headphones, and these were the best I could find for the money (I purchased referbished). I had to return a pair of audio-technicas (bass-heavy) because they just sounded terrible. These headphones are comfortable, and really, really do sound amazing. It's not just a 'style' marketing thing, they actually work really well relative to the headphones in this price category. I used to own a pair of bose ($150), and these headphones have a better overall listening experience (I love deephouse, electro). My .02.

VI had heard of the Monster brand of headphones, but never really bothered with them until I saw on sale. I had been looking to replace my old headphones. Definitely reduces outside noise, but there are times when some of the outside noise can sneak in, this could be due to me having a larger head. Sound is great. I use it on my iPad with the mic/volume control cable. Music and movies sound crisp and clear and also works great with my Playstation 4. Definitely check these out if you are in the market for new headphones

VFirst off, the packaging and design of these things is pretty nice. I enjoyed opening these for the first time and I think they look good too. The sound quality is excellent for the price range. Bass deep and the quality is crisp. Though the eat cushions some times get a little tight over the ears (need to put my glasses on top of the headphone cushion) they're soft enough to be worth it.My favorite part is how there is no sound bleed. Crank them up and put them on, people around you won't be able to hear.

VAwesome headphones. My Beats Solo's broke in one ear, and since I've had them for a few years anyway, figured it was time for a replacement. After scouring the internet, watching video reviews and comparing products, I decided to give these headphones a shot. I like a lot of bass, and these certainly deliver a punch. That being said, if you do not want rib-cage shattering bass, you can also hear real clarity in studio-quality music. Overall, I'm impressed for the price point.TL;DR:no ragrats

VI bought these headphones for my girlfriend. After using them for a short while, myself, i am now really considering buying myself some as well. The volume can go up a lot louder than i expected  at the same time as it blocks out outside noises. The bass is incredible and can also go up really high withought overpowering the rest of the sound. Also, they are a nice snug fit which allows you to run with them and withought needing to re-adjust them every 10 sec.  I highly reccomend these headphones.

VI love these headphones! I have a pair in the teal/white and they are awesome looking. I prefer them to my beats because they don't have quite as much bass. Although they aren't over the ear, they are still pretty good at sound isolation. Some say they are overpriced but when I compare them to my Beats Studios, it's clear to me my DNA's are more worth my money. The sound clarity and build of these are AMAZING! Carrying case isn't as protective as other brands, but still a good addition.

VDNA Headphones are well balanced and clear. They are one of the clearest set of cans that I have ever tried. Beats, Skullcandy, and the like (designer headphones) are all comically unbalanced with overpowering lows and muddy highs. These DNA are great at reproducing the quality of studio headphones while looking great. The highs are nice and clear without being piercing and the lows are punchy but not too aggressive and the mids complement everything else nicely.

I replaced the cable with a third party from Amazon, but then the left ear went out... I had it about a year so very disappointed with the durability.

VI have to admit I am probably easy to impress.  I have been using earbuds with my iPod and I have found them to be very uncomfortable.  These are great, in comparison.  I might be just as impressed with a set costing 1/10 the price, but these are the ones I have and am enjoying.I love musicals and other music that tends to have a full orchestra.  The first song played after I plugged these in was one of Enya's.  Beautiful.  It was more distinct and clear than the earbuds ever allowed it to be.  That was followed by a song from Evita and then a song from Il Volo.  I felt like I had a front row seat.  I am using my iPod to help me through a walking program I have started.  These headphones will help to make that much more enjoyable.  It will also help to cancel some of the road noises I can hear usually.  Since I walk in my backyard, I won't have to worry about missing traffic noise that shouldn't be missed for safety reasons.If I wasn't impressed by the headphones themselves, I would have been by the packaging they came in.  WOW!  I have had jewelry come in less impressive packaging.  This is quite a display case.  It also comes with a bag to store them in as well as a cleaning cloth.  There is also a cable with an in-line mic. The cables shouldn't tangle. No batteries are needed.For those for whom this is important, there is a Made In China label, which I don't find surprising.  Are there any electronics not made in China?ETA:  Found one problem with the headphones.  I can't hear my phone.  My daughter called while I was walking and I did not hear it.  I also set the alarm for the length of time I want to walk and I can't hear when it goes off.  This is kind of a good news/bad news situation.  Nice that it blocks outside noises, but there are some you would like to have get through!  I do continue to be impressed by the quality of the sound.ETA (March 29, 2013):  I mentioned I only had the earbuds to compare the sound quality of these to, and these came out WAY ahead.  I now have an inexpensive pair of over-the-ear headphones I can compare them to.  These still come out WAY ahead, even to my untrained ear.  The inexpensive ones sound tinny, compared to the rich sound these provide.  I barely move the sound to the right when using these and I have to move it almost all the way to the right for a decent volume on the inexpensive ones.  The sound blocking of these helps with this, I'm sure.  The others block very little background noises.

VThe thing about the beats headphones is they have turned a market that hasn't exactly marketed itself very well in the last few years, to cater to itself. The people who buy beats or these kind of beats headphones are doing it for two reasons. Either they've seen their friends wear them or seen them on tv with dr. dre pimping them out, so somehow they must be good. The fact is that you're paying for a name, you could get a way cheap pair of headphones that have better quality, it just doesn't bring out the bling or name.I have used these headphones, and they are fine. Kinda odd looking, but okay. But not for the price they are trying to sell them at.

VBest Headphones - better than beats
p1066
sg5
VThese headphones have amazing sound. They hit the lows, highs ,and the kids unlike beats by dr dre are mostly lows. With me being a audiophile and having professional sound equipment and previously owning beats solo hd's, these headphones blow them out of the park. Definite buy if you like to hear music how it was made to be

Vim 16 and i listen to all kinds of music from dub step to country to r&b; to rap to rock and these headphones are perfect for all of these genres. when the beat drops trust me you wont be able to sit still. they sound great and if you have them adjusted right they dont hurt your ears. Ive owned beats. these are better.

VI love these headphones. They're comfortable and the sound is amazing. My only complaint is that I have not even had it a year and the plastic piece around where the headphones fold has already broken. This is why I only gave it 3 stars. For the price I paid I would have hoped the quality would have been better.

p1083

VFor anyone wondering, "are these better than beats?", of course they are! These headphones are a great pair of on-ear headphones. They might feel a little flimsy later on, but that shouldn't worry you. These headphones are very durable and I would recommend them to anyone, especially for this price.

VResponse to comparison of MDR V6
p1200
sg5
VI have both the DNA and Sony MDR V6. In fact I have owned MDR V6 headphones for the last 20 years and replaced them recently since they have always been a great set of monitor style headphones.I just A/B tested the Sonys (which cost less than half as much).The DNA are superior in warmth of midrange and overall tonal qualities IMO. They do have exaggerated bass, especially when compared to the Sony's which are a flat response monitor type headphone.The Sony's have a more detailed high end while the DNA is a bit more mellow and musical in the highs but not as pronounced.I did not test extensively and my tests were based on classical and electronic dance music.The two headphones sound very different. I would say for general listening I prefer he DNA although I think I you have limited funds you should buy the MDR V6 since they are a great performing set of headphones for much less money. In fact the MDR V6 are good enough that if you have not heard better headphones you may wonder if headphones NEED to sound any better. There is a reason they are used in studios and broadcast settings as the defacto monitor headphones for the last 20 years...But...I do not think these headphones are worth 200 dollars. I was given them as a gift. If I had 200 to spend I would be looking at stuff from Sennheiser, AKG or Grado aka "real"  headphone companies.

VI also have a pair of Diesel Vektr by Monster so I did a lot of switching back and forth on different songs to see how they compared. One of the most telling things about the DNAs what that after listening to them for a few minutes my teenage daughter the audio snob begged for them. She thought they were awesome. She wore out her Beats and likes these even better. So we both really like them. I am probably going to have a hard time keeping them though.- The DNAs are so much more comfortable. They feel so nice on my ears. The pads are so soft. I can wear them for long periods of time with no discomfort.- The DNAs are louder than the Vektr. With the same volume on the iPod they are louder. So top volume is louder as well.- There is more treble with the DNAs. I think I like this as well.- The DNAs seem fairly sturdy and well made. They come with a leather bag to keep them in.- I love the DNA's!

VAMAZING PRODUCT
p1854
sg5
VI read several reviews about these before purchasing them. I initially bought the sol republic Tracks V8's they were ok but they were returned today. I just opened the Monster DNA and all I can say is WOW! The construction of the headset is amazing. I sound is next level The highs are crisp and there is base but it doesn't muddy the sound. The only draw back is the remote is apple friendly only but the middle button does work with my windows phone. The volume is the only part not working. I got them at an amazing price too. I couldn't ask for a better musical experience.

VI only gave one star since I received a defective item.  My son opened them Xmas morning and I immediately noticed the defect before he removed them from the box.  The cushion on one ear phone was not sealed, revealing the inside foam cushioning. Very deflated!!! This is the one item he really wanted and requested these rather than the more popular Beats.  I requested an exchange however after looking through the reviews I see others have posted pics of the exact issue. However, I gotta say this is the only item I've ever returned from Amazon!

VEars get too hot wearing these (They sounds and look great though)
p2286
sg5
VLiterally the only complaint I have about these is that they get hot. I'm not seeing any other reviews mention this, but it's hard for me to believe I'm the only one with this problem. The sound blocking materiel give your ears no room to breath and it get's hot, really hot. I can't wear these longer than 30 minutes because my ears turn bright red and are burning from the heat. This is a big enough problem for me I returned them.Fit - I thought the fit was good. The padding on the ears made it comfortable to wear if you ignore the heat. I have small ears, so I can see why men or people with bigger ears would complain about the size. So If you want a pair I highly recommend going to the store and trying them on to see how they feel on you. (And do it for 30minutes and see how hot they get. Though it might be because they completely cover my small ears that it causes the extreme heat.)Sound - I'm no audiophile but they are definitely better than a $20 pair of headphones. The audio for talking was crisp and clear, the music was good, and for me the bass level was just right because too much bass makes me sick. If you prefer the crystal clear clarity over base than I think this is a good choice.I think this is important to mention when I see comments about static squeaking or what ever, if you are using this in your computer and you get that, it's not the headphones fault. It's electrical interference with you headphone jack port. I can't remember what exactly it was called again but the jack is too close to another device in your PC and it causes the screeching sounds.(and again seriously am I the only one who overheats from these headphones??????????)

VSo i got these in cobalt and grey for christmas, and i have been using them for over a month. Let me tell you a little secret ignore what the naysayers say. These are an amazing product. In my opinnion they are just as good if not better than beats. The audio quality can't get much better they aren't too bassy and not too flat and for my genres of music thats a good thing. They are noise isolating and the volume goes very loud. They are very comfortable very plush. And for only $150 you can't ask for much better. The design is also very cool. Just as good as beats if not better, 5 stars.

p2717
sg5
VThese headphones are great. I needed them and did not even know it. I love to listen to music on my iPod, play games on the iPod and play my electric piano. My children finally told me to get headphones to keep the sound down. These folding headphones are perfect. The actual head piece cushions are very soft and comfortable, I like them much better than ear pods. The outside noise is greatly reduced. I can't wait to try them on my next airplane trip. These headphones will certainly come in handy when I practice the piano. The kids and cats hate to hear that. The headphones come with two tangle free cables, which are soft and really do not tangle or kink. One cable is for non Apple products such as my electric piano and the other is a control cable for Apple products which means that the cable has been especially designed for  iPad, iPod, and iPhone. This cable also has a mic for answering calls. The other cable can be use to "daisy chain" with other headphones. Each earpiece has a cable jack so that either one can be used. I would recommend these headphones for anyone who needs headphones.

VDECENT SOUND BUT FLIMSY
p2752
sg5
VI've gone through a lot of headphones over the years as an active audiophile.  I can honesty say the sound is pretty good with decent bass.  However, already one of the headphones pops out of the side because of the flimsy plastic.  I bought these on sale but I much prefer my old V-moda headphones.  They seem indestructible and the sound is much better, (however, they do cover my entire ear, unlike these ones).Not recommended

VIt is a style thing
p2788
sg5
VI usually avoid reading reviews of other people before I write my own review, but this time I could not help it.  I never heard of Monster DNA headphones before, but others I know have, so I would say their brand image is known, by at least a few.  The controversy is, as far as I can tell, are these worth $200 or even $150?The package the headphones come in probably cost more to make than the entire cost of regular low-cost headphones.  I can only say the packaging will probably impress everyone, but is it worth it?  I really would not plan on keeping the box, so what is the point in expensive packaging?The first noticeable thing about the headphones themselves is the look.  I would even say these headphones are more known for their style than they are for the quality of their sound.  I think they look nice, but I would not pay one-fifth of the cost of these headphones for just style.My wife didn't care for the way they feel when wearing them.  This is to say, they have a nice snug fit and block out sound well, but she claims it made her ears hurt.  I have to agree, these do fit tight and block things out well, but they did not make my ears/head hurt.I really think all the high expectations come from the fact that these are very pricey headphones.  I think they sound good, but I really cannot say they are much better than the cheap headphones I have had in the past.My toddler destroyed two pairs of headphones I had (not on purpose).  He would like to use them, but a slight step on one pair and pulling the other pair a little too rough ruined them both.  While I have read that Monster DNA headphones are supposed to be very durable, I would not want my son to test them, as I fear he would find their weakness.  Being mostly made of plastic, they do not really look any more durable than the other two I had.

VThese headphones are great. I picked them up on a black Friday sale and its pretty damn good. I listen to metal and head rock and so far I've nothing to complain on the quality of the sound.There are a few cons, but the pros out weight it. If you see it on sale in $150 price range and want something with style and performance I'd recommend this. Otherwise just get a UE4000 or Audio Technica.

VPros:They sound amazingThey look greatThey feel strong and well builtThey are a great buy - worth every pennyYou can plug in your audio cable on either side (L or R) VERY convenient.Way better than Beats ANYTHING...Cons:If you have a really BIG head they will fit, slightly uncomfortable for long periods of time but it's not a huge issue.

VEven though theses headphones sound really nice they have such poor quality of durability I have got them replaced twice under a year because of one the ear piece is falling off after 3 months of having them and also the second time was the folding mechanism got loose after 1 month. So now that I am getting a 3rd pair I probably will just sell them.

VTremendous value as these were listed at $229 and I got them on Amazon for $99!!  Monster is more known for their digital cables, but man these have a great sound to them.  Excellent noise canceling.  My son has a pair of Beats and he tried these and was really impressed.  Use them for workouts, walking, hanging out or just listening.

VGreat headphones for sensitive ears
p2875
sg5
VFor years, I have searched for headphones for my hubby that won't hurt his ears. He hates the ear buds and most of the headphones that rest on your ears hurt after anything longer than half an hour. This is really annoying when he's watching a movie and his ears start aching halfway through. We tried a bunch of different brands that are rest over the entire ear or just on the ear. These are by far the softest headphones. They rest like pillows on your ears. The sound is also really good. For movies and tv shows, it sounds just like the TV on surround sound. It is clear and balanced. When listening to music, it is not as balanced. Still, it doesn't bother me much but then again I'm not a huge music person. I love to listen to music but am not well-versed in tone and bass. For me, I just want clarity and volume and these give both.The negatives? Well, the price is a huge one. These headphones are really expensive, especially when there are others out there for $10. So far, they have been sturdy which is a huge improvement from the typical $10-$20 ones. Also, these are not noise cancelling headphones. So if you're looking to put these on and not hear another thing, then you'll be disappointed.Overall, I think that these are a good purchase, but if they break...I think I would find a cheaper brand.

VI've owned these headphones for six months now,I never give my honest opinion until I've spent some time with the product. For 200 bucks, monster basically swindles you out of good quality headphones, honestly. I had a problem with these headphones from the first day, literally. The durability is pathetic in my opinion, it's only been six months and mine are all scratched and discolored, though I do overuse them. As for the quality, they are more flat line, which I appreciate, but the speaker blew a little bit so now I can hear it during some songs and in between songs. This happens when songs hit reasonable bass. I wouldn't give these to my worst enemy.I can't wait until I can afford to buy better (less expensive but still better) headphones.

p3180

VI agree with some of the other reviewers that many of the early reviews are probably a marketing scam. However, I did not find these headsets to be all that bad. My pair arrived last night and I took them to the gym today for use. Blocked out outside sound pretty well in the loud gym. Sound quality is great! I will warn that, even as advertised, these headphones are meant to play music more balanced. If you are looking for something that blasts base these are not for you. Personally, I really like the balanced sound. They weren't as uncomfortable as others said they were, one reviewer said they started hurting at 10-15 minutes but I didn't have this problem. You will feel them over time but just a quick slight adjustment and you are good to go. I gave these a 4 star because you can find better out thee for the price of these but I am certainly not disappointed by these sets.I will update this as time goes on.

VIf you want Monster, Check out INSPIRATION! DNA not worth it!
p3186
sg5
VI am want to make a 100% unbiased review of these headphones despite seeing all the rave on these which is complete crap.  First off, I bought two pairs of these on Black Friday for $75 per pair.  I used to own a pair of Monster Beats by Dre Studio headphones but they literally fell apart.  Studios cost $300 and I wasn't expecting the same sound, but what I heard from the DNA headphones was just plain AWFUL!  For all these reviewers on here that actually say these things have bass, you must all be crazy or you work for Monster.  Yes I know the breakup and split with "Beats" was nasty and "Beats" aren't made by Monster now, but I expected better from Monster.  There is a silver lining in the cloud though!  Monster headphones are just like Monster cables.  Most of them are overpriced junk but their insanely high priced cables actually perform quite well.  So with that said, Monster DOES make a good quality pair of headphones, they just aren't the DNA's.  Look up MONSTER INSPIRATION headphones!  All metal, no plastic!  BASS that you can actually feel as well as hear and yet they still produce good midrange and high sounds as well.  For the bad and good......  MONSTER INSPIRATIONS cost $349.95 at Best Buy and as they are much better in both quality and sound, they should be selling for more than the $299 Beats Studios.  BUT, the INSPIRATION is on clearance right now!!  $225 at Best Buy and $189 on Amazon with FREE SHIPPING.  I did get Best Buy to honor the Amazon price but either way, they are definitely in a whole different league than the awful sounding cheap plastic no bass ear cracking DNA headphones.  I am returning both sets of my $75 Black Friday DNA headphones because they are not even worth $75, so no they DEFINITELY are NOT worth $149-$199 as they are currently priced.

p3197
sg5
VI received these as a gift from a relative who has more money then sense, but I was intrigued with trying an over-priced and ugly set of headphones. What a disappointment. The set feels cheaply made and sounds horrible. I have a $15 set of JVC headphones I purchased for a trip last year, and they're easily on-par with these. Mind you, I didn't ruin my ears by listening to loud rock music in my teenage years. These headphones sound bland, hissy in the treble, and much too strong in the bass. There's no discernible mid-range, so forget about vocal music or audio-books. Utter crap. Thankfully, there was a gift-receipt.

VForty dollars? Maybe. But even headphones around that price range will sound better than this. At the most. But spending $200 on this would be insane! The sound quality is not good, especially in the base levels. Music just sounded so... hollow with these on. They were somewhat comfortable, though not the best. And that triangle look? Not impressive at all!I have some BOSE AE2 headphones, which cost about $50 less. The sound quality is far superior, as is the comfort. At $200 I would at least expect some noise cancellation features, but this does not have it. That said, neither does the BOSE, but those aren't selling for two Benjamins.I can't recommend this. Stay away and look at something else. Even the Beats On-Ears for this same price is better, and I wasn't a fan of the Beats either.

VMy Non-Audiophile Review for Those who Want an ActuallyRelevant Review
p3299
sg5
VI bought this item because my dad had his Beats stolen, and he needed a new pair. I gave him my Beats (my review is there under the Red Solo HD page) and bought these as a replacement. I'm NOT and audiophile OR a paid reviewer,  and I thought the Beats sounded good. However, when I got these, my mind immediately changed on how much I like the Beats. These sound much better, in my opinion. (I'm comparing againsts the Solo HD Beats and occasionally the Studios.) The sound is more clear (makes SO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE), Dubstep sounds better, bass is still thumpin', guitars sound good, voice sounds good, and they get really frickin loud. Like Studios loud. They are also very comfortable, but a little small. If you have a large head, they might not fit. I love how I can change the side I put the wire on. The included wires are silver colored and flat. This causes little to no tangles.All in all, these headphones are better that Beats (Solo HD) and there is no reason to get Beats over these.

VTrade in Your Beats for DNA's Now!
p3321
sg5
VHere is the real deal folks.  The Dre Beats were produced by Monster.  Monster and Dre ended their relationship (5 year contract)earlier this year based on Monster's desire to produce a better headphone (w/ Viacom as a partner) using the same and/or better technology they used in manufacturing the Beats (they even kept the same engineers).  Allegedly, Monster also believed they could not market Beats to music pro's because Beats marketing targeted the sucker parents of the 11-14 year old range (the exception may be the "Studio" line of Beats).  In short, the Beats are marketed to 11 to 14 year old's as the "cool thing" to have whereas the Monster DNA's are marketed to pros in the Music Industry (watch any of the pro music shows not sponsored by either Monster or Dre  and you will see what I mean).  I have no idea who is currently manufacturing the Beats at this point. Just thought this background may help in decision making.I always believed Monster overpriced it's products to the point I stopped buying their cables and other products.  However, the Monster DNA's are a big exception.  The quality of the sound compared to the Beats is not so much better that you should not get the Beats if you can get them in the $50-$75 range for the Solos or $125-$150 range for the Studio's, especially for kids.  However, the DNA's are simply better in nearly every aspect to include ergonomics, clarity, sound, tone separation, and even packaging.  The sound is incredible.  I can hear every detail distinctly. The sound is simply better than if I was actually at a U-2 concert front center.  The noise isolation is 100%, without exception, perfect- like I am the only person in the world (do not wear these while driving- ever). I compared the sound difference (by listening, not reading specs) between the DNA's and all the Beats.  Hands down, the DNA's win on all accounts, especially when listening to high quality encoded uncompressed audio files. However, the Beats did have overpowering Bass for those who only want to hear bass and lose other sounds.  It is worth mentioning that I compared brand new DNA's to the line of Beats that were already "broken in."  These headphones require some time to break in and achieve optimal sound.  The Beats "Studio" line came closest to matching the DNA's in my opinion. But, the Studio's are over $300- yet still do not beat (no pun intended) the DNA's in my opinion.The build quality of the DNA's also feel much sturdier and they fold up nicely. They are also lighter than the Beats.  Compared to the Beats, the only drawback I could find with the DNA's is that they use a smaller gauge audio cable than the Beats; yet, Monster produced the cables for the Beats (go figure).  Worth noting on the DNA's is the ability to swap out earpieces as well as share the headphones via second audio output.  Monster provides both a carrying bag as well as a second audio line for sharing.  The primary audio line has an inline volume control as well.I could add another 500 words easily comparing published specs.  However, you can research that if interested. My real world comparison and testing makes the Monster DNA's the hands down winner.

p3336

VMy son begged and begged for xmas for some beats. The solo's were $200 and felt kinda cheap. I told him if we were going to do this we were going to best buy to check out all the headphones they had and give them a good test. I knew that he just wanted beats for the name since everyone else had them. We tried prob 10 different sets of headphones, including beats studio and solos. The DNA's are amazing. They sound great no matter what type of music you are listeneing too. The beats are very 'bass-y' if that makes sense. They sound great listening to rap but listening to rock sounds a bit different. They had the DNAs on sale for xmas at $150 so for the price we tried them. We've had them for over a month now and they are still great. Love that you can change the cord out if it starts to get worn, they fold up into a smaller size easier to carry and you can buy skins for them to change the colors. The quality of these headphones in hand is awesone. They are very sturdy feeling. I watched a video were someone took the a twisted them in either direction as hard as they could and they didnt break. I totally believe that they could do that but since i paid so much for them Im not going to test that theory. Overall they are a great purchase!! I would recommend them to anyone. (I also heard that Monster made the Beats line of headphones when they came out. I was told that their contract with beats is now up so they are making their own line of headphones. Beats are no longer made by Monster)**Revision** Forgot to mention but unlike beats if you are wearing and listening to the DNA headphones, you get very minimal noise leakage to the others that are around you. IT is great considering my son has an awful taste in music. :)

VMy two kids received these for Christmas and they absolutely love them. It seems to me that they were made to be in direct competition with the Beats Solo's. I think they look better and sound better than Beats. Are they worth the $200 price tag? Personally, I don't think any headphones are worth that but it is what it is! At least they have a unique look with great colors and my kids love them. I have worn them and think the sound quality is great and they are very comfortable to wear. They feel like they are solidly constructed and came with a very nice carrying case. You can also connect the headphones together and listen to the same thing which the kids have done on occasion. I would recommend the Monster DNA's above Beats any day! And for the record, this is my first review but seeing some of these negative comments made me want to offer my opinion. I am comparing these to Beats because #1, it seems to me that those are the direct competition and #2, those are the only other headphones I've really listened to. I'm not a big techno person, just a mom giving an honest review of my opinion and that of my tween kids!

VI have probably 10 different pair of headphones, one for sport, one for DJ, one for travel, etc, but my favorite are the new on-ear DNAs by Monster. These blow away all the Beats headphones.  The style of these is total next generation, the comfort is great, the sound is AMAZING...really crisp and clear. I listen to Hip Hop, EDM and Alt and every tune is amazing with these headphones. Beats are very bassy and distort on the low end - not great when the volume rises. Also the DNAs have great passive noise cancelling. I can barely hear a baby cry on the plane two rows away. Sickest part of the DNAs is that the ear pieces swap out and you can customize them to you look...pretty sweet!

Hits the bass perfect for me and highs are incredible!  I hear things in songs I never knew were there!Country: Listened to some Carrie Underwood....as amazing as she is, this just amplified her vocals and highlighted her background instrumentals.Classical: I played a bit of Danny Elfman because it's the closest I had to an orchestra type of sound. From the Alice in Wonderland soundtrack, this was fantastic! Great drum lines amplified by high tones and mids that never hit too high or drowned out with a rattle.Rap: B.I.G. probably one of the greatest in my opinion and when it came to bass, this was top...hit the lows hard and heavy!Pop: Ellie Goulding was who I choose in this genre. Love her new album and the mids are perfect, showing off her vocal talent and you can hear everything crystal clear as if it were live.Alternative: For this I thought I would be concerned because these headphones do have a prevailent bass to them. However, when I played a bit of Fun, it was great! Now this band has heavy beats to begin with in some of their songs, and these made it hit hard when needed and faded to the mids and highs appropriately.Videos: I watched a few videos too. ALL came in clear and pristine! some better than others depending on the genre, however I enjoyed some of my favorite songs even more with these on.Movies: like a movie theatre! If not better...I can hear every little sound effect and every background element...great for action movies like Hungar Games.This has got to be my favorite pair i've owned so far in the last few years.  Great buy and highly recommended!

VI don't own these and I don't plan to, but I suggest that if you are in the market for headphones then you defiantly shop around a bit. I know more or less what a complete crap review looks like, and most of the 5 star reviews are complete crap. Seriously. Do some shopping. More expensive does not necessarily mean better, and I would question the mental constitution of anyone who would pay $200 just for music.EDIT: Okay I realize this may need revision as I believe I came off as too harsh on audiophiles, which was not my intent. I relize that there are three hundred dollar headphones out there that are worth every penny for some people. My main problem with these is that so far as I can see, this page is not actually selling headphones so much as they are selling a brand name. There is no info provided other than the fact that it has noise canceling capabilities and it comes in lots of pretty colors. I would be much less cynical is there were actuall technical specifications, i.e. driver size, frequency range, etc., to give proof that it is worh the cost.

VAmazing Quality

VNot only are they a beautiful style but great quality too as well. I really like to find loud headphones with great sound and this is it! I tested them next to my brothers beats and they're louder (at about 20% sound i can hear the song perfectly) and have better sound and alot more comfortable. When i used to use my brothers beats while working out since i was sweating they would suction to my ear and pop them all the time but these babies i dont even feel them. A genius from the apple store recommended them too and who can argue with a genius ;) Btw if you dont know monster is the same company that makes beats (the beats have the same logo on the side just incomplete without the headphones on top).

VGreat Quality Sound Headphones

VI find it kinda childish and phishy that the 2 negative reviews on here are from the exact same day and for the same color headphones, we know that person for some lame reason really wanted to try to knock these headphones down. But to no avail, these headphones are real quality, the sound is truly studio quality and the look for most im sure is cool. The triangle design is different, not necessarily cooler though than other great headphones but the sound ranks right up there with IE: Soul, Beats, Pioneer, Technics, Street by 50 cent, Sennheiser, Numark, Sony and so on but its about sound quality, and these monsters deliver. Whether your DJing, recording in the studio, flying on an airplane or listening to music at home, these headphones sound are true in every aspect. I would recommend these headphones to anyone, and They are a nice addition to my or anyones collection. The Soul and Technics headphones are my favorites but I have 14 different pairs of studio headphones and the sound quality in these ranks right up there. Enjoy
