VNice sound, fit, but don't get caught wearing them when the sound source goes silent.
p74
sg5
VThe earphones have good sound with good range.  The recharge is within a reasonable period of time.  And I can wear the phones for a couple of hours at a time without them becoming uncomfortable.  I bought two units so that my wife and I could both have a pair.  One nifty bit about it is that we can share our source of music with each other...  One of us can start streaming on a frequency, but both headphones can be tuned in.I'll be keeping the headphones, but I must admit, there are things about them I don't much care for.1) The bulky recharge station has the appearance of a 20th century left-over that looks like an old steam iron, and has a massive footprint.2) If you position the station incorrectly, you get random interference, much like not quite being able to tune a radio station, and it fades in and out; and when it fades out, there is a varying degree of hissing-static noise.3) When the sound-source goes silent, the tower appears to stop broadcasting a signal, and that makes the headphones pick up static.  This happens quite suddenly, and the transition from silence to ear-splitting hissing-static can be anything from annoying to downright painful.  The noise level is sufficiently loud enough that my ears continue to ring, even without the headphones on, for a good hour.

VA co-worker recommended this to me as she has had it and enjoys watching tv in bed, but her husband doesn't want to hear the tv.  It could not be any easier to install (less than 5 min.) and it's very user friendly (simple).  The headband has ample cushioning on both the ears but also the top of the head.  Sound is fantastic quality.  Our tv does not have a soundbar, and listening through the headphone was a higher quality than the tv.  Very glad we purchased it.

VI read the reviews and still opted to purchase these headphones.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am.  Yes, they work and they charge well.  Aside from that I would not recommend them.  They don't cover my ears completely and constantly slip off.  The sound is so basic, offering no stereo quality whatsoever.  If you pause the tv, you will receive an annoying hissing sound out of the headphones.If you want the basest of sounds from uncomfortable headphones, these are for you.

When orderingMAKE CERTAIN your flat screen has more than one AUDIO out connector, we use a sound bar with our Sony due to poor T.V. audio and must disconnect sound bar to make use of headsets hookup!  On a personal note buy these any time other than XMas, seller jacked price to twice what it currently listen for...unreal!

p206
sg5
VThe sound is good when tuning is precisely set; it can be easily bumped off the desired location. The charging  mount position is a little skittish and this requires better placement attention than one may think. But if you pay attention to these things I found that the range and comfort both make these drawbacks worth it. I hope quality is lasting for a long product life since I like using it but have only had it about three weeks.

VI bought these for my husband for Christmas. Our TV is right outside the bedroom door and he doesn't like to watch TV at night because he's a night owl and I'm usually in bed by 10 and he doesn't want the noise to bother me. So I bought him these and they are great! I think some other reviewers mentioned a hissing noise, but there is a tuning knob on the side that you're supposed to use. If it's not tuned right you will hear hissing, just like a radio, but when you tune it correctly there's no hissing and they sound great.

VThis is my third set of Sennheiser headphones.  I use them to watch TV while working in the kitchen at night after i have put my kids to bed and need to minimize noise, or any other time i'm doing something noisy in the kitchen and want to be able to hear the TV. (I don't usually get to sit down to watch TV!)  The two sets i previously owned have lasted approximately 7 years each, with about 5 hours' use per week. I have dropped them occasionally on the kitchen floor, but no other abuse. They have been very reliable and consistent. All three pairs have looked and worked exactly the same - except - i've noticed that this third pair have a slightly shorter range, even though the model seemed to be higher & more expensive than my previous pairs. If i go to the garage or upstairs, i get moderate static now, whereas with my previous 2 pairs that didn't happen. But i can live with that. They have been so reliable and easy to use that i haven't considered buying any other brand when its been time to replace them.

VI used to think these headphones were great. I admit, I used them a lot, but right after the 2-year-warranty was up, every time I put brand-new batteries in them, they work well for maybe five hours, then the volume doesn't want to work right, you can't dial them in, and then boom: You take the back off of them and check the batteries, and for whatever reason, the past three packs of batteries I've put in them have corroded.(And of course, if it would've happened a month ago, they'd still be until warranty...)Save money and buy the RCA ones. They don't fit quite as well on your head, but I bought them for my parents, and they do the job just as well for less.I used to think Sennheiser made reputable products, but perhaps they are of the ill reputation.

No-hassle, crystal clear, well balanced sound.(2) Very easy setup.(3) Excellent value relative to slightly less expensive products.CONS:(1) As others have mentioned, these are clearly designed for stationary viewing/listening.  Stability is an issue with these headphones.  They are not ideally suited for treadmill use or walking around.(2) I have an average sized head and these are slightly too large for me.CONCLUSION:While the technology, price, and setup are truly excellent, the headphone design, comfort, and fit is well below average.

VSave Time and Print the Return Label Now
p356

VLow quality. Unit was dead on arrival. Completely dead! Couldnt even get a power light. After testing, i determined the power adapter is defective. How absolutely lazy and cheap do you have to be to not test the power adapter before packaging.Gave this as a birthday present. Happy Birthday. Now all you have to do is print a return label, repackage everything, drop off the bad unit and wait another week. Enjoy!!!!Besides the abysmal quality control, the unit feels C-H-E-A-P... The foam ear piece coverings look like they will rot and deteriorate quickly and whats up with the tuning knob? Did you know you have to TUNE the headphones to the transmitter like you did with AM radios in the 30s?News flash. Welcome to the 21st century. I expect these units to automatically digitally lock on to the correct frequency just like my cheap $10 bluetooth headphones.And if that wasnt enough. Turn the headphones on with the base station off and instead of getting complete and total silence (because there is no signal), you get your ears blown out with white noise.If you long for the "good ole days" of Jack Benny, short wave radio, swing time music, and ears throbbing from loud white noise, this unit is for you!!!

Listened to some opera : audio quality in the satisfactory-but-not-great range, but I expected that to be the case,  so not a disappointment. The big selling point here is the fact that they're wireless,  they work and the battery recharges right on the stand.

He now can hear the tv and even walk into another room and still be able to hear what they are saying on a show.

VBought these to  watch TV without disturbing the wife.  I was drawn to the great reviews and 300' range claimed.  I was very disappointed in both the noise and distortion of the sound in the headphones.  I'm not an audiophile--I don't expect it to be perfect but this was just unusable for me.  I replaced this with a cheap-o bluetooth transmitter and a pair Sony bluetooth headphones--Bluetooth doesn't have the range of this device, but the sound quality was 1000% better.  I did attempt to "fix" this by changing the transmitter frequency, and fooling with the tuning on the head set, but nothing came close to a usable sound. I think the core of the problem is that this device uses analog radio to transmit the sound.  The device seems to be crippled by any sort of RF interference.  I would have expected there to be some sort of filtering in the device especially given the $80 price point.

VEasy setup and works very well. Bonus is that you're given 2 different ways to configure this headset: send all the sound to the headset or, send sound to both TV speakers and the headset. Fidelity is very good too, I'm now hearing sounds that I hadn't noticed before. Heads-up: if you pause whatever you're watching, after several seconds the headset will revert to static. Easy to fix, right after you restart your show, move the "Tune" dial slightly to hear audio. Apparently the frequency / channel between the transmitter and the headset is only active when audio is active.

VSennheiser RS120 wireless headphones
p613
sg5
VFirst set arrived previously opened and DOA.  Replacement set is FANTASTIC!  I am a die hard "Bose" owner, but these wireless headphones have wonderful base, crisp trebles and crystal clear voice.Out of the box they are a pain in the rear to get them to charge on the charging stand.  Once you have worn them however they spread apart more and only have to be set on the stand and they will charge.The headphones are made with the utmost quality and comfort in mind.  I often just put them around my neck from behind and they are plenty loud enough to hear.  When placed on the head of the user correctly, others sitting in the vicinity cannot hear them at all.Great wireless headphones!  Highly recommend!!!

The only "problem" I had is once when I had the headphones on but no sound output from the TV, I actually picked up a neighbor's cordless phone conversation. I couldn't find the frequency listed anywhere k but apparently it's the same as some cordless phones. Just something to keep in mind. Once I tuned the headphones and the TV sound came back, I lost the phone conversation.

VThese are decent but you have to set your expectations correctly:1. These are not around the ear headphones, I would classify them as giant on ear headphones. The sponge surface is flat throughout.2. Because they are giant on ear headphones they may slide off when you lean forward (to pick up a sock for example)3. There is no indication when the batteries are fully charged, the red light is always on when charging.4. They are open back headphones, which means no sound isolation, you will hear outside noises and others can hear the audio coming out of them faintly. This could be a positive and negative, I like to be able to hear when my daughter is calling for help with her homework.5. The instructions say that initially you have to charge the batteries for 24 hours, so you can't use them right away.6. I would have loved to see an aux input, so I can quickly plug my phone and use them as wired headphones.7. I paid 72.99, no tax, free shipping here on amazon and I think it was a decent purchase.

p697
sg5
VWorks well most of the time, though there are occasions where the headset loses sync with the base station, and when that happens it gives out a loud hissing sound (you have to turn on and off again). Doesn't happen often but when it you definitely notice it!Range is decent. When used in a house with lots of walls you can probably get a good 30 feet before losing connection.Sound quality is pretty good and the ear piece is comfortable for long wear (30-60 mins) despite being made of foam.

VReReview from 2 to 4 stars
p709
sg5
VI'm ReReviewing this product. I'm going from 2 to 4 stars. I'd make it 5 stars save for the documentation. I returned the first set because the ON light didn't seem to work. I asked for a replacement. It did the same thing. At which point I contacted Sennheiser and they promptly returned my email with a 3 page explanation and helpful hints. They refer in the doc of an auto-on feature but its very poorly described.Turns out the green ON light only comes on when the Audio hookup is detected and its working correctly. It DOES NOT come on just because the unit is plugged in?!?! I have now recharged and setup the second unit and it works great!!Another poorly documented setup item is the charging of the headphones. I thought the headphones charged wirelessly. I did not connect the metal frame with the fact that the headphones have metal contact points and must be centered in order to charge. If either of the earpieces are extended they will not sit properly in the cradle and not charge. Therefore, the earpiece extensions should be pushed back in before cradling the headphones.Once I understood the configuration, they worked great. The sound is very sharp and crisp and the phones are very comfortable.

VFirst is that they don't have enough ear padding to feel overly comfortable.
p715
sg5
VI bought this headset to watch in bed while my wife slept. I had them for about a month before I sent them back. Took off 2 stars for two reasons. First is that they don't have enough ear padding to feel overly comfortable. I am bald and have watched tv in bed for up to 6-8 hours at a time and my head and especially ears are very sore after that long of viewing. I have been disabled for about 4 months so I wanted something that I could lay down in bed to watch with. The sound and clarity was good and it was easy to set up and use. The deal breaker for these that led me to buy a Sony brand was that after a few minutes of my show (either a movie or Netflix usually) being paused the headset disconnects in a fashion and you are hit with an earful of loud static. These probably have slightly better sound and reception than the Sony version I am currently using. The Sony MDRRF985RK for about the same price. But I am staying with the Sony due to the extra cushion on the headset and the fact that they just go quiet after about the same amount of time rather than go static. I would prefer to go with a higher end seinnheiser but couldn't afford them at this time. Hope this helps someone looking for these at this price range.

VGreat for my Grandfather
p727
sg5
VI bought these headphones for my grandfather because his hearing is poor and we don't want him to blow his TV speakers out, plus we want to be able to hear. He has had many different sets of headphones and all of them are collecting dust in a box somewhere. This set is different for a few reasons. First of all, they was a lot easier to plug in to his DVR then some of the others have been, of course those ones were from many years ago and technology has come a long way. The next point he liked was the charging dock and how easy it is to use since he doesn't have to plug them in or anything like that. The tuning is easy and the sound quality is fantastic. He can actually hear his TV and they aren't turned all the way up and that is really a plus for all of us. He also likes that they just sit on top of his ear because the ones that encapsulate his ears just do not fit. The only complaint that he has is that they do not have a volume adjustment for each ear individually. His right ear is worse than this left and so what is good for the right is a little to loud for the left. That is why I give this product a 4 star because that might one day be enough to get him to stop using them. However, these are currently a hit with him and that is important to me. I think they are a good product and a good purchase.

VBeware of Volume Control Problems
p756
sg5
VI purchased two of these (not from Amazon). Although the sound quality is excellent and very comfortable to wear, the volume control broke after a few months and in the same manner on both of them. As you move the volume up & down, the balance changes and you hear a lot of static.Don't buy is my recommendation. I really wanted to give it 5 stars for everything else that works to my liking, but the above problem is just not acceptable. I used to see it on cheap electronics in the 80's. I was not expecting that from Sennheiser!

p767
sg5
VI brought these headphones years ago but never used them.  I finally decided to break em out and try em out.  There are a few things I like about them and a few things I dont...  Please keep in mind that I am not an expert in electronics.What I like:I like that they are wireless.I like that they are charged while stored on its little docking arm.It got a pretty good range on it once its tuned correctly. We've got an average sized house. With the base stationed in the living room, we can make out back to the garage which is at the back of our average sized backyard.What I don't like:I can only connect it to my cell, tablet and computer. It wouldn't connect to my Samsung LED TV and this is why I broke it out in the first place!Unfortunately, it doesn't have Bluetooth and I cant add it. it would be nice so I can just Bluetooth to my cell or tablet instead of unplugging and plugging in... It becomes aggravating after awhile.The headphones aren't noise cancelling.  I thought they were.  Again, the description may have stated this.. I don't remember.Ah, they are OK.... But I was really let down when I realized they were noise cancelling. I was hoping to cancel out the noise in house whenever I watch a movie, which is once in blue moon.

VI bought this for my spouse.  His hearing is not what it used to be.  Often he needs to turn the TV up so loud it bothers me.  Especially if I want to go to sleep before him.  This was the perfect solution.  The charging base plugs into the wall and the TV (our TV has headphone jacks which is pretty common on newer flat screens, but check first).  When you use the headphones, you can take them off the charging base and they are wireless.  They are comfortable and work great.  I highly recommend them!

p869

VI purchased in September, 2009.  I've used then every night since.  They're comfortable, lightweight, and provide very good sound.  The tuning is a little touchy, so getting it dialed in just right can take a minute, but once you do, sound is great and they stay tuned.They're really only good if you stay in the room, but you don't need a direct line of sight.  I keep the charging stand behind the television. You can also get a second headset without a second transmitter.I've used it on 4 different televisions, and I've always plugged the transmitter into the tv directly.  It has never caused the tv speakers to shut off. (Philips, Samsung and Vizio models).Also, the batteries are standard AAA rechargeables.  Six years in, and they're still strong.  I've never replaced them.  But, when the kids have left the headphones turned on and they've lost charge, I can just throw in 2 AAAs and I'm fine.

VWorks...sort of. The main problems are (1) Power connection is sketchy at best, and is very hard to get and keep connected. It is hard to understand why they choose to have a removable power connection, but hardwired audio input connection on the base unit. Makes no sense. (2) The channel selection dial on the headphones is touchy, your best bet after getting a decent connection (if you can get one without significant background hiss) is to place some tape over the dial so it doesn't move when you are wearing the headphones. (3) They are really cheaply made in general, so they are not the most comfortable things, nor the best sounding.Having bought them for my mother as a gift, I would definitely not recommend these, and would return them if I could, now that I have seen them.

I'm not an audiophile and am not too picky about sound, but it was a bit tinny and often had a hiss that I couldn't get rid of.  I guess the price isn't bad for the quality. My two chief complaints are: Mine wouldn't sit properly on the charger unless I adjusted both sides of the headset before I put them on it.  And I'm not a big fan of the frequency dial being mere millimeters away from the volume knob.  I've mixed the two up quite a few times.  I need something a little bit more user friendly.  I'm returning my pair to upgrade to a higher model.

VUnreliable for long term use.  Product stops working and does not perform as described.  Very difficult to use, does not cup the ear, plus sound is inadequate.  Product doesn't quit until after 30 day return policy is over, so now we're stuck without being able to return or complain.

VBought these for my husband for Christmas.He wanted them to be able to watch TV at night without bothering me when I read. He loves them. The sound quality is superb. He said it's like being in the movie theater. He is also able to get up and move about and the sound doesn't break up at all. The one and only drawback is not being able to switch off and on between the headphones and the TV sound unless he turns them off at the base. Could be just our TV or we need an adaptor of some sort. Other than that minor nuisance he loves them and praises them all the time

VI live in a high rise apartment and purchased these for watching TV while I use my exercise bike in my apartment.  They are light, comfortable and the sound is excellent and so much better than listening to the TV volume setting on 20.  They come with rechargeable batteries and charge in the rack.  The only negative I can come up with is that the charger doesn't have the ability to tell you "charging is complete".

VI got these almost 2 years ago, and have been using them ever since, at least 3 to 4 hours or more nearly every day.  They still perform perfectly and I have no complaints.  The small issue that they fall off if you bend over is true, but not really bothersome.  I wish there were a way for me to continue to use them with my new audio equipment, but it has no headphone jack or rca stereo output jacks.  I have tried using the optical audio out jack with an adapter to rca analog stereo jacks, but have had no luck with the results.  Is there a solution out there?  Probably, but I haven't found it yet. I still would recommend these, as they have never failed in the nearly two years that I have used them, and I will still search for a way to connect them successfully to my newer equipment.

VSound is good & clear.  Installation is easy.  Sometime the tuning can be a little tricky, even with the receiver less than 10' away (direct line of site).  The head band is a little too large, despite having what I consider a large head (even with the head band fully retracted).  I did notice that a little tuning time spent & you can amplify the sound quite a bit.Overall, pleased.

VBought this for my 83-year-old dad to use whilst watching TV.  The sound is great, as is battery life and charging convenience.  But why - oh, why! - did they make the frequency tunable?!  These days, it's pretty standard to have everything on a PLL or crystal control and have the frequencies dead-on.  Sometimes, Dad turns the wrong knob, and I have to go over and re-tune it.Still, there's nothing else in this quality range that sounds this good that isn't bluetooth (yes, folks - I did NOT want to have to deal with pairing and lip-synch issues with a TV!)

VI like these and they've probably saved my marriage. The sound is good and they have a long range. The cons are that they can feel warm on your head and they certainly aren't feather weight. The other problem that could have been easily avoided is the fine tuning wheel being directly under the volume wheel, it's so easy to hit the wrong wheel and have to retune the whole thing. It happens so often that I'm thinking of getting it exactly where I want it and than taping it. It would have been better to have the fine tuning on the side with the on and off switch.

VGood Quality Headset with good range, but has a few issues.
p1084
sg5
VSo my wife bought this for me for Christmas here from Amazon. I record and stream a lot so having a wireless headset with decent sound is nice. Wires always get in the way as I move around.So the sound on these things are pretty darn good. Not as good as some high end headphones, but excellent for wireless.The range is very good.  The wife put them on and walked from my office at one end of the house to the other, and said everything was crystal clear.I will say that after long sessions I have had a few moments where I got a brief bit of interference or something, but it was minor and not too big an issue. Not sure if I am too close to the base station. So I will be playing with location for it.Another issue which is minor, is that the tuning nob is right next to the volume. So it is very easy to accidentally hit the tuning nob and lose audio completely when you are looking at using the volume nob.A bigger issue is that at times it seems like the device likes to adjust the audio levels on the fly. I don't know if it thinks something is too loud, but at times when I am playing a game I will lower the in game audio to get things how I like and then the headset audio changes later.  It is annoying and doesn't happen all the time, but I am trying to isolate the cause here.My biggest gripe and it is VERY annoying. If there is no audio for 3-5 minutes the base station shuts off. When this happens the headset just starts blasting static white noise. It can be loud and very annoying. If all you do is listen to music, or play a game with constant sound/music you will be fine. But I guarantee at some point it will shut off because of lack of audio and then you will be blasted with white noise.  As soon as more audio goes to it, it turns back on. Would love a way to disable this "feature". Or at least it should disable the headset audio so you don't hear white noise.What I ended up doing was writing a little program that every 170 seconds (little less than three minutes) it plays a 12KHz audio file out the speakers. This is inaudible to humans but registers with the headset so I never have the issue with the base station powering down.  Although I really shouldn't have to do this.It is a good headset and comfortable. I would give it 5 stars if they fixed all the above issues.  4 stars if they at least fixed the timeout.As long as you are aware of these issues, and they don't bug you, or you work around the one like I did..  This is a good headset.

VQuite the challenge to get to work properly...
p1131
sg5
VTuning this is like tuning a radio that keeps on changing stations involuntarily. In front of the "charging dock" aka the "white base thing" there is a white switch keep in the middle and have the headphones tuned towards the middle to have the best quality sound (I found through trial an error). If you move a lot or if you are earting I often hear static that really pulled me from my movie, I'm also 5 feet tops from the "charging dock device". When tuned don't mess with it, but you often do have to since you still hear slight static that is extremely bothersome. Their not that comfortable either especially if you are a glasses user. If you want the best wireless experience while watching a bluray/netflix and don't mind spending the extra buck buy yourself a console and look at headsets for that device (TurtleBeach etc..). Now the Installation... It's simple but the instructions over complicate it, the cable with the yellow end goes on the bottom of the "charging dock" keep in that mind. The headphones are also quite loud, as in if you have them on they still make considerable sound around you. In the end once you have them tuned and if they don't act up they do fit their advertised purpose. Hope this helps.

Now, nothing will work and they do not charge (red light doesn't light up).  The headphones are a bit uncomfortable and clunky and stiff, but I was willing to deal with that in order to have wireless sound in the bedroom for when my wife went to sleep.  I have been a loyal Sennheiser consumer for over 35 years, but now I am very unhappy.  I no longer have the box so I don't know if it can possibly be returned.  In summery,  I cannot recommend this product.

VA cheap pair of headphones masquerading as Sennheisers
p1178
sg5
VThis product does not live up to the Sennheiser name. Between weak signals, mediocre sound quality, and a completely analog tuning system, these headphones are more like a $20 off-brand than a pair of Sennheisers. Additionally, the level threshold for the auto shutoff is way too high, resulting in loud, jarring white noise after a few moments of quiet, such as when scrolling through Netflix looking for a movie to watch. Sennheiser should have made the tuning mechanism digital to silence the white noise. I highly recommend NOT purchasing these headphones, at least not for the $70 price that I paid.

VThere is a "tune" adjustment that is very sensitive and you will be lucky if it does not move.  The frequency does not "lock" automatically so every time you need to use these you better have a steady hand and try to tune to the frequency of the transmitter.  The power plug is very difficult to insert.  Almost impossible for my 76 year old mother...Also the head set is bulky.  I would expect better quality from a German manufacturer: these are the worst headphones I ever had.Most important: Left channel stopped working after 42 days.  I don't even have the packaging to return so I guess I just burned $75...

VI had bought these headphones for my husband as a gift and wasn't able to get them to work from the minute we opened them. There was so much static that we couldn't get a clear signal and barely could hear the little bit of sound we could get from the television. I would not recommend them. I was very sad they didn't work, my gift was a flop.

VPoor Headphones - Tuner Distoration hurt ears - Don't WASTE your hard earned Money on this crap
p1231
sg5
VThis sennheiser has a dock with audio cables and a jack to plug it in the laptop audio\u2026. Then, on the headphone, tune the frequency from the headphone to hear the sound. There is distortion, once the frequency matches, you hear the sound. The tuned point where there is no distortion, has VERY LOW sound. The moment you try to fine tune it again to increase the volume, loud distortion hurts the ears.Disappointed and embarrassed as this was gift to my brother and i have to return it to Amazon......Not worth it...... Don't buy.....

Would recommend that anyone needing hearing aids listen through these headphones to be able to compare with hearing aid quality sounds for decision making in what is the best product to buy.F.  Very nice to be able to turn TV speaker sound down to zero(0) to not disturb anyone else and can adjust sound level in the headphones to personat al needs.G.

VThis is a great device for being able to listen to television late at night when everyone else is asleep.  The sound is great with little to no interference in most cases.  The only issue I had with this unit was when we used it in an apartment building where it was picking up radio waves from other apartments.  In our home, however, once tuned in there is virtually no interference.  This particular unit has the advantage of being rechargeable while on its stand (which is also the transmitter).  I find that the transmitter can even be hidden behind the tv set and still work without a hitch.

VGreat unit, especially for severe hearing impaired
p1272
sg5
VIf you have severe hearing loss like I do, I recommend you buy this unit. Bought another RS120 to replace my existing unit purchased in 2011. I damaged the headset in the existing unit and needed a replacement. I wrote a review of my experience with RS180 and RS195 units, so feel free to look those up. Bottom line, neither of those units will match the RS120's ability to crank up the volume so that I can enjoy watching TV w/out my hearing aids in. The qualilty and depth of the sound captured by the RS120 is why I bought another one. I had so hoped to be able to upgrade my experience with the RS195, but alas, it was not to be. The headset on the RS120 is snug and your ears will get a bit warm, but the tradeoff for me is worth it. There is minimal noise escape to bother anyone near me, even with the volume at the mid point on a full charge. This allows my daughter and I to enjoy watching TV together without having the TV blasting. I hope Sennheiser continues to make this product (would be nice to have a slimmer base like the the RS180 and RS195, but the unmatched volume control of the RS120 keeps me coming back.

VI bought these for my wife so she could watch TV while I'm trying to sleep, and they seem to work just fine.The set-up was very simple with my Sony flatscreen TV and VZIO soundbar. I have it all set up so the TV sound is muted and the volume is controlled by the soundbar. When the headphones were plugged into the TV it all just worked. Turn off the soundbar - headphones working and TV muted.The phones themselves just required a set of AAA batteries (supplied) be installed and the base station be plugged into a power supply and the TV headphone output terminal.The RCA plugs were a bit of a surprise, but the phones came with a mini-jack converter. I guess that the standard is RCA plugs for headphones in Germany, or maybe they envisaged them being used on the AUX OUT terminals of a receiver. I dunno.Eventually I'll have to replace the plug-type adaptor with a cable-style one as the fat plug needed to accommodate two RCA plugs blocks off the last remaining HDMI input for my TV, but that won't be a problem.The phones worked out of the box but my wife managed to knock them out of tune by fiddling with the controls at random instead of looking for an on/off switch. I showed her how to tune them back in. Once I'd explained it was like tuning an old transistor radio she got the knack.

VAttention Sennheiser and LG
p1302
sg5
VI purchased this with high hopes. One  critical point for Sennheiser to disclose up front - I wanted to use this with an LG television set.  I tried for a very long time to get a audio signal and couldn't.  It made no sense. I called LG customer support ( I couldn't find a Sennheiser telephone technical support number) and found out that LG television sets cannot connect to any wireless transmitters. First off,  Sennheiser needs to let people know - as a disclaimer, what mainstream brands or models that this product will not work with.  And I'm pretty disappointed with LG as well, that they couldnt even put in a headphone jack since they have made it impossible to use  any wireless hearing assisted devices with their TVs. Pretty cheap.  So, this review is not specifically about the model, which is probably fine with compatible audio devices \u2013 the problem here is with the companies involved.  So I would make sure the tv or device you have is compatible with wireless assisted hearing transmitters - before you purchase it.

p1320
sg5
VThese are probably more like 3.5 stars, with the only negative being my level of comfort. I have corded, over-the-ears mid-priced Phillips headphones that comfortable for music and guitar playing, and that I use for the TV on occasion, but I wanted something wireless specifically for the TV. I explored several options and landed on these mainly because I wanted an all-in-one solution. Bluetooth headphones would have required a separate Bluetooth transmitter, and the other affordable Sennheiser set would have required frequent battery changes or at least the purchase of a rechargeable AAA battery pack. I wanted the ability to easily recharge my headphones, so these are what I got. They work and sound great, but I find the on-ear design a bit uncomfortable for extended TV listening. If you're concerned that may be the case for you, you might want to try them on somewhere before you buy them on Amazon.

p1332
sg5
VThe reason for this 1 star review, is that these have zero ability to be functionally used as a PC headset. After about 5 minutes of low/no signal (which can happen often during gaming, watching youtube, etc), the transmitter shuts off, and you are greeted with mega-decibel ear destroying static in place of the silence.  It's awful.For dedicated music or TV use, probably ok, but if you want these for a PC, stay FAR, FAR AWAY!

VUncomfortable headphones, inadequate volume control
p1355
sg5
VThis product was so disappointing I had to return it. Though it's easy to set up, the maximum volume level of the headphones is too low. I wanted the wireless headphones so that I can raise the volume of the TV without making the volume uncomfortable for my wife. She would be able to keep the volume low, while I could turn it up, using the headphones. I was surprised to discover that the maximum volume possible was not particularly loud.In addition, the earpieces of the headphones do not fit well over the ears. There is no depressions to allow the ears to fit comfortably. The headphones tended to slip down, requiring repeated readjustments.For the price being charged, I expected a product of high quality. My requirements, I think, were quite reasonable: easy set-up, adequate volume control, comfortable headphones. After setting up the headphones according to instructions and listening to a few different TV channels with the volume switch at maximum. I was still struggling to hear clearly. I returned the headphones the next day.

VI do love the fact that it charges, is wireless, and doesn't have much static. The thing I don't like is that the part that touches your head is flat felt. You'd think that after all these years they would make some improvement. I can only watch one sports game or one movie before my head starts to hurt, but at least I can watch that, so it's enough for me. I got what I paid for, and I like it.The one thing that bugs me a tad, is that I can't get awesome, move quality sound to play. It really just doesn't sound that awesome. But I can use it when my family is watching something else so I can do my own thing, so it's still useful and worth every penny.

I didn't bother to check with a VOM, I just sent them back and picked another brand. Also, the charger didn't work unless you pressed on the headphone.

VI have been using these for about a year now.  My office is in the loft and my wife usually wants to watch TV in the living room which is right below my office.  Before I got these, it was hard for either of us to hear what we were watching.  These headphones plug right into the TV and now i can hear my TV without disturbing my wife.The headphones charge very quickly so anytime I need them they are fully charged and the foam is very comfortable. I also really like the charging stand, it looks nice and is also very functional.The only thing that I do not like about them is they tend to slide off my head easily if I am moving around a lot but usually I am just working on the computer while I am watching a baseball or basketball game so it really does not bother me that much.

VAfter buying atleast half a dozen Sennheiser products I am convinced that the company does not know how to manufacture a bad product. Even if they tried, they will end up making a very good product at the least . This is my second TV headphones and I couldn't not buy them after seeing how many people bought this product on Amazon and gave them such a high rating.When I first unboxed it and connected it to my TV, it took me around 3 minutes from the second I opened the box until the device was fully functioning. I cannot believe how easy it is to use this product. I read some 1 or 2 star reviews and my only explanation is that 1. you received a defective product. 2. you are incompetent when it comes to technology. I am so happy I bought this product by Sennheiser and there products will always be first choice from now on cause the Germans know a thing or two about making an excellent product!Will all the praise I give this product there, nothing is perfect so I will list next the pros and cons of these headphonesPros:- headphone base doubles up as charger as well as holder, just make sure you buy rechargeable batteries (main reason I bought this product)- they fit very snug on your ear- excellent sound- batteries will never run out unless you use them for 24 hours non stopCons:- placements of tuner and volume dial in very bad location. Tuning can easily change if you are laying back on a pillow and move around alittle.- you will start feeling discomfort after an hour of wearing those headphones- static starts to appear when  you are using headphones while using your phoneIn conclusion I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for something affordable. You will not be satisfied if you buy a cheaper product. I did that and I wasted 50 bucks. If you have a much higher budget then go for the higher models.

VOld school tuning on a modern radio receiver
p1455
sg5
VChanel 1 was noisy, tried 2 and 3 with no more luck. Switched it back to 1 and retuned the headset, and suddenly it sounded much better. Dirty contacts on the switch? But there continued to be distortion during some music passages. Retuning the headset cleared this up. Tuning requires turning a thumbwheel, similar to tuning an old style radio or TV. I find this too old school, and likely to get bumped off center. Trying the RS 175 instead.

VDelivery was sooner than expected and pleasant shopping experience, although I did find these a little less after ordering. Have to pay sales tax now in this state with Amazon. Purchased these as a replacement for "TV Ears". No comparison. This is a awesome set of headphones. Quality build and sound. I could not be any happier with my purchase. Great bass and treble, range is wonderful as I can go to the restroom or kitchen and not miss any of the audio. No static what so ever. If you are looking for a inexpensive set of earphones to listen to your tv and movies, buy these you will not be disappointed. Easy to set up & hook up. Shiennheiser hits a home run with this one as far as I am concerned.

VKnobs not the easiest for elderly users
p1520
sg5
VThe headphones are easy to set up, and they sound decent. The only thing wrong with them is that the volume and tuning knobs are directly next to each other, making it easy to accidentally switch to the wrong frequency and get static when going for the volume or simply adjusting the headphones. This wouldn't be such an issue, but we bought these for my grandpa, who isn't the most dexterous person. He'll get the hang of it eventually, but they would be much better if the knobs weren't so close together.

VI have no idea why these are rated 4 stars. I received them as a gift 2 days ago and am returning them. The audio is atrocious and the earpads are uncomfortably itchy. An hour of setup resulted in nothing but frustration and a constant hiss in the background. I'm not an audiophile, but have set up an entire home theater with 5.1 channel and multiple inputs, so this review isn't based on a lack of technical expertise.

They sit nicely on my ears and I haven't noticed any issues with them watching an entire football game.  If you're looking for good quality at an affordable price for wireless headphones, you won't find a better set than this one.

VThis head set is a wonderful item for me to be able to watch TV, or DVD's, as I have a serious hearing loss.  I can hear clearly, and adjust the volume as needed.  The head set lasts about a year, as I use it quite a lot.  The freedom to wander while wearing the headset is a big advantage for me as I don't usually "just sit" while watching, or listening to TV.  I'd highly recommend this headset to others, as it isn't only helpful to a person with a hearing loss.  It blocks out outside interference.  And it allows one to listen to a show, and not disturb others close by.  I'm so grateful to have found such a wonderful product.

p1662

VI've only had these a few days so cannot judge how they hold up in the long run but I can tell you I think they are wonderful! I spent considerable time in a session reviewing wireless headphones. I trust Amazon reviews at least ninety seven percent, I know that there are people who are overly critical about almost everything, those that are brand loyal and aim to please and those that fall between the two. I do not ignore that three percent. I believe there is pertinent information there. Back to the Senheiser Headphones,....Even though they were cheaper than some other good brands and ! had never heard of them I decided to take a chance. Sooo glad I did! I have the Bose Solo system and worried they would not be compatible.... not to worry, My Bose does not even have to be on in order to use these or it can be on with the volume turned down for people with normal hearing. unbelievable stereo effect from these! with a channel tuner instead of a switch on the headphones and a switch on the cradle. they use AAA NiMh rechargeable batteries that are charged just by being placed on the cradle! No plugging in! Thank you Amazon reviewers that steered me towards these. I am completely happy and Thank you Amazon for delivering them on time and safely and expertly packaged.

VThese are awful - like an antique AM radio, tons of static, I've had two other Sennheiser wireless headphones, one was pretty good (and was stolen) the other was really impressive.  This one is awful, I got snippets of voices, lots of hissing and general noise and not one bit of what I was actually trying to hear.  I did hear an advertisement for Time Warner Cable from who knows where(!?!?!?).  I don't use TWC.Maybe these are defective but I've never seen wireless headphones with a tuning knob before(!?!?!) and that tells me manual intervention is needed to make them work.MAYBE if you live in a desert somewhere they'd work but in a city, no.I'm going to spend the money and buy a good one from Sennheiser, I haven't given up on the company, just these phones.

I can listen while walking throughout my house and never miss anything.Now that I have two I can share a set. I keep the base units on different switch settings having plugged into different TV outputs.If watching the same Tv you just adjust the headset to receive the TV your watching.Oh and the price is very nice for these well made on ear headphones.

VWOW!  These sound better than the TV speakers. To me they have a great stereo quality. These head phones were recommended to me buy a friend that has a pair. The best thing I can say about them is they are perfect for my husband who is hard of hearing. He can mute the "loud" volume on the TV and hear a better quality of sound.  He loves them.We are both happy now and no longer have "dueling TV's" in my house. The fit is really comfortable. We also ordered the charger and have had no problems with it. We have ordered a second pair for myself for the bedroom so either of us can watch TV without disturbing the sleeping other.

VNot worth it,
p1877
sg5
VSo I have used this for a while now and I have to say I am very disappointed with them. First of all, because you have to manually scan the channel of your music playing, you often get that old-radio-style white noise in the background, so sometimes the quality can be pour. Overall, the sound is OK but for the price range, you can get way better.Also, the Auto turn-off feature is not a feature, it's an issue: if you don't play audio for about 5 minutes, the transmitter will turn off which results in your headphones rushing you with full volume white noise! You can't turn this feature off.You are better off buying bluetooth/wired headphones. This type of headphone will probably not satisfy you at all. I do not recommend.If I didn't persuade you, this review certainly will: http://www.tassile.com/2011/02/01/bad-design/

VIf you google these, you'll see they have a serious and consistent problem where the volume control knobs cause a popping interference sound that is unsolvable without warranty service. I am pretty handy and took mine apart using instructions I found on various forums, but the problem persisted. The technology in these just isn't reliable enough to justify the $80 purchase, and mine are unusable now after a year of owning them and treating them very gently. I'm attempting a return and suggest you look elsewhere for your wireless headphone needs.

p1900
sg5
VInitially I really enjoyed these headphones. I purchased back in 2012 and used them pretty much every day. The main use was for playing games on my computer. Functionally they are (or were, i'll get to that in a second) excellent. Around a year ago, i noticed a crack forming above the left headphone, I quickly applied some pretty good epoxy to it and all was well for about 2 months, when they eventually cracked completely. I applied epoxy again, and they survived up until around a month ago, when in addition to cracking, there was a buzz I could here with all audio. I knew at this point, there was no saving my beloved headphones.If i could order these again, I'm not sure i would. I really wish that the headphones themselves could be purchased for a far reduced rate than the phones plus the base. It seems cost prohibitive to buy just the phone in my case, as i'd be left with an extra base of which i have no use for.In short, I wont buy these again. The issue i've had with these headphones are a result of (in my belief) poor design. While i'm sure the reason for making the extension part of the headphone out of plastic is to save some cost versus making them out of metal, the result is a product that does not last as long as it should. This is especially true of you have a gigantic head such as mine, where these are stressed more than normal.During the life of this product, i'd give it 4 starsBecause it broke on me within an unreasonable timeframe, -2 stars

We purchased these for my father who is hard of hearing. He was unable to watch tv without shaking our walls. Now, we are all happy. They charged  quickly and are loud and clear enough for him to enjoy watching his favorite shows. The only problem we had was not realizing you need to close the adjustable headband before putting on the charger, otherwise there is not enough weigh to charge the headphones. That was our fault. I do wish that the charger light would go out when the headphones are fully charged. You have no idea how charged they are at any time.

VI had bought a pair of Sennheiser RS 160 and had to send them back as they were to difficult to use. So I bought  these Sennheiser RS120 and had to send them back as they had to be tuned whenever I used them, and still got hiss sometimes. I have them hooked to my tv and if there is no sound  for about a minute the transmitter turns off and they make a loud hiss. I took them off and set them down on the table. When I came back in a couple of hours the battery was dead. I had a five year old set of Sony headphones that had broken and I need to replace them but they never gave me this much trouble. I will never buy another  Sennheiser product again.

They\u2019ve all functioned perfectly until the last set we bought about a year ago.  This headset started to suffer frequency drift and became directional to the point that if I moved my head left or right, the signal varied.I contacted Sennheiser and reported the problem.  Sennheiser said \u201csend them to us with a description of the problem\u201d.  Did that!  Two weeks later (today), and much to my surprise, I received a package from Sennheiser with NEW headphones.

VTuning these headphones can be compared to sending out a radio signal into outer space and expecting some sort of intelligent alien civilization to contact you back, and then be promptly disappointed as to the incessant hissing, mediocre sound quality, and the fact that it interferes with your once-amazing cell phone reception.If your computer doesn't play some kind of sound for maybe 5 or 10 minutes while these headphones are turned on, it will lose its connection and you have to turn it off and on again, re-tune it and then maybe-- just maybe-- you can watch that 7-second clip of a cat jumping from couch to couch. Once you establish a connection, make sure to replicate the precision of a Navy Seal veteran because if you're not careful, instead of changing the volume, you'll tune the thing out. A simple convenient fix would have been to just put the tuner on one side and the volume on another. Maybe even just change the texture of one of the knobs if keeping them separate is too blasphemous.I have to be missing something here. I'm not technologically inept. I've had these headphones for about a week, and it's a struggle. Maybe I'm ignorant, or maybe I'm in denial by admitting I'm ignorant, but why couldn't these headphones have just been USB connectable? Is it expensive to produce? Am I wrong or does a contact-charging wireless radio-transmitting headphone booth sound like more of an expense, more of a hassle?

VBest Headset I Own Now!!
p2181
sg5
VI've had this for 4 years now and so far it's the best headset for the price. My headset was damaged due to the battery age and I had to replace the set with another. Now before anyone starts thinking negative about the product let me just say this is the best headset sound wise. When my 1st pair were damaged I went out and bought a SONY brand headset that ranges at $109.99 and the sound from it was horrible. It sounded so deep as the bass was up to the highest but there was no option to change the sound of it. Compared to these Sennheiser, the sound on this is so much clearer and nice.

Often need retuned to set the station perfectly and in the environment I am in, I should have ordered the closed back type.However, when everything is meshing, these headphones do sound amazing. I can actually hear lyrics I didn't know were audiable. And the range is pretty good. The only issue Ive had was that a hair of mine had jammed itself in the diaphragm.I would not buy these again for my applications. These can be good headphones.

p2264
sg5
VThe sound is very clear.  The unit very easy to hook up.  WhatI am not really happy with is the lack of comfort of the headphones. They don't have any noticeable cushioning at all, straight, flat against your ears.  Also, the dials for "tone" (tuning to the TV) and "volume" are on the back of the headphones that are on your ears.  Since I only use these while lying in bed, the back often hits my pillow and can change the settings easily.If I were to buy another set, I would look around for more comfortable and economically designed headphones.

VGreat Headpones but bad design in the tuning area.
p2276
sg5
VThe quality and performance are fine and audio sounds great.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is because the tuning dial is too close to the volume dial.When you are wearing the headphones and try to adjust the volume, it is way too easy to run your finger by the tuning wheel which is identical in form and shape to the volume dial and right under the volume dial.  This causes the headphones to disconnect from the base and you have to readjust the tuning wheel to reconnect.  If Sennheiser engineers every look at this post, I would recommend they put the tuning dial in a different location or better yet, put a cover over it so that after you tune it, you close the cover and you don't need to worry about it again!Other that the tuning wheel, everything works great.

V... headphones to use with my Samsung UN50J5500 50-Inch 1080p Smart LED TV (2015 Model) TV
p2318
sg5
VI bought these headphones to use with my Samsung UN50J5500 50-Inch 1080p Smart LED TV (2015 Model) TV. I received them today on time and the package was undamaged. I unpacked the box, put the batteries in the headphones, plugged the yellow cord into the back of the grey stand which plugs into the wall or power cord, plugged the black and red cords from the grey box into the output on the back of the TV and they worked just fine. You may have to adjust the volume or tune them in from the headset itself. Simple to use. Just put your TV on mute and you don't have to worry about bothering others while listening to the TV. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. I'm happy with them.

VA bit snug on my big head.  Sound quality is good enough for my use.  Hissed a bit at first, but turning up the volume at the source and down at the headphones drastically reduced the hiss.Depending on your use, they auto shutoff implementation is the worst part of these.  I tend to put them on to watch a video, then leave them on with no sound.  After a minute or so the base shuts off. This part is apparently a mandatory US regulation, but instead of the headphones going silent they pick up loud static.  We had squelch on almost every 70's CB radio, seems like that technology could be implemented here.

VI think the sound is fine and the range is great.  I can walk out to the garage or upstairs without losing sound or picking up extra noise.  I do hear three "clicks" periodically, but it doesn't bother me.  The tuning is a little sensitive to get it dialed in, but then it's clear.  My main complaint is the the headphones are loose on my head.  If I bend over at all they shift or fall off.  Very annoying.

I can watch TV and exercise at the same time without the noise of the treadmill interfering with the sound from the TV. I researched various brands of headphones before I purchased the Sennheiser headphones. They came highly recommended, and my husband and I have been pleased with them.

VAfter asking if these would work with my Samsung 40 inch TV and getting all positive responses, I quickly charged the headphones for 24 hours as instructed, and they were a breeze to install, absolutely no problem at all.  I had previously purchased RCA wireless headphones and had to return them because they just would not work no matter what I did.  So I was delighted with these.  The sound is great and it is simple and easy to use, the charging stand is straightforward, don't have to place the headphones one way or the other, just put them on the stand. I also have a Unistar, which is also excellent for TV, but the band broke so the headset would not sit on my head,  kept falling down.  The Sennheiser is almost double the cost of the other headphones, but they seem to work well from any angle, meaning, I don't have to be right in front of the receiver.  I only just bought and tried these headphones, but I give them 5 stars because they sound great, crystal clear and easy to use, and very comfortable.

p2443

VPurchased July 25, 2015, Died November 29, 2015.  I was listening to them today, and the base suddenly stopped functioning.  The  step-down transformer at the plug is still working, although it is supplying 10.5 volts DC, instead of the recommended 8.5 to 9.5 volts, so something internal in the base must have worn out.  I have always had the charger/base plugged into the battery backup/uninterruptable power supply I have my computer is plugged into, and the base was never dropped or jostled in any way.  I would have bet on the headphones quitting first, because they have slipped off my head numerous times and crashed to the floor, but they are still functioning normally.  I liked these headphones when they were working.  The headphones themselves are light, feel cheap, but the sound is ok.  Great for doing household chores while listening to the television or whatever.  This is the second set of Sennheiser headphones that have disappointed me, the first were a wired set of "gaming" headphones that had a cheap plastic headstrap connecting the speakers...which snapped like a turkey wishbone when I was putting them on my head, (both sides at the same time, just above the speakers), after only a year of use.  The company's good German engineering is wasted by outsourcing the manufacturing to China.  This will be the last Sennheiser product I purchase.

Very sturdy, great quality sound, soft on the ears (most over-ear headphones hurt my ears after a while, these don't), the charger still works perfect, transmission still great  Only con would be the loud static from the automatic shut-off but at least it tries to save battery!

p2479
sg5
VI bought these headphones a couple years ago and used them for watching TV just before going to sleep while trying not to bother my wife. Comments: 1) There is a lot of sound that leaks from these headphones...they are 'on ear' so beware of the real difference in sound leakage between on ear or 'over ear' - it is substantial 2) They are not comfortable, don't fit well and if you get up and bend over will literally fall off your head. I tried every adjustment to get them to fit with no luck - was always annoying 3) After two and a bit years they stopped taking a charge. I replaced the batteries but no go. I have just replaced the headphones. So, overall not good marks for the RS 120's from my experience....you get what you pay for and in this case do some homework....upgrade to Sennheiser 165 or above, or, for real value for less money I strongly recommend looking at the Sony MDRRF985RK, which are cheaper, far more comfortable and sound (in my opinion) equally as good as the RS 120's.

Vthis is what happens when you don't test a design
p2484
sg5
VI've been using these for a year and a half now.  As far as the quality of sound aside from interference, it stands up decently well against studio monitors.  The sound is excellent.  The batteries have behaved well too, they can hold a charge for a good 8 hours for me (and I don't leave them on the transmitter/charger after they charge, it's not good for batteries).  The durability of the parts is great too--I've dropped these a good number of times and the most that's happened is one of the pads has come off (and I just lock it back in place).The reason I know about the durability though is one of the unit's many drawbacks, most of which are design failures that would likely embarrass any engineers with a sense of pride (ie. most).  It comes across like Sennheiser focused more on speaker quality than most other aspects, and while the speakers are great the ergonomics of these headphones for example are awful.  I've had to basically 'train' them by bending them repeatedly to fit my head adequately (by default they squeeze my ears enough to ache after about 20 mins of listening, which is unacceptable).  I have a pretty average-sized head by the way, at least according to hat fittings.  The overhead portion of these should have been built to be adjustable/bendable, and they are not: there are only notch-based length adjustments near the earpieces.  They also slip off most of the time if I tilt my head forward, and they have always done this (before and despite any of my adjustments).  The result is usually hitting tile after dropping from head level, and usually one of the pads flies off.  All it would have taken would have been some time spent wearing these to realize the flaws here.The other issue I have--and it actually makes me avoid using these a lot of the times--is a design feature that comes across once again like it was never tested.  The transmitter/charger is designed so that if there's a sustained period of sufficiently low amplitude/volume in the signal (2 minutes) the transmitter *stops transmitting*.  The logic behind this decision still baffles me, because it doesn't serve any purpose like saving battery life because the headphones stay on.  What's worse by far though is the result--I'll put together a playlist at my system, start it up, put the headphones on, and go about my business (usually chores around the house that music makes more tolerable).  If I remember to keep from pointing my head down and dropping them then all is well until the volume of the music drops below ~15% (at the end of the set, on some songs that have low output for portions of them, or if I have to pause for some reason).  What happens is that after two minutes of silence the transmitter stops and I get full volume static in my ears.  You can imagine the jolt that gives someone at least, it prevents me from ever putting volume above 40% for any length of time, I can't play some low-output music I own with these, and all the time I have them on I'm fearful in the back of my mind of the signal dropping below 15%.  This design flaw is *inexcusable*, especially at this price point.  All it would have taken is some measurable amount of testing.The last issue I have is because of yet another lack of testing--transmission/reception.  The frequency band of adjustability at the headset seems fine, but the transmitter's band is far too narrow, so the signal is more susceptible to interference in an average environment than it should be.  The power output of the transmitter is too low as well, so even close to the transmitter there's audible (very low but still audible) static, and if I wander more than a room away from it the static starts getting in the way of the music.These types of flaws are not acceptable to me.  It's not hard at all to design reasonably according to use, and Sennheiser puts this unit at a price point where there is absolutely zero excuse not to.  The result is unnecessarily overpriced, sub-par functionality.

VThese Headphones have a much greater range than my RCA WHP RF headphones. The sound is also great. The batteries last a long time before needing a rechargeMy big complaint is the ear pads on the headphones are smooth and they go flying off my head all the time. Other headphones have that ring of padding with a hole in the center to help it to catch on my ear and keep them on my head. If you are like me and rarely just sit in front of your TV or Stereo, you may want to get headphones with different ear pads. I've had mine hit the floor and knock the ear pads right off. I'm afraid one of these days they will hit the floor and stop working.

VIt's OK. Maybe somewhat overpriced for what it is. The sound quality is decent for me (not an audiophile), but sometimes there's a buzzing in the background. As others have mentioned, it dynamically adjusts the volume over time, which is sometimes annoying. When playing video games, I usually have to adjust the volume a few times before it stabilizes to some reasonable level. The charger works well. Comfort-wise, it's probably as good as any on-ear headphone I've tried, though as with all on-ear headphones, I find that it becomes uncomfortable after a few hours. I don't have any interference problems.If I could go back, I might try rigging up some sort of 3.5mm -> bluetooth -> bluetooth -> 3.5mm setup instead of this.

VThe sound is fine, but these earphones are just huge. I have to stay motionless while watching TV, or they'll just slide off my head. I can make them bigger, but there is way to make them smaller, and adjust them to fit better.

VTV's audio ports do not work
p2543
sg5
VI have a Visio TV model UM_M3D651SV 65\u201d. It has two different ports on the back for audio out but neither work with my RS120. I do have a sound bar attached using an optical connection on the TV. The only way the RS120 works is when I used the ports on the cable box (Uverse).  This is not good because anytime I am using streaming or the DVD the RS120 does not work.  Also I noticed an echo from the TV's sound bar when listening to my headset.  I have check the TV\u2019s audio menu to see if I can turn the ports off or on but did not find anything. Any suggestions?

VI wish I had time to share more information about the quality and positive results from this product. You won't go wrong by purchasing this and other products from this company. I purchased three (3) sets. The only drawback I have is that I cannot run two separate sets too close together in different rooms because the voice signal cannot be dialed in on the second set. It wants to pick up the set in the other room. All I get is mumbled static in the second set. One set at a time is Super!  Stan - West Columbia, Texas

VBest Money You'll Ever Spend on Personal Electronics
p2609
sg5
VPurchased these for my father-in-law after he came to live with us. An honorably-discharged Korean-era USAF veteran and retired factory worker, his hearing has seen better days. For the sake of domestic tranquility, I shopped around for a reasonably-priced, lightweight and easy-to-use pair of wireless headphones for him to use while watching television. Among several candidates, the Sennheiser RS-120's jumped off the page. The price was right, and thousands of positive reviews couldn't be wrong. Without question, for the price, these are simply outstanding. I ditched the no-name AAA rechargeable batteries that came in the box and replaced them with four higher-endurance batts. Rather than replace the phones on the charger stand each night, I keep a fresh pair in a wall outlet charger and swap them out every couple days. The batts are super easy to change (no tools required; just a simple twist-off of one of the ear pads). Bottom line: This is the best money I've ever spent for any electronic product EVER.

p2734

VI am about to purchase my second pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones. If you are hearing impaired and often miss out on words or phrases that take away from the joy of a good movie or program, I highly recommend these headphones. I previously had to turn the volume up so loud that it deafened everyone else in the house. The only static I encounter is when there is no transmission of sound (as at the end of a movie). My second purchase is for use with another device in another area of my home. Since purchasing these headphones, I am thoroughly enjoying my hobby....a lover of movies! And, I no longer miss a word!!!I have recommended these to family members who have purchased multiples also.For the price, there is no better deal.

p2793
sg5
VGreat pair of headphones. Charged overnight, installed into a Vizio Smart TV. Installed the connectors into the R & L port, tuned the headset, all good. Tried on an older Magnavox,  found I would need a 2$ adaptor that does not come in the factory box.Overall, happy with the quality of the headset. Comfortable to fit on my brain pan, I also like that the ear phones are not a donut style which would make my ears sweat after a while. These press against your ear very well without being uncomfortable. After using them for a long period of time my ears did not feel squished. Some people have noticed a slight " hiss" to these. I have heard a small amout, never bothered me as it was faint. Remember this is a radio frequency headset, not Bluetooth digital. You want to spend BIG bucks, get a BT capable tv and BT headset just so you doent hear a slight hiss, worth it... your choice.When finished I just laid them back into its charging cradle. Nice design,  good finish, and good sound. A fair price for this product, IMO.

We got it hooked up easily and it worked beautifully - for one month.  Two days past the one month return period, the unit stopped working.  We double checked all connections and anything we could think of that would stop the unit from performing.  Nope.  Soooo we paid $80 for only one month of relief.  Very unhappy customer.

VQUICK SET-UP, WORKS GREAT
p2811
sg5
VSet these up right out of the box in moments. Works on my TV with the adapter, I have a new Samsung 4k and there is a little "Audio out" plug, looks like what you'd plug earbuds into. Works with the TV volume on or muted.  My only beef is that they are a little big for my small girl head, but if they were tight I suppose they would hurt after a while. Got them to listen to my music without bugging my neighbors and I think for that purpose these are going to work really well. I also walked into another room and they worked great, no static, could still hear my show. I think if you have a big house you'd lose the strength depending on how far you walk away from the receiver, but ultimately that is just common sense and would happen with any wireless headphone.  I am extremely happy with these headphones.

VThese wireless headphones look like the ideal solution for private listening to T.V. or music without using wires which could prove to be a tripping hazard.  However they did not work, ( no wireless signal), so I returned them.  Too bad the concept seems sound.

VI could not get the Sennheiser RS120 wireless headphones to work with my Samsung TV, so had to return them. It is a simple setup, so I don't think it was a problem resulting from my lack of electronics savvy. One other recent reviewer had the same problem.  Gave it only one star because it did not work for me, but want to note that other reviewers were happy with them.

VGenerally, I am happy with my purchase.  The sound quality seems quite high, and it has allowed my girlfriend and I to live in peace in a one bedroom condo despite our different work schedules.I initially bought these to use at my computer believing that they were over-ear cups -- perhaps the result of a too hasty purchase.  Unfortunately, these do not work to drown out outside noise because they are "over ear", but the inside is a flat foam pad rather than a cup.  However, I hooked them up to the TV and it achieves essentially the same end.Pros:  - Headphones and cradle have clean, uncluttered, and unobtrusive look despite being only a few inches from the TV.  - Easy to charge  - Fairly comfortableCons:  - Tuning seems to drift while watching TV over the course of an hour or two.  It is simple enough to correct.  I don't know if this is a hardware issue, or if there are minor vibrations from the headphones that slowly turn the knob. - I don't particularly care that the foam presses against my ear.  I prefer cups that press against the skull rather than ear-cartilage.

VSorry - I hate and don't trust those reviews where the person complains about the item.  I always think I'll just try it myself (unless many many people say it's not worth it).  But - - I did not like this item from the start.  I SHOULD have sent it back. Originally only one ear piece worked and it is hard to find the exact tuning in which it does work.  Then I stopped using it for a month or so and now I can't get it to work at all.  I will likely post it on Craig's list for free.  Really not a good product.  I'm going to still look for something else that does work reliably.

VI bought these for my father who couldn't hear certain sounds when watching television. I hated turning up the volume to a near deafening level so I thought I would give these a try. Other brands had poor ratings but this one had excellent reviews...and I agree 100%  My father wears these when watching television and can now enjoy a program because he can hear every detail!  Better yet, I can leave the set at a level I like. Best feature, if you hook it up right, when the phone rings I can mute the main set but the sound still carries through the headset so my dad can keep watching/listening to the program.

VHi, this perspective is not a put-down, this item does what it is suppose to do, no more or less. My view is that it could be better. No instructions of quality comes with it explaining the buttons specifically, it should have bullet points and pictures of those buttons. Also finding a strong signal and hanging on to that signal is weak. For people who listen to serious documentaries it does not work. Sometimes this item signals goes in and out, missing important points. For people who just watch TV it may work for you

VVery disappointed !! This headphone create massive noise ( i understand that any RF headphones create some level of noise, but in this headphone its bit high ). It create loud noise if TV is paused/stopped for 2 mins. ( Not even 2 mins, this is the most annoying feature of this product ). It doesn't fit well on head, it might be uncomfortable after an hour or so. But definitely, uncomfortable in certain way. Its okay product if you have no other choice for this price. Sennheiser has really great products in RF headphones if you have budget for that.

VLove this unit.  Although it is little bulky, the sound quality is pretty good and the distance it covers is phenomenal.  It covers 2nd floor corner room all the way to 1st floor kitchen which is diagonally opposite location.  I was very surprised.  For its price it is very nice unit.  I would definitely recommend this product to those who wants wireless head set.

VI bought two sets of these headphones eight years ago so that my wife and I could watch tv at night without waking up our toddler.  They have worked perfectly for eight years now, and are used daily.After eight  years of daily use, they have begun to develop some problems.  One set is beginning to cut in and out and the other has lost sound in one side.  But we got eight years of use out of them, something I don't expect from an electronic device that's used every day.I'm really glad that they are still available because I'm buying two more sets to replace our old ones.  I hope they will do as good a job as our original ones.

VThe sound quality is good, but the analog tuning is poor. You can find several settings where the phones work, but some work better than others. The tuning should be set to one or two switch selectable channels at the factory.This is easily done with today's technology. Also, if you wear the phones while sitting in a sofa with metal framework, the phones stop working until you move your head a few inches. Very annoying.

I want to say that the people at Amazon made it so easy for me to return & even immediately put a new unit in the mail which I received 2 days later. The unit was easy to install after watching the video. On the video they said to set audio to "fixed." I missed that instruction the first time around & now I wonder if that caused my problems. Anyway, my husband & I are thrilled with these headphones!

p3296
sg5
VI previously owned Sony wireless headphones which broke and were discontinued.  The installation of this set was easy. It lays on the charging cradle easy without any adjustments to charge unlike the Sony. I have a small head, not sure if it will charge so easily if the headphones are set for a larger head. The sound is great better than the Sony pair but they lay flat on your ears not cupped around so outside sound is noticeable unlike the Sony.  I use them for watching TV and sit about 12 feet from the TV. No static or interference so far. My largest complaint is the headphones loose signal once or twice an hour for no apparent reason. It is not from walking around or even movement since I am sitting in the same position. So when this happens you must turn the fine tuner knob on the headphone slightly to re-tune the signal which is not the biggest deal just kind of a nuisance. The headphones do shut down when there is silence for a minute or two which happens when I pause a show to do something else, when this happens you here static in the ear and must switch the headphones off and on again which is also kind of a nuisance too.

VBad Dial Placement
p3338
sg5
VAttributes: the range on these things is great. I have the base station on the floor of the master. And, I can go outside and still hear the headphones. They are oriented for the left and right ears. But, that's kind of a fault, too.Faults: there is a rotational dial for volume and frequency (so it can sense what radio waves the base station is broadcasting on). What I dislike about these dials is that I put these headphones on in bed so that my wife doesn't have to listen to the TV late at night (plus, I don't have to turn it down super low). Why is this a fault? The dials should be on the front or side of the headphones because the pillows can rub against them. Turn the headphone around, you say? Yes, but then they fit weird because they are oriented for the shape of the standard human head, which happens to have ears on it. I say to the manufacturer: fix this and the headphones will receive higher ratings.

VPretty good product, my wife has to be in bed early so I have to keep the volume down so I don't wake here, but sometimes I just couldn't hear what was being said on the program.  I purchased this and now I can have full volume so I can hear, but doesn't disturb my wife with the loud music typical in movies between dialogue.  This is really a good set and I like that it recharges on its own.  The only drawback is you have to play with the wheel a little to tune in exactly to the sound, but once you got it perfected, the sound quality is great.  Finding the perfect wheel setting is a bit tricky because if you don't get it right, you get the in and out interference, so you have to dial it in just right.  Otherwise, great product for the money and better than several I tried and took back to the store.

VI just received this product and was very excited and eager to try it. Then, the DISAPPOINTMENT. I tried to plug the adapter in and it does not turn on.  I should say this is the worst design I have ever seen in any electronics. I don't know what the designer was thinking when he made it. Perhaps, he wanted to hurt the company!. I will never ever buy any Sennheiser product. I would give it zero star (even I did not really have the chance to try it properly).  I spent 90 min trying to insert the adapter into its plugin in the docking base...So stupid design!

VDue to the RF transmission, you're going to get some interference in any busy city area, but I am always able to adjust my personal electronics that are near the transmitter and tune it in to avoid this. The sound for the price and it being RF is actually of very good quality, and for the price this rocks. I had a friend buy some for his TV watching, and I had a pair of these that I wore out with years of use previous to this set. So, as you can tell, I find them very suitable. I also own a pair of wired Sennheiser PC 363D high performance surround sound that I switch out with these depending upon my computing needs. Such as using these while laying in bed to watch videos on my very large computer screen. Works great! Sennheiser is highly recommended by me. Also, because the batteries are simply rechargeable, you can replace them after a year's use in order to get a longer charge if you've used the first pair of batteries a LOT over the year, like I do.

p3416
sg5
VAbsolutely the best.  Excellent sound & clarity.  Finally, I can listen to TV without the entire neighborhood knowing what I'm watching.  I have only charged the headset twice in the three weeks I've had them.  I cut them off when not in use and save the batteries.  Do not put them on the charger every time you finish.  Run the batteries flat if possible for best results.  Also, if like me you have a dumb TV, plug into your cable box, not the TV.  The TV mute will not work for the headset so I just take them off.  They are a little tight anyway so it gives my  head a rest during commercials.  Top notch equipment.  Definitely highly recommend for anyone.

The infrared ones (various makes etc.) are cheaper and some I have had work very well, the sound is not as rich.

VWe purchased this product to reduce background noise in a small house while using the TV.  It is very easy to set up and charge the headphones.  They are also very comfortable and easy to use.  The sides are marked with an L (Left)  or R (Right) so you do not wear the headphones backwards (which I did - however, they are much more comfortable wearing the correct way).  We set the volume of the TV to zero (no volume) and they still work.  Controls are easy.  On-Off switch on the left ear.  Signal adjuster and volume on the right ear.  The signal adjuster is used to tune in the signal from the unit.  If you hear static, just move the adjuster until you can hear the sound, and then fine adjust to make sure the sound is clear.  The sound is very crisp and clear - much better then I would have expected.  You can turn them up very loud as well so you do not hear any background noise.  I can walk into the kitchen (next room) and still hear the program.  When done, turn the headphones off and just hang back on the charging unit.  Overall, I am very pleased with the product and would recommend them.  Reviewed by G. Swanson

I now can have the TV volume at a normal rate for  myself while he wears these very comfortable headphones and is able to hear also! Before we received these headphones I was always saying " turn the TV down". My only regret is that we didn't have them sooner. My husband wears them for hours and notes they fit great and are very comfortable. We highly recommend!!!

VThese are very nice headphones.  We had them set up in just a few minutes and they work great.  We did let them charge fully before using.  My husband has hearing aides and these are as much for me as they are for him.  I can now have the TV at a sound level that is comfortable for me.  We did plug this into our DVR so we could still have sound on our TV.  Our TV didn't have a switch so we could have sound coming from both at the same time.  When we want to watch a movie he just unplugs from the back of the DVR and plugs them into the back of our blue ray player and they work great.  They have really nice sound too.

p3542
sg5
VIn the beginning it's all good. You can put these on without disturbing those around you. After about a year, the volume dial would cause one or both sides to go silent or at uneven levels. You have to start moving the dial in a certain way to get both sides to even out. This is going to take some practice because it happens every time you turn on the headphone.

VThis was purchased for our 98 year old mother who is hard of hearing. The sound is clear and what a joy it now is that she can hear the TV without blasting us out with the sound. She now enjoys watching TV again now that she can understand what is being said. The setup was easy and was used as soon as the headset was charged. These have a good range thru the house but we have not tried taking them outdoors. We purchased this set as the batteries in the headset can be replaced easily unlike the Sony set. We use these approximately 9 hours a day without recharging. We put them on the charger overnight and they are ready to go the next day.

p3566
sg5
VThis is a fantastic product. I use it all the time. The ability to hook it up to anything allows me to listen to older medias I cannot bluetooth too. I have lots of old audiobook on tape and I can attach this to an old walkman and not have to carry it around/wear it. Great for when you have on athletic shorts that can be pulled down by weight and have no pockets. The charging method is very nice and it has never gone dead on me and I have used it for hours at a time before.The range was more than enough for me I have had it probably 150 feet away outside with the base inside going through one wall. Make sure the volume on the source is turned up or it will not "hear" it and you will get cut outs followed by static. The tuner has 3 channels and I can always get a good signal, however, the middle default almost always works. I highly suggest these if you want something you can hook to a TV, vinyl player, tape deck, computer tower for a source.The sound quality is very good from what i can tell. I have only listen to music with them once, like I said I mostly use them to listen to audio books when I'm working on my guns or hot rod. The bass wasn't like what you might expect from a $300 dollar set of studio headphones, but the overall clarity was very high. Strong highs and mids. I also have no buzzing or static undertones like some of the people have said to experienced. I only get that when I am over maybe 200 feet from the unit. I have it near a window so that may help with the range I am seeing, but once you get to the range limit you will know. You will begin to loose volume and pick up static.The seem average in the durability section, however, I have had them in my shop with all kinds of high speed machines and tools and they do not pick up anything or buzz when near a highspeed tool such as a highspeed belt sander, bench grinder, or Dremel which is something I did not expect I thought all headphones did that. I do not worry about them though. They have gotten very dusty in that environment and I just blow them off with compressed air and they keep right on trucking. I have not dropped them though but I am sure at some point I will.My only real concern I have is the cord at the base of the unit. I worry about that. It does not seem very durable.

VA high quality and performance poduct with excellent audio and overall performance
p3673
sg5
VUsed primarily for TV media. Audio and technical performance is excellent. A little heavier than IR models, but very acceptable for late night viewing without disturbing your honey. One minor  glitch, user issue is that the tuning and volume thumbwheels are basically identical and within an inch or so on the back of the right ear cup. This make them easy to confuse and throw the tuning off instead of adjusting the volume (which can happen more if you're laying on your back, head on pillows). So then, you have to retune of course - easy, but a little annoying. Minutia number two is the auto-off 'feature' - "If the headphone output level is too low, the transmitter automatically switches off." Sounds great, right? However, the headphone RF auto-tune starts to sweep up and down looking for a signal to lock on to - all with a static filled roar with a kind of a beep which I assume is a result of the sweep resetting itself. So, if you're just drifting off and the media source shuts down from end of program or auto shut-off (sleep timer etc.) be prepared for the wake up call.

I originally thought I would only use these phones when watching TV late at night or when watching noisy programs like auto racing. ( Which my wife doesn't like!) But. I found that I wear them often now for regular programming when I don't want to disturb others with my choice of programs.

p3793
sg5
VDecent quality and range, and reasonably comfortable.  These are not by any means noise cancelling, and are not going to be satisfactory for any real audiophiles -- but they aren't meant to be either.The main disadvantage for these headphones is that they use an analog frequency adjustment which isn't always perfectly reliable.  Walking around an upstairs room for example it will sometimes jump from normal, to super loud, to soft, to static depending on the signal strength.  Fine-tuning the 'channel' often helps, but such is the nature of this device.The headphones supposedly operate on an FM 900mHz frequency, so in theory the base station can also be used to transmit audio to other FM receivers in the house, though I have yet to attempt such.

The Sennheiser has fantastic sound, deep rich bass and clear highs.  I can wear them anywhere in the house (two story 1750 square foot condo) and get perfect reception.  The old tv ears would drop reception if I moved my head quickly or stepped out of the den and they would retune to another station if there was a loud noise on the program I was watching.

VThese headphones are going back as they are pretty much unusable. No amount of tuning seems to get rid of the constant hiss, and when you think you've tuned it to a minimal hiss, you move around a little bit and suddenly you get extremely loud interference.The design is poor as well, as the tune wheel is directly next to the volume wheel. Even if you think you've found the sweet spot tuning wise, you go to adjust the volume and it's super easy to adjust the tune.

p3984

VI've had these headphones for about 13 months now.  For the most part these work very well.  The complaints about the hissing sound when there isn't a radio signal is normal.  Those folks are probably too young to remember when TV stations went off the air overnight and all you got was static snow on your TV.  As long as everything is turned on they sound fine.  Working the volume and tuning knobs took a little time to get used to but it's not a huge deal. The complaints about them being too big and falling off are valid.  I wear a size 8 hat and these things flopped around quite a bit.  I hooked on some over the ear pads from an old set of hearing protection muffs and they stay on fine now.  These aren't studio quality headphones that will satisfy the audiophile snobs, but they work great for TV watching.  They work in stereo and they separate out the sound on the TV show.  You can hear a car pass you by or a door close behind you.  Pretty cool.  I just wish they fit a little better.

The problem is that the volume control is used a lot, but the tuning is only rarely used. These two controls should not be identical, and so closely located.

VI've owned these for almost ten years now and have been using them almost daily. They still look like new but the on/off contact switch is starting to give out. They required no maintenance whatsoever.PROS:+ Great sound. There's plenty of volume with a nice range throughout.+ Comfortable & lightweight. I can wear them for hours on end without any sweat or ear pain.+ Good range. It's after 30 feet where I would start getting some signal loss.+ Did I mention durability? In my experience it's not often that an electronic product lasts that long with daily use.CONS:- Some slight hissing. It's noticeable when the music stops but otherwise imperceptible.Color me impressed. These turned me into a Sennheiser fan.

VThe reason I do not like it is because when I tip my head forward, the headphones topple off of my head, and I cannot seem to find a way to remedy.  It actually does not seem to fit my head at all. That is my only complaint about it.  It does have good sound.  It is just that it will not stay on my head.

VAfter reading reviews on a bunch of headphones, I chose these Sennheiser RS 120 & am extremely happy with them.  At first it was great. Then after a while the sound was really low. I soon realized I needed to adjust the "tune" button & BOOM, it was even louder & in surround. So if anyone has problems, just adjust the tune button & it will work great!!  When I first plugged the cables in my TV the sound was off on the TV & only on the headphones. After re-reading the reviews I found if I plugged them into my cable box, as someone suggested, the sound was through the tv & the headphones! The sound is absolutely amazing!!I really love these headphones!!! Some of my TV channels seem to be lower in volume. With these,  I hear without having to turn the volume all the way up. I feel like I am in a theater.  I hear things I normally wouldn't  & much clearer with these headphones!!!  I highly recommend these!!!

VThis set works great, but you have to pay attention to the directions. When I set it up all I could hear was static. I did not realize you had to play with the tuning dial  to get it to work. Once I figured that out it works great. The only bad thing is you have to play with the headphones to sit properly on the holder to get it to charge correctly. That's why I  only gave it four stars. They had phones are good but not wonderful they work great for me

VAfter visiting with my dad for two days and yelling over the tv, I decided to look for headphones. My dad has had the tv so freaking loud for at least 4 yrs. This past visit almost put me over the edge. I researched/Google cordless headphones and decided on these. FANTASTIC choice!!! It is so quiet watching any program now. NO fights, yelling, screaming, headaches, words under my breath, etc...Its actually a very pleasant experience watching tv with my dad anymore.  He is soooo happy AND so is everyone in the house and on the block! It took literally 2 minutes or less for me to hook them up and get them working perfectly. It took longer to open the box. My dad walks around like king chit from room to room not missing a word. You can adjust the volume on the headset to your preference.  The tv itself can be on low, high, or mute and he can still hear it according to his headset volume. My mom wishes someone/anyone would have purchased these yrs ago. It would have saved a lot of headaches and nights of fustration! He is taking them to my house when he comes down to visit. They are THAT easy to install. This is in the top 5 products I have purchased on amazon.  UPDATE as of 11/30/15...The product is STILL fantastic!  My problem is the price dropped $10 in less than a month which does not make me happy!!

VI really enjoyed these headphones.  I use mostly for late at night when little ones are in bed and you don't want to wake them.  Also helps with movies that are very conversation driven, but for some unknown reason everyone speaks extremely softly or is whispering.  They don't have a lot of powerful bass output, so they may not be preferable to certain types of music, but on the upside, explosions and loud bangs in movies won't blow out your eardrums either.  Charging is as simple as putting them back on the stand.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the long term comfort.  After a two or three hours, you will feel the need to take them off for a few minutes.

VThe tutorial is annoying and really not necessary, man that guy likes to hear himself talk! Once installed and using them I was amazed. I never realized how much I was missing. Being a huge Cowboys football fan I could hear them in the huddle making calls! All I can say is that you don't know what you are missing if you have trouble hearing or the family gets annoyed at how loud the volume is when you watch TV. The quality is fantastic it's like being in a movie theater.

VSound is ok if you sit still near your smart TV. But the range is poor and connection drops out when you move around the house. (And we have a small house, less then 1500 sq. ft.) Headset becomes uncomfortable after a 1/2 hour of use. Volume and tuning controls are awkward to use because of there small size.

VI got these for my 86 year old mother, did a lot of looking around and reading reviews and these always came up as some of the best wireless ear phone as simple and well made.  My mom loves them, has stopped her needing to turn the volume up too loud when we visit her. I'm almost jealous sometimes, may have to order a pair for myself at some point.

VLots of hissing and some crackling/popping
p4438
sg5
VI bought these along with a supplemental set to hook up to my TV so I could turn the volume up loud without bother my neighbors.Setting it up was easy, and figuring out how to use them was simple, so I have no complaints there.The sound quality seems very good in general. However there is a whole lot of background hissing. There is a tuning dial that allows you to tweak the connection to the base, but no matter how carefully I tuned it I couldn't eliminate the hissing as well as some crackling and popping. If you're watching something that has constant noise above a certain level, you probably won't notice it. But if you're using it to play video games, or during conversation scenes, you'll definitely hear it. It gets worse when you move around or even turn your head in certain ways sometimes, I guess because the connection to the base is pretty fragile. I was able to still listen to things from the next room over, but it was hit-and-miss. Sometimes it would be fine, sometimes I'd get a lot of crackling.Also, they aren't very comfortable to wear for more than half an hour at a time.I'll be returning these shortly.

I'm just like OK. it's not getting a signal but Jeez, you'd think the manufacturer would know that this is probably unworkable for some people. I'm sending these back because now, I can't get audio at all just that hissing noise.

VGreat Headphones! Beware "Auto-Shutoff" Feature
p4468
sg5
VThe Good: Great Sound, Long Range, Wireless ChargeThe Bad: Auto Shut-off, A Little BulkyI have never reviewed anything before, but these headphones are definitely worth a few words. They have some great features and some unfortunate ones, but overall, they do exactly what they are designed to do, if you set them up right and understand how to use them properly.The base station is lightweight and sleek, and acts as a wireless charger for the actual headphones. This is a great feature, and really well designed. The two metal contact points on the headphones sit gently on the metal rest of the base station. Nothing plugs into the headphones, ever, and they never need batteries replaced. All you need to do to charge them is put them back where they go. A red light on the front of the base station lets you know that they're charging.The base station itself connects to a traditional power source via a small adaptor that, nevertheless, takes up two slots on a standard surge protector. If you have a lot of devices, you'll need to put it at the end ;) The audio runs via a male rca cable, from the base station to your audio source. That is extremely convenient, since it is the standard for most consumer audio products. With an rca to stereo mini adaptor, you can use these cans for pretty much anything.I purchased them as a gift for my grandmother, who is elderly and hard of hearing. I wanted her to be able to enjoy movies and television again without having to crank the volume or risk missing out on things. When I was there to set everything up for her, they worked like a charm.I have to admit, I was shocked myself at how clear the audio signal was. The bass is full and heavy, mids are solid, and the highs are crisp and clear. They work equally well for music, movies, and live television. They get LOUD. Louder than I expected. Loud enough for my grandmother. There is a frequency and volume control on the right side ear of the headphones, so you can make adjustments on the fly. On the left ear is a power switch. Simple, convenient, and user friendly.These are not Bluetooth. The base station broadcasts the signal from your audio device via radio transmission, directly to the receiver on the headphones. You can select a channel from a switch on the front of the base station. As long as the headphones are properly tuned into the broadcast from the base station, and within the very generous range (300ft), the sound is surprisingly good.  Get a snack, go to the bathroom, get the mail...you won't miss a beat. Keep the base station away from lights, power cables, and speakers, and there is very little interference at normal volume levels.I was able to use the output from my parents' television and set it up so that the headphones received an audio signal, even if the volume on the tv itself was turned all the way down. Eureka! Nana could watch a movie with the rest of the family or on her own without disturbing anyone else. I also thought they'd be great for watching tv while on the treadmill, but, alas, they're a little too bulky, and slip off soon after you start running.The biggest drawback of the Sennheiser RS120's is their Auto-Shut off feature. It is a confusing and frustrating experience if you are not well-informed about how it works. THIS IS IMPORTANT, and may be a deal breaker for a lot of people: if the headphones don't detect an audio signal after just a few minutes, they will stop sending a broadcast signal, and you will be greeted by a rush of loud static in both ears. It's an unpleasant surprise, but something that can be avoided altogether with minimal effort.After my mother called to complain that the headphones were no longer working, I took them home to see what was was happening. I hooked them up to my guitar amp to test them out. At first it was amazing. I could practice at night without waking my wife and son. I was able to play anywhere in the room, free from another tether to the amp! After a short break in playing, though, I lost contact with the base station and got the static full force.It was obnoxious and baffling to think that such a stupid feature would be included in something so well-designed in every other aspect. Why? WHY?? From what I've read in other reviews and online forums, it is for compliance with FCC broadcast regulations. Well, ok, then. Moving on...Other reviewers have offered up suggestions for dealing with the issue, and I want to make it clear that it has nothing to do with where it is plugged in or how it is powered. It is just designed this this way. One reviewer's suggestion for dealing with the problem was to crank the source audio, effectively tricking the base station into thinking it is receiving signal when nothing is actually playing. It works, but is not always practical for every situation, and it forces you to listen to the extra gain under your sound track.For me, the auto-shut off is not a deal breaker. Everything else works so well that I've learned to deal with it. A green light glows on the base station when you are broadcasting sound. When it is off, you'll get only static through the headphones. If you know this, you can proceed accordingly. When you pause your movie to go to the bathroom, you simply switch off the headphones before you lose the signal. When you come back, press play, and wait for the green light before switching them back on. After using them regularly, you'll do it automatically.It was the Auto-Shutoff that compelled me to write a review of this product to begin with. It makes them too complicated for my parents (let alone my grandmother) to use, unassisted. I get a lot of use out of them myself, and when we know that Nana is coming over, I'll bring them and set them up for her. In the meantime, I'm happy to finally be able to watch movies late at night when I get home from work. I'm thrilled to be able to play guitar at night without having to hunch in the corner like a troll.Unfortunately, now I owe my grandmother a new gift. She's so difficult to shop for.

VPerfect match of high quality and tolerable price.I have absolutely no complaints on this product.  Works throughout my apartment (even in through a couple walls) cannot say for multiple floors as I do not have multi-stories.  I have used them for 4-5 hours straight and only then did they start to irritate my ears/head but to be fair I have a really big head.  The battery has never been a problem even after that 4-5 hour stretch.Sound quality is probably around 8-8.5/10 even though the price is way less than how much you can spend on sennheiser headphones.This is based on a scale where I cannot imagine any headphone unit could achieve more than 9.5/10 considering the bass limitations of being laid upon your skull.My aunt has a pair of 2 year old sennheisers that, at the time she bought them, cost more than my laptop itself, and they didn't seem any better than these.

VPros: It works. It's RF so it works through walls. It uses replaceable rechargeable batteries.Cons: You have to tune it. I have never heard of this before. It should tune itself. To make matters worse, the tuning knob is large and just below the volume knob. It is very easy to accidentally turn the tuning dial when reaching up to change the volume. Then you have to tune it all over again. My preference would be to not have to tune it but if they must have it, they should have made it smaller and located it away from the volume control.

p4568

VWorks fine. However had problems at first. I found the trick is to adjust the volume on the TV to near maximum BEFORE using the headset controls. Then use the volume control on the headset to reduce the volume. If you have the TV volume set too low, and try to raise the volume with the headset control, you will get only static. The headset needs the TV volume set high in order to provide a strong enough signal for the headset to function.

My last set gave out and I decided to choose the Sennheiser RS 120.  The set up was very easy.  The quality of sound is very adequate for watching TV and movies.  The earphones are very comfortable.  I have been using the earphones for about a month so I have no review on the longevity of the earphones.

p4604
sg5
VI bought these headphones for my grandpa, mainly because he wanted to listen to his music channels on the TV louder than my grandmother wanted to listen to them.  For their application, these headphones seemed to be a good option.  After getting the headphones connected to the TV, plugged in, and ready to go (which was relatively easy), we tuned in the frequency of the unit and my grandpa was listening to his mellow, sleep-inducing instrumental music as loud as he wanted.  You do not have to worry about volume issues, as they can be turned up very loud.It should be clearly stated that these headphones are not made to emulate surround sound, but rather just provide stereo sound of whatever source you have them hooked up to.  While the distance was good (anywhere within his apartment he could use them) and the setup pretty easy, there are a few shortcomings with this product.  The contacts that keep the headphones charged on the base are just big enough to go on the metal rods.  If they're not placed on the base unit properly, they will lose connection and not charge.  In addition, the frequency dial on the headphones is a little too accessible and can be fumbled with on accident from time to time.  Neither of these issues are cause for alarm, but should be noted.Pros:+ Good wireless distance+ Powerful enough to provide good volume+ Comfortable to wear for extended listening sessionsCons:- A bit pricey- Charging contacts can be finicky- Frequency of headphones can be changed on accident at timesWhile I personally would've tried to purchase a pair of headphones that have some additional features, for what my grandpa needed (to listen to his TV), these were a good option.  After an easy setup, they work very well, are reliable, and provide good volume.  In addition, they are comfortable enough to wear for a prolonged amount of time.

VTo bulky, if I look at my feet they will fall off. Lots of static and interference. The transmitter is about 10 feet away. They sit on a cradle when charging and when they form to your head when you do go to charge them they may or may not charge or charge intermeditly due to the poor charging design. I would not recommend these to friends or family. For the price you can find better quality and ones that fit, charge and sound better with much less interference and static. I read mixed reviews and was hoping most of the negative ones where from picky people but that wasn't the case.

VThese are great sounding, lightweight headphones. They are plagued by an intermittent issue, however, that is very frustrating. Despite there being ample signal from the TV, the transmitter will, without warning and very irritatingly, lose power causing the headphones to blare static. Then, anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes later, the green power light on the base will come back on and one is able to hear the broadcast again.

p4699
sg5
VWanted to like them, but kept running into the same problems as others. The auto off feature is ridiculous and only half implemented. The idea to turn the transmitter off after "idle" time is not necessarily bad, but it should send a signal to turn the headphones off first or they should auto off by the same conditions. Otherwise you are met with loud static directed at your ears when your device is quiet for a few minutes.The reception adjuster knob is not the best, can't quite get the sweet spot. Either the set had a nice volume but a low hiss during quite times, or the volume doesn't get high enough and you get crystal clear audio. You kinda get to choose what works best for you, I guess it's nice they give you choices.In the end, I'm keeping them, mostly because I got them for free. I like the charging/transmitter base idea and it looks good holding them up on my desk. The sound can be great, and they are fairly comfortable.

Bulky when trying to lay on a pillow, not that comfortable, controls are tiny, if volume set really low it'll drop the signal connection and scare the crap out of you with loud static suddenly. not something I'd recommend....pluses? -charges relatively fast and convenient to drop onto the stand.

It's well made from a company with a reputation for making quality products.  Many cuts above a similar product by a different manufacturer which turned out to be cheaply produced, but with a hefty price tag.  Totally recommend it.

VWe bought two sets and are very pleased, I more so than my wife. We have one plugged in to the DVR on channel 1 for watching TV. The downside was that it wouldn't get sound for our Roku when watching Netflix or Amazon. The only audio out on my TV was a digital optical so we bought a digital to analog converter, an Orei DA34 recommended by Sennheiser and that solved the problem. Now the audio comes from the TV rather than the DVR so it doesn't matter if we are watching regular TV or streaming content with the Roku.

The sound is clear through both floors of our home, and over the entire lot while cutting grass.  The only problem I've had with distance or hiss, is when the batteries get weak.  Otherwise, the sound is great, although I'm no audiophile, and mainly listen to talk.

VI have to admit, I was skeptical when I ordered two of these.  I have had wireless headphones before and could always here static or they faded out after an hour or so.  I moved into a huge loft apartment, and using my huge surround sound was just a way to piss off my neighbors, so after some intense research, Sennheiser was quoted as the best many times over, and I wholeheartedly agree!!!  WOW, was I surprised at how easy these were to set up and use.  And the clarity and perfect surround sound is amazing.  I can now watch a movie at MY volume level, never have to worry about my neighbors again.  I bought two transmitters, one for my 3D t.v. in one room and one for my theater t.v. in my main room.  The headsets move from one to the other perfectly.  Being able to just set them on the transmitter to charge up is wonderful.  I have used them for up to 8 hours at a shot without recharge, didn't get uncomfortable, very soft on the ears/head, and the battery was still going strong.  I now use them for digital music and have wondered to every edge of my 2600 sq foot place and NEVER EVER got a single sound of static.  If you want GREAT sound, GREAT comfort, GREAT price, etc, etc, etc,  BUY THESE or one of Sennheiser's other models.....worth every penny!!!!Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Dock

VExcellent headphones! Deep bass, crisp high notes. Comfortable feel, especially like the fact that it uses standard rechargeable AA batteries. The stand doubling as a charger is also a very, very nice touch. This sits at my desk at work, and compared to my old wired headphones, these give me much more mobility and freedom to move around. Highly recommended!To those who may take issue with some "hissing", I think I have figured out why. As you tune the radio frequency, you'll come into some frequency bands that have a high volume but has hissing accompanying it. Tune it further, and the volume goes down (a bit or quite a lot, it depends on the headphone), but the hissing goes away. If at this point your volume settings are not at max, you can tune the volume up and get fully rich sound without the hissing. Try it, it's awesome :).

The tones (base and treble) are wonderful and the sound level is exceptional. I am able to listen to my computer and T.V. (with the help of a splitter) while everyone else is sleeping. Great product.

VI've had these now for a couple of months. Their good and fit well. And they charge while docked. My hearing is extremely poor and I could have used headphones with more volume. When the voices are soft and low it's quite difficult for me to hear them. I wanted to test wireless headphones at an audio store but could not find one. Best Buy and Radio Shack are not set up for testing. If anyone knows how I can find a headset with loud volume please let me know. Also, what would one look for under product description to find out how loud they go?

VThe quality of sound was very good but for me personally they were uncomfortable being on the ears instead of over the ears.  I wear glasses and after a short period of time my ears were aching.  After much more research and two pairs of headphones later I think I have finally found the best all around ones for me.  Though I've only had them for one day of usage the Sennheiser RS 175 over the ear has comfort, excellent sound and additional features to enhance bass or surround sound for movie watching.  They were a little pricier than I intended to spend but the quality has eased my sticker shock.

Plan on taking them along when we take the RV out that way I won't bother the wife while she watches a show in the bedroom and I'm in the front area. Well worth the money.

VWon't Stay on My Head
p5172
sg5
VThe headphones I received were tilted forward about 20 degrees, so they slid off my ears every time I leaned forward.  The headband is tough plastic, and would not bend straight.  I like them otherwise, but I bought them for my treadmill, and there is no way I can use them for that.  They would be fine for listing to music in a reclined position, but that is not why I bought mine.  I'm forced to return them.I still have an old pair of over-the-ear Sennheiser headphones I bought circa 1970, and those are great.  I've replaced the earpads many times, and the cord once.  I was hoping Sennheiser still had the magic, but I guess not.

VEnded up returning it. The transmission between base station and headphones are analog RF - and very susceptible to jamming. I work in an engineering lab and it's quite RF noisy. I could not get any channels to work cleanly.In addition there was something wrong in the phono plug adapter and it kept dropping the connection - which manifests as screaming loud static in my ear randomly. I'd be jamming along with my scratchy / noisy dance music and SCREEECCHHHHHHHHHH that would try to blow my ear drums out. Couldn't get it to work right. I've changed to bluetooth headphones and those are great if I'm in range.

VNICE HEADSET WITH FREQUENCY TUNING NECESSARY.
p5316
sg5
VThe headset generally meets my expectations.  However, there is a three-channel variable frequency control on the headset that can lose the signal from the TV transmitter if it is accidentally touched, or moved when one places the phones on their head.  You then have to retune the frequency knob to find the signal.  This is much like a sensitive radio dial on a transistor radio..

VFar from German Quality. The headphones had some interference sound while on. While they are "on" and there is nothing playing they will start to sound like an old TV while it is displaying snowfall. They are extremely uncomfortable! There is no place for your ears which means that they are squished. The charging base feels super cheap and really light. While picking up the headphones from the base the small magnets on the charging plates are able to pick up the base. Price is $80 but they are not worth any more than $20.

I was losing most if the dialogue in movies so I tried everything from higher quality speakers to ear buds to headphones.  I had quality problems with the ear bud system and the first headphones did not have rechargeable batteries.  The RS 120 successfully addresses all the problems and reproduces sound with a fidelity quite acceptable to me.  I also purchased an auxiliary headset which I alternate on the charger and it works just fine.  Set up is easy and quick and, all in all, I am completely satisfied.Bill T - Bend, OR

VRS100 Not For Serious Audio Applications
p5382
sg5
VI don't like to provide negative feedback but feel compelled to provide some caution.  While the audio quality reproduced ( when clear ) is very good and the range of the RS120 is excellent.  Unfortunately I must concur with other reviewers regarding the failure of the unit to allow the operator to fully tune out the Wifi, Cellular, and general radio frequency noise they pick up is a show stopper for me. There is obviously some lack of filtering, shielding or other engineering design issue allowing the unwanted signals to get into the audio inputs. I would suggest one could live with the background hiss once an audio source is playing, however the large static crashes and RFI picked up make them unusable and I give them an overall 1 star.  I will experiment with some clamp on ferrite cores on the various power and audio cables in hopes I can keep the stray signals out of the unit but given the amplitude I am hearing from the RFI and static crashes, it is doubtful that will work. I promise to return and post an altering review if that proves successful. I will say though this headset is almost there, just not quite for a price approaching $100bucks.

VThe perfect solution for my silent TV watching and video game playing needs!
p5423
sg5
VI waited to write a review after I had a chance to fully test my new Sennheiser wireless headphones. After several weeks of using them, I must say, I am extremely happy with all aspects of this product! I mainly use them at night, after my fiance goes to bed, so I don't wake her when I watch a movie or play a video game. I am using the headphone adapter to plug the base into the headphone jack of my stereo receiver, which is where I have all audio routed to (TV, CD, PS3, Record Player, Computer, etc...).First off, the headphones sound GREAT, in my opinion! The audio is very clear, and it has a good balance of bass and treble. Neither are overpowering, much like a decent pair of studio headphones...pretty even across the spectrum. I do not notice any "hiss" or feedback when there is audio present, but there is a little hiss when your audio source is silent (like during loading screens for games, or dvd menus). This goes away once audio is playing. I watched a couple of action movies the other night, and the balance between the music, dialog and sound effects was perfect. Also, when playing games, the audio was crisp and balanced. In fact, I could hear a lot of background sounds in the movies/games that I wouldn't have noticed when listening to them without the headphones on.The headphones have a power switch on them, as well as a volume control and a channel tuner. The channel tuner is used for "tuning-in" the reception from the base, in case you are getting static (not for tuning in radio stations, etc...). The volume control works great, and can be used even if the volume on your audio source is turned down low. I have read a few reviews from people who mentioned the volume being adjusted accidentally, when they would lay down on a pillow or something. I have not had this happen yet, but also have not totally tried wearing them while lying down...I have only rested my head against a pillow while on the couch, and have not had any issues like that. The only negative mark I could give it would be that after a couple of hours or more of having them on, the headphones do start to become uncomfortable on your ear. There isn't a lot of padding on them, and they do not fit over the entire ear. But, it isn't so bad for me that I would deduct a star from the review.The range of the signal seems to be very good, and works great for my situation. My front room is fairly large, and I have been able to walk around in it, and into the kitchen without any issues. I would say it is at least 30 feet away from where the base is located, and even when the signal would be passing through a wall. So far, so good. Occasionally, I will get a quick "hit" in the signal when I turn my head a certain way, but it goes away almost instantly. This has happened when I was sitting 5 feet from the base as well, so I'm not sure if it is quick interference from another device, or actually coming from the base. It is definitely not something that is horrible, though, and shouldn't worry anyone thinking about purchasing it, in my opinion.Ultimately, I couldn't be happier with this purchase! The price is definitely right for what you get, especially when compared to other similar products. Plus, being in the video production industry, I have always relied on Sennheiser to deliver quality audio products, and this is no exception. Good clean and balanced audio, high volume, great range, and easy charging make this a great buy.

p5465
sg5
VUPDATE AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF ATTEMPTED USE: This strikes me as a cheap analog tuning design from the mid-Twentieth Century.  Does not even have a old time "squelch" circuit to protect ears from loud hash when user is tuning but signal is not yet locked (and seems to require retuning each time turned on).Although it sometimes has excellent sound quality when "locked", it usually has an annoying "pulsing" noise during quiet audio and often has to be reset by unplugging power.I would never buy again.

In fact, she asked me to buy her a pair... made a great birthday gift. I do have a couple cons:  1) the Tuning knob is difficult to use because you have to turn it such a small amount to go from scratchy, bad noise to good sound.  It is easy to bump or turn by mistake.  2) They tend to slide off my head when I bend over the least little bit.  I think that if they had over -the-ear pads on them they would stay on better.

VThis headset works great. I am amazed at the clarity of the television audio, things that I haven't heard in a very long time: distant car horns, ice tinkling in glasses, children laughing in the distance, etc. My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the headset gets a bit uncomfortable during a full night of TV viewing. It's just a little tight. But that's not enough to not buy one for anyone. I'd purchase this unit again!

I was able to use the head phones on the old sending ad charging dock,which I have saved as a back up in case the old one fails.

VWe bought the headphones because my wife and I live in a one bedroom apartment and it's nice to be able to do two different things without disturbing one another. The headphones have great sound but I don't love that the radio dial is not digital and that it's on the same side of the headset as the volume. Sometimes I want to turn the volume up and I hit the radio dial which changes the station and the noise is not pleasant. They are comfortable to wear but if worn for the length of an entire movie my ears feel really hot like I have ear muff's on in the summer.On the plus side it was very easy to set up once we realized we needed to plug them into the computer and not the surround sound or tv. Daily access is so convenient because you don't have to unplug them from anything in order to use them. They just sit there, charging right on the metal stand, until you are ready to use them. I am  happy with the product overall but I look forward to updated models.

VMy system:LG TVDenon AV recieverATT UverseRokuGoogle chromecastStatic noise is the issue.Worked beautifully when ATT Uverse channel selected.When Roku or chromecast selected the static noise was intolerable.Also, if there is no transmitted sound for almost exactly 3 minutes (maybe you have paused the program) the static noise BLASTS you out of your chair.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 9/8/2015The main reasons we wanted headsets were:1. We wanted separate volume controls.2. We wanted headsets when we found that, despite our expensive Bose surround sound system, when watching, as an example, movies with British accents, we had to turn on subtitles. But with good headsets that problem pretty much disappears.After trying these headsets (and one other cordless type), there was just too much fooling around. We didn't particularly like the two controls (volume/tune) on one side since it is too easy to accidentally tweak the tuner. And as mentioned above, there was way too much static noise when we selected Roku or Chromecast.Also, we found that we preferred the 'on ear' type since they are more comfortable and noise attenuation is not important when you are in your own TV room.So I did some more research and came up with a near perfect solution (for us). Enter the BEHRINGER MICROAMP HA400 ($25) and a coupla Bose on-ear (wired) headsets (about $100 each) . Its a simple little amplified box that is placed near your favorite TV watching chairs. I ran a cable under the carpet from the A/V receiver to HA400. Both head sets then plug into the HA400. Its so much nicer to reach over and turn 'your' volume control on the HA400 than fooling around with the wheel on the headset. Of course, it doesn't matter now if we select Uverse or Roku or Chromecast we get a clean static free transmission. (With both wireless sets we tried we would even get some Ham transmissions from time to time). Obviously we had to give up the freedom of the cordless sets but that is the only downside.Constant clean sound reproduction, zero static, no headset charging, no remembering to turn off the headsets.

VI have a DVR that goes to my AV receiver then to the TV.  If you hook it to the AV Receiver jphone jack plug it shuts off the speakers, and My wife wasn't happy with that, so I hooked it into the TV itself in the Audio out plug,  That works great.  I take my haring aids out when I use the earphones as the pressure on the ears with the aids behind them is uncomfortable after a few hours.  From a sound standpoint, this is the clearest sound I've had in years!  I hear things in programs that I have never heard before and the voices are so clear that I never miss a word like I did with only my hearing aids.LOVE THEM!

VMy own fault for not jumping right on the return wagon, but really thought it was my lack of knowledge in hooking them up. Which seemed relatively easy. I should've known when I first plugged them in and tried to rest the earphones on the charging dock and the red charging light did not illuminate properly that something was wrong, but again doubted myself. Then plugging them into the tv, reading all the instructions on how to connect through Visio audio, still they do not work. The audio connect light oddly lights up briefly when the tv turns on, but no audio is heard through the headphones at any time. Eventually the green audio connect light just shuts off and I'm left with static.I'm very unhappy that I only had 30 days to decide how to work these things.

VGreat Quality Sound, From 30' and Through Cement Wall!
p5854
sg5
Vi bought these headphones to be able to watch TV shows in the same room as my husband, when he's working and can be distracted by the TV sound. Our TV is outdoors, and gets signal from a cable box inside the house using wireless HDMI - about 30ft away from where we sit, and through the exterior cement wall of the house. After reading some other reviews, I was worried the sound quality would be poor and that I'd have to return them, but the sound quality is great and the lip/voice sync is better than with the wireless HDMI hookup. The setup of the headphones was very easy - less than 5 minutes to get the batteries in and connect the base to the cable box indoors. Overall, I'm very happy with them!

VThe power plug from the wall unit would not mate properly with the receptacle on the rear of the transmitter unit.The plug would not fully seat down in the receptacle. A gap between the plug and receptacle was clearly evident. The power light on the transmitter would not come on no matter how firmly we pressed on the yellow plug. We tried twisting the plug while turning but it would not fully seat. I am very disappointed in this product and its manufacturer as it appears that a quality check may  not have been made before the unit was shipped. I have already shipped a previous similar item back because it was listed on a page with wireless items and it was not.

VI am giving this 3 stars with the hopes that people may actually read what i got to say. Do NOT buy this headphone set! I used for a day and packed it for a return with the speed of light. I am a musician. My ear is trained to sounds. The white noise you are about to experience with these headphones is going to drive you crazy. No matter what the frequency you set the dock at - that noise will be there, lower, or louder, it is there and does not go away. Another thing i absolutely hate about these headphones is all the wires that they take in order to function. When think wireless you don't expect a ton of wires. The dock needs to be plugged into an outlet. It is retarded. One would think the dock would charge and then function without being plugged in at all times. Think about this- wanting to use these headphones on your laptop- you have to tie down your laptop to the dock, which is wired to the wall making your laptop stuck at a very rigid position. Cant do much. Defies its purpose. And even if you lets say hold your laptop sitting right next to an outlet- there are wires all over you. The padding on the headphones feels cheap like an 80s walkman. These headphones also do not seal very well. Everyone within 3 feet radius will hear exactly what you are doing. And there is no bass. God, if you listen to anything with a deep bass, these headphones sound like they are about to fall apart. And of course, just like everyone else, i found the tuner nob right next to the volume absolutely impractical. Lets say you laid down on your couch listening to an audio book, if you moved a little too much, chances are, you'd hit that tuner and the clarity of the connection goes to hell. Last but not least, they are unreasonably stupid expensive for what you get. I paid an extra 10 $ and got a pair of studio AKGs that come with a 3 meter cable instead. Best decision ever. Just like these were the worst decision ever. Sennheiser have another pair thats like 29$ and that pair is not wireless but it is miles better more durable and sound efficient than these disgusting waste of money headphones.

Little pieces of cheap plastic all the way down the cord to bare wire. To repair they need to be rewired.  I called Sennheiser and there is no recourse.  You must pay to send to them. Pay them to repair cord pay then for return shipping.  They do not stand behind their product very disappointing and expensive!Would never buy their product again.

VI ordered these as a gift for my brother because he produces music and is a huge miami heat fan. I figured what a great way to combine both of the things that he loves sports and music. He used them when producing beats. My brother indicated that he loved thie sound quality of them, however he didn't use them that often as he obtained so better quality studio headphones. Overall I would say due to my brother liking them I will give them four stars. They are a decent set of headphones, not high quality though. I would recommend them to anyone looking for headphones on a budget or just something temporarily.

VThese headphones are great.  The cuff over the ear blocks out the noise and keeps the music in nicely.  The color and style are as pictured.  These work great and the cord is sturdy when taking it in and out.  Great product.  I gave it a 4 of 5 because there was an older rasta style I was looking for that they no longer carry.

Vi liked these a lot when i first got them. then a little on down the road, they started breaking around the extension piece from putting them on my head. theyre cheap and flimsy feeling, and not durable at all, like most of candy's stuff, but they do look cool. theyre not comfortable to wear from an extensive amount of time. (after 15 minutes, your ears start to get sore) they came in perfect condition from the seller, so its not their fault that these broke like they did.

VBest Budget Headphones On The Market
p6532
sg5
VI have owned these headphones for nearly a year now and thought I could finally put my opinion on them for the public. My initial impression of these headphones was "these headphones have way less bass response than say, my pair of beats" - which I no longer own. They do, and if subwoofer range bass is your cup of tea, then a pair of overpriced beats may be the headphones for you. These headphones are very balanced in their approach. Discerning ears may be able to hear or notice that they may have too much treble response, which can sometimes be slightly shrill, but in this price range - there is some legitimate give and take as to what you get. These headphones are extremely durable - my dog got ahold of them one day and pulled the ear piece off the headphone itself and it slipped right back on a lot easier than I expected. I travel with them quite often and they are in my suitcase and they have held up to the test of time. I took a full star off due to the treble being slightly shrill at times and the fact that if you are a warm blooded person they can heat up your ears and cause some uncomfortable experiences. As I said, I sold my beats headphones after finding these. I am sure there are better headphones out there (Sennheisers, etc) - but as far as performance, stylish design and everyday wear and tear - these are practically unbeatable in this price range.

The adjustable headset is poorly made. I promise you will only get 6 months out of these headphones, which is a bad investment.

Although they don't look like new anymore but that is because I basically beat them up. If u r a looking for a great pare of headphones that are durable, good looking, sound amazing at a reasonable price well these are it.

I unfortunately wasted all my money at the strip club and I'm broke. But you should buy it! Aye buy me one while ur at it bro

Check out some place like Ross or Marshalls first, as I got this exact pair for $12 in a discount bin. They are great headphone, just do a little looking and don't spend $150 on them.

VMuddy sound, OK price
p6719
sg5
VI bought these mostly based on price and the microphone and somewhat on reviews.  They seem to work OK, but I find the round over-the-ear design doesn't fit my ears very well (they're more oval ;) and the clamping force is pretty high, although not terribly so.  I only gave them 2 stars because from the very first they sounded "muddy" to me.  They play plenty loud and have plenty of bass, but the sound is just muffled, or something.  I have other inexpensive headphones that sound better to me, so I wouldn't go with these again.  I should note that I have mostly used them with an adapter cable to plug them into my computer(s), so it's possible that the adapter could be causing the bad sound, but I did plug them directly into an Android tablet with similar results, so I don't think it is the adapter.

VI went through two pairs of these in one year because they both got shorts in the cord. they also both broke right above the earpad, but I could still use them after duct taping them. (they both broke within a month of owning them, not because I stepped on them or anything. I had to adjust them so they wouldn't hurt my head, and they broke from that, which is kind of ridiculous. they really shouldn't have been that easy to break.) Basically, they're really painful to wear for more than half an hour.the sound quality is decent, but it doesn't make up for everything else.I think the only positive thing I can say about them is that they're pretty, and the name is amusing.

p6890

VThe third set I've bought, but only because my son stole my first pair and my second pair got torn apart in a move.  I am allergic to Latex and cannot use ear buds and I also have a hearing problem, so my needs are different than most people.  Depending on my work schedule, I have been known to wear these for 8hrs while entering data and experience little to no discomfort.  I also do not have to turn up the volume very loud anymore, saving my already damaged hearing. I can also hear for the first time minute details in movies (ghost noises in my paranormal shows!) and the sweetest notes of Vivaldi's concertos. Pure bliss! And let's not forget how AWESOME they look!!  Everybody giggles and comments on the devil monkey and "Be Good Tomorrow" stitched along the top.  Totally me!!If you are looking at more expensive headphones, I would seriously consider these or any other Skullcandy cans first.  The quality and customer service (Lifetime replacement) cannot be beat!

It feels like they're squishing my ears into my skull. At this point, I prefer Apple's crappy earbuds and if I cant find those, I'll wear these around my neck but it's not comfortable so it doesn't last long. I've had them for a year and continue to try to use them but it always fails so they just sit in a box for the most part :( sucks because i love these so much and really dont want to buy a new pair of headphones.

VSkullcandy Hesh Headphones S6HEDZ-118 black
p6955
sg5
VFirst of all, these are Skullcandy and they do sound good. The bass sound is excellent , but the overall sound isn't loud enough. They make me want to increase the gain on every Mp3 I own. Now, just hold on a second, because these are fairly loud. My ears aren't ringing after listening to music through theses headphones. I bought these used and I always expect some problems, but I had to completely rewire these headphones. The headphones started making fluttering sounds and I know they were shorting out. They now work just as good as new. These headphones are just okay and don't regret buying them, I just wish they were about 3 notches louder.

VGood for closing on the job. they cancel out well if you turn them up loud. But I have six holes in my ears and these headphones are pretty tight right out of the box. Uncomfortable. And if you're over six foot tall or have a bigger than average head size, you're probably not going to like these. Carrying bag you get with these is a nice touch, keeps them safe inside a bookbag or duffle bag.But all in all: They are too tight, especially if you have earrings. The cord is braided, but is very short. The sound is good, but not fifty dollars good.

VThe adjustment on these headphones is the weakpoint... The ladders (or whatever you want to call them) are extremely thin - and the way that they headphones are designed - the heavier piece (that it comes out of with the logo) acts as a fulcrum to weaken these rather thin plastic parts. My left headphone adjuster is cracked clean through - enough to expose the wire - so I have a very ridiculous frakenstein tape job holding them together. The right side is also clearly weak and is beginning to crack as well.

VThese are mediocre headphones to put it best. Would probably be great for younger children or those not really serious about sound quality.The sound quality on these headphones is below average. My music constantly sounds distorted/fuzzy when listening with these.The build quality is less than stellar. If you enjoy 'creaking' sounds with every twist and turn then these by far are the king of creakiness. It's almost unbearable just to adjust them on your ears after extended periods of use without having to cringe at the sound of cheaply made plastic.The Skullcandy brand is all hype! I've even tried the ti headphones which are supposed to be an upgrade from these... sounds the same to me. If you are more worried about fashion than sound quality, then Skullcandy has you covered. You can find just about every color to match your outfit of the day. They even have headphones from all your favorite sports teams! Jack up the price by slapping logos of your favorite team on them, but pay no attention to sound quality.I'm writing this review not even an hour after selling these on Craigslist. Comparing these headphones to my Audio Technica WS-55 and M50 is like night and day. If you are serious about sound, steer clear from this brand altogether.2 stars since they have a pretty decent warranty. Not many companies will get you a replacement for 50% off if you accidentally break them.

They are cute and pretty comfortable until the 5th month when the ear cushions get a bit harder and less giving.I would not recommend these if you are looking for something to last a long time. I could have bought 5 pairs of headphones for this price and still had three or four leftover by now.

VThese headphones are great for sitting at your computer and listening to music. They have a great sound that doesn't produce to much treble or bass; very well balanced. There are two issues with these headphones that comes down to personal preference. First, whatever you are listening to is going to be heard by the world. These headphones do not muffle the sound of your music at all, so others will always be able to hear you unless you turn your volume literally all the way down. This isn't an issue for me because I listen to them primary at home. Second, if you move around at all while listening to these bad boys you are going to sweat. This is an issue for me because I often clean and dance around when I'm jammin. They are similar to ear muffs and will heat your ears pretty quickly. Keep those two things in mind, but also know that this is a nice pair of headphones depending on your preferences.

p7098
sg5
VFor starters, let me just say that these phones actually handle DJ TECHNORCH, noizenecio and t+pazolite very well! Most stereo systems and headphones simply cannot output his music all that well, but these headphones can! These headphones can handle powerful beats up to 800 beats per minute. Just go on youtube and play NECROPOTENCE from t+pazolite. That was the song I used to test out how fast of music these can handle. As far as heavy hitting bass, anything done by RoughSketch, noizenicio, and DJ TECHNORCH was good enough to test these headphones out. They can literally handle anything you throw at them.These headphones cost me about $50 and were the perfect replacement for my Sony headphones. The bass is definitely there without the need for extra subwoofer power from the higher end headphones. The headphones cover your ears perfectly to keep outside noise out, even when the volume is low, so I can use them near loud vacuum cleaners or machines or something.Bottom-line, for the price, these headphones are golden! It is like you are getting something far better than beats audio headphones (usually go for around $200) for 1/4 the price!

VThey're okay, but I'm not buying another pair
p7188
sg5
VI'm not buying another pair of these.  I was very excited when I first saw the headphones, thinking they were stylish, good quality sound, and economical (mine cost $30).  Unfortunately, they only delivered as I had expected in style.  They looked exactly the same in real life as they did in the pictures online.  For the first few months, I really loved them.  However, after I took them on a trip and wore them for more than an hour and a half, they started to hurt my head.  I felt like my ears were being crushed.  The headband pulls the cans together way too hard.  Granted, my head is larger than average, and as far as adjust-ability goes they fit _around_ my head very nicely, but for extended listening these headphones hurt.  Now I'm no expert on sound quality, but these didn't seem too magical, and from what others have said Skullcandy is primarily about style.If you have a small head, care about style over quality, and can't afford Beats or some more fashionable but comparably low-quality pair of headphones, by all means buy these.  Otherwise, go for a pair of cheap Sonys, JVCs, Koss or some other brand that puts sound quality and comfort first.  You'll thank me later.

VPoor craftsmanship. They look good, but the headband is constructed with a metal strap that attaches to the earphone with plastic. Over time the plastic cracks and breaks leaving the earphone detached. I contacted the seller about this problem but got no reply. If you do decide to purchase a pair of these headphones you must remove them carefully otherwise they'll break in time. Since I got no reply from the seller I have reattached the earphone using zip ties which will only last until I find another suitable pair. This time I'll be more careful. Buyer beware.

VThe best headphones iv ever listened to
p7246
sg5
VI heard about these new "beats" headphones, and looked them up online and discovered that they were very stylish, and I also discovered the price, unfortunately. I am a huge OKC thunder fan, and play basketball a lot.I sampled the beats from one of my friends while we were shooting hoops. i realized why the beats have horrible reviews. The sound quality is very poor. I decided these Skullcandy headphones were going to be the best choice for me. I have had them for 6 months, and i these six months i have discovered thse things.  1. The sound quality is absolutely insane. I have never heard headphones that project the sound so clear. I am more of a pop- rap guy, and these headphones are amazing.  2.  these headphones NEVER fall off. I have taken these headphones to their limits, and they have never let me down. I have done every workout  I know of, and they have never fell off. ever.  THE VERY FEW COMPLAINTS... I would really have liked the parts where you can adjust the size to be metal.  2. After 4+ hours they start really hugging your ears and they start geting uncomfortable. But if you take them off for 5 mins, and then put them back on, they'll feal good as new.  overall great headphones.

VA decent pair of budget headphones
p7251
sg5
VFor ~$50, you will get a decent product. Although many people will only buy it because of the brand name/looks, you won't get a bad pair of headphones. The large 50mm drivers make for loud sound. Whether that's good sound or not is a whole different story. From the ears of an audiophile, you will immediately hear imperfections. However if you've just come from cheap iPhone headphones, you'll hear heaven. There definitely is a burn-in time. When you first get it, the bass will be a little overpowering, bleeding into the mids. The highs won't really be noticeable either. However once you've got a few hours into them, they start to even out. I tested these with dubstep, electro, rap, and rock in FLAC format. If you're listening to mp3, you're not going to hear what these headphones can actually produce. The Hesh don't actually have a ton of bass compared to others, but the bass is smooth. If you're looking for head-thumping bass, you're not going to get it from these. What you will get is a smoother, more refined bass. The mids are harder to detect. They're not as prevalent in these but a trained ear can hear solid mids. The songs I was playing didn't really push the highs too hard so I can't vouch for certain the quality of the highs.I liked the different color varieties so you can personalize your headphones. They're not at all bland. The headphones are sleek and aesthetically pleasing. I only have one complaint in that the cups are a little too thick. You'll look kind of like Mickey Mouse walking out in these. It doesn't really matter to me since I'm only going to use these for office/travel use.The construction is where the Hesh falls apart for me. It's made entirely of cheap plastic. I can see they did it to cut down costs but in the end, these headphones will not last. The adjuster band killed the headphones. After a few months of use, they snapped one-by-one. I ended supergluing it together but now it will no longer be able to adjust the size.The comfort is also not a huge win for me. The headstrap does not have a lot of padding. It also doesn't create a lot of friction. It can be good or bad depending on how you wear it but for me the headphones just kept slipping off my head. The cup pads are very stiff. They're made of a fake leather material. It's very hard and uncomfortable compared to other headphones. Depending on the size of your ears, the cup may be over-ear or on-ear. It's just small enough and just big enough to be both. The cups will end up hurting your ears after a while of wear.These come with a gold-plated 3.5mm jack so you can use it for your iPhone or PC. I've had no connection problems or power problems. I've accidentally run over the cord/jack with my chair and no damage has been done. The cord is made of nice braided fabric so it will last longer than other rubber/plastic cords. The mic is of decent quality. Phone/Skype calls will work pretty well. However since it is an inline mic, they tend to pick up a lot more things than you want. For example, my friends could hear my mom in another room or my dogs barking outside.In the end, I wouldn't exactly recommend these to anyone but it's not exactly a bad choice if you're set on getting one.

VOne of the best sets of headphones I've ever owned. Very sturdy, amazing bass and sound. I've grown a lot of hate for Dr. Dre because of how overpriced they are. All you need is a great sounding pair of headphones - and these are it. They sound absolutely beautiful on newer songs such as Imagine Dragons - Radioactive, however they sound great on all songs.Instead of wasting a ton of money on a pair of Dr. Dre's headphones, buy these.*EDIT*After an honorable use of two-three years, I've gotten new headphones. I got the Skullcandy Crushers, and they're very nice. I decided to come back to these headphones as a spare but they sound like rubbish now. Was surprised at first, but these things are dirt old.

Im an average sized adult male, these should fit much better.Sound is adequate, single sided cord is nice.  Rest of headphones feel too large and plasticy, but also fragile.

VThe skullcandy hesh are pretty awesome. I just bought my second pair and they are great. of course the build isn't the best, but they are the best headphones under 50$ that you can get. If you are on the budget, the highs, mids, and bass are the best on these headphones than any other. just be careful because they aren't the sturdiest pair around. i would refer these to a friend.

VMy son wanted these because a friend of his had some and he loved everything about them.After looking locally at all of the stores we found them on Amazon for $20.00 less and that made him very happy since he was spending his own money.  He thinks the design is awesome and has them around his neck as much as possible whether he is using them or not. He couldn't be happier with his purchase.

VI took a chance on purchasing them while shopping at another retailer. I was looking here at another brand,(which I'll still purchase cause I want them), but at this moment I was in need of a pair for my HTC One with Beats Audio. The moment I plugged them in, I was thinking to myself, "They'll probably sound OK" That was an understatement. The enhanced sound quality from the Beats Audio of this phone gave these headphones some serious knock. The bass response isn't overpowering, but it's more than adequate. The highs and mids aren't piercing either, so you won't get that scratchy sound I hate. The only genre I've listened to with them so far is Dubstep and Hip-Hop, and I've been more than impressed by the sound quality. For the price, you can't beat them. If your looking for some serious sound on the go without breaking your wallet, then Skullcandy Hesh gets 2 thumbs up from me.

VI bought these phones at Sam's Club for 40 bucks. I was looking for something that was sweat resistant, durable and decent sounding. These are not audiophile headphones, but they sound much better than most for the price...and I consider them quite sturdy...at least compared to my Grado headphones. Overall, highly recommended.

VThese headphones came in Record time: 2 days. The sound quality is great for just $40! They do not fit too tight and came in the original packaging. The material is very sturdy and nothing is flimsy. The only thing is that the blue is much darker than what is shown in the picture. But other than that these headphones are great. A very good buy.

With this being said, I have only had the item for two days so I can't say for sure but I think that it is of high quality. A 4.5 star review if possible (iAccessory Shop - seller)

VI was really attracted to these because of the Boston Celtic team colors and KG as the featured player.  It is top notch Skullcandy performance as over ear headphones and sounded great.  Only problem I had was that the head band is made of plastic and didn't adjust too much. I wear a size 8 cap and these headphones were on the tight end when I put them on.

VI have to laugh at people who say the packaging was hard to get into- I ripped it right open with my hands and I am a pregnant female. Besides it has nothing to do with the product.I amusing these right now. Optically I love them. They sound just fine as well. I don't have them turned up loud and they tune out the outer noises. They are pretty snug and tight on my head though but maybe I just have to wear them in a bit, they are stiff straight out of the box and I do have a big head. Good sound though!!!

VA Good Set for the Money
p7602
sg5
VMy original review appears to have been based on faulty data and I apologize to the Skullcandy people.  This set has decent power, clarity, and a good range of sound.  It does not have AC-DC concert volume, but at this price, I really didn't expect that.I had written that there was a good deal of distortion at higher volume levels and this remains true, but I am speaking about what most people would consider an insane decibel load for the human ear.  After 45 years of playing like Tommy Chong, my ears are shot anyway, but others might like to preserve their hearing.The cord is a bit short, but I own many extensions, so if you need a longer cord, pick one up.  I really like the fabric feel of the cord.  It should help it last longer than a traditional one........time will tell.In short, I recommend these phones both for the average listener and for the Rockers out there who are tired of wimpy low end headphones and on't want to drop a few hundred dollars for the big boys just now.

VI just got these headphones today. They're amazing! Very nice, very stylish, very padded. :) The sound is AMAZING, literally like no other headphones that I have ever tried before. The bass is AWESOME and I love them. HOWEVER, there is one big down side. (Which is why I didn't give it a 5.) After about twenty minutes these headphones hurt your ears. /: Maybe it's just because I just got them today and they haven't "stretched out" or because I was just sitting down in one position, but they were really tight. I think that if you were doing something at the same time, such as moving around or reading a book, you might be able to ignore it. But just sitting down and listening to music, they really hurt. I'm not sure if this will go away with time or not though, so I'll update in about a month. I would definitely buy them. :)

p7708
sg5
VFor the price you pay the quality of the sound is amazing. The clarity of the music is amazing and good for the price the only thing lacking is the plastic that makes up the headphones. It is cheap and when used everyday on a normal basis the plastic tends to give up and can form cracks which eventually can break. The last problem is the cups, they hurt the ear when used for more then 30 to 40 minutes.

p7773

VThese Hesh headphones are decent for the price, but they are uncomfortable. They squeeze your head a lot and the padding is hard and irritating. Makes long listening sessions almost unbearable. The construction is cheap plastic, and the sound gets distorted as the volume increases. But for the price, they are pretty good. I suggest lower volume listening, so that you get better overall sound. They look stylish, but for $60 I bet you can find better. Look for brands like audio technica, sennheiser, and grado. If you aren't an audiophile, then these are great. If you are, go for something else.

VI bought a pair of these from the local Entertainment store and have had them for about 2 years now and I can say that this headset is awesome! Sound is great and they're really loud for what they are. I was never expecting this much volume from a headset that doesn't require batteries. The sound is great, I can wear them for a long time before they bother me but like any headsets they will start hurting eventually but thats just the ears' way of saying they need a break. I see a lot of bad reviews saying these are cheap and break easy but I have dropped mine a fair share and they are still intact and work perfect. It is most likely user error to people who claimed theirs broke so soon. These are $50 dollars, so quit expecting them to work like $300 cans! These are just perfect for anyone who wants high volume and great sound at a decent price but know that you are getting what you pay for, Skull Candy, NOT DRE BEATS!!!

V$50 Dollar Junk Headphones
p7833
sg5
VI remember reading the posts about how they break easily and I figured that most of the posters must be negligent, but I've been proven wrong.I bought the headphones for myself as a X-Mas gift just to have one side crack while I was placing them over my head. LITERALLY. Not even a month and they broke up going over my head.A week later and that side has snapped off completely. Now... it's not like these were even my daily wear headphones, I only wore them when working from home and the sad truth is my dollar store headphones, and $13 Skype headphones have lasted over a year.Why the bass was great and the noise cancellation was unbeatable what's the point if you pay $50 for a month? Unless Beats by Dre are actually durable and worth the money not only have these headphones turned me off from Skull Candy forever, but perhaps all premium headphones.Good riddance...

VAfter having a server ear infection resulting in a tube being put in my ear I was told by my doctor to switch from earbuds back to headphones. I have heard very good things about skull candy so I looked into getting a set of headphones made by Skullcandy. While browsing I ran across this pair and fell in in love with them! They are very good. Perfect noise cancellation, fits my ears extreamly well. My only complaint is that they are kinda bulky and don't fit around my neck as well as I had hoped. These head phones come with a drawstring bag to carry them around and protect them as they ride around in my backpack when not in use. If a friend asked me to suggest a pair of headphones i'd tell them to go right for these.

The fit is nice over the ears, sound (especially base) is solid, but anything passed 75%-80% volume the sound gets muddled & sound bleeds out so others can hear music. If you're looking for high-end sound then these are not the headphones for you, but if you want an affordable, good (not great) set of headphones, these will do just fine.

VI purchased the headphones for my son for Christmas. He wanted the Beatz by Dre. But after reading the reviews on the poor quality; how quickly they break, etc. After reading the reviews I selected this model of SkullCandy headphones. My son loves them said they are better than the Dr Dre headphones. He now wants another pair in a different style. Awesome buy!

He doesn't have a large head, and he always treats his electronics with care, yet the cracks have deepened almost enough to snap the headphones right off. I can only conclude that the Hesh headphones are made with subpar materials.On the plus side, they do have a nice sound, good bass and noise-canceling ability. And they look cool, lol.

Vgood sound, not comfortable
p8137
sg5
VExcellent sound - comparable to the quality of my Bose AE2's with a very high efficiency (volume produced for the input given - as loud as I have ever seen any headphone produce). They are heavy and they bother my ears after about 40 mins. I have a large head but tiny ears and the design of the cups just does not work for me. The cups are not large enough to go all the way around my ears so they apply pressure to either the pinna or the lobes. The padding on them is not soft enough to compensate for the pressure they apply on my ears and the discomfort gets to me after a while. The headband is somewhat bendable and you can reduce the pressure they apply to your ears to some extent but it is still not enough. I like the sound enough that I have been wearing them several times a week for the last 3 months and unfortunately they have not gotten any more comfortable with breaking in.

VGreat Pair of Headphones for the Price
p8178
sg5
VI found this pear of headphones elsewhere, and decided to write a review here for the community. Highs are very good, lows are enjoyable and the overall build quality is good. This is the first generation, so they do feel a bit plastic-y, but not so much that you feel like they will break at any moment. They isolate outside noise very well only when the music is high, but that is usually not a problem for me. The leather cushions add for an extra luxurious feel and are very comfortable to wear, partly because the top of the headphones is also padded. The leather has its downside as well: your ears will warm up after about 30 minutes of constant use. The cord is of appropriate length and doesn't limit your mobility. If you're on a budget, this pair of headphones is still a very good buy, even if they are a bit outdated.

VOverall, the sound of these headphones is top-notch for the price range, although the highs are a bit muddied VS the lows. Nonetheless, sonically, I'm impressed for what I paid.However, these headphones HURT. I'm a skinny guy, 25 years old, normal sized head and ears, and these things make me feel like I'm wearing a vice on my face. If you wear glasses, don't get these at all unless you've been dying to discover new pressure points behind your ears. They squeeze really hard all things considered, and the earcups are deceptively small so you have to actually wrap the cushions around your ears in several steps to actually make them fit on your head.Overall, great sound, really really uncomfortable for someone who has an adult-sized head.

VI got these headphones to replace a pair of $7 Vibe headphones that were starting to have audio problems, which i got to replace a broken pair of Skullcrushers. The sound quality is very good, with all of the genres I listen to, Metal, Classic Rock, Electronica, House, dubstep and SID. All of them sound amazing! the only problem I have with them is that the foam parts of the earcups are too small, and after about 2 hours of skateboarding and listening to music, my ears started hurting. Other than that Great buy(i got mine used for $28 bucks, they were treated pretty badly, but i bet that brand new, they would be worth the $40-$50 you have to pay) the cord never tangles, I never have any problems with the minijack not fitting in my mp3 player or reaching it(i'm very short for my age though)Pros: Great sound quality with most genres of music.Cons:Earcups are too small, plastic feels brittle.Decision: BUY THESE! THEY ARE AMAZING!

VOkay, these headphones are O.K. they have good low end beats and the sound isn't distorted when the volume on the ipod nano is on full. I'll give u a quick pros and cons chart.  Pros:-great low end beats-compact-extremely comfortable if you have a small head-handles high volume  Cons:-cheap plastic-this probably doesn't go for most people, but i have a hearing loss so I cant listen to loud music, so i have the volume low. But when the volume is low, the beat cancels out the other noise such as synth, if you listen to house or dubstep like i do. Sure, if the volumes loud it's still crisp.-uncomfortable around the neck.

VThey do sound good for the price but they are made from cheap plastic. Mine broke just taking them off my head. Mine seem to exhibit the same weakness that others have complained about: The adjusting slides are made of thin, brittle plastic and break very easily. I would not buy again.

VGREAT BUY! The mike however doesn't work with my Nokia Lumia 710, and I do wish that the cable was removable but for the price I paid ($34) I can't complain. The bass is there but it's not over powering the rest of the important parts of the song (Cough cough beats). They aren't that comfy, infact after 20-30 minutes they started to hurt my ears. But remember they are around the ear. Overall I recommend these headphones for regular listeners or anyone on a tight budget. Keep in mind that these retail for $60 elsewhere!

VThe sound quality and clarity is actually pretty good for headphones in this price range. They are a bit bulky, and if you think your going to be wearing them around your neck while they're not in use then you might want to look at some different headphones for in my experience they are simply too bulky for that. The bass also leaves something to be desired but for quality on a budget they're pretty great.

VI put these on my wish list because my old Sony earphones had the fake leather peeling off all the time and leaving little black bits in my hair/ear. I ended up getting these as a present for my birthday.These Skullcandy Hesh headphones sound pretty good but the build quality is poor. Less than a week of having them the fake leather is peeling away from the headphone cup. At least its not leaving bits of stuff on me but it wont be long before the other side starts to do this I imagine. Has it hindered my ability to listen to music? No, not yet, but if the thing starts coming undone within a week or owning then I dont recommend it to others.

VThese are great headphones, The over-the-head strap is comfortable (there's some kind of padding in it). I like how the cable only comes out of one of the sides.The cable itself is covered in some sort of fabric, so it is tough, and also flexible. The cable will never retain its shape, which is good. You should never have to worry about this cord getting tangled. The cable is only 3ft long, so you're a little limited there, but I have never had an issue with the length (except when I try to get up from my desk forgetting that I'm still wearing the headphones).The ear pieces are a good fit. There is sufficient padding around the ears so you shouldn't have to worry about them being painful. They are sufficient large enough to completely go around my ears and make a good seal.Sound. The sound quality is good. They are quite loud, and I have never noticed any issues with the sound. However, the domes on the outside tend to pick up external noise. So for example, wind is easily picked up by these phones. So if I'm wearing these outside on a windy day, the wind will be amplified in my ears by these domes. This is one of my annoyances with this product.The other annoyance is the fabric. I feel like the fabric that covers the ear padding as well as the over-the-head padding seems like it might be the kind of fabric that will deteriorate over time, or that it will crack.Overall: Good headphones, good sound, good fit, not the best for cancelling external noise, fabric doesn't seem reliable.Recommendation: Go for it, I love these!

p8344
sg5
VI am so hyped with my Wade Skull Candies. I rock them with a white wade shirt and goes perfect.The construction is perfect, designed so the cord does the easily get a shortage.The music and sound quality is amazing, not as good as Beats By Dr Dre, If you are buying ear phones for studio quality, Skull Candy is not designed for such.The frabic on the top loop becomes discolored to a white-yellow colour after a few months of use. It does come with a nice clothed bag, but I didn't use it too much.The ear cushion began to acquire slight ware and tear after a year of slow-moderate use.Recommendation: Buy if you a HUGE Wade fan, because there is nothing like it on the market right now.

VGood headphones, some issues
p8360
sg5
VThese headphones are great. I got them last year for christmas, and they're awesome. The sound is amazing, there's little to no leak, and I love the pause/unpause/skip button on the cord. There are a few problems though, and they are enough of an issue that I decided to share my experience. If you wear these for too long, they tend to hurt your ears a little. Also if it's hot, they get sweaty. The worst problem, however, is that they break. I don't know if it's just me, but a week or so ago they started to break. When I had them hooked up to my computer, they would sometimes randomly do short bursts of static, or a loud popping noise would occur. Also, the part of the headphone on the left ear right above the speaker and below the size adjustment thing broke. It just came loose, and now whenever I wear the headphones, the left ear sticks up and won't fit over my ear anymore. This sucks because these headphones have great quality and I love them, except they haven't even lasted a year. This is pretty disappointing because now I actually have to buy some. I've tried my best to preserve these, but alas, duct tape has failed me. All in all, these are amazing headphones. I'm no audio nerd, but I think this sound is great. It's clear and loud and everything is just perfectly blended. If you're thinking about getting these headphones, I recommend that you do, but maybe get them used or for cheap because they will, inevitably, break. So, if you get these, treat them as nicely as possible and prepare yourself for when they break, because they will, and it is rather heart-breaking. These were some great headphones while they lasted. If you get them, maybe you'll get more than 9 months of use out of them.

VSkullcandy Headphones are some of the best headphones you can buy.But on the down side of the subject, they are pretty expensive to.  You know how they say, "this is music to my ears.", these headphones bring that metaphor to life.  They are very high quality, it feels like you're actually at the band whose concert you're listening to. like I said earlier, they are a great pair of headphones, and there just a great product to listen to music with.The first time I listened to a pair of Skullcandy headphones was after school at my friend's house.  He had a pair of them on his bed so i asked him if I could listen to them and he said yes so I picked them up and I pressed play on his IPod.  They sounded great!These are perfect headphones for kids and adults any age.  Someone who would really like them would be someone who enjoys music, also, I wouldn't recommend putting these were a baby could get a hold of them because they are expensive, other than that, they are great headphones.

VOk so i have had my pair for about a year or 2 now and there still going strong, I love them... I dont really like the bass on them but other than that the sound is crisp, clear, and overall just good.they are hard to wear for a long period of time(like 6 hours or so)The only thing that I really saw as a reason to mark off one star was that they broke on me(plastic broke)So one day i was using my headphones and they fell off my head onto the ground and the pastic part that makes the earpiece swivel broke so the right ear just hanged down by the wire. I really got aggrevated and tapped it but nothing sticked. So finally after a week or two went to the store spent 5 dollars on crazy glue glued it completely(used half the bottle) and now they work perfectly!Overall I recommend this to anyone who can not afford the new version.My reasons for recommending1)Good sound quality(not enough bass but not by much)2)blocks a lot of the sound from the outside3)Is comfortable as long as you dont wear it for more than 6 hours5)VERY load... this thing gets very load so when your testing sound quality put your computer volume on 35-40 because it is insane :DHope this review helped you make your purchase! :D

VI rated four stars for some reasons:First lets see the PROs:  +4 starsPros: - Very good sound quality,  - Best sound in R&B; and Pop Music  - very nice design and fit in your ear.  -  the wire cord is made like "shoe lace" so it won't twisted.  -  And most of all the price is very reasonable not like ( "BEATS by DRE" it's very overpriced ).On the other hand, I noticed some CONs: -1 starCons: - made in cheap plastic.  - bass are not too impressive, I preferred "BEATS BY DRE" if you want a super excellent bass.  - wire are not detachable But, as I heard Skull Candy have already released a new heads check it out in Google.So overall,I am satisfied for my purchased. Definitely, I will recommend this product to all who don't want to pay big $$$ for a headphone, and if you want a good sound quality with average bass, this is the right choice.

VBought a pair at a local FYE store, got to the car and they sounded awful! everything was crunchy and distorted. i realized the driver or something was busted. Went  back and traded them, the new ones sounded better. pretty decent sound, good price, and looked really good. i also liked that the headphone jack could be removed from the headphones just like you can with the beats. but these leaked really bad, and didnt have very good sound cancelation. but my goodness they are very uncomfortable. ive had uncomfortable headphones, but after like an hour or 2. with these. i had a headache in 10-15minutes. they squeeze way too tightly. I took them back, i got the skullcrushers, they are SOOO much better. and the sound is way better too. they dont leak much at all unless you crank them and are standing right beside them, and they do a great good job of canceling surrounding sounds. plus they have dual drivers, and a subwoofer! id get skullcrushers. or atleast not the hesh, unless you have a very tiny head!

VGreat Headphones, no problems, great for sound isolation at work
p8467
sg5
VI use these at the office when I need to drown out the rest of the noise and people.  Either fire up Spotify or start into my own collection.On the plus side when you fire these up you discover a whole new side to your music colection that you've never heard(if you've only used the cheap plugs that came with your mp3 player) for not much more than the bottom line pairs.These are not fully up to par with the high end sennheisers, beats, etc.  Some people will take that as a negative, but you're also not paying the price for those head phones either.  I've heard people complain about breakages etc, mine have been rolling in the bottom of my backpack for 7 or 8 months with just the little sack they came in for protection.  I've got a fairly fat head(7 3/4 hat size, and they fit comfortably sound great.They are not specifically advertised as isolating, but you put these on and you won't likely hear your coworkers or any workplace noises.

p8472
sg5
VI bought these headphones from Bestbuy about a year ago. I put in hours of research trying to find the best bang for my buck. I came across these and i really liked the style and power so i grabbed them. About 8 months into owning them i was putting them on and they snapped... Thankfully Bestbuy let me get a new pair because they were still under warranty. All in all i am very pleased with these and will continue to use Skullcandy. Just remember to be careful putting them on. The way they feel on your head is very nice but takes a bit to get used to. Buy this and you won't be disappointed!

VGot them 1 year ago for $35 refurbished, and now they are starting to break. If you can get these for $25-$40, they are OK for the price, but you can get better. Definitely DON'T pay $50+ for them though. If you are paying $50, go for the Sony XB500, they sound a lot better, and are more durable (as well as more comfortable). If you are on a budget, and only want to spend around $25, look up the Monoprice 8323, they will have the same durability, but will sound almost twice as good for $25 then these do and they are selling at $50+.

VSlightly better than the Turtle Beach X11's.
p8482
sg5
VI recently picked these up in the store and so far they are almost just like the Turtle Beach X11's (Minus the stupidly long cord X11's have, and it doesn't have a mic). The cord is about 30" (30 inches), but the Turtle Beach X11's is like 14' (14 feet). The braided cable is a nice touch, it is also on most Razer headsets. The surround sound is awesome, I would say it is exactly like the X11's. The bass and treble is great, plus a good bass makes the shots echo in-game (I love that :P) the surround sound is great for spotting enemies. It is a great headset for the price! (I got it for $60 at the store, the 2nd version is $70) Fairly good noise cancellation, would without-a-doubt recommend to anyone looking for a good gaming and music headset!P.S. Has one audio plug, fits every cell phone, laptop, and MP3 player ;)

VSkullcandy Hesh Headphones
p8493
sg5
VQuite a few months ago, I had bought a set of these. To my satisfaction, they are still as good as new I had brought these to school with me, and I found that the Headphones can take a beating, but don't be expecting you can fling these across the room and they will be fine durability-9/10I had bought the Scout version of these, being an outdoors kind of person, and Hesh fit the bill perfectly, and they turned a few heads as well. in looks-10/10I listen to music as much as possible, mainly rock, or hard rock, or heavy metal. These make the music clear as day. I could here every pluck of a guitar string, every beat the drums threw out, and every voice fluctuating there was. I also tested other styles of music based on what I had figured a lot of people listen to today; First I tried was dubstep, The sound quality is clear and crisp, but the Bass in these aren't as strong as something you would find in Skullcandy's "Skull Crusher" model. If you want as much bass as possible, go for the Skull Crushers. I also tried orchestral music. Every song from the popular music group "Two Steps From Hell" was a new experience. I heard new melodies, and new harmonies. I heard sounds I had never even picked up on with my old set. Another thing, these get LOUD. I mean if you crank up your computer's volume to the max and put the speakers together, they will shake in your have. If you put the volume at the max, and listen to even a relatively calm song, you won't be able to hear very well for a few minutes. All together, I had came to the conclusion that these are well rounded headphones that make great work of many, if not all genres of music. Sound-9/10The microphone on this set, I had found useless, It's plug-in has a triple stacked whatever thing (One of my friends tried to explain it to me) that enables the microphone to connect to the computer using the same plug-in as the headphones themselves. The reason I found this useless was because of the fact that it should mainly be used on a cell phone, which I do not own. But that's just my opinion. The microphone for me gets a 5/10 just because I don't have a need for it, but most might.On of the deciding factors that had me itching to buy this pair of headphones, was the comfort. I would be wearing these for many hours of the day. I am a gamer, so I figured if a get good comfort, then I would get more out of them; being able to wear them longer. I have only slight comfort problems, sometimes I will get a pain right below the back of my ear, from how tight they can be, but once you adjust them to a size that would fit you, you can wear these all day. Comfort- 8/10The next section of my review is the closer, affordability. being $50, they were the most expensive headphones I would have bought to the date. To me, do to all of the factors stated above, I would say these are the choice for you if you are looking for the most efficient way to spend your money on headphones. Although somewhat expensive, they are completely worth it. Affordability- 9/10

VThese headphones quite simply are ok. They're not great nor are they terrible.{SOUND}I listen to a lot of dubstep and with dubstep there is a lot of jump between deep bass and high highs and everything in between. The highs are pretty good as well as the bass, but the mids aren't very good at all high mids are very prominent while the low mids have trouble coming through. Overall the sound is ok.{FEEL}As a person with a very large head and very large ears it is hard for me to get good headphones, though these fit very well. My fit inside of the cups even though they look very small. There is also plenty of room if you have a big head. I usually have to pull headphones all of the way out to fit my head, but I'm about to notches in on each side and they fit great. They have a thin mesh, nylonish head band with surprisingly feels pretty nice. The general construction feels solid with nice soft, rubberized plastic through out.{LOOK}If you're buying skullcandy headphones this probably matters to you and they look pretty good!

p8509

VMy husband and I both bought a pair of these head phones so that we could listen to music while in the school library.  When the head phones are on you can't hear anything from outsiders and outsiders aren't bothered by your music.  We have had our headphones for over 9 months and these have certainly held up to the test of time and the use and abuse that comes with our daily commute.  They are super comfortable, I can wear my head phones for hours at a time (which is really good when I'm writing a mid term).  Recently my husband has started wearing them outside when he is doing yard care, and they are really good at muting out the sound of the machinery.

VHonestly I can be pretty rough on headphones. But these stayed at the office and were only dropped once or twice. the really skinny piece of plastic that allows the band to be lengthened snapped (not that big of a surprise). I got mine for ~$30. I see them listed for over $100 for some reason.??? I wouldn't speed nearly that much on these even if I didn't think they would just break again.Sound quality was decent for over the ear. Ok bass, that didn't buzz or rumble too much. Decent treble. If you want to give some one a nicer (looking) pair of headphones for a gift and not be upset if they break, these would probably work great.

But it can be fixed with settings on your MP3. and they cancel noise for the most part. Glad I bought them.

VThese headphones were, let's just say, adequate. When I first got them I was super excited because they were my first headphones that were over $30 (assuming that more money meant higher quality,) and all of my friends had recommended them to me. When I first put them on, I was sad to say that I was not very impressed. The only difference between the sound of these and some regular $10 ear buds that you could buy in a vending machine was that the bass was brought out a BIT more. Besides that, almost no difference. Even after a 24 hour burn-in period I noticed almost no difference. I must admit, I was a bit disappointed. However, I can admit that the comfort of these were alright, I could wear them for hours with no discomfort. The main problem with these though, is that they break very easily. When I say this, I mean that they break after a period of time. I had these for 5 months with no problem, but then one day I noticed a slight crack, and then it went downhill from there. After that, I counted 7 more breaks in the next 2 weeks (by now, they were pretty much just big duct tape headphones.) My last complaint would be the price. Seriously, $50 for these? I think now they MIGHT be worth $30... maybe. With all of these factors considered, it's safe to say that these were certainly not worth the money that was spent. You can easily find higher quality headphones for $50.

Pros: They keep a significant amount of noise in so that no audio bleeds out, they look nice, and have great sound. Cons: Material is a bit flimsy looking, after about an hour and a half of usage and they began to hurt the outer ear.

VI bought the Black Hesh headphones, and I wore them for 7 months. The sound is wonderful, they are super comfortable and the cord never ever tangles. However, near the end the headphone ear cups came loose and the right one broke off with no rough handling. Since they have a lifetime guarantee on Skullcandy.com, I messaged them with my problem and sent in my headphones at their request.They got back to me within the week and emailed me a full refund coupon, and buying a new pair with it was super easy.All in all, WONDERFUL HEADPHONES for the first half year or so, then they will most likely break. However, the lifetime guarantee makes it super easy to exchange them for new ones

VI bought these for occasional use on the test bench as I repair audio equipment for a living. I wanted a pair of affordable headphones that offered full range sound and a comfortable fit at a reasonable price. I didn't need a headphone that is extra durable for daily use that need to take a beating.The Skullcandy Hesh fit the bill perfectly. At an affordable price, the frequency range is nicely balance between the bass and treble - with a bit of a dip in the midrange as I expected. They are comfortable and block outside noise very, very well. The soft storage pouch is a really nice plus too.A couple extra thoughts to pass along. These are not audiophile grade headphones, they lack detail and refinement found in higher-end headphones... however if you are going to listen to MP3 audio, they are just fine. Also they did not sound good at all when I first listened to them! These do need "break-in" to sound good. I connected them to a home receiver, cranked the bass, and let them play for an hour - made a big difference.Lastly, for home listening you will need an adapter for 1/4" jacks (should be included IMHO) and watch for clearance sales on outgoing colors and styles. They are not worth their full price - there are much better headphones available for just a little more (the Sony MDR-V6 comes to mind). But when the price is discounted, these are a good deal.

They're really much nicer then I thought they would be and have a good heft to them which gives me the impression of strong materials.  These are good headphones hands down.

Sure you can tape them up, but then you can't adjust them.Again, I love the sounds, and of course the look, but for the price, even with warranty they are hardly worth the trouble.

VLOVED MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT
p8635

Vthe Dwayne Wade headphones were given to me for my birthday because Wade was and is my fav player. the sound quality was amazing and the bass was great because it was loud but did not muffle the sound or cause static. the headphones took a while to get used to as they have to be fitted into. after you get used to it though it is not much of a problem. these headphones are not something you want to wear while you sleep as your ears will be throbbing a little. other than that the headphones are excellent for any genre of music. if at 75%-100% then sound outside your phones are for the most part expelled out. many other people who wrote reviews say the headphones are made of cheap plastic and break easily but that is not completely true. as long as your not yanking it off your head than the headphones will last quite a while. the designs are also amazing and there are a wide range of choices you could pick for the headphones. i would strongly recommend these headphones for music lovers.P.S.: The cord does not get tangled.

VI didn't actually buy these off of amazon, but I looked at the reviews to see what other people thought of them. These headphones are made very well. They work great, and they seem very durable. The cord is made of some type of nylon fabric, not plastic, so it is very unlikely that it wiil get tangled. the sound is great and the headphones fit very comfortably on your head and around your neck when not in use. Lastly, they look great. I think people buy skullcandys partly because of their look, and these look great. overall a great buy.

VI got the Paul Frank Hesh headphones as a gift to myself, thought they would look cool and I was right, the looks are awesome, also the sound is great but I got them four months ago, and they're already dammaged, you see the plastic used adjust the size to your head is a very cheap one, and breaks only by using them (even carefully). So if you're like me and cannot use these without adjusting the size, it will be an awful waste of money. Please reconsider buying quality semi-pro headphones such as Sony and others alike, don't get fooled by looks like I did

VI have had these headphones for about 6 months, around 2 of which they were not in use. I'll break down their features by section. I paid around 30 dollars for them.Sound: 2/5Honestly, these headphones are nothing special in sound. Upon receiving them, I was immediately disappointed by their quality. The bass is rather weak, the trebles are muddled, and the highs are unfocused. Depending on the price you pay, this may be acceptable, but if you're looking for sound alone, a 15 dollar pair of headphones could beat these. Although they are around-ear, the headphones are not very effective at passive noise cancelling, and leak a great deal of sound.Comfort: 2/5I found that after wearing these headphones for more than an hour, my ears started to hurt. Part of this is due to the fact that the drivers are round, whereas ears are not. What results is that the upper part of my ear gets clamped more than the rest of my ear, and this causes a lot of pain when wearing them. Additionally, the band is not very flexible, which creates quite a bit of pressure on your skull. However, for people with smaller heads and ears, this may not be a problem. The leather on the ear-pads is not bad.Design: 4/5These headphones look quite good when you're wearing them, but it should be noted that you intend to carry headphones on your neck, it will be impossible with these. They clamp around your neck completely, making it difficult to breathe. So if you are not wearing them on your head, you must stow them somewhere else.Durability: 1/5I put these in a backpack on a flight, and the adjuster on the side cracked. The problem is that these headphones are entirely made of plastic. Had the adjuster been aluminum or some type of metal, this would not have happened. Admittedly, this was my own fault, but this was ENTIRELY avoidable. Aluminum is cheap, and even that is found nowhere in this set. The mesh inside the drivers is also easily ripped, although I haven't experienced this. The fabric appears quite low quality.Portability: 3/5The headphones come with a nice bag, and the non-tangle cord is a nice feature (and should be standard on all headphones when possible). On the other hand, the headphones don't fold up, so there is no way to reduce their size.Bottom line: If you can get these headphones for around 20 dollars, it's not a bad deal. However, these are by no means a spectacular set. There are better options out there for the money that you would spend on these.

My brother got dr dre beats studio and the only big difference i could see in the quality was the bass. it was better on the beats.Pros: very good sound quality for the price, very good bass, look awesome, and they come with a soft carrying pouch which is nice so they dont get scratched up.Cons: they're al little tight on your ear so you cant where them for a really long time.

VGood for an mp3 player
p8750
sg5
VI bought a pair of these and they fill the need I wanted them for: inexpensive, full ear cup headphones to use with an mp3 player. Which is obviously what they were designed for. The cord is too short for anything not within arm's reach, and do not come with a 1/4" adapter. Plugged into a stereo, or recording equipment, or an electronic musical instrument, they don't sound all that good. Very colored sound. Way too much bass, for my taste. But for an mp3 player, they fit the bill. With a little tweek of my Sansa's EQ, they sound pretty decent, and the snug fitting ear cups really block out external noise well. The large drivers make these loud, so I can turn the volume down some and get better battery life out of my mp3 player.

VSuggest AVOID SkullCandy Over The Ear headphones
p8762
sg5
VI would strongly suggest avoiding these SkullCandy over-the-ear headphones.First, they sound terrible.  Listening to a favorite piece of music, suddenly I'd open my eyes and say "Where is it?"  There would be pieces of music simply missing.  They sound muddy and bass-heavy, and just plain awful.. especially when you have to wonder what pieces of the music you aren't hearing at all.To top the experience off, they broke!  (No great loss!!)  Flimsy construction of earpiece holders.  One just snapped (and it was under no significant pressure.)SkullCandy in general is now on my Do Not Buy list, as I consider them a rip-off.  I replaced these crummy $58 (approx) set with a $20 (approx) pair of SennheisersSennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)and all my music is back.  They're *much* cleaner, more accurate, more comfortable, and from past experience with Sennheiser they will be rugged and long-lasting.I can't imagine quite whom the target audience is.  Perhaps those who have never heard even a reasonable set of headphones?Hope this review helps someone else avoid a similar disappointment!

VThese headphones are amazing.  My son cannot hear a word I'm saying (which is great for him bad for me) and the sound is crystal clear.  Another good thing I noticed is the cord is wrapped with this fabric material instead of the usual rubber or plastic that ends up bending and tearing. My son uses it on an old 3G iphone with no problem.  My husband had trouble getting a good plug in and working properly with his iphone 4 w/ otterbox.  I haven't tested it myself to see if it's the cable plug in what but the quality of the sound is wonderful.  The price is low enough compared to others like this.  I highly recommend!

VI loved these headphones... Until they broke and it only lasted me 2 and a half weeks! My friend had a very similar pair and they broke the same way. The earpiece with the wire snapped off. I was sitting in class and a kid knocked them on the floor and backed his chair into them. My friend stepped on on his. What i'm getting to is the fact that it wasn't designed well at that part. There is a crease at that point and now that I look at the other side I can see that is a seperate piece. There were only two narrow, hallow tubes holding it on (and the wire).Its a shame because it looks great and the sound is even better. I don't know about you guys, but I don't buy items like this for short periods of time. I wanted this headset to last 2+ years but that won't be the case with this.

p8826
sg5
VI had bought these with the intention of having great sound and pretty good bass (albeit they aren't to the point where they meet how much Beats can withstand bass, but if you're not a major bass head it's ok). When I first got them they were extremely adjustable, but no matter how much you try to keep these adjusting sides with care, they will ALWAYS break. I guess it's because of some cheap design flaw, but I overcame it because i was able to use these headphones one the very last notch, subsequently meaning i had to duct tape both sides of the headphones (the left side broke first then the right side). Ironically, this headphones performance has not diminished because of this. I say that because the wires run though the inside of the headphone extenders and the headband itself connecting both earpieces. You can even use these with your gaming system and hear crystal clear audio, even the own footsteps you and anyone else make. Overall I have to say these are some really nice headphones, design and all. Oh and the little bag it comes with for these things is so nice too.

p8832
sg5
VThis pair of headphones was $50 originally, but through discounts and promotional offers, I got them for $12.  I'd say they're definitely worth $12, but far from being $50 quality.  The sound is pretty good for the price, but that's pretty much the end of the pros.Cons: Ear cups will likely crimp the edges of your ears which can be irritating after 20 minutes and very painful after an hour; cord is very short; the headband is connected to the cups in a way that makes the headphones sit extra-wide on your head, looking a bit goofy; no volume control within the headphones themselves, you have to rely on the source; virtually no noise-canceling--certain external sounds actually seem louder when the headphones are on, albeit distorted; small amount of sound leak.Once again, everything above being said, they're worth $12, DEFINITELY not worth more than $25.  Skullcandy's $10 earbuds are a much better value and very similar sound quality.

VI bought these looking for a medium grade set of headphones for until i could afford a high quality set. They live up to the skullcandy name of being sound quality when compared with the price. These did not blow me away. They are simply an adequate set of headphones.In terms of comfort, I can wear them for an hour or two before getting uncomfortable. The foam does not squeeze but they are firm. It has the feel of a lower grade headphone in this area but no actual complaints.One issue Skullcandy is known for is how you have to go through their headphones like, well, candy. But they have started a life-time warranty that made me comfortable enough to buy a somewhat more expensive pair anyways. The cord is wrapped in a cloth to add strength, and they feel sturdier than i was expecting. I have had them for about five months and they have lasted, which is a pleasure.Sound is kind of an issue. The bass is impressive for a pair of their size. They have a clear treble. However, one thing I noticed is that it seems like the sound is obviously coming from the left and right (I know this sounds obvious but bear with me). Most headphones will have the effect or feel of the sound being centered in your head, but these seem like the sound is coming far from you in either direction, possibly from behind. This effect is strong enough where it irritates me but it could just be the way they fit on my head, or it could just be my imagination. I don't know.Overall they are what Skullcandy usually is: Better quality than their price indicates. The $40 I paid for them was a good price. I wouldn't pay more for them, and anything less would have been a very good bargain. A very adequate set of headphones.

VAfter dealing with earbuds for years I made the decision that I needed a pair of actual headphones.  I toyed with the idea of shelling out big bucks for BOSE headphones or even Beats by Dre.  Thankfully my lack of funds forced me to explore less expensive options.  I paid around $30 for these headphones and could not be happier with my purchase.  The sound quality is great and I am thrilled to have bass back in my life.  Some of the reviews mention that these headphones might not last as long as others, I just bought them a few weeks ago so I can't comment on their long term durability but they seem to be constucted just fine.  Also people mentioned them not fitting over big heads.  I have a large head and the headphones fit perfect.  The ear pieces are mad comfortable and work as ear muffs to (it's winter in Boston)!You will not regret buying these headphones!

VTerrible, much better ones out there for price
p8897
sg5
VDon't buy these unless you can get them for $5. I wouldn't spend more than that on them. I bought these and returned them within 10 minutes for better headphones. They sound distant and lacking, like the sound is coming from another room instead of from headphones. They also do terribly on trebble and are mainly midrange with some bass. They aren'y particularly loud headphones ether, nor are they good enough quality to be worth $50. You can get some great pairs of headphones in the %50-60 range (Sony MDR-XB500 being my personal favorite) and these are not one of those. I am an audio professional and have used several pairs of headphones for various uses. I was planning on getting a pair of these for use while walking for listening to music because I figured they would be loud, but the terribly balanced sound coupled with low power handling make these not only sound bad when they're at low volume levels, but become even more distorted at higher ones. They have worse sound quality than the $3 colby headphones you can get. These I used to wonder why people thought Monster Cable made the best headphones but comparing them to these beats sound phenominal, but Beats also only have the overall quality of about $50-75 worth. Bottom line is I would not suggest these headphones, nor any headphones made by Skullcandy. I also suggest against Monster Cable's audio gear. Go out and get yourself some SOny MDR-XB500's, or save up for the XB1000s or some Sennheisers or Sure or any of the other actual audio companies. Don't get these. Ignore the people saying they're great because they haven't used any other headphones in that price range. Also steer clear of Bose as they are just as terribly overpriced.

p8908

VThis product is just AWESOME, the price is great, the brand is great, the sound quality is just really great, the bass it has inside hits harder than my Macbook Pro and other famous Headphones brands i have seen... I compared it with a Senheiser that costs over 150 dollars and i can say that they are pretty much the same in sound experience. The cushion is really good, its size is ajdustable, even the cord quality is way superior than others..!!With this headphone i can listen to really noisy/loud music without feeling pain and without hurting my ear.I recomend you buy this product..!!

p8926

VI managed to get these headphones on sale for $40 and am pretty satisfied with them so far.  The sound quality is great for the price I got it for and further tweaking with an equalizer can further enhance these headphones.  Outside noise is reduced quite a bit and is almost eliminated completely when listening to music at a reasonable volume.  My only complaint is that these headphones aren't quite the most comfortable and the cord for them is a bit short at about 3-4 feet.  They press down on your head a good amount and the pleather headphone coverings get kind of hot after a while.  Overall I think they're a good kind of middle ground headphones.  Comfort may be a bit lacking but their quality is quite a bit above other cheap headphones that I've tried.

Vokay so i'm going to break this review into parts to make it easier to figure out what im talking about. I am rating them in comfort, style, and sound. each rating i give is one out of 5 starsComfort:****I gave this four stars because despite other peoples comments on this i thought they were coftrable. They fit over my ears perfectly and the headband is the perfect size for my head. I gave this four stars though because i've read from other reviews that the earpieces are too small to fit over most peoples ears, and i do have rather small ears so they might not fit over most peoples ears.Style:**so i gave these headphones two stars for style because they are huge and they will make you look rather dorky. They are also a lot bigger then i expected, but style doesnt matter much to me since i only listen to music with my headphones at home.I would have gave style one star if it wasnt for the cord the cord doesnt tangle and is really cool.Sound:****the sound overall i would give a four because after listening to music with them for awhile i have found they make my ears tired like i dont want to listen to things it might just be my pair though.The sound overall is very nice and smooth. I have found after listening to songs i like i have found new parts i hadnt heard before while using other headphons keep in mind though that i usually use a cheap pair of $15 headphones. Another thing to consider though is that they leak sound. They are also very loud for a pair of heaphones they are about as loud as my old headphones at were when i turn the volume to medium but if you really like loud and turn it up to full volume it has a bit of base which is an interesting thing ive never found while listening to other over the ear headphones.Are they worth the price?:Despite the few problems I found with these headphones I think they are well worth the price. I truly belive that you wont find a better sounding pair of headphones for this price. And if mine do happen to break i will definetly be using my warrenty and getting annother pair. Point of mentioning skullcandy has a lifetime warrenty on these headphones so if its a problem with manufacturing they will give you a full refund and if you break it they give you 50% back on them.so In conclution I think these are worth the price and you should definetly buy them.update:1-2-13 ive had these headphones for quite awhile now and they are still working which is amazing :) none of my headphones have ever lasted this long.

VI had two pairs of skullcandy hesh headphones and I'm unsatisfied with them. They look cool when you wear it but for me that was about it. The sound was okay  it wasn't good but it wasn't bad. The thing i dislike about this headphone is they hurt your ears after 10 minutes. Not only that they brake really easily. Both my headphones broke after two months of usage. But, the good thing about this headphone is that it is not expensive for a headphone.

If you like huge bass that will rattle ur brain go with the skullchrushers but, if you want good overall sound quality then get these! The padding on the side are very comfortable and wont hurt ur ears. Also they are adjustable so they can fit a large head or a small head. The cord has a cord type of thing on it to make it tougher. The plug it gold plated witch makes the music sound better and more fresher.

VThey look great, and are really flashy.  Thats about it.I've bought some cheapo Sony headphones for a little less than these that sounded much better.  I also have a pair of akg studio headphones I bought for the same price that sound much better than these.Ironically, I have a pair of skull candy in ears that I bought for $20 that sound much better than these.  That is, in part, why I went for these.  I can't believe all of the possitive reviews.  I'm very disappointed.The sounds were distorting and the bass was weak, even when I messed with EQ levels and moderate volume levels.

VI received my black and blue pair of SkullCandy Mesh headphones a couple weeks ago and I have to say I love these headphones! I'm a college student who is almost always on his laptop (I use it for music, my tv shows, soccer matches, and sometimes hw) and these headphones seem to excel with whatever I am doing. I was worried that the large amount of bass these headphone promise would take away from the clarity of them, but that is absolutely not the case. These headphones are comfortable also, I only seem to have discomfort with them when I wear them for a couple hours consecutively and am also wearing my glasses, but a simple readjustment should fix that. The thing that stands out to me most is how alive the crowd sounds when I'm watching a soccer match, it's amazing. My roommate often watches hockey on his laptop, and he often borrows my headphones to do so when I'm not using them because it makes the sounds of the ice really come alive! This is an overall great pair of headphones, and I would definitely recommend purchasing them, because like I said before, they aren't just good for music, they're good for any kind of listening.

VI really enjoy these headphones. I received them today so I will be sort of loving and bias towards them. My shipping was super fast, they shipped out on Monday and I received them today(Tuesday). They sound good and are somewhat noise cancelling, not completely, but that's OK. I haven't "burned" them in yet so I do not have a good view on the bass, even though I should point out I do want a little bump in my music since I do listen to rap/hip hop mostly, but I don't want it to be too over powered and rattle my ears. You don't need to worry about having them at full volume I only have mine at 40% and they are LOUD. They are not bulky on the head like other headphones and I love that. They were $20 cheaper then on skullcandy's website. They look great, even better in person. Only problem is you can tell from the get go how they are made with plastic. For the price though I'm not complaining I knew what I was getting. They fit comfortably on the head and I enjoy wearing them. Overall I get them a 8/10. Only thing holding back is the plastic and because I haven't gotten to experience them burned in with full sound quality and only having them 1 day. I would recommend these things in a heart beat for people wanting a stylish good pair of cheap headphones. Hopefully skullcandy expands into other sports like football and I would gladly buy another pair of Steelers!!

VSkullcandy is awesome
p9086
sg5
VSkullcandy's are awesome headphones, They're not THAT delicate, I'm very rough with my headphones because I only buy headphones that can take a beating! I bought a Celtic's pair in 2009 and it lasted me a year (My ex boyfriends pit puppy chewed them apart) after the quality of the sound and bass and for under $100 I decided to buy another pair of Skullcandy Hesh headphones, I bought the shattered Rasta ones, I was worried about them not lasting too long because the cord was plastic instead of braided (Like the Celtics ones) but they lasted until January 2012, and the pull down part broke, they still work (nothing a little duct tape can't fix) But I'm not wearing duct tapped headphones out in public, I ordered another another pair and again, AWESOME headphones, You cannot find another pair of headphones with great quality sound and bass for the price of skullcandy (between $50-$125) and with HEAVY abuse they last about a year, NOT bad (Before skullcandy I was buying $20-$50 headphones that'd last me a month or two, then I'd have to replace them)

VGreat price and good sound for headphones at this price.  Shipping time for the product was very good.  The product was shipped the day after it was ordered.  Works great with the i-pod my son has.  Recommend these headphones highly.  You can't go wrong for the price and sound.

VDon't Believe Everything Bad People Say About These...
p9125
sg5
VAt first I was a little skeptical about buying them, but it seemed the good reviews outweighed the bad. Plus they have a lifetime warranty:) I am a reckless teenager, and i break things easy. I have had these headphones for almost three weeks, and they seem pretty durable to me. nothing has broken, snapped, tangled, or fallen off yet. These headphones may not be good for the serious audiophile, or a DJ, but for a teenager or young adult with a young budget you can't beat the price. period. I love them. Let's start this off with looks. we all know skullcandy is top ranked with style and fads, so the fact they look awesome is obvious. I love Bob Marley and Rastafari, so these are perfect for me. PLUS they have a super strong cord. It's made of nylon or some kinda fabric, and it's only on one earcup. the cord hardly ever tangles. perfect design on the cord for my uses (listening to music at school to drown out the teacher). Now comfort... they can be a little annoying, but if you adjust them just right, they feel fine. at first i thought the earcups hurt pretty bad, but after a couple days the leather really loosened up. they may not be very practical for some things. try hiding these under a beanie or hood so you don't have to listen to what your teacher's saying. NOt a big problem for me, i just carry some ear buds along. But for traveling these are pretty good also, and they come with a cool little travel bag, a stencil, and a bad-A sticker i put on my phone. These headphones are great overall, and the only downside for me is the noise leakage. if your'e listening to your music at halfway volume level, the people around you can hear it also. My mom doesn't like Dr. Dre at all, so when i use these around her or in a quieter place i have to turn it down pretty low. at lunch when the halls are filled with screaming girls and obnoxious guys they can't hear it at all, so you can listen as loud as you want. I like listening to these around my neck because they're like carrying speakers around. really good sound with an equalizer. if you can customize the sound that comes out of these cans, DO IT! I listen to a lot of rap/hip hop reggae, and rock, so if i can put the equalizer just right they sound really great. Oh, and even when the volume on them's pretty low, you can only hear your music. noise cancelling to you, but not to people around you. overall, i give them a 4.5/5 for my purposes, and considering the good, the bad, and the ugly.. I LOVE MY SKULLCANDY HESH's.

VRedefined My Listening Experience.
p9137
sg5
VWhen I used to listen to music it was like a surface level sort of thing, I got the music in and that was that. I'd been using Skullcandy headphones for as long as I can remember and had never even considered over the ear until recently. When I first got my buds I thought I had never heard music the right way before, it was just so much more immersive as Skullcandy tends to be. When I bought this product it happened again, I rediscovered sounds in my favorite songs that I didn't know were there, minor nuances that just made the sound a much more enjoyable experience. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and any and all consumers as well. Great quality as always from Skullcandy.

VI'm pretty picky with audio equipment and I would not have purchased these if I had not owned a pair of Skullcandy before. I purchased my first pair of Skullcandy on clearance, because I needed a basic pair for work (quality didn't matter). After using the 2XLs ( the other set) I was immediately impressed with the quality. The lows weren't over enhanced and the highs were very clear.After I purchased this pair I wasn't expecting to be disappointed and I was right. The quality of audio from these headphones is very high, especially for the price. The lows aren't over emphasized and the highs are crisp. The mids seem to be just lower in volume which is perfect for my taste.I've seen some complaints on this product and I can't imagine them being caused from the headphones themselves. I'd suggest getting a pair and trying them yourself. A few reviewers suggest that the device determines the audio quality and that's not particularly true. The quality of the music depends on the file you place on the device. Most devices that were made any time recently are built with the hardware to handle higher quality audio. If your music is 128Kbps then you can't really judge anything. I'd suggest 256Kbps at minimum and 320+Kbps preferred.The noise cancellation is remarkable. My wife was listening at maximum volume next to me on the couch in a silent room and I couldn't hear anything at all. She never knows if I have the music on or not when I'm wearing them.The mesh wrapping on the wire protects it immensely. The plastic sheathing on typical wires get pulled and tugged very often and the mesh is very strong which prevents damage on the wire.The 3.5mm jack is very small so it's not bulky. It seems sturdy even though it's very small.The wire comes from one side of the headphones keeping the wire from being across your face.Buy these headphones, you won't regret it unless by some chance you get a DOA.

Its probably not as bad as I made it sound, but a factor that should be considered when buying the product.

p9161

VI will get right to the point, I only have a few things to say about these headphones after I have used them for about 5 hours watching movies, tv shows, listening to music and playing video games on my computer.PRO: soft ear pads, very nice crisp sound undistorted by excessive base, the look is good and they do wonders to keep sound out.CON: there to tight around my head, they compress the cartilage in the back of my ear and it hurts after about 1 to 2 hours or so, but I knew about that before I bought them from other reviews. If it worn't for that one thing; I'd give it 5 of 5 stars.

p9167

VIll flat out say buying this product was a mistake, its only use for me now is backup in case my main headphones die and i need to wait a bit to replace them..  I give it one star Maybe the version i got was messed up or its just me but i noticed that the sound quality for me was sub-par. sounded like playing through cheap speakers my logitech wireless headset had better sound then this did......not only that but i found it had a very small but stil present annoying feedback noise when plugged in that my other headphones did not have . to my computer.Cant believe i wasted 30 bucks (plus 4 bucks overnight shipping) for this product. Too much of a hassle for a return because then youll have to get the box sent to you , repackage it.  get it to be shipped blah blah blah. and thats one of the reasons i shop on amazon.. no hassle. to be fair its not amazons fault. either the headphones i got were defective or its just not the best product and half of the people reviewing it need their hearing checked OR it could just be that it works fine on cd players and the like, but has bad sound when used with a computerwho knows.either way i dont care Im not wasting my money on another skullcandy product again.  Besides honestly the headphones were a bit bulky for my taste anyways should have just got the replacement sony headphones that broke.  didnt have overnight shipping but i could have waited.ugh.  thanks a lot Skull-candy expecally considering i had a pretty bad day today so this didnt help at all.whatever.

VI will start off by saying these headphones arent bad, just not the greatest. Right out of the box you will notice they are rather "creaky" and feel a little cheap, however I am not too worried as they dont really feel delicate, just plasticy. Mine has a cloth cord, which I like a lot, it feels tough and its unique. The packaging was a huge pain to get into, they seal it everywhere possible, so you really have to hack it up to get the headphones out. Upon first putting them on, they feel a bit tight and almost stretched out to fit over my head. They do make your ears very warm (to the point of sweat) and for me they get uncomfortable to wear after only about 20 minutes due to them being very snug. Because of this I wouldnt recommend these for gaming sessions or media editing.Getting to the sound; at first they sound "in your face", deep bass and loud. I have read that headphones need a "burn in" period, which is basically a break in period, and that headphones will sound better after several hours of playtime. I began to notice improvement in overall sound after about 3 hours of use, vocals sounded cleaner and everything was more balanced. Going into specific genres now, we'll start with metal and rock. The vocals sound a little overpowered here and dont really stand out against the music. Also metal can become rather fatiguing to listen to as these headphones make it very boomy/thumpy. For metal and rock, I would rate them a disappointed 2/5. Next some bass heavy dub, which sounds good on these, any vocals come through nicely I dont really have any complaints there as I think these headphones were meant for bass heavy tunes, so a 4/5 on that. Now trance/dance music featuring crisp vocals; the vocals could be better and the again the beat of the music tends to compete with the vocals which are supposed to be the focus, but they do sound pretty good here, I give them a 3/5 almost a 4 but not quite.Bottom line: based on the price (not comparing these to top of the line headphones), sound quality is an overall 4/5, but the comfort and build quality/fit are at a 2/5 so I give these headphones a 3/5 total rating. In my opinion they look very goofy while worn, they do have some cool designs though. The way they are marketed makes them come across as more of a toy or fashion statement than anything else. Understand that these are marketed for teens mainly, so thats why they arent the best for adults, like myself, in terms of fit. For the price of them they are not bad, but I would suggest going with something else as there are so many other brands of headphones for around 50 bucks.

I am so impressed with their built in mic- the sound quality is amazing (both for myself and the caller on the other end) and they are so comfortable!  The construction is great, the only draw back is the white around the pillowy ear piece-- being a woman, they will probably have makeup residue left over, but I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.  This price is phenomenal and the quality is so well worth it.  I have used many other types of headphones/sound equipment.  I was a little hesitant after reading reviews, but I will be gushing about these headphones to anyone who will listen!  MUST HAVE!

VA great headset but I do feel that for the price of $50 there are way better things out there.Sound quality is worth the $50 and I'm sure you'll be satisfied with that. For me however, the sound is all it's worth. The headset itself feels flimsy and is made of cheap plastic. The parts where it extends tend to break and because of that you need to be very careful about where you put them down and how you wear them. If you have a rather large head like I do, this may not be a good idea.All in all an ok headset. But one you need to be super careful with.

p9327

VI got these headphones for myself as a Christmas gift.  I've been wanting some "real" headphones because I just got tired of how pathetic earbuds are.First the GOOD:  The sound is good, pretty much what I was expecting from earphones of that size/price.THE BAD:  Despite its padding, and despite breaking them in, these headphones squeeze in AROUND the ears too much (not the actual ears).  I can actually feel the pulse of my heart beat push through the pressure the earphones are creating.  It's very uncomfortable after just 5 minutes or so, which is unacceptable because, I mean, who the hell only wants to listen to 5 minutes of music.  I put a large bottle in between the speakers so as I'm not using them, it will slowly break in the phones so they aren't so stiff.  Even though they are significantly looser now, they still restrict the blood flow around my ears.  I shouldn't be able to feel my heartbeat through my freaking ears/head when I'm trying to listen to music.IN THE END:  Good sound, but too uncomfortable to wear long enough to enjoy anything.  For $50, that's kinda BS.  Unfortunately for me, I can't find the receipt.  If you buy this, SAVE THE RECEIPT.  I wanted to give 1.5, but I guess 2 stars from this reviewer.

VI love them. Being a DJ I know what songs should sound like and this did the job better than I had expected. They are a quality product with a relatively small price. I own some on ear Bose headphones but they might be replaced. I'll recommend these to anyone. Only reason their getting a 4 is that they tend to be quiet with certain devices, like my phone.

p9338

VThese headphones are great!  They are probably the best headphones for $32.  The bass is great and the sound is definitely comparable to beats by dre.  Just make sure to take care of them or they will snap.  There is one flaw though.  The only problem is that if you are listening to these headphones for about 1 1/2 hours-2 hours then your ears will get sore.  Other than that, best headphones I've listened to for the price:)

p9344

VI love SkullCandy headphones, but was a little disappointed at how stiff the ear covers are on these headphones. It makes wearing them for long periods of time a little uncomfortable, and sometimes painful so that I can't wear them anymore and have to take a break. I am going to see if I can replace the ear covers with a softer more cushioned cover, but if not then I will be purchasing new headphones somewhere down the line.Also when I bought these they were around $50, what a waste of money now that they're cheaper!!Other than that they have great sound, I love that the cord is covered in a cloth lining - it makes it more durable!

VI don't know why so many people hate these things. They are good cans with comfortable, soft leather ear covers. My only complaint is that THESE THINGS LEAK. I'm not worried about my cans leaking, but if you need private headphones, these aren't for you. But if you're like me, these are good headphones, with nice clean bass especialy for hip-hop/rap. I ordered them late wednesday night and they were here friday morning. Great buy, I deffinately recomend them.

VI purchased a pair of these Skullcandy Hesh headphones a couple of years ago, so the price was much higher back then. The current price for these headphones is pretty decent for what you're getting sound-wise.Quality-wise, these are poorly built. There is absolutely no padding whatsoever on the speakers. My ears hurt very bad after an hour or two of use. I had to resort to putting a thin piece of cloth on the speakers so my ears wouldn't feel any pain. The fit is also very tight as it felt like my head was being squished.Now onto the durability, which isn't all that great either. Since these headphones have such a tight fit, they also have a tendency to easily crack around the band. Thecord also started having issues (a common theme with most Skullcandy products) and stopped working, so I had to do without the volume-control.Now, finally onto the sound. The sound is actually fairly decent. Very crisp highs, and decent lows. The bass blends in well and doesn't distort.Overall, I wouldn't recommend these headphones to anyone due to the comfort issues alone. It's a real shame, because the sound quality on these headphones isn't bad at all. But, it's simply not worth the damage that will be done to your ear.

VWhen I was going to to buy this headphones I saw a lots of negative comments from youtube and other places but I still bought them and the funny thing is that they are 10 times better then the panasonic rp htx7 headphones that my brother has and does headphones only have good reviews on youtube. The skullcandy have better sounding,it louder, and the material that the skullcandy is made of is more finer then the rp htx7. So don't let other sites confuse you about buying this product. It is so great I bought another another skulcandy.

VAfter looking at noise cancelling headphones @ $150-$200 a pair, my son settled on these for abou $40 on Amazon.  We tried the Dre, and to me, they are a piece of junk.  So, for $150, you are getting a noise cancelling piece of junk that is a status symbol due to the name.  I read reviews on the Dre, and everyone complained about the breakage, and they were right.  I went to Best Buy, and the floor model was broken.If you want good quality and nice sound, these SKULL CANDY headphones are for you.  I used to DJ about 20 years ago, and I fell in love with my Sony headphones and I have them to this day.  They weren't noise reduction, but they worked just fine.  Same with these.  I can hear the highs and lows very nicely and they handle the digital sound perfect.  Why spend all that money on a name, just buy these.Specs:-These fit nicely OVER his ears.-Cord is a nylon covered material that doesn't kink or knot.  It's a great feature.-Color is cool.-My 11 year old son loves them.If you decide that you want noise cancelling headphones, forget the Dre or any of the midline stuff, and buy BOSE quiet comfort headphones.  They are worth the money.  If you want a good entry level headphone, these are very good and won't break the bank at $40.

VI just recieved my Hesh Skullcandy Headphones yesterday and I already love them.  They came with a carrying sack and they are very good for noise cancellation.  While it doesn't cancel all outside noise, it is sufficient.  The only bad thing I can say about these headphones is that they aren't quite as loud as I would like, the maximum volume isn't very loud.  The bass also leaves something to be desired, but it is pretty good for the price of these headphones.  I would definitely recommend these to someone else.  Now to see if they're like all other skullcandy headphones and don't stand up to time.

He has expressed many times how much he likes this product.

VMy Mom bought these headphones for me for christmas and at first they weren't the ones i wanted at first i wanted the skullcandy skullcrushers, moslty for the bass.  When I got them I didn't know what to think of them because i hadn't look up on them very.  I had actually wanted a pair of good headphones moslty to listen to music and to help out when creating music for mixing I do like bass I'm very into my bass music and I know there are people that say that the sound sucks and that the bass is cheep and that your better off buying a cheep pair of earphones which is stupid because they have amazing bass they aren't over done most headphones can get into bass.  I thought the sound of these headphones were awesome to me the cancel out just enough sound so I can focus on what Im working on.  They are built really good they have very comfortable and i have big ears, and the cups fit really good on my ears I can listen to them for hours on in and my ears won't hurt.  also the built on the top of the headphones has amazing padding.  I also have read that they look extremely cheep, but to me they look really cool, and they also come a nice little bag that is very nice.All in all great pair of heaphones for a person who is in high school and doesn't want to spend a whole lot on headphones because I am know to break stuff very easily so far they are very durable.Beast headphones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VI bought two of the skullcandy headsets for my sons for Christmas in late October.  Christmas morning when these gifts were opened one of the headsets only worked in one ear.  Being the the order was made early I guess that Amazon will not replace it, only give a partial refund.  I will begin buying elsewhere in my Christmas shopping plans, where gifts are not opened and tried out immediately.  I guess it does pay to shop local is cases like this for Christmas gifts.  Navigating the Amazon returns process is an endless loop once purchases are two months old: a very aggravating process in trying to contact this retailer.

There is a little sound leakage at higher volume levels. Ear pieces fit comfortably when they are fitted right, i wear them all day long at work. the cord is wrapped in something that keeps it from getting tangled at all, and it is just long enough to go from my face to my pocket. All in all there is nothing i can complain about in a pair of headphones i paid $30 for.

VI bought these headphones for snowboarding and lounging around the house. I had read that there was issues with them breaking but I figured these people were just being careless. I was wrong. The joint where the extension piece operates is just fragile and cracks after usage. I had these headphones 6 months and in that time glued the piece back together 3 times. Sound is great but considering they are made and sold to be durable, they are far from that.

V### Updated 2 December 2013 ###There are absolutely better headphones available to enjoy music on, that should be obvious.  But someone with a budget, who can't spend more that a few bucks, isn't going to consider a $300 pair of cans when shopping around.  I'm going to be as objective as I can be and only review the Hesh based on its price range.  (even though reviews like these are very subjective)MY EXPERIENCE:  I've listened to music avidly since I was old enough to walk.  Oldies, soul, RnB, classic rock, funk, alternative, metal, hip-hop, punk, even classical on formats such as vinyl, cassette tape, CD, MP3 and telepathy based music (word).  I'm only 29, but I think I have a fair opinion on how each genre should sound when you hear it reproduced on audio equipment.  Professionally, I've been in a career for 7 years now that involves serious critical listening skills (transcription of foreign languages).  I won't bore you with the details, but almost every day I wear a high-end 2 lb headset for about 12 hours.  I also dabble in amateur home studio music production, and have learned much in the past years about mixing and mastering tracks on reference monitors and headphones (shouldn't mix on headphones though).  I hope that you will trust me with at least the technical aspects of this review.THE BUILD TYPE:  The Hesh is a pair of Closed Back Circumaural (around the ears) 50mm driver headphones.  The two main types of circumaural headphones are closed back and open (or semi-open).  Most likely, you won't be able to find a set of open-back headphones for under $50.  That shouldn't bother you though, since open-back headphones have an airy sound (a drier, tinny sound).  Most people who want to 'enjoy' their music will prefer a closed-back set, this allows for a typically deeper sound, with more natural bass.  The soundstage may become more cramped (because of the physical properties of the headset), but I would say people who are going for the Skullcandy are looking for a more exciting extraction of the music they listen to.  This is to say that the main demographic of Skullcandy consumers is probably those folks who want 'Beats by Dre' type sound but can't afford it.  You want bass, you want it in your face, and no less (whether its good for the music or not).  I get that, and hopefully Skullcandy gets that enough to include some quality in their production.THE BUILD QUALITY (4 out of 10): I've already seen a fair share of negative reviews criticizing the build quality of these cans.  Know one thing, something made of thin plastic is easier to break than something made of metal or wood.  It shouldn't take a genius to realize that its more affordable to build something out of plastic than other nicer materials.  The Hesh is made of cheap plastic, so it can be sold cheap.  Increase the material quality = increase the price, duh.  That being said, there are a few things to be realized.  I am a responsible adult when it comes to taking care of my electronics.  When I buy something that lacks durability, I treat it as such, and am careful with it.  Most Skullcandy users are probably the young crowd, teens or whatever.  A younger person can't be expected to be as responsible with their possessions, especially since their parents probably paid for it.  Parents, if you're complaining this headset falls apart after a short period of normal use, you should probably re-evaluate YOUR definition of 'normal use'.  A kid will probably break this headset before an adult does, this is just the nature of responsibility (in my opinion).  Continuing, here's what I think of the quality.  The worst offense, I'd say, is the ear-cushions.  They are very stiff right out of the box.  The first few hours/days of wear time will be somewhat uncomfortable until the stiffness loosens up.  I hope in time they will soften up, because I'm use to gel-filled pads with my work headphones, and soft leather ones with my studio reference cans.  The earcups are also somewhat on the small side.  I have a larger head, with medium size ears so I was a little surprised how small the earcups were when putting it on for the first time.  The head band is also cheaply made, with minimal cushioning against the head, but not completely awful.  Wear times longer than an hour or 2 could get pretty uncomfortable, and perhaps sweaty.  I don't think these headphones were made for very large heads either (like I was saying, more for teens) as the compression on my head is fairly tight.  The cable is shorter than would like it to be, its about the same length as my earbuds cable.  I would prefer at least 6 feet for circumaural cans, a cable as short as this one just makes the headphones feel more like a toy.  The build quality of the cable is also pretty cheap, and will probably be damaged by accidental crimping, tangles, tie-ups, etc.  To avoid this I just have to treat with care, like I plan to.  To summarize the build quality, I will just say two things you should expect: cheap plastic, stiff cushioning.(((UPDATE: The stiff earcushions are still a bother, and the smaller size of the earcups still lead to quick discomfort after listening for more than 30 minutes.  Nothing has broken or been damaged yet, but the uncomfortable build is still a major issue for me.)))THE LOOK (6 out of 10):  This brand (and market) of headphones is usually more about style than substance anyways.  Quality costs more, but looks cost almost nothing.  These are larger headphones, so wearing them may make you look goofy; but only as much as any pair of larger headphones you put on.  They look okay, and there are several flashy styles/colors to choose from.  If looks is more your thing, get Skullcandy.SOUND QUALITY (2 categories)1.  BURN IN-  10 minutes (5 out of 10): Right out of the box they sound like expected.  Unrefined across the  entire spectrum (w/IPOD).  But know that almost all headphones need a break in period (called the burn-in).  The burn-in period could be 24 hours of play-time or it could be 200 hours of play time.  It really depends.  At the  time of only 10-30 minutes of play time, I find it to be too strong in the low-mids and also  high-mids.  The bass at first seems to be attractive, but I realized after a few minutes that it was  actually the pumped up low-mids that sound like bass frequencies (they are just above the bass frequencies).  The chief problem with boosted low mids (or any part of the mid frequencies) is the problem of listening  fatigue.  Some headphones are so well balanced in sound that you could listen all day and your ears won't  be tired or worn out.  I already listen to headphones all day professionally, so listening fatigue is extra  irritating to me.  The last thing I want while listening to my music is a headache from boosted dB in any  part of the frequency spectrum.  It just shouldn't be there, but at $50 or this kind of deficiency should  be anticipated.  You should also know that at this point I've only tried these on an IPOD, which I'll go  over soon.  My opinion at 10 minutes of burn-in: Almost poor.  It needs more time to break in, then I'll  re-evaluate it.  24 hours (combined playtime): Not much difference...  3 months : Unless the source of music is EQ'd before reaching the headphones, the sound is going to be less than satisfying.  Plugging them into a non-EQ'd source (even a high end one), you hear the sound flaws of the headphones.  I don't think these headphones have aged very well after break in.2.  FORMATS:  IPOD (6 out of 10)- Most customers of the Hesh will probably use it primarily for the IPOD.  EVERYONE should realize the problem with listening to an IPOD with any kind of headphones: The audio source  quality is just as important as the headphones thru which you listen to it.  If you plug a set of $300  headphones into an IPOD, do NOT be surprised if it sounds just as crappy as a $20 pair of headphones.  The IPOD, while it is a great readily available media for playing music on the go, is not made for the  HI-FI and audiophiles market.  You MUST expect a lower quality of audio when plugged into it, and should NOT  be surprised when your music sounds like junk listening to it thru any set of cans.  This problem is  exacerbated when you listen to a lossy compressed audio file (usually an issue only with MP3).  To truly  evaluate the headphones, without unfocused or unknowledgable bias, I have to check the IPOD against other  formats.  As a tip, if you're going to listen to music on the IPOD with these, select R & B or Classical as  the EQ setting.  I find either one of those settings covers most music genres nicely, and makes them more  pleasant to listen to.  Bottom line, the IPOD is far from the most ideal listening source, when it comes to  audio fidelity.  (((UPDATE: While I don't think the IPOD is a Hi-Fi level source, listening to music with the EQ setting on R&B;  seems to sound pretty good.  I switched out between listening to a un-EQ'd vinyl record thru a Marantz receiver  and the IPOD, and the IPOD sounded better.  I think it was because of the EQ setting.))  Laptop (6 out of 10) - Not much better than the IPOD, with one exception: I can control a 10  band eq with most audio programs I use.  The key to using the EQ is you want to subtract the right  frequencies rather than boost anything.  This will help to avoid listening fatigue, which if you don't  know by now I HATE.  If in any program (such as ITUNES) try these settings: Boost 32hz and 64hz 3 dB,  cut 125hz and 1khz by 3 dB, boost 250hz and 500hz by 1 and 2 dB, respectively.  Boost 2khz and  4khz by 1-2 dB.  Boost 8khz by 2-3 decibels and leave 16khz alone.  This might help bring better  sound out of the headphones even if only marginally.  DAC - ((updated)) My recording interface is a USB Roland Octacapture.  Essentially it is a digital to  analogue converter.  I only listened to a few things thru this with the Hesh, so I can't properly evaluate  it.  But it seems like it would sound okay thru this, but just for listening to music or playing video  games.  It'd be horrible for doing any audio work (like mastering a track).  Headphone Amp - ((updated)) I didn't end up getting one, but I still highly recommend it, especially a  tube headphone amp.  It helps balance out impedance problems in the signal chain.  I'm sure the impedance  is low on these though, I haven't checked in a while.  Low impedance headphones are easier for amps to  drive.  Stereo system - ((updated)) I have a Marantz SR7005 surround sound A/V reciever system at home.  When I  tried the headphone output while listening to a vinyl record player thru a high-end preamp, it sounded  pretty terrible.  It lacked clarity, the bass sounded really muddy, and I couldn't believe the mess being  made in the mids.Thanks for reading folks, this is the final draft of this review.  I sold the Hesh at a garage sale late last year.  I'm very happy to be rid of it, but that's ONLY because I can afford better headphones.  I've owned Denon AH-D5000 headphones this whole time as well, so consider my bias for expensive gear into this review.  I know the Skullcandy Hesh is a cheap piece of plastic to most, especially me.  But its not made for HI-FI snobs, its made for the affordable crowd who want a flashy pair of cans with pumped up bass, even if the listening spectrum is badly unfocused.  If $50 or less is your budget, I say go ahead and try them out.  But be prepared to give them time to adjust to being played, treat them with care, and plug them into a good audio source ((or use R&B; eq setting on IPOD)).  But I would look at other brands/models first before getting these.  And stay FAR away from Beats By Dre or any other similar knockoffs (Ludacris makes some).  They are truly the epitome of overcharging for garbage quality.  There is too much snake oil in the audio equipment world, don't be the one to buy in to it.

VPros:These are great headphones.  they are extremely loud and give out great sound.  on my laptop i would normally have my volume at 100% and have problems hearing it (using on the ear headphones), but with these i need my laptop around 25% and i cannot hear anything outside of the music playing.Cons:These headphones are over the ear and if they would be just a little bit farther from the ear they wouldn't start to press against my ears.  after about 6 hours it start to hurt the edges of my ears (but it may be just me, because i have some big ears).  but this usually goes away after 5 min of having them off and them i am ready for another hour.hope i helped.

VI have to say, they're just okay. They don't fit over my ears quite the way I'd like, and they were a tiny bit small for my head. So for those people who have large heads, it's not probably the best product for you.Plus, they're just so bulky. I didn't think they'd be quite as bulky as they were =/But one good thing is the wire. As with all Skullcandy headphones I've ever bought, the wire is covered in fabric instead of rubber. It's therefore more naturally durable, though if you're not careful it can actually break more easily.

It's perfect for me when I need an escape but if you're walking down the street with passing cars? Forget about it. Even if you turn your ipod up all the way to hear the music you're not going to want to because the distortion of the speakers makes you want to cry. But like I said, they're perfect for around the house use and I use them all the time.

VWith so many great reviews I was really looking forward to receiving a really solid pair of headphones. But I didn't think these Skullcandy headphones were as good as people said they'd be. Personally I thought it was too heavy on the bass, which I found ok for hip hop and r&b; but not really suitable for other genres. However, for the price I can't really complain though because really really good headphones run hundreds upon hundreds of dollars. So overall I'm pleased with what I got based on the low price I paid through Amazon, but otherwise if you pay retail price then I don't think it's worth it.

So, I did the  thing that everyone else does, I sent them into skullcandy headquarters for evelauation. So I have been waiting...and waiting...AND waiting for them to give me the heads up that they have recieved the damn things and say that they will send me a replacement set. NOPE, I have been waiting since APRIL for them to send me at least an email or text or SOMETHING. I sent them emails and emails and emails.

I cannot say how durable they are becuase i only got them today, but if you take care of them they should last. One tip: when you take them on and off do it in a straight line. This prevents less movement of unnecessary parts. They also come with a pretty nice carrying bag. Also, don't bend the cord around the jack too much so the cups will still work.

VThis Product is Amazing!! Its built pretty sturdy, the material feels nice, and it fits pretty nice! For $35 on amazon compared to $50 dollars at zumiez this is a great buy! It shipped pretty fast even with the Free Shipping option and they sound great! Wouldn't mind buying another pair sometime! :) Great Product overall, the only thing is that after awhile your ears get kind of hot so you have to ventilate them a little bit! But I don't mind that so for me they work perfect!

VThe packaging was taped back together but it was a refurbished product. The headphones themselves have been reconstructed to a degree of quality higher than that of a pair of the same headphones that my friend just bought fresh from Skullcandy. These cans are, for the price, very high quality and the build construction is solid.The headphone cord is thicker than normal and feels very sturdy and does not tangle. The cans fit tightly on the head but the head band is not noticeable and only the headphones themselves can really be felt especially if you are not thinking about them. Again, this particular product feels more sturdy than an original from the online store and it clamps onto my head more securely than the original, though it is still comfortable and not to tight. Your ears do get warn and i use mine as a replacement for earmuffs when it is cold outside but i have never had a problem with "sweaty ears" so I cant comment much on these headphones from that angle.The padding is more than sufficient although there is some sound leaking if that is an issue. Above 75% volume on a standard ipod will allow others around you to enjoy your tunes with you if they listen close but the leaking isn't significant and is easily offset by the sound quality.Bass is low and clear with minimal distortion even at high volumes. The Highs and Mids are clear as well although it is obvious that these are built for bass emphasis. Acoustic and concert music both sound wonderful and the sound stage is adequately large and deep. They are built for R&B; but i have yet to find a song or genre that sounds less than adequate through these cans. I listen to a lot of House music and artists like Morgan Page sound wonderful on these.Hesh Headphones are not professional quality and do not stand up to headphones priced in the 200+ range but for the 30 i paid for them through amazon they are head, shoulders, and body above other headphones that can be bought for the same price. I highly recommend these headphones for anyone looking for a solid mid-level pair of headphones that can take a beating and still keep playing and pounding on. I personally would have paid full price for these (49.99) if I had needed to and still would have  gotten my moneys worth.

VIve always went with earbuds when it came to something to listen to my iPod to but this time i decided to try out these headphones and the sound was better than any earbuds Ive listened to. maybe if u have used other headphones other than this than your opinion will be different. i looked for the cheapest pair of these and i found these for 30.00 which is awesome because these cost 50.00 usually. they don't break easily Ive only had them for about a few days but Ive fell asleep with them and no damage was done so i wouldn't call that easily breakable maybe if you like throw them at a wall or something then yeah they will break. Ive found nothing wrong with these headphones yet if i do i will update this review

VGreat Until Broken...
p9780
sg5
VNot gonna lie, but these headphones do actually produce great sound. But since they're essentially all plastic, they break so easily. I had mine for only a month until the adjustable band on one of the headphones snapped in half and I had to super glue it together. And it lasted for about a few more months like that! I mean, the sound still worked and I didn't really care as long as it worked and the other band was adjustable... But... Then the other band broke where I couldn't fix it with superglue, and then the sound started going... All in all, they're great headphones but NOT worth the price. $50+ for cheap plastic. Do more research before investing in ANY SkullCandy product. You're just buying plastic and design.

VI was pretty hesitant to buy this but once i got it, i loved it. Yes, it is true that this headphones are not very comfortable and feels like a burden on head after extended use, bu, it is worth for the amount of money spent. The sound quality is great, bass effects and beats are pretty good, better than the ipod ear phones. To avoid the disadvantage i mentioned, i keep on switching between my ipod earphones and skullcandys at some intervals. Also, one big turn on is the look. It looks SEXYYYY..It also comes with a small skull sticker(Rasta) which i stuck to my ipod case on the back :) ;) Makes it look FUNKYYIt is a good buy, i find it better than any other skullcandys especially skullcrusher and GI. Great value for money.

VI recently got the "Rasta" version of these headphones, and I am more than satisfied (as always when it comes to Skullcandy).Comfortable fit (even with an earring in), easily adjustable. Sound is a little more bass-prominent, whereas I find the earbuds to be balanced, but my skullcandy earbuds hurt my ears after prolonged use. I can use these over the ear headphones all day (literally, a 24-hour period) without feeling discomfort.Great for music, great for TV or movies. I'm sure you could find headphones with a better sound, but for the price? These are clearly the winner.Also, it came with a drawstring pouch for toting the headphones around, a sticker (that you can put "somewhere cool" and submit to Skullcandy for a possible prize), and a stencil of the Skullcandy logo.I love the design, and the top of it is wrapped in a real woven band (feels nice). My family complimented me on how awesome they looked. The cord is a bright green as shown. It easily untangles (and doesn't tangle easily) but I find that it sticks to its shape (if you bend the cord, for example, it's going to stay a little bent). It's the same type of cord as the earbuds I have. It's also pretty long.The headphones are also durable-- I've dropped them about four feet and nothing happened, also I accidentally banged the two parts that go over your ear together, with no damage.All in all? I can't find a downside to these headphones. I'd recommend this buy to anyone!

VThese headphones are really awesome! I agree with all of the other 5 star comments, these are boss. If you go on YouTube, there are a lot of really helpful reviews on skullcandy headphones, especially for the Hesh's. If you are wondering if these are going to cover your ears, my ears are on the smaller side and they kinda touch the inside edges, but this shouldn't be a problem. I'm positive that these aren't cheaply made and that they ARE durable. These are sick.****************************************UPDATE!*************************************After a week of daily use for a week or so, one of the wires broke internally. Sweet while they lasted, I guess. I know a friend who has a pair of these and his have lasted a few years, so I guess I got a dud.Oh well.

I've had great luck with my Skullcandy earbuds and was confident these would be well worth the money and they are.  They fit nicely, are light, and made very well.

VI'm purchasing a set after using my brother's for a long time. I have no idea what most reviews are talking about. The product is durable, as I do like to wear them while sleeping or laying down. The sound is perfectly fine for headphones, and I'm willing to splurge abit just for a brand name. I admit they did get uncomfy after awhile, but that was because of my small hoop earrings pressing into my ears. Flip them in, or take them off. Otherwise, beautiful.My only big issue was the fact we didn't have enough for everyone in the house!

VThis is my first set of over ear stereo type headphones.  I've used ear buds for the past few years, and I am definitely not an expert when it comes to anything audio.  But Wow!  What a difference these make!It's awesome to be able to hear the same favorite songs in a new way.  It's like you can hear what the artist actually intended you to hear.  I walk to class with these on all the time, and they do a good job blocking out the noise from the outside.  You can still hear certain things if the volume is low enough, but that's okay with me as I'd rather hear a car coming at me than not.I love how the headphones look.  There have been some reviews saying that they don't fit very well.  I think it's like a new piece of clothing.  They definitely felt awkward at first, but after about 2 days of wearing they felt like part of my everyday attire.Durability might be a question, but I've dropped these, smashed them in my backpack and choreographed my hip hop dances with them on and they don't show any sign of breaking.  Honestly, I try to take care of them but since I'm at so many placed everyday they do get banged up.  You can't beat the warranty, and that was a huge factor in me buying these.Overall I would recommend these to a friend.  Other people might say different, but I think they look great, feel great, and sound great.

VI am a programmer and am looking for headphones that I can use 8 hours a day. I picked up a pair of HESH at target for $45. I was impressed by the sound quality for the price, but I'm no audiophile. Unfortunately, I have to return them because after just one day of use, I have found that they pinch my ears. My whole ear will fit inside the leather but it is very uncomfortable after about an hour.

After about a week though it became better. The sound on it is nice, rap music, rock or whatever, the sound is always nice. The sound also doesn't leak that much, so you can listen to decently loud music and not bother your surrounding. It's a nice purchase for the price.

VAfter trying some Skullcandy earbuds, I decided that the quality of Skullcandys products was good enough to purchase some earphones. After seeing the prices of high quality earphones, I felt that  Skullcandy would be a good value. I chose the Hesh earphones mostly on looks but the specs had a little to do with my decision as well. When I received them I immediately connected them to my iPhone and played all different types of music to really test them out. Sound quality overall is good but the bass isn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. They also weren't as loud as I would have liked either. I don't want to blowout my eardrums but sometimes you just want to crank it up and you can't really do that with these earphones.

VThe sound is awesome but they break for no reason and customer service is a Gamble trust me find a better brand. The warranty is a joke. You send in the headphones and they decide whether or not the damage is something you caused. IF they determine the damage was your fault which most likely 90 % of the time they will, all you get back is a 50% off coupon on your next purchase. They keep the headphones and you loose half of what you paid for them. Some warranty. The headset adjuster is made of cheap plastic that breaks simply because you take them off your head.They lasted about 3 days. I am very disappointed in this product.  My advice... go somewhere else to buy headphones.

VAfter reading several bad reviews, I figured maybe they just had a defective product. After weighing the good and bad reviews I decided to buy them and if I did not like them I could just return them. It took only two days after I placed my order to get my headphones and I have to say they fit great. Some reviews say they are bulky, they don't fit right over my ears, they are made of cheap plastic, when you wear them around your neck it does not fit right. Well to the not fitting right over the ears I will be the first to say I have huge ears and these fit comfortably and with any over the ear headphones you have to adjust them after wearing them for a long time. They are a little bulky but that is exactly what you are buying, bit headphones that will fit over your ears. One review I read about the cheap plastic and they bought it for their child(teen) and after a few days they broke. I am only 22 and can tell you those headphones did not bread from normal wear, the teen probably horsing around with his friends dropped them and broke them, as with anything if you drop it or are rough with it they will not last. Overall I give these headphones a 5 out of 5 and they are about 60% noise cancelling without music on. I don't know what other reviews have said but when I am listening to music at half volume I can't hear anything, they are perfect. I highly recommend these headphones. (and if there is any defects skullcandy has a warranty and will replace them or if you break them you can get a new pair for cheaper)

Now a few months after even I started using them on a daily basis when my brother is at school so they get like 7 hours of use everyday and they don't seem to notice. We don't treat these like they are some sort of jewelry they are always on on the desk sometimes I wear them to go workout.The build is very durable and I don't know how other users manage to break them in such a short notice, they must treat them like crap.

VMy mom brought me to the mall the weekend before my birthday since y birthday was the second Monday of school & I couldn't have a real birthday party & I told her I wanted Dr. Dre headphones but then we found these awesome headphones & since they were cheaper than the Dr. Dre ones & more cool looking she got me those instead & now just yeaterday I noticed once I got on the bus that 1 of the speaker things was loose but figured it'd be fine so i continued to use them for thr next few hours but 2 or 3 hours later the speaker thing came almost completely off only dangling from the cord. I don't use them roughly or anything, I a very careful with my stuff, in particular any thing that was given as any kind of present 9especially if it's as awesome as these headphones. These are sound canceling and even have some sort of blue tooth in them so u can talk on the phone for ages without having to unplug them and putting ur ohne 2 ur ear. They are extremely comfortable and fashionable looking even come w/ a bag that I find a waste of money, since I only ever used it for about a week and got sick of it & now only plan on using it when I pack my headphones for a trip or something. Anyway I went to a cousin's place and she was able to glue the speaker thing back on & said I had to wait 24 hours to use them again so I am going 2 try them out & see how it goes, hopefully I wont have 2 buy a new pair of these. :(

VI'm really not that hard on headphones. I'm not dancing around in them and people don't come over and use them. I use them for my work doing transcription. I am very disappointed to have to report that already -- in less than six weeks' time -- the right side earpiece is breaking off. Guess I'll have to go back to paying a lot more for headphones that will last for a decide amount of time.It's too bad. I had no problems with the sound and I think they are cute -- but breaking so easily just ain't cool...!

VMinor Disappointments.
p9957
sg5
VSkull Candy's headphones are like no other I have seen, they have a variety of interesting designs that stray from most competitors. But have they sacrificed physical quality for an appealing look? I must admit I really brought these headphones because of the awesome design and I have heard some good words for the actual sound quality which was quite promising and true.Although the setbacks that made me think "Why didn't I read a review like this one" was that upon sleeping in my SOFT bed full of PILLOWS with the headphones on I woke up in the morning to realise the frame supporting the two earmuffs together had suffered a gut wrenching crack. The headphones are still usable and it isn't much of a problem, but if I were to accidentally bend the frame any more it would surely snap. Now you could probably point the finger at me and say I could of rolled around too vigorously at night which would of snapped it, but I have read quite a few articles online by a simply Google search to use as my evidence of a poor quality frame. The major problem I see here is that Skull Candy is a well known brand and should live up to its expectations, in Australia you have to pay about $135 dollars at the local skate shop for these, I'm just glad I got them for an awesome price at Amazon.Now my half hast attempt is to try warranty them at Skull Candy Australia, if I get rejected it won't be a big deal. Now if I were to have brought them from the local skate shop here I would of surely had to tie a slipknot out of the audio lead and kick the chair.

VSo I got these for a 13 year old as a birthday present. So far it looks stylish as I got the "Dwayne Wade" Edition. The cloth is cheap looking but solid. The only place that really concerns me is the plastic adjustable part that allows your headphones to get smaller or bigger. It seems pretty easy to snap....even a 13 year old could do that. Anyways I just got it a week ago and the sound is good. Bass is solid and higher pitch parts are above average. Make sure you leave some breathing room for year ears though. They are very tight and easily make your ears sweat. Overall I would buy this item again as it was only $31. Although no Bose, I may just buy 7 of them to equal the amount I paid for my bose :)

VSkullcandy Hest Metallica Headphones
p10021
sg5
VAt first, I loved my Hesh Skullcandy Metallica headphones.  With the tight ear pads and in-line volume control they were the perfect match for my treadmill TV watching.  However, because the sliders for the headphones are plastic they cracked and became broken.  Now my headhphones are useless.So even though in the short-term I enjoyed them, they did not last without breaking.  In looking at the Skullcandy website, I noticed that most of their overear headphones have plastic sliders.  This is something that clearly needs improvement.

VSkullcandy Hesh is a very good quality. I was very satisfied with my purchase even after a couple months of use. However, these headphones are not very comfortable for prolonged listening sessions. The plastic headband is soft. Later I noticed a small crease on both sides. This crease continued to grow until the cups completely dislodged and held on by only copper wires. However, the headphones failed during the return policy period, so I got refund thankfully. I would buy HESH again if Skullcandy improves in the plastic quality.

VHesh Headphones
p10126
sg5
VLet me first state that I am a Radio DJ and an audiophile. I know how good headphones sound and I know how bad headphones sound. Normally low-budget headphones provide decent sound quality. After owning a few pairs of different Skull Candy headphones, I can honstly say that they are all just gimmicks. The 2011 Hesh headphones sound terrible. They sound extremely flat and the bass is virtually unnoticable.  As I just stated, I know how bad headphones sound and for Skull Candy to market these as premium headphones with 50mm drivers is complete BS. I have listened to a complete multitude list of songs and albums set at different kbps and genre and each song sounded terrible with these headphones. A cheap pair of Sony headphones sound way better than any Skull Candy product.The only genre that sounded better than Apple earbuds was Rap/Pop/Dance/Electric. Rock music sounds awful with these. So if you generally don't care and want to look cool, by all means waste your money on Hesh.For similarly priced headphones I would recommendSennheiser HD 202  II Professional Headphones (Black)for these have the best overall sound for entry level over-ear headphones. Trust me, AVOID SKULL CANDY!!

VExcellent Low-Price Headphones
p10148
sg5
VI have been using these headphones for approximately one month now, and I am pleased with my purchase.  The sound quality is some of the best I have ever had for paying $35 dollars for headphones, and is an incredible improvement over the $30 (vastly overpriced, and utterly crappy) Apple ear-buds. They have the typical good quality of parts that Skullcandy is known for, and they feel solid and fairly sturdy. These headphones DO NOT have any significant noise cancellation when you are not listening to music, but they were not advertised with that capability, so I was not expecting much. When you are listening to music you hear almost nothing else. My only complaint with these headphones is that, because I have a rather large head, they put some pressure on the top of my head, which can get uncomfortable over time, but it is not anything serious.Overall, this is a great product and an excellent purchase for anyone looking at budget headphones. I absolutely recommend these headphones.

VDISAPPOINTMENT, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND
p10166
sg5
VMy husband bought me these headphones for Christmas 2010.  I'm an administrative assistant and use them for work.  To avoid my headphones getting lost or broken during my commutes, I keep them under lock and key in my desk at work.  I take extremely good care of my things.You can imagine my surprise when both of the headband adjustments cracked and broke by February.  Mind you, I don't even adjust the headband because they fit find without it.  The material is a cheap thin plastic.  I went to the Skullcandy website to see if I could get a replacement set and I did.  Only that the replacement set took nearly a month (March)to get back and I had to pay for the shipping, which was not reimbursed, about $8 and some change.  The first time, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However it is now August and guess what?  The same headband adjustment material, that had already begun to crack in July, has broken yet again. If you're keeping count that's 2 sets in less than 9 months.I'm contemplating on sending them back again, but what would be the point?  Eventually, I'll have to continue sending them back and spend more on shipping and handling than the damn headphones are actually worth. I feel bad for my husband that was laid off last year, because it took him a few months to save up to get them for me so he'd have something to give me on Christmas.Wait there's more! The headphones are cute and I find them reasonably comfortable but the noise leaks...a lot.  On days I don't want to wear the headphones I could easily use them as speakers with my iPod volume at less than half way and that's not a compliment.I would not recommend these to anyone. I find that they are banking on a trendy brand name and designs, other than that the quality is terrible.  Do not buy.

VMy cat killed a pair of Sony studio reference headphones and I was in desperate need of a pair of over ear, middle of the road price range headphones.  I found these on sale from here and was stoked when they arrived.  I was pleased with the design up close, and they sounded decent.  Not as as much deep bass as my old Sony headphones, but punchy enough to get passed it.  They started out a bit tight but loosened up over time and the ear pads were comfy. The sound isolation was good enough to block out most noise but not all.  The problem is the durability. The cord is tiny and feels as if the slightest tug will sever the wires and instead of making the adjustable part(which IS the stress point on these) out of metal, they used plastic.  3 good months of usage and they snapped  right above the ear... bummer.

VFor the small amout of money i paid for it, i guess you get your moneys worth. The sound is good, as well is the noise canceling. The one that that urked at me, was how small the headphones where. The ear piece did not fit around my ears very well... In fact there increadbly small. They only seem to fit my 9 year old brother, and then its still kind of tight. Just keep that in mind when you purchase this item.

VTHEY BREAK.
p10188
sg5
VPlease read this before buying!! These are my SECOND pair of skullcandy over the ear headphones. The first ones where the foldable subwoofer model and they broke after about 6-8 months of use. I chalked it up to coincidence and concluded they must have been weak because they were collapsible. So I purchased this pair here, treated them like they where made of glass, and they are still already fracturing after less than a MONTH of use! The plastic part where the ear piece slides up and down is what has started to crack, causing one ear piece to be much less snug than the other, and I KNOW it will eventually just snap off just like my previous pair did. Learn through my experience - DO NOT BUY SKULLCANDY. They look awesome and sound great but WILL BREAK ON YOU IN LESS THAN A YEAR OF REGULAR USE, EVEN WITH THE MOST GENTLE OF TREATMENT.

VFor me, when a head phone costs more than $50, it better be good. I bought these at the store for $50 after my other headphones broke. I like these big ones, but they are kind of hard to find in stores. Its mainly just ear-buds they sell, which i don't like.I bought that and Sony MDR-ZX100 Headphone for $20, so i spent about $70 on both headphones. Anyway, I tried Candy first, because they were bigger. I was disappointed that it didn't come with a audio enhancer on the cord. My other pair (that broke), for $30 came with this feature (they lasted about 5 years or so). I put them on, and they fit my head very well, and your ears just slide right in.I turned it on (my MP3 player), and noticed it sounded different than my other ones. It sounded lower quality than the one i replaced it with, so i fiddled with the custom setting on my mp3 player, ect. It still sounds off to me, like the songs are low Q or something. If it makes any sense, it sounded like a triangle in terms of how the music is distributed. The lower stuff, guitars, ect, come out on both ends of the head phone and sound further apart (stereo), and to me, more balanced, but the vocals and drums are at the top, and sound like they are more mono, like a focal point, which bugs me. I guess if you like this set up get it, but the other headphone i bought, Sony MDR-ZX100, are square, as in, it doesn't sound mono, and everything is stereo and balanced, rather than having a middle-like focal point.The cord is short, but very light, it looks like a string, which is nice. It doesn't look like it will tangle or knot easily. It should have came with a sound enhancer for $50. IIRC, the one that does come with a sound enhancer is like $70 or something crazy.It comes with a stupid sack case thing, and a stupid sketch thing, just to raise up the price probably, I could have lived without both. These will be my backup head phones, and Sony's will be the main stage for now.TL;DR[-]Overpriced[-]Doesn't come with a sound enhancer[-]One cord coming out of the left side[-]Comes with a stupid carrying case[-]Drums and Vocals sound mono (like a focal point or something)[-]Other instruments sound stereo[-] I like the design with the skull[-]Short cord[-]Cord isn't heavy or bulky, but very thin, string-like[-]feels cheap[-]Light (as in, not heavy)Overall, its ok. It comes down too, if you like the focal pointing or the drums and vocals sounding mono or not. Not bad, i like a few thing, but the focal point kills me. Also, its very expensive, and doesn't come with a sound enhancer.

VI bought these hoping I could get a descent pair of headphones for $50 at best buy.  At first feel the plastic feels cheap, and the ear pads are stiff and not very soft.  They fit very tight on my head, it was very uncomfortable to wear even for a short period of time.  My hat size is usually a 7 1/2.  I returned them and picked up the phillips o'neill stretch headphones from amazon, and they are extremely comfortable for my big head.

VI purchased these headphones from my local F.Y.E store. I got them on sale for 35 bucks thinking they'd be great for just listening to music. I didn't need any high quality headphones at the time, so I figured these would be perfect. And to be honest, for a few months, they were. Right out the box, they were especially louder than any other headphone I've tried! The 50mm drivers are to thank for that, even though these are the only 50mm headphones I have ever listened to. The sound quality served my needs quite well. But these were my second pair of Skullcandy headphones that broke. I won't go into my first pair's experience but this pair was different.I was listening to them at high volume when all of a sudden the left driver started cracking, so I took them off to see what the problem was. I tapped on the outside of the left cup and the speaker stopped working immediately and it hasn't worked since. These headphones were nice and they were loud with quite a lot of bass, but I doubt i will be buying anything else from Skullcandy for a while, sadly. The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because of its loudness and its sound quality which, to me, sounded remarkable. Great product while it lasted.

VAll i can say is wow... Being from a company like skullcandy I had high expectations for this product, iI decided to go with a more expensive, but not the most expensive pair they had. Turns out I wpuld have been better served if I had just set my money on fire. The pair of... Well i guess you can call them headphones arrived late, no suprise there, but the box it came in was HUGE!! No wonder my shipping required a second mortgage! And when I opened this huge box i see the heaphones in this weird plastic, with zero packing material of any kind, apparently $40 shrink-wrapped heaphones will be fine if they are able to fly all over the huge box in transit. I finally get the headphones out, and i can already feel what other reviewers have commented on, its cheap, brittle plastic, from the pictures it looks like it would be somewhat durable, but once you feel them you know they arent going to last. They only fit my head when fully extended, and even then they are very snug and uncomfortable. The only reason they are called noise cancelling is because the thick padding fills in your ears and ruins the music, sounds like im listening to my music while under water. The ear pieces are too small, and make your ears sweat and hurt after 10 minutes or so. I DO NOTRECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!!! This $40 something pair of headphones are made to fit children and the quality feel like it was made BY children!

VBefore I bought these headphones i read tons of reviews about them because my music quality is really important to me and i wanted to make sure i was making the right choice. With these headphones, i made the best choice without a doubt. I've read reviews about how they hurt you're ears and are uncomfortable. I'm sorry, but thats a bunch of bull. They are extremely comfortable and i can wear them for hours without any problems what so ever. The music quality is very very impressive, i love using them whenever i can. The bass in them is fantastic, but also isn't overwealming and does not distort the music. If you love enjoying your music, and are looking for a quality pair of headphones, you've found them. And for $35-$45 are you kidding me? enter your credit card number right now and get these headphones. The only problem you should have is deciding what color you should get. Enjoy!!

VI love these head phones! Their so stylish and compared to my last earbuds, have amazing sound and are comfy!PROS:Pretty comfortable, i bought them on sale so for 35 bucks they have amazing sound! The noise blocking is pretty good, it depends on how close you are and how loud it is and stuff but its good. I LOVE THE CORD! Its amazing! It never gets tangled, and also makes for a nice toy to play with when im bored in the car! The padding on the sides and top is very nice too.CONS:Well along with style, they dont look the best sitting on the top of your head cause they look kinda flat. Its hard to explain but they dont look super awesome if you wear them normally. but who really cares. Umm it does leak sound, but its not bad. as long as you dont have your music blaring its okay. and again it also depends on how close someone is to it for them to be able to hear it. The only other thing is they kinda suction to your ears and it gives me a little headache after a while.But overall these headphones were worth all the money! Annnnd as a plus it comes with a carrying bag and a skull candy "Skull" cut-out! I put mine on my laptop:)Hope this was useful! It was also my first review! ^,^

p10315
sg5
VI am a 15 year old kid and I bought a pair of skullcandy skullcrushers a couple months ago and they still work perfectly but I just got the hesh yesterday and I would like to say for 34$ it's an amazing deal it has great sound quality and the bass is tight. They do cancel out voice very well and I Do prefer these over the skullcrushers because it has better sounding bass and the sound quality is almost the same and that's a 20$ difference plus te hesh feel more durable but what sucks the more u adjust them the more stress there is at te top of the headband and they stay on your head great! My problem is that I have big ears and it doesn't completely cup my big ears but oh well I would still recommend these to anyone on a budget (like I am) but if u pay over 45$ for these go with sony headphones or sennheiser. Oh I almost forgOt they do leak some sound not a lot but I mainly use them to run and to ride my bike and they are great!

VThese headphones have changed my perspective about over the ear headphones. I used to not like them because no matter how much you would turn up the volume you could still hear people talking. Now with the NBA headphones with just putting them on it is hard to hear people talking. Then as soon as you start playing music it is like that is the only sound in the world because that is all you can hear. All in all the Dwayne Wade NBA Skullcandy Headphones is the greatest headphones I have ever purchased.

VI was thinking about getting these headphones for a while. I had owned many pairs of skullcandy headphones and they had usually lasted me a long time. I wanted to upgrade to a pair of studio-like over ear headphones and it came down to the skullcandies and the beats by dre. Although the quality is lower than the beats in both sound and comfort, these headphones do a great job for a great price. The Beats are better than these, however they are not superior enough to justify the price. If your looking for a solid pair of headphones all around, then these are for you. They are light weight, sturdy, and block out sound (great for buses, trains, crowded areas). Little discomfort on ears due to them pushing on your ears, but you will break them in. Like I said for the price, you can't go wrong.

VThese are a pretty standard headphone. The have Great bass response and ok mids and treble. You wouldn't want to use them to try to do a studio rough mix, but they make decent reference headphones. They're also great for the Airplane, car trips, or just Ipod listening. They're pretty comfortable, however the vinyl ear pads can get a little sweaty with extended wear. They do not isolate sound really well. I will give them the fact that they're not advertised as noise cancelling so this was less of an issue for me. The only real issue I have with them is that the adjustment bands on the side are cheap plastic.After about 4 months of standard use they're to the point where I have to have them replaced. I called Skullcandy and they set me up with an RMA no problem. The only downside is that you have to pay the shipping to them.

VAs soon as I opened the headphones, there was a rattling sound coming out of the left earpiece. The sound was average, I've had seven dollar sony earbuds that sound the same, They are however comfortable headphones. I would stay away from skullcandy as their quality control is horrible. The material used is also cheap. For the price get a pair of Sony MDR-7506's

VI am not a dj, or one that needs to use headphones too often. I use headphones while on my personal computer for listening to music, watching videos on youtube, movies and the like. The headphones have a great sound, no doubt that the sound quality is high. The headphones get a little bothersome though, the cuffs are completely round so they fit kind of funny on the ear and get uncomfortable after a little while. I found myself needing to take them off to "rest". Also, they aren't made very well. The plastic has cracked on the left ear side and is starting to on the right. In all fairness maybe I just have a big head, but nevertheless, I cannot fairly high recommend. Very Bulky and I feel made rather cheaply. The sound is great though so I give 3 stars.P.S. My hat size is 7.5.

VMy opinion and overview....I  believe the average person will find these comfortable, but for me, sadly, they are not.It seems that if the cups were constructed just a little bigger in circumference,  my ears would fit inside allot more comfortably.  I would advise trying em for a couple hours or days before throwing away the packaging..I will be returning them for that reason :(.other than that Id say these phones are a great buy and if you like rap, dance, or anything with bass, these go hard !!If you want a great set of cans, then forget buying those 20 dollar pair and invest some more $ in these, you be happy with the sound, and  Skull candy has that lifetime warranty, so your set. You'll waste more $ replacing those cheapo's besides the sound quality is levels above .

VI've always been a music enthusiast, however I was never able to use earbuds because my ears are far too small for them, thus began my search for a decent pair of headphones.These are not only decent, they are incredible!  The noise isolation is high quality and the sound quality is amazing; it was definitely love at first note.  These headphones are light, comfortable, and durable.  They truly live up to the quality that Skullcandy is known for.

VI bought these for my girlfriend whose a Celtics fan and loves music. She loves them but can't stand how they can't produce the same sound in any other electronics besides her cell phone. She plugged them into the TV at night to listen to movies without making much noise but couldn't get %100 sound without holding down the volume knob. Very strange. That's the only minus we have on them. They look great, feel great, and have AWESOME sound! No better headphones for your mobile electronics!

VI was really pleased with Skullcandy earbuds in the past, so I decided to buy a pair of over the ear headphones. They were great for about a week or two until I noticed the sides started cracking. I was careful with them to begin with and they have never been dropped or shoved into any small spaces, but after I noticed that I decided to be extra careful. Unfortunately that didn't seem to work. The right side is almost completely cracked off and I am super disappointed. They sound phenomenal, but they are not durable. I'm afraid to use them for fear that the entire right side will break off. Luckily, Skullcandy has a really great warranty and I told them about the problem and I'm getting them replaced.

p10477

VThis a great pair of headphones. They are low priced for the great quality of sound they put out. The volume can get loud so it would be a good idea to moderate the volume level. These headphones do a good job of canceling out other noises by you.  They look stylish and feel soft. My only complaint would be the size. They do feel a bit small on the head and around the neck. Good thing they're adjustable. The only other thing that would be a deciding factor is if you like how they cup your entire ear inside. Not to mention the cord to insert them into your MP3 player is a bit long which can get annoying.  But if you're looming for a great pair of headphones at a low price, this is the pair to get.

VI personally love Skullcandy. I live in Utah, and it's nice to see a Utah-bred company get some attention. These are the first pair of Skullcandy headphones I've owned. I got these at Best Buy for a good price. Here's a breakdown of everything:Sound Quality: 4.5/5Great sound quality; bass was great but not overpowering, mids weren't muddled, and trebles were clear. Great reproduction of sound. The only complaint is that the bass could have a little bit more of that "boom" factor; right now, they're just "there." Passive sound isolation isn't the best, but this isn't intended for sound cancellation anyways.Comfort: 3/5When I first got these, I thought that the padding was a little bit stiff. I thought I just had to break it in for a while. Now, after a couple of months, it hasn't gotten any softer. Compared to the Skullcrushers' soft padding, this is hard and doesn't create a very good seal. I constantly have to readjust the headphones, and the cups aren't the biggest. Maybe I'm just a wuss, but these give me a headache after just an hour of wearing these.Durability: 3/5Almost all plastic; I haven't had any problem with anything breaking, and I even keep it in a backpack that gets thrown into lockers and stuffed full of books. I don't know how much longer these will last, though. Even a little movement makes them creak.Portability: 3/5These cans are HUGE! Add that to the fact that they don't fold up, and you've got a huge thing you need to lug around. These also don't look the best on your head, and aren't ideal to wear under a hat.Honestly, if I were you, I'd get the Skullcrushers, which can be had for not much more than these. They fold up, are much more comfortable, and have some wicked bass, especially if you like hip-hop/dance music. The sound quality is the most important aspect, so I guess I'm going to give this a 4/5 overall.

VAfter reviewing several different options, I chose to go with these due to the price and the specs. This was my first pair of Skullcandy headphones. I usually spend the extra money and go with top of the line sound products such as Bose or Sony. I knew they would sound good, but I was very pleased after using them for just the first time. I didn't realize these headphones would do so well with noise cancellation. The sound from these things boom! I've used them for music and also with my PS3 for loud sound at night. They are very dynamic and put out loud sound even when just hooked up to my mp3 player. I've already ordered my second pair of Skullcandy headphones.

VI found that the Skull Candy Headphones were very stylish and received a number of compliments on them. For the low price I purchased them for, the quality of sound and noise cancellation were excellent. Also, they arrived at the exact projected date in wonderful packing condition. However, upon wearing them upwards of 60 min, they become annoyingly uncomfortable and can sometimes cause a headache. If one plans to wear them for less than an hour at a time, they are a great value. Unfortunately, they are not exactly dorm-friendly, as you must wear headphones in order to watch movies or listen to music for long periods of time.

VThe Headphones are Overall Amazing, especially for the price. the sound Quality is excellent and they are comfortable to wear on your head.Now the Only issues with these headphones are that when you wear them around your neck they kinda choke u a little. So Avoid that, I just used the slack of my belt to wear them on my pants when I had to take them off.And the other thing is that the Plastic extension on the headphones are of poor quality, the right hand side broke off from just normal wear and tear and the right hand side is now cracked. I easily fixed this with Black duct Tape, and no one notices.the speakers on the headphones are truly amazing, they never scratch or get any type of interference. So GOOD JOB! on that part SkullCandy! by now my headphone speakers would have blown... you can Definitely BLAST the music and not expect to go deaf or break your Headphones. LIKE I SAID EARLIER- GREAT BUY FOR THE PRICE!!!

VI bought these headphones in January. Within literally two weeks, one side of the headphone rails had started cracking. Being the lazy, non-receipt keeping consumer that I am, I taped them up and went on my way. Today (April 11, 2011), the other side has begun to crack and break apart.In summation, these headphones are crap and not even close to worth the money. They are simply poor designed, and can't handle the "stress" of being worn the way they're supposed to be.DON'T BUY!

VI bought these headphones with a bit of reluctance because of some reviews, but some people obviously don't know what they're talking about. The whole thing is great! It even came with a nice carrying case. The sound is amazing, crisp and extremely loud. I have to turn it really low so people don't hear it! Bottom line, definitely reccomended. I've tried Beats by Dre, Sony, and Bose, and surprisingly the cheapest headphones I bought are the best. Great product.

I hadn't had them a week when the thin adjustable part snapped. Complete waste of money, do not buy under any circumstance.

Vwork pretty well, for the price(28$ you can't go wrong) note amazon rises and lowers the prices all the time. At first they hurt a little, but its not too bad, you can only wear them for so long and then half to take them off. they are seriously not worth 50$; the quality is no were close to be worth that much. they are stylish, but if you can afford to pay more, look elsewhere,go with another company, skull candy tends to be cheap in quality. They sound pretty great, although not the best pair of headphones (you get what you pay for). if your someone who brakes things easily i would Not recommend these; i knew in advance that the quality was questionable but also knew that if i take care of them i could make them last longer.

p10618

VGot them earlier this month. Love the quality of the sound, I love the DJ/Studio headphone style, BUT they break unbeliveably easialy. This is my second pair. broke in the exact same place as last time. The arms are very flimsy despite how the might look and feel. I STRONGLY recommend Adjusting the headphones to a comfortable size then coat the arms in super glue, then fill the ENTIRE area with hot glue. Then cover the hot glue with duct tape, preferably black. The wire is very thin and brittle, if an arm breaks it won't be long before it cuts the wire.On another note, these things get REALLY loud, and they leak. Everyone around you can hear what you are listening to, and you can hear them too. Even though they are over the ear they do nothing to block out outside noise and they might as well be speakers. The sound quality is amazing for the price. I spent a little under $30.If you do decide to do what i did with the tape and glue, make SURE you get them comfortable first, they might be comfortable at first, but the get uncomfortable real fast, i suggest making it slightly bigger than you think you should.

The design is great and they are very comfortable, and they also cancel the noise around you very well. However, if you are looking for clear sound, these headphones were a waste of $35 dollars. I suggest if you have Apple earbuds, stick with those; their sound quality is much better.

VThis purchase was for my daughter.  When we first began searching for the headphones, I couldn't understand why she wanted them, and why they cost so much.  But then I began to see other teenagers with them and soon found out this was the in thing to have.  Once we found them on Amazon, they were much cheaper than the big name stores.  When she received, I have never seen her so excited.  Of course you know teenagers don't get excited anymore.  Anyway she loves them and she wears them all the time.  Excellent price, sturdy and long lasting, and a great gift for a teenager.

VUncomfortable for My Big Fat Head
p10664
sg5
VI picked these up because they were pretty cheap, looked cool, and I wanted to try some over the ear headphones (I usually use in-earphones). My biggest problem with these is that they are very uncomfortable for periods of long listening. The ear cups aren't large enough for my ears, combine that with how even though the size is changeable for larger heads, they are really tight. Consequentially, my ears were really banged up after wearing them for a couple hours. The sound quality is also very mediocre, with it being relatively weak and tinny. Also, it blocks out enough sound to make it hard to listen to whatever is in your environment, but loud annoying sounds seem at times almost worse. Furthermore, the plastic construction seems a little cheap, though I don't know yet how easy they'll break. So in the end, I guess you get what you pay for.Edit: After a few uses of these headphones, the thin little piece of plastic you see in the picture between the head band and ear cup snapped when I lifted one ear to talk to someone. So I learned my lesson, don't ever buy earphones from Skullcandy, they're cheap pieces of crap.

VSo i bought these headphones thinking these would be nice because they are skullcandies. After about three weeks they broke! The volume and stuff still works and everything but the extension part you adjust to fit your head broke. i haven't used them in a week because they look like they are going to break if i use them more. I'm disappointed, the extension part is plastic so it just cracked and is about to break. the sound and stuff was nice, but there is no point in buying this because it is pretty cheap. I payed 50 bucks for these things and they dont even last.

VSound decent, but the build-quality is not worth $50
p10714

VThese headphones sound all right, they're more balanced to my ears than my Sennheiser CX-300 IEMs. They are definitely not worth $50 though. I got these on sale for $25 and I found that they sound more like headphones in that price range.1. To me they are extremely uncomfortable since they clamp to your head like vice-grips even after letting them stretch out, and they're pretty heavy on my small head.2. They sound better in terms of tonal balance compared to my Sennheiser CX-300 in-ear headphones. The mids and highs are laid back compared to the more forward bass and seem a muddy to my ears (the notes seem slurred and not very detailed). The bass is there and has a decent bass punch. I do have to compliment them on their soundstage. The soundstage for these closed headphones is definitely a lot larger than my Sennheiser CX300's. A larger soundstage makes the music recording sound more realistic, as if you were in a concert hall, so that's a good thing.3. The cloth carrying case that's given in the package is not very useful unless you're storing these headphones somewhere for a while. I use these at school and they're reaaally bulky since they don't lie flat nor fold. They are not very portable.4. The pleather ear pads are stiff and also uncomfortable. They do isolate some noise but not too much since the stiff pads do not conform to my head. In the back of the headphones' ear cups, there is a gap between my head and the pads themselves, despite trying to adjust the headphones around.I haven't had any problems with these myself, but when I move them, they do make a creaking sound so I'm not sure how durable these will be. For $50 I hope they last a while. I've had my $25 Sennheiser CX300's for 2 years without any problems yet.UPDATE March 24, 2011: I took a look at my headphones in the sun today and I noticed that the joint connecting the 50mm driver housings with the adjustable headband has a crack in the plastic on both sides of the headphone. It seems like this is the weakest spot of the headphones considering other reviews, and I can see why. At that specific spot, most of the flexing of the headband occurs there, which is a hollow plastic tube. Very poor design on Skullcandy's part.UPDATE July 13, 2011: So the cracks on the headband have now become even larger and my right ear piece is barely hanging in there. I'm looking for a replacement headphone at the moment since these are really loose on my head (due to the headband cracks).UPDATE August 9, 2011: Now both sides of the headband have become cracked to the point where I cannot place them on my head and remain in place. They slide off of my head since there is essentially no clamping force. I purchased a Shure SRH940 headphone and my review for that product can be found on its product page here:SRH940 Professional Reference Headphones

VFirst overear headphones a bad buy at all.[Update Aug 2011)
p10725
sg5
VIve already used these headphones for a week now, it really works well on music, but it sounds even better if you use your EQ on your ipod or your portable music device, it helps the headphones adjust to what you want them to sound like Rock,Electronic,Dubstep,Techno,Alternative,Country you name it these headphones work like a charm. My only problem seems to be the noise cancellation a bit, i can still hear a little bit, but that is only if i focus on that. I have not had these headphones break on me so far and they seem to work like a charm. It feels like i am a DJ and the sound is kept within my ears only, plus i can feel the bass on Dubstep and the sounds the way they were sopposed to be without the earbuds these are excellent. Plus for the price they are C+ headphones, meaning they are above average quality for a cheaper price than what they use to cost(60$), buy with confidence. One last thing be gentle with your headphones when sliding them down, because i keep noticing by the reviews that they say the Skullcandy headphones will break, but i bet that is because they put to much force adjusting the sides to their ears.August 2011-------------My Skullcandy broke sadly i accidently sat on the side of it, i had good times with this one, and i learned that these headphones are good but not great. I recently baughtSennheiser HD 202  II Professional Headphones (Black)I hate to say it but Skullcsndy looks good but is decent at best, but Sennheiser is a relieble brand like Bose,Koss, in which it can deliver on Dubstep,Bass and all of that plus it has good noise cancellation which Skullcandy barely had it. It is 20$ right now with HD type headphones, and i am liking it right now as i baught it, to me it is a steal. This is only an alternative if you do not want to pay the price for Skullcandy and want something that is cheaper and better.

VSkullcandy Hesh Headphones Review
p10731
sg5
VGreat design and shape. I love Skullcandy headphones, they are some of the greatest headphones out there! The Hesh headphones are VERY comfortable, fit nicely around your ears and on your head. The sound quality...eh, it's okay, not the greatest but it's still pretty good. It isn't completely bad but then again it isn't the greatest in the world. Very light headphones which can be good for some and bad for others. The good part is that they aren't that heavy when having them on or just having them around your neck. The bad thing is since they're light and made of some plastic, they could go out but who knows. They also come with a nice silk-like bag for you to carry them around in. I would say these would be the perfect set of headphones if you love to just listen to music to relax, get some steam out of your system, etc. These wouldn't be the kind of headphones for anyone who is professionally in the music business and need some of headphones to do work with; if you need something like that then look for the Skullcandy DJ headphones at the Skullcandy website or a nearby Apple store. But otherwise these are a good pair of headphones and again I would recommend them to anyone who just wants to jam out to music.

VGood Sound Quality, For the Price
p10755
sg5
VI purchased these because they'd been recommended to me by a friend. In hindsight I probably should have gotten the DJ-style headphones, because they collapse and are therefore more portable. Although these headphones are very comfortable for the most part, they are a tight fit (width-wise) and tend to be snug on the ears. This is good in the sense that they won't fall off, but bad because they get uncomfortably tight very fast. Otherwise a decent product, for the price.

VI bought these back in the summer and was pretty pleased with them. The bass hits hard and they sound great as long as your not an audiophile.However, they broke after VERY light usage after a couple months. They're made of cheap plastic and the thin piece between the head band and the earphones crack easily. So if you plan on using your headphones for more than a few months before buying a new pair, look elsewhere.Also, they're horribly uncomfortable. They will squeeze the heck out of your head, so prolonged usage is usually associated with headaches.Good luck. However, I've yet to have a problem with their earbud headphones.

p10766
sg5
VI bought this set of headphones and I take VERY good care of things like this. I kept them in the little travel bag and never thrashed them around, etc. They are awkward fitting, but the sound is great if you like your bass. However, shortly after purchasing these headphones, the extendable plastic pieces that adjust the size started to crack and one just snapped entirely in half, making them unwearable. After adjusting them to the appropriate size, the plastic pieces didn't have the bend in them and they broke. This is not something that was my fault, it was a defect in the product. I felt that I should have spent the extra money and invested in a nicer pair of headphones. That is my suggestion to my fellow consumers. Hope this helps!

VThese do leak sound, but if all you're going for is style, these are the right headphones.

I'm not some sort of audiophile, but I still love these headphones. I had a pair of Sony MDR-XD100s before, and they were pretty much equivalent to these headphones in everything except comfort and style (they were way more comfortable, but less stylish). In the end, you really are just paying for the brand, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Skullcandy never fails to shine in terms of looks.

VWhen I had first ordered these headphones, I was thrilled because of how great they looked, and how great the sound was. A month goes by of some less than average usage; they aren't used everyday, mainly within the house, and when I do use them outside, I always use the included baggie and make sure the individual earphones are not extended out. Never dropped them, no harsh contact, etc. So about two days ago when I'm pulling (lightly) apart the headphones to put over my ears, I hear a crack. To my dismay, the extension part of the left headphone had cracked somewhat, with only the center part not having fully cracked. They've been sitting at my desk collecting dust since as I'm afraid to damage them any more from normal use. Also to note, I do extend the headphones nearly all the way out. I did not think of this as much of a problem, as I had hoped the construction of the extending parts would be fine; I was wrong. Eventually I'll work up the nerve to use them again, but for now I just feel a bit ripped off at how easily they became damaged.Overall: Great style and sound for when they weren't damaged, which was about a month's time. Bad construction, which ultimately, if a product like this doesn't last at least nine months to a year, much less at least six months bare minimum of average use, the sound and style cannot make up for how soon mine became damaged. I know customer's usage will vary, and this will not happen to everyone, but I advise purchase at your own risk for these headphones.

VI brought these about a month or two ago. At first I was one happy camper as the sound quality was great - WAY better than my old Sony MDR-V250s to be sure! Before purchase I'd read some of the reviews warning about the weak plastic pillars but just blew them off. Dumb move on my part for lo and behold not two weeks later it happened to me on the right side! It hadn't cracked all the way through yet, mind you, but was clearly headed in that direction. The left side wasn't looking too hot either. I considered returning them, but riding the train home from work I saw a girl with the EXACT SAME model headphones as mine. She'd wrapped duct tape around both the pillars so I just decided to do the same. Didn't really want to go through the hassle of a return, and after all the audio, at least, is first rate...Bottom line...I really can't recommend these. Sure they SOUND good but for the price you pay, the construction should be much much sturdier. Neither my Sony MDR-V250s nor my XD100s have fallen apart like this and I've had both of those for far longer while paying way less!

VI bought these cuz i broke a cheap $10 set and i thought they were really big when i first got them. It was only because i wasn't used to these type of headphone,but that was easily forgotten with how great they sound. They came with a pretty nice little bag with the logo all over it and a sticker!Anyways, the point is the moment i plugged them in i had to reduce the volume on my laptop. I had everything set to the lowest volume and could hear just fine. they feel kinda stiff at the band that goes on top of your head,but i'm careful with my stuff,so it should last.~great sound~muffles a good amount~great for guitar practice~gets a little tiring on the ears,but you can get used to it~great design~be careful with the adjusting band and it'll last you

VFirst of all, all you audiofiles out there are dumb as hell nobody cares if these headphones aren't as good as your 300-400 dollar headphones! And if they break, CHILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Skullcandy has got your back and will replace them...for life...free of charge. As far as sound quaility these headphones are pretty good. I listen to music...A LOT. And I listen to almost every genre, but I mostly listen to John Mayer,Maroon 5,Dave Matthews Band, etc.. And these headphones work excellent. Although they are not listed as sound cancelling they do offer some sound cancelling properties with music playing. As for appereance these could look better I think. They looked good in the picture, but the ears are pretty big, and you can look a little goofy. They do sit on your head good and they will stay there! I warm up for wrestling in these and they stay on good through that. The cord isn't too long and having the cord go to only one ear is nice. BUT you can't wear them around your neck very well. And they don't have swivel cups.Overall I would give these headphones a 4 out of 5. But if you are buying these on amazon I would recommend the Skullcandy Skullcrushers, although they do require a battery I found the sound cancelling properties better. Also they had better overall sound quality. They are much easier to carry around and the bass is much better. Also they have swivel cups.

VComfortable, Good Sound Quality, Would Recommend
p10805
sg5
VI bought these headphones 2 months ago, and so far, I love them! First and foremost, the sound quality is good. The only setback is that the bass is not as strong as I would like, but I prefer a lot of bass, so these would be perfectly fine for the average listener. I listen to pretty much every type of music, and everything sounds great. The design is comfortable, I've worn them for hours on end without any problem. The speakers fit over my ear, unlike other over the head headphones I have tried, and they have a snug fit without that "crushing" feeling some headphones create. Before I bought them, I read many reviews where people commented that the headband had broken, but I have had no issue with this. They have been extremely durable, I have taken them on many trips, and have had no issue. Sound isolation isn't the best, but this is not a huge issue for me. In a loud place, such as on a bus or train, sound isolation is not a problem at all. The only time I have had any issue is in a car or quiet building. Overall, I am very glad I made this purchase, and I am currently looking at buying some lowriders, which would be less bulky to travel with. But these will still get plenty of use, and I got them for a great price compared to some other brands!

VI got these as a christmas gift from my mom and they worked great out of the box. Half a month later the fake leather around the sound-output thing started coming off. I have only used these at home on my laptop for watching videos and music(i have not taken these out side or left these in places they could get damaged). Just a few minutes ago i was putting them on and the plastic piece that slides inside the headphone for adjustments cracked and now they won't work anymore. They lasted two months with minimal use. I'm no expert but there are definitely better ones out there for the price. When they worked everything was awesome. Now they are broken.

VAs you would expect from Skullcandy, the style of these headphones is great. The ear piece is more round and sticks out more than the picture lets on. The design and comfortability is great though. Great for someone who is looking to have a nice pair of headphones to match their style.When it comes to quality.. maybe not so great. I'm used to using Bose quality headphones/ earphones and honestly I'm not so sure these are the ones to try and compete. Now I'm not going to go into saying that these are the worst out there, because they aren't. Sure they get loud enough to enjoy. The bass is OK but don't expect to hear the deep bass described on the website. Everything else is heard pretty well, but it's just not as clear as I think it could/should be. There is no umph. Anyone whose has usedSennheiser Headphones,Bose Headphonesor evenBose headphonesmost likely won't be a fan of these. I'm sure not.For any kid(like most) who haven't been exposed to any of the named, these are a good choice.

p10851

VThese are definitely great headphones, at least in my opinion. They are comfortable, the noise cancellation is great, they look nice, and everything else about them is nice as well. I honestly don't understand why everyone dislikes this brand, their headphones have never broke soon after I got them, as the reason why I've had to buy them over and over again is because I keep losing the earbuds, which is simply my own fault. I use these as DJ headphones (I've just begun DJ'ing, and this is currently all I can afford), which means I'm not sure how they would work outside (if they could be damaged in the rain, for example). I assume that they would work just fine because of their durability overall. The art work is very nice, especially on the over-the-head part. The ears are comfortable, canceling all noise around me. Overall, these are definitely worth the price and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a cheap, but reliable pair of over-the-head headphones.

VI have only had these headphones for a couple of weeks, but they seem pretty good. The bass is pretty loud though. If you listen to rap then you're probably okay. I listen to Hardcore and Pop Punk and I have to mess with the EQ on my iPod so it sounds better. They look amazing though. There should still be a Scalabrine edition...Oh, whatever website they were from took FOREVER to ship. They took over a month just to leave the shop. It also took them over a month to charge my card.

Overall definitely the best buy of headphones I have ever gotten.

VBought these headphones after my pair of skullcandy ear buds went south. Used them for 6 months and was relatively pleased with them. They were comfortable enough to listen for about 1.5 hours, but anytime after that and they would give me a horrendous headache from the pressure of the spring on my head. They sound decent enough for the price, if only a little bass heavy. My biggest complaint is that after 7 months of ownership, the plastic in the size adjuster broke, requiring me to tape it fixed, 2 months later the other side broke. Since wearign these around campus I have seen 2 other people wearing identical headphones, broken in the same spot. I would not buy these again considering I know they will break in the same spot. Nor would I recommend them to a friend.

VUmm, first of all, they look kinda' dorky. I mean, they have a blue skull on each ear piece, so I think it is something that a 5th grader would consider "cool".But, I don't really care about how they look. I am all about utility. Unfortunately, I cannot wear these earphones for more than a few minutes at a time. They are too tight, and they squeeze my head. No -- if you are wondering -- my head is not an air-inflated balloon that is easily squeezed. So, it seems that there is a design flaw inherent in this product, in that the headphones do not mold to my head. And no, I am not a behemoth giant; I am a regular Joe. I don't want to jump to any conclusions, but I do have to wonder if these were even tested in the lab while they were being developed. I've tried for several days, and I've decided to return them to the store for a full refund. Ugh.

VOk first of all the people that say these headphones suck, suck. I would say I am an avid music listener and always have headphones on or in. These have pretty sick sound quality. If you are expecting a lot of bass though you may be a little let down. Now I'm not saying that the bass sucks, but it was a little less than I thought it would be. Also they are a little fragile, but if you just take care of them you'll be fine. Finally, if you are looking for sound cancelling headphones these are probably not what you want. They do cancel the sound alright with music on but you can still hear background noise. Over all these headphones are a great buy for price and I would definately recommend these headphones to everybody!

VI love these headphones. I got my husband the audiophile the Derrick Rose Hesh headphones for Christmas and when they arrived he loved them, but I too loved them so much that I ordered the Paul Frank's for myself, because I hate earbuds. My ears are so small they never stay in. These are great headphones, and I got them even cheaper on Amazon than on Skullcandy. I noticed that there are many reviews that say they hurt after a while, but I'm not having that problem at all. I'm thinking that maybe it depends on your head size, because to me, they're extra comfortable. I wear them mostly for my daily commute into Manhattan by train and their great! I don't blast them, but I can hear my music comfortably as well as stay aware of my surroundings. I get tons of compliments on them too. They're like a fashion acessory - and I do love fashion. The only issue I have is that they don't have the in-line mic. For those who say they hurt I say maybe try another one of the skullcandy line, like maybe the agent or the icon. They're over the head but not as snug as the hesh line. Hope this helps!! Electric Animals, I'm coming for you next!!

VI've been waiting to find a pair of headphones that I liked because I can't wear earbuds (my ear holes are too small...). Anyway, when I saw these, I immediately picked them up because I like Paul Frank and I figured you couldn't really go wrong with Skullcandy, plus the colors were super cheerful and cute.The sound is fine and everything, but I used these to watch a movie on my laptop...and the movie was 2.5 hours...Anyway, halfway through the movie, I noticed that it was really getting uncomfortable. Then towards the end, my head was screaming to take them off because they hurt so bad! I was hoping for the movie to end quickly so I could throw my headphones away! It was something about the way these things fit around your ear or something, plus the pressure from the whole headset was unbearable. But it was just no fun. I noticed other reviews also talked about discomfort too, so I'm not the only one! Don't be fooled by the picture where the padding looks really nice and cushy.I am not one to exaggerate. When I write my reviews, I always try to be as accurate as possible to help others, plus I don't usually take the time to write negative reviews, but I felt these warranted one to save someone else the literal pain. The other downside is that I bought these elsewhere at full price, so I'm sad to see them for a better price here and I can't take it back because I already threw away the packaging... :( I really don't think they should charge this much for these particular headphones. I'm already going on a search for a different pair. I've only used these once. Such a waste. :( I gave it 2 stars because the sound wasn't bad, but on the comfort level, it gets a zero from me.

VI bought these because I was sick of the terrible quality that earbuds give, I wanted something more for home use but it turns out I cant really use these out of home much anyway.The sound is great everything is clear and I was impressed my the quality of the bass for the price! The only problem is that unless you are surronded by quite a bit of noise everyone can hear what you are hearing. I have even been able to use my headphones almost like portable speakers they are so loud off of the ears. So thats a negative but it is the only reason I gave the product 4 stars.They are a lot more lightweight than i expected but i also expected to be more metal details etc, but it was mostly all plastic which gave them a little more of a cheap feel, but hey they are 40$ not 90$ so you get what you pay for.

VSkull Candy Hesh Scattered review
p11007
sg5
VPros:- Good sound quality- Looks really sexy ^_^- They're simply amazing headphones. I'm really satisfied with my purchase.Cons:- All of my skull candy products (3 earphones) have broken within a few months. So I'm hoping this won't happen to these headphones. Unfortunately, people have said they're very fragile and break/won't work easily.. So I'm just putting this up here as a warning. Mine are fine, though.- Very LITTLE sound leak. If you put the sound quite loud in a rather quiet environment, you'll be able to hear your music.But this is not really important to me. It is for most people. So I'm guessing this would be a con. This is probably due to the cheap plasticky sides of the headphones.Overall: I love them and I recommend them to music lovers. :)

VI bought the headphones about a month ago to bring on long bus trips. I treated them well and was only able to use them a couple times. One morning, I while I was adjusting them, thep plastic snapped. Under further investigation, I found the plastic used is very cheap and thin, and once you break it, absolutley NOTHING will fix it. I would suggest these headphones, because the sound quality is great and they're comfortable, but it's kinda hard when I'm back now to my crappy regular apple headphones. Skullcandy is too over rated.

VThe Best For The Price
p11065
sg5
VI bought these headphones a while ago and I love them. I kept looking at the Beats By Dr. Dre but the price tag was just too high for my liking. For the price of these headphones you get a lot. The sound is very nice. I have listened to a wide range of music and they can handle most of it. The highs are a little muddy but if you get past that everything else is perfect. The headphones in my opinion are very comfortable. I listen to music for long periods of time with them and I do not get the headache that occurs with in-ear headphones. They seem very durable and they have lasted me through everything. I have taken them on a couple of trips around the world and they are perfect for the plane. Overall: when you get these headphones you can expect to be sucked into the music world and they look stylish. They were a great buy. Hope this helped.

VThese headphones are great! They are a great quality for the price, especially if you don't want to spend $100 on a really good pair. Sparkle Motion might be a little deceiving for the design (I thought it was a graphic that was glittery or something but it's a flat color vs metallic or glittery, but that's alright). Cord is a good length, and I like how it's wrapped in cloth material. Good choice for headphones.

VVery good, with a few trivial problems
p11088
sg5
VBasically, these headphones are 100% worth the money you'll be spending for them. They look pretty good, and they get pretty loud so even if you feel weird about having them on your head you can hang them over your neck and you can still hear the music- plus it's really cool.First things first, these headphones are not THAT sturdy. They are durable enough so that if you drop them or maybe even throw them on the ground, they won't break but be careful where you store it because they have been known to snap. The headphones are mostly plastic and there are a lot of moving/swiveling parts. A little bit of TLC will prevent these headphones from breaking- plus it comes with a cool little bag, a sticker, and a spray paint stencil.Next, these things are pretty tight. If it's your first time getting skullcandys or you're upgrading from earbuds/cheap headphones, these things have noise cancelling foam rings, and they snap onto your ears pretty tight. This is good and bad- It's good because it does cancel out some of the noise... When I'm listening to my music on normal volume I can't hear anyone unless they're shouting into my ear, but its bad because it can get uncomfortable. It's the type of thing you have to get used to. When I first put them on I was like "Darn, this is really tight" but after a few days I got used to it and now they're pretty comfortable. It also varies from person to person as some of my friends say that they are really tight and others say they're perfectly comfortable. Something else to keep in mind, they don't fold up like other skullcandys or other headphones for easy storage... They stay in the headphone shapeThose are the two main cons about this product, but it still gets 4.5/5 stars because the sound quality is aboslutely amazing. I listen to rock, pop rock, punk rock, alternative, metal, and dubstep (techno but VERY heavy on the bass) and this headphone can easily take any of these. One of my favorite things to do is to close my eyes, set my EQ to bass booster, and listen to the skullcandy doing work. It sounds absolutely amazing and the headphones handle the heavy bass extremely well. I brought these headphones to school and people were trying them out and they were mostly all impressed at the quality of the music.All in all, if you're looking for an afforadble upgrade to your cheapo headphones or annoying earbuds, this is a great deal. With only trivial problems and amazing sound quality, what more could you ask for from a pair of $35 headphones?

VI was actually inspired to get these headphones after purchasing a pair of Skullcandy Skullcrushers.  Those were a quality purchase and these headphones didn't disappoint either.  There isn't a person I give these to that doesn't believe they are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent.  One unique attribute of these headphones is that the audio cord is wrapped in nylon instead of rubber.  They come with a nice carrying bag for travel and the every component of the headphones is sturdy.  The designs on the earphones are attractive as well.These headphones are definitely a deal for the money and I can see myself buying many more pairs in the future.

The fact that these things feel like they are going to burst into flames the second you touch them due to the poor build quality. They also make the person wearing them look like a complete ass. My point being that many many MANY other HI-FI options exist in the same price point, and if you spend a little more*and you will get what you pay for* you will be blown away that you ever considered buying these.Sony MRD-XB500-700 being one, and the Koss PRO DJ100 being another that simply annihilates these.

VNice Looking, but Completely Average Quality
p11122
sg5
VThese Paul Frank inspired Skull Candy brand full ear headphones offer a cute look for fans of the artist but overall they should not expect any sort of significant quality in terms of both sturdiness and sound. The speakers wrap around the ear comfortably, and while they do feel sturdy enough, these obviously aren't the type of headphones that should be taken outside in the rain or dropped on the floor too often. The wire is actually a good highlight as it is wrapped in a soft yarn-like material and not your typical rubber, therefore it feels more like a shoelace and not so much a wire. This ensures that the wire will never become tangled or stuck in any sort of annoying twirls especially if you're the type that likes to wrap up wires when the item is not in use. Therefore, just take care of these physically as they may tend to scratch easily.Now in the area that matters - sound quality. Unfortunately, most of my rating was lower simply because of this. The headphones emit whatever sound you put them through, but for the most part things just sound too average and flat. There is no significant bass or overall good balance. The bandwidth is not Bose or Westone quality, so don't expect to be blown away. I mean, even in the least. Plus right out of the package, I noticed that with some songs, if the volume was even significantly louder than average, the headphones would make this small rattling and distortion type of sound, as if the speakers weren't strong enough to handle a higher than average volume. This is the biggest disappointment with these headphones. One would think that with speakers this big these phones would be strong enough to handle a good amount of bass without any distortion whatsoever. Then again, Skull Candy has always been notorious for their style of substance, and these headphones are unfortunately no exception.These are a good idea for a collector's item if you are buying them for a fan of the Paul Frank artist, but if you want to do your music justice, spend a little more on a quality brand, like Sennheiser, Bose, Westone, Sony, Phillips, etc. (Actually, some of these other brand names would probably offer BETTER sound quality headphones for a cheaper price).In the end, being a big fan of music, I simply cannot recommend these, or any other Skull Candy product.

VI am posting this here because Skullcandy won't let me post a NEGATIVE review on their site! I bought these headphones thinking 1) they're Skullcandy and 2) they are $50+, so they must be good. I was totally wrong! The headphones all around feel cheap! From the 'Made in China' label on the plastic to the other material used, they were NOT comfortable. The headphones were circular so they did not fit my ears. They also let out wayyy to much sound when I had them on. In other words, if you don't want to have people hear the music you are listening to, the volume must be extremely low.Do yourself a favor and avoid these!

VThese headphones are excellent! I bought them at Best-Buy for $49.99, and, for the price, everything about them is great! The sound clarity is superb, and the bass is perfect. It is not over-powering like the Skullcrushers, or many other, more expensive, headphones. And these headphones actually grow softer with use.  When I first bought them, I thought that the padding was a little hard, but after owning them for 2-3 months, I must say they beat my old Sony MDR-NC7 headphones in terms of sound quality. Definitely one of the top choices for a pair of headphones under $100. I definitely recommended them!

VI got this headphones for engineering purposes because they are simple, NOT biased and NOT EQ'ed for studio monitoring. Listening to music though this guys is pretty awesome to be honest, bass in punchy, mids are excellent, and treble is crisp. I use an Apogee DUET for recordings, and having this headphones plugged into the headphone jack of the Apogee makes the sound much cleaner and clear. I listened to all the genres I could possibly think off, and they all sound amazing with this headphones.This might not be Beats by Dr.Dre, but for the price you got yourself some excellent monitoring headphones. If you are into DEEP bass or DEEP hip-hop beats... I recommend the Skullcrushers by Skullcandy (unless you want to drop some major coin on major studio headphones).

p11157
sg5
VConsidering I bought these headphones for $50, the sound quality is very good.  I also own a pair of $120 Able Planet NC Headphones and of course there is a significant difference in sound quality.  Do not buy these if you are looking for a pair of traveling headphones as they do not assist in reducing the low humming of voices or car engines.  However, they are good headphones with decent enough quality to play a wide range of music.  And I would agree with other reviews... I have never heard a non-powered headphone pair sound this LOUD when simply plugged into my iPod.I strongly recommend these headphones to anyone on a budget who is looking for a decent pair of comfortable, over the ear headphones.  Personally, I use them when I play the drums.  They cancel out enough of the noise from the drums and they're loud enough to still hear what you're playing (without spending over $300 on Studio headphones).

VI got these for my daughter's 14th birthday and they have been a huge hit. She was using the cheap iPhone earbuds that Apple provides and even tried some of the noise isolating earbuds (cheap ones).  She kept losing and/or breaking earbuds or the rubber pieces that actually seal them into your ears.  My daughter is really into fashion.  So, when she saw the Paul Frank monkey headphones, she wanted them.  She's not really concerned about sound quality or even how sturdy they are.  But, I was.  After reading several reviews, I was a little concerned about how sturdiness.  After having had them for a week, the quality seems to be decent.  They aren't exactly built like a Mack truck.  But, I think if cared for properly they will hold up.  The cord seems to be pretty decent quality.  The sound is really good.  Definitely as good as I would expect for the money paid.  One knock on them is the plastic used for the cushions on the cans doesn't breathe at all.  So, your ears can get very hot and sweaty very quickly in these.  The look is very cartoonish.  But, it's perfect for a teenager or a pre-teen. She gets lots of compliments on them.  Overall, we are very happy with our purchase.

VSkullcandy gives you the best BANG for your BUCK!
p11198
sg5
VSkullcandy found their niche when they ventured off into their versions of designer headphones. Who would of thought to take such a simple product and fuse it with designs that probably will soon become (if not already) the JORDAN of headphones.I have purchased two Skullcandy headphones for my nephews, both HESH's, and my nephews absolutely love them! The great feature about these particular Celtic KG Hesh DJ Headphone's vs the HESH Paul Frank Blacks is that they have a mic switch that allows the user to mute the sound and hear what a person is saying without having to take the headphones off. (Which is not on the first pair of Skullcandy headphones that I purchased so that nephew is not too happy with his lil bro having an extra feature he doesn't have.)However, the important fact is the SOUND. Both Skullcandy headphones produce amazing quality for the money. The Skullcandy headphones are perfectly unmatched in this category and excellent for anything you need to listen to on a regular basis. From an iTouch or any mp3 player to the XBOX or a PS3; Skullcandy provides various models for you to bang out with and is truly the choice of the ear.COPYRIGHT TSTREETZ 2010

VI just got these awesome headphones today! They have amazing sound quality! It's like listening to a speaker when the volume is full blast and they are on a desk. I'm in college and really need headphones to block out sound as much as cheaply possible for studying. I have used them only for a few hours, but love everything! Everyone else loves the cute design! Despite that, my favorite aspect is the cord. Instead of being covered in some latex plastic stuff like most headphones, these are a braided cloth cord decreasing shock risk and increasing the longevity! I was surprised to see that these come with a satin carrying case as well. I give it 4/5 because I hadn't had them for very long. But I would Definitely suggest buying!Carmanita RavenFreshman at Converse College

VI Love These Headphones
p11210
sg5
VI'm used to using the separate headphones where you rotate this awkward piece of plastic behind your ear because those are cheap, but I decided to buckle down and get some nice over-the-ear headphones because the original ones I'm referring to never seem close enough to my ears. I love the style and color; I feel like Skullycandy is all about expression. I read the reviews before my purchase and I took note that these leak sound (which is unusual considering the style), but I truly don't mind. I usually only wear headphones when I'm walking outside or at home, not in public places anyway. This product also comes with a pouch which is really neat; I just store these and my iPod in there so I always know where they are. I also love how the cord doesn't get tangled and ruined like most headphones! Whatever material they used for the cord is ingenious.

p11234

VThe first pair of these I bought fit comfortably. The sound quality was pretty good, but although the cups fit over my entire ear, they let in more outside noise than I wanted them to (used on my daily ferry/bus/street commute). Returned the first pair when edge of the vinyl ear pad cover started to come out from under the hard plastic cover on one side after less than a month (exchanged for a new set). When the second pair started to do the same thing, I took them back too - the clerk was unsurprised, indicated they got a lot of that with the Skullcandy headphones. Didn't give them a third strike, decided to try another brand instead.

I enjoy when I am on the subway and someone else is dancing and singing along to the music I'm listening to in my headphone. I also get a lot of compliments on my headphones alone.  Great look and a great buy. The only thing that bother me about the headphone was the material that it is made out of.  One week after I got them, the blue cover to the speakers came apart. Haven't yet tried to figure out a way to fix it but overall, the product is a great buy if you can keep it from falling apart.

VThis is my second pair of Skullcandy Hesh Headphones. The last pair suffered from cheap construction as well as this one does, but for $50, you can't beat the sound, and the comfort. This aren't noise canceling headphones, they amplify, if you listen loud enough, others can hear what you're listening to. Other than that, my second pair, will see if they last six months, good computer mixer sound as well.

VWhen I was considering buying these headphones, I was reading a lot of reviews on them that made me not want to buy them. People were saying they were the crappiest headphones ever & that they're a waste of money. Truthfully, these people are just plain wrong. They're expecting way too much out of $50 headphones. I think that these are pretty beast for $50 headphones. They sound amazing & the bass is awesome as well but not so overpowering that it distorts the sound. They also do an awesome job of blocking out surrounding noises. I know there are a lot of people who say these hurt your ears after wearing them for too long, don't worry about that too much. Just a simple readjustment will stop that from happening. The only thing that's a bad thing is that they do leak some sound. But that's not that big of a deal for me so to me, this product is flawless. Another thing: everyone is saying that these are made out of some cheap crappy material that breaks easily. Once again, wrong. If you don't yank them off your head & actually make an effort to take care of them, they should last a while. & even if they do break, Skullcandy will either replace it at no charge or replace it for 50% depending on what happened. So if you're not planning on buying these because of all those reviews that say this product sucks, you should just go ahead and buy them. You'd be surprised at how amazing they are & how all those reviews were just a bunch of bs. These headphones are just so amazing. My very first pair & I couldn't ask for anything better for such a cheap price. Oh yeah, they're also stylish as well (;

VI bought these because of reputation.  I wanted a non-earbud type headphone to use while I worked in the office.  I found that these headphones..1) Leak a lot of sound.  Expect to keep them turned down pretty far if you are in a quiet office setting.2) They squeeze your head far to tightly.  After an hour or two of wearing, I get a headache.  And before you even say it, I have adjusting them.  I've even tried wearing them at max adjustment till they no longer touched my scalp at all.3) Brittle.  Is there any metal in these headphones?  The last straw was the arm snapping on them.  Upon inspection the cross section of arm is a very thin layer of plastic.  If you are going to make a device you put on & off your head day in & out.. at least make it robust?!  I've probably gotten less than 50 uses of these.

p11307

VI really like these headphones, even though I just got them today. I picked Skullcandy for their reputation, and I wanted a solid pair of over the ear headphones with good bass and sound quality for $50 or below, and this is what I decided on. I'm really glad I picked these! They're pretty cool looking and the sound quality is awesome, lots of bass but not so much that it's too overpowering. They fit well on my ears, though they might hurt if your ears are either really sensitive or abnormally large, I guess. They seem pretty heavy duty for the most part, but even if they don't hold up (Again, I just got them), be aware that Skullcandy has a really awesome warranty where they'll replace them if they fail randomly and they will reimburse you for half of a new pair if you break them by accident, no matter how long you've had them. That alone is enough to make them worth the price, as you will never have to pay full price for another pair. Just be sure to write down the date you bought them and you're golden. If you are on the fence about these, go for it.

VBeing skullcandy, I didn't hesitate purchasing these at retail price (49.99). My old over the ear skullcandy headphones were incredibly loud and sounded great.I'm not going on skullcandy by brand anymore. First set failed in a few days and I had to go through a huge hassle exchanging them since I couldn't outright return them.These are extremely uncomfortable, especially after wearing them for long periods, and for the brand and even at the price they're simply NOT loud enough. The sound quality and bass is superior but the uncomfortable ear padding is complemented by painful pressure from the sound I don't usually get at such low volumes.I've been sticking with my $5 clearance Sony mega-bass ear buds until I can find a replacement for these massively disappointing headphones.

The sound quality is great and they look cool!  The only little thing is they don't fit over the ears that well (my ears are average) which can be a little uncomfortable after wearing them for a while but it's not major at all.  Overall a great product I definitely recommend these!Update:Ive had these for a few months now and they still work great.  Although one of the side adjusters recently broke.  I didn't drop them or anything I was simply adjusting them when it cracked.  I was able to fix it with some duct tape and some plastic to act as a splint.  If you get these just be careful with use the plastic on the adjusters isn't that strong.

VI was so excited for these headphones! While the noise canceling feature worked effortlessly, the Bluetooth connectivity was awful. At first i thought it might just be my phone but actually Bluetooth worked for every other electronic I have. But the headphones would stay connected for one song and then if I tried to change it to a different song it would automatically disconnect. Then trying to get it to connect again failed each time. Not sure if I just received a faulty headphone but to spend $300 for these I expected so much more.

p11453

VGot these headphones on sale on Black Friday for $100 off. I had the original post-Monster Beats Studios and I also have the Bose QC-15s. I travel often. In my experience, Bose noise cancellation on a plane is far superior. That said, this generation of Beats has done a nice job at closing that gap. The overall sound is better than the previous Studios and more balanced. I prefer them for everyday use over my Bose. I also found the I had an equal overall experience in a plane with my Bose if I based my cost benefit of these headphones on improved sound and noise cancellation. I gave my Bose to a family member and now use these Beats Studio Wireless exclusively as my only travel/everyday headphones going forward.The rechargeable battery has not an issue for me on long haul flights. The feature is also saving me money on AAA batteries. I recharge them every night. I do wish they auto shutoff if they weren't receiving a signal while on Bluetooth mode, or added the ability to work with out a charge and no noise cancellation.Bought and directly fulfilled from Amazon. Received a 100% genuine, non-counterfeit product.

VExcellent sound quality, listen to a variety of music and it all sounds great, some complain of too much bass but with different settings for different types of music on my iphone I didn't have that problem, sound cancelling seems pretty good so far, have used them on my riding mower and the noise level of the motor is greatly reduced. Can't wait to try them on a plane. Fit, finish and overall quality is great. I would recommend this product.Pros: Sound excellent, comfortable, easy to setup and use.Cons: Expensive, can get a bit warm on the ears on a hot day, wish Crutchfield offered the flat black ones, i put a carbon fiber look skin on mine to keep it from getting covered in finger prints,

VMy son bought these with his Christmas money and he loves them. His mother also loves them, so that might cost me more money in the long run. We will see. I haven't been able to wear them more than once since he keeps them with him all of the time, but they did sound great. Love the bass levels in them. Nice and clear. Bluetooth cuts in and out randomly (hence the 4 stars and not 5), but overall not a major issue.

Like disconnecting after each song so you have to connect your charger to a Mac or windows 7 or better and update the firmware from the beats website which is pretty easy. Over all I have no complaints

As someone that listens to all types of music from classical to rap, to rock, these pass the test on all genres.Comfort: Little stiff at first, but that will lessen with wear. The padding on the ear, and fit is is ideal.*as others have mentioned make sure you go to the Beats site and down load the latest firmware as it will update the Bluetooth and fix the connectivity issue*

I only seem to get great quality noise out on the right ear.If you want to invest I suggest this brand, but I would go in the store and buy them. Not online.

Vthese headphones are my favorite pair of headphones that I own. They are very stylish. I love the Bluetooth connectivity. The only problem with the Bluetooth is that sometimes when it is your pocket and you turn your head away from the phone, the connection drops for like half a second. But other than that they are amazing.

VBeats vs Bose
p11770
sg5
VThey're fine. Seems the wireless headphones are all in the same price range and these serve their purpose for me. I tested both the Bose Soundlink Wireless and these and here's what I found:BEATS work better with an iPhone than a Macbook. DOES NOT CONNECT WELL TO A MACBOOK!!! Not that they won't work with a Mac but they tend to prefer to connect automatically to an iPhone OVER a Mac over bluetooth and it's kind of a pain to have them connect to my MacBook Pro. Not a huge issue, just pretty annoying.BOSE I found connected better to my Macbook. Or iPhone. Was strong with both and connecting was easy breezy. I also think BOSE had a longer range, but I didn't test it to be sure, but it does seem that BEATS drops the connection pretty fast.BEATS is a bit better for bass sounds, and Bose has more depth / range of sounds.My tip? If you're willing, go to an Apple Store and buy both and test both out, playing the identical songs on two different devices and see which sounds better to you. Personally I stuck with Beats mainly because I use these for electronic music and the BEATS had the EDM range I was looking for. But BOSE had a different range. Plus I just liked the look of the BEATS more. But honestly, each are fine. I just stuck with this one because I liked the colors.

VGreat sound. Nice and deep
p11794
sg5
VPros:Great sound.  Nice and deep.  Bass is very good.Not too much like the Skullcandy Crushers.The protein leather on the earpads are very nice and soft.Cons:Not the most comfortable.Ears get hot because they did not leave enough space left between the ear and the leather.The ears cannot breathe and gets hot pretty quickly.The ear pads are very soft and cushy and so it is still more comfortable that the ATH M50X.The wireless convenience is what  you are paying the premium price over the ATH M50X though.The build quality does not inspire confidence.  It still has a plastic rattling sound from the folding joints.A $300 headphones should have a much better quality than this.  This is nowhere close to how well ATH MT50x feels in your hands.The active noise cancellation is very muted.  It probably adds around 25% in addition to the passive ones you get from covered earcups.As opposed to like 85% you would get from the Bose QC25.If Bose made the QC25 wireless, you might still get this becuase most likely Bose would price that at something ridiculous like $450.Bose's wireless headphones do not have Active Noise Cancellation yet for some unknown reason.=====================Update:  The Bluetooth connection kept dropping off with my iPhone6 plus.Thanks to other reviewers on Amazon I found out that there was a firmware update released by Beats to address this.You have to go to the website, download the sofware and connect your headphones to update the firmware.After a restart and reconnect with my phone, it was fixed!

VTheses headphones came as a complete surprise to me the first time I checked them out. I knew I had to buy them right away. The bass is so much better than the older Beats headphones. The earcups are extremely comfortable for long sessions. The bluetooth connectivity issues have been resolved as well. Battery life is decent enough to last at least 10-12 hours. The only downside would be the weight of these headphones.

VWas worried that I'd have some connectivity issue since I'm not an Apple user. I have a Dell XPS 13 (2015) and Note 4 and haven't had any issues at all. Connecting to my Note 4 via bluetooth was simple. Not a problem whatsoever. Getting the headphones to connect to my Dell XPS 13 was a little frustrating at first and after about an hour of frustration I realized I hadn't ran the most recent updates for my computer yet. After running the update everything connected perfectly and haven't had an issue yet.I know Beats aren't necessarily the best sounding headphones but I love them. The fact they are wireless is perfect. The battery life is pretty good. I charge them about every 4 days and use them fairly often throughout the day.The thing about these Beats headphones is that they are extremely comfortable.

VPlain and simple.1. They weren't meant to last and break just like any other apple product (probably so you'll buy more or whatever).2. They aren't worth the cost3. They're just pretty to look at and use as an accessory The longest I managed to go without using/replacing a warranty for these headphones is 6 months. The bluetooth sucks. Constantly disconnecting from my phone and tablet (might have something to do with them being Android phone and tablets). These headphones work nice enough but not well enough for the amount asked.  I don't suggest anyone buy these headphones. This item is incredibly overhyped. Were it around $100 to $150 I'd probably understand people buying them.

VThe sound quality is great!  The biggest reason these where bought is for the noise canceling feature.  They are NOT noise canceling.  They only muffle out sound.  You can hear all outside sound, which is very disappointing given the extreme cost of this product.  We thought our first pair which was bought at Christmas was defective in some way and sent them back for a replacement pair.  Second pair that was received was exactly the same.  I feel the item description should be changed.

VI rode the fence trying to decided if I needed these with all the other headsets I already had. Well, I am certainly glad I dropped the hammer on these. First I should explain how I listen to headphones. I use an app called EQu on all my apple devices. This is an equalizer which enables me to mold the music. I don't like a headset dictating to me what my music is going to sound like. The headphones provide the canvas on which the music is painted and the equalizer decides the intensity of the color painted on that canvas.These headphones are some of the best I have yet used for the way I listen. There is and incredible latitude of frequency and it all produces clear sound. The accuracy of that sound is always debatable but it has to be there. I can adjust my listening to what is playing and not have to worry about the capability of the headset to handle it. This is really the first time I have had this kind of listening freedom.They fit a little tight but that will probably loosen up or I will get used to it. The finish is well done and very classy. I got the flat black ones.You adjust them on the surface of the left ear cup.  It is all vary intuitive. Push up on the upper portion and the volume goes up. Press down on the lower portion and the volume goes down. Front and back changes your selection. Tap the center for hold again and it plays. Tap the cup when you get a call and it answers it. Tap again and it hangs up.These are highly rated, highly priced headphones. If you are seriously going to listen to your music you have a lot to choose from at this level. It is important to decide how you listen. If you want good base and good highs these are great. If you use EQ these are excellent.

p11949
sg5
VI bought these to use at my gym, 24 Hour Fitness, where, to my dismay, the company has recently initiated a highly-irritating, advertising campaign on their TV monitors that includes playing insipid pop songs at high volume. These headphones do the trick. They completely eliminate the gym "music" and my music sounds great through them. They fit very snugly -- I wear them not only on the gym floor but also while racewalking & running on the gym track and they never budge.At first, I was a little bemused by the control system, fumbling around getting them up and running on bluetooth with my iPod Nano. Finally, I realized that when you turn them on, it takes a second for that to happen and the tone to tell you that it has. I had been double-tapping the button, erroneously turning them on but then back off. Now I'm fine with that. Initial bluetooth connection is easy and the headphones automatically connect with the last bluetooth device you used them with, so now I just turn on the Nano, then the headphones, and music is playing. Controlling pause / play / fast-forward via the headphones works fine, as long as I remember how many quick pushes on the button does what. Not really intuitive, but maybe that's just me.Can't speak to durability as I have only had them a few weeks but at this point I highly recommend them, at least for gym and home use. I don't think they would be appropriate for outdoor running any distance, where you really build up a sweat, as they fit tight all around your ears, thereby encouraging sweating and then would become a reservoir for it. So, if you are a heavy sweat person, maybe look for something else for workouts. I get mine only a tiny bit sweaty working out in the gym and I just wipe them with a slightly damp paper towel.Seems to me at this point that my iPod, on bluetooth, uses battery much faster than the headphones. Last time I recharged the Nano, the headphones were only about a quarter way down, according to the indicator lights.

VJust a day after the delivery, these headphones kept on disconnecting from my iphone. I tried to download the updater but it kept on saying that it is getting interrupted. One good thing out of all of this though, apple care really helped me and are now gonna replace the beats. So, if you have any issues with connection , be sure to update it (didnt work in my case though).

VBest Christmas Gift Award goes to...ME!
p11991
sg5
VI usually don't venture into the electronics department, when considering a gift for my husband, because he already has everything, and he is very picky!  But, just one week before Christmas, I asked him what he thought about the beats headphones, and to my amazement, he didn't know much about them.  I didn't know much either, so I began my research, reading reviews and watching videos.  Since he loves everything Bluetooth, I settled on this model in black, and Amazon Prime got it to me just in time for Christmas.  Well, my husband loves these headphones!  Every few days, he tells me of a new discovery.  For instance, he is impressed by the clarity, whether he is talking on the phone or listening to music. He loves how well the noise cancelling feature works, and that they are so comfortable to wear, he could easily fall asleep with them.  These are great headphones, and the perfect companion for his IPad and IPhone.

VI bought these headphones about six months ago and I keep them at my work (a desk job).I have two cracks right above the ear pieces (one on each side of the headphones). One side's is larger than the others. The plastic is so low quality on these headphones that they crack just from putting them on and taking them off of your head. I think I might have accidentally "dropped" them 1 1/2 - 2 feet onto the ground (from my chair) one or two times. Either way, I watched the cracks start from the tiny stress marks on the headphones to full-on cracks just from every day use.P.S. I tried sending them back into Apple and get them fixed under the warranty. Apple claimed that the damage to my headphones isn't accidental and that they won't repair them under the warranty.

p12019
sg5
VThese are actually really good headphones, but there are a few things you must understand before buying them.1. Audiophiles trash the hell out of beats, but what they don't understand is that they are meant for/marketed towards a totally different audience, and serve a completely different purpose than actual studio headphones. These headphones are meant for the power music listener/media consumer who enjoys a very full bodied sound to their content, not a sound engineer who is spending their time analyzing and tweaking sound frequencies in a digital audio file. These headphones are not "precise" at all... but understand that precision doesn't always equal a pleasurable listening experience. In fact, to the average joe, highly precise studio headphones will sound boring, and often times dull. Beats products provide a very rich and "bass-y" listening experience, which gives your music a sense of warmth and depth. This is done by tweaking the EQ frequencies, but they sound great nonetheless. Now, i agree that the name "studio" is extremely misleading, as these are NOT studio headphones. But i guess Beats' marketing department feels different.2. THEY ARE VERY OVERPRICED FOR WHAT THEY ARE. Truth be told, there are headphones out there for less than half the price that will give you the same/better listening experience; but understand that thats not what you are paying for when you buy beats! Beats has spent countless hours/money on marketing their products, and they have very successfully built and maintained a brand image like very few companies before them have ever been able to do. You are paying a premium because it is considered a privilege by society to be seen wearing beats, and it makes you the "cooler" person in the room. Its a fashion statement; much like a Louis Vuitton purse or a A&F; T-shirt. These headphones are not worth $380, i would even venture to say that they are not worth $280, but if you want that "beats image", thats what you are going to pay for.

VSolid Bluetooth Headphones!!!
p12030
sg5
VI really like these headphones, I listened to them first at a best buy and though I liked them then I didn't feel they were worth 379.99 after all they are made of pretty much plastic!,  When I seen them on amazon for 264.99 which imo is a little more reasonable for what you get it was a no brainer!, the bluetooth is great I dont notice any significant sound quality difference between wired and bluetooth, the battery life is great and the sound is what you would expect from beats, also the noise cancellation is great, it doesn't cancel everything but Its enough that if you are listening to music the background noise will go unnoticed...... Overall Im satisfied..... My only gripe is for a headphone that is advertised at 379.99 retail, I would think they would make them with a better quality material to give them a more premium feel.....

VUPDATE:So after do a little research I found out if you have a computer (yes an actual computer and not a tablet) you can actually hook up your headphones to your computer via USB and download the Beats Updater and update to the newest firmware and it should fix the issue.  In the Beats instructions they mention nothing of this and who would have thought you would ever need to update your headphones.  At any rate, the headphones are now staying connected and now I would recommend these for people to buy even with the pricy price tag.https://www.beatsbydre.com/support/how-to/firmware-updates-beats-updater.htmlOriginal Review:I wish there was a star less than one.  I would save your money.  These headphone are pretty expense and for that they should work.  The wireless is disconnecting from my iPhone non-stop.  I went on the Beats webpage to trouble shoot and they said simply just to reset the headphones.  Well that is all good, but you have to do it all the time.  I can't believe Apple would even sell this product since it doesn't work well with their products.  For almost $400 these headphone should at the very least be able to stay connected to your device.  I was actually surprised by some of the high reviews.  I'm guessing people spent a ton of money on the headphones and were too embarrassed to say they were crap, much like the people who buy Dyson vacuum cleaners.  Save your money!!

VI have had beats headphones, but for some reason the ones I purchase from Amazon has been quite the disappointment. The reason for buying the wireless headphones was to be able to use the headphones via bluetooth, however, after pairing the headphones it would just disconnect and I could not connect it back unless I turn off and turn on the headphones which is annoying to do every five minutes.

p12059

VI was initially very happy with these headphones. One of my friends got a pair first, let's call him friend A. Followed by me. Then another friend, let's call him friend B. All within a week or so. I say this to make it clear that my issues aren't isolated. I want to give one other piece of information. We all use them similarly. At work in an office 9/10.The sound is very impressive as is the noise cancellation. In those two respects. In my opinion these headphones were and are still near perfect. After 2 years. The batteries still hold a great charge. With typical use you can go days without charging them.Now for the issues. Within the first 11 months, they were great. Then one of the parts where the headphone folds with the studio logo on friend A headphone just shattered. At that point they looked like a pair of nunchucks. While not as extensive, something similar happened with friend B and his were not longer able to fold.The cover for the cushion on my Ear pads began to separate shortly after exposing the foam. I then had a similar issue as the friends above where my headphones don't fold as they should.At the time these headphones were $300 with maybe $10 off here or there. The expectation was that these would be headphones that last a long time. It's definitely not the case.Within the first year of warranty. These headphones have been great. Beyond that they deteriorate rapidly. I can't in my right mind recommend them.We did order some replacement parts to give them a bit more life, but for the price the build quality is seriously lacking.

p12070

VThese headphones sound great, period. I really wanted to get them to work for me. If your anything like me when you can't get your headphones connected it drive you crazy. I spend ten solid days with these and had enough aggregation that I decided to actually write a review. Here we go....Got these on Christmas from my wife, connected them that night and listened to some jams while coloring in my new adult coloring book....perfect combo, I know. Everything was going smoothly until the next morning. I woke up with the urge to toss on the headphones to take the dog out and walk around the house getting things put together....wouldn't connect. Turned the headphones on and off, bluetooth on and off, even went to my devices (iphone) and clicked connect/disconnect. I ended up having to forget the device, then connect them again....twice. Finally I got it working and by that time my wife could see the frustration was building. The same thing happened several other times during our short relationship.That being said, I wear bluetooth headphones for about 12 hours/day while I'm working and I know how to connect a pair of headphones, it wasn't user error. I rely on my headphones for my job, I don't want to waste time getting them connected multiple times throughout the day. If I'm not listening to some jams during the day I'd go crazy!The last straw was when this happened two days in a row, the EXACT same problem.Fast forward a couple days after the initial connection issue, maybe day 5 and 6. I'm pumped about trying these things out on the treadmill so I get on and start running. The zone is perfect, great pace, great bass..."started from the bottom now we here"......that's all you can think about. Songs over, I'm more than a mile in and don't even remember what happened. Time for some 2Pac, wait where is the music?? No sounds, NOTHING. I could hear it coming on, that different silent pitch you hear, but no music at all. Force closed my apps, turned headphones on/off, bluetooth on/off, everything, hard reset on the phone.....all while running....nothing worked. I had to listen to the music on my phone speakers the rest of the run. This happened two days in a row.I wanted to love these, I really did. I had wanted a pair for a very long time and wouldn't ever buy them for fear I wouldn't like them. I'm perfectly happy with the LG 730's...they've lasted me over a year and have great sound quality for what I use them for. I would imagine these would get 5 stars from me had I wanted a headphone that I plugged in.I'm not proofreading this.

VI purchased these headphones from Amazon and have been a loyal Beats owner in the past.  In fact I had the old original studios so I was excited to get the newer ones, especially being wireless.  When I first put them on they sounded okay (using Galaxy S5).  I really had to turn the volume up pretty high on the device for them to output adequate sound.  A few days later I took the headphones to work and after about an hour of listening they started to hurt the top of my head.  The band used is a little thicker and is made of this rubbery material.  I thought to myself as much as I love the looks and the wireless feature of this headphone I can't wear something that is going to hurt my head.  Because of this discomfort, I decided to return my headphones and get the Bose QC25.  The Bose QC25 are lighter and more comfortable after longer use and also have better noise cancelling.  Before I shipped these headphones back I wanted to test the difference of sound quality between my Galaxy S5 and my iPad Air.  Like stated earlier, the sound output from my Galaxy just was not what I had experienced with Beats in the past.  However, when paired with my iPad the sound quality was magnificent.  There was a huge difference.  I am unsure of what is causing this issue, but it is something to be aware of.

VThe sound is very clear and they sound great i was impressed at first BUT they do distort sometimes when you turn them up which is a bit disappointing, besides that these are worth the $265 not only because of sound but these days you are considered "cool" just for being seen with them. One interesting thing that i noticed is that they sound EVEN BETTER through bluetooth than the wired connection which is a pleasant surprise. Only thing in question for me will be how long they will last because I've only had them for a month. Had a small issue with connection dropping to my macbook and iPhone 6 when i first used the headphones then i realized that you can update the software on the headphones and the connection hasn't dropped since. There are cheaper headphones that sound just as good or better BUT they aren't BEATS so of coarse u get no cool points for owning them so these do good across the board.

p12092
sg5
VFirst Impression:I have an original Beatbox by Dre that I absolutely love and expected the performance of the Beatbox to translate over to the Beats Studio 2.0, especially since the Studio is a much newer product. Boy was I wrong. My first impression when I put these headphones on and turned them on was, these must be defective. The best way to explain the noise produced by the "active noise cancellation," (keep in mind I was in a silent room using the headphones) is to imagine a scene from an old western movie where the wind is blowing really hard and making a whistling noise. It's not just a faint noise, but an awful whistling noise that made me want to take the headphones off immediately before I developed a headache.Sound Quality:You know the plastic headphones with the circular foam on them they try to sell on the airplane? Those blow the Beats Studio 2.0 out of the water! The whistling and white noise from the "active noise cancellation" distorts the music even more than it already is. The noise cancellation slightly dampens the surrounding noise. As I type this I have the headphones on and turned to about medium volume. I can still here some guys lead pencil he is writing with and can here him turn the page of his book. I am sitting about 20 feet away from this guy. I tried to give these headphones the benefit of the doubt, but when I played some Dr. Dre through them I almost fell out of my chair in disbelief. The bass sounds as if there is a piece of notebook paper between the ear and the headphone that is being slapped every time a low note is hit. I had my friend try them on without telling him any details so I could obtain an unbiased opinion. I put on a heavy bass track and handed him the headphones and said listen. He listened for about 3 seconds, looked up and almost started crying from laughter. He couldn't believe how crappy they sounded and said, "cheap wal-mart headphones sound better than this."All in all:In all honesty I got a great kick out of these headphones. They really lightened the mood around the house. Everyone was able to get a laugh in. Needless to say I will be sending back these "headphones" (I don't think they should even be called headphones they're so bad) and purchase a pair of Bose Quiet Comfort 25.

VPainful to wear and don't cancel noise
p12109
sg5
VGot the gold pair for Christmas and tried them out on my return trip home. I could hear every word of the flight attendant's safety speech with the volume turned up to a good level. I think a pair of ear muffs would cancel noise about the same.They also hurt my ears and my head. They are very very heavy and push down on the top of my head and pull my ears down. I had to take out my stud earrings to be able to wear them, and even then they werent comfortable to wear for a 2 hour flight. They're fancy looking but when worn (I'm an adult female), I felt like I looked as if I was trying to channel princess Leia... in other words silly.All that aside the actual audio quality was nothing to write home about. Certain types of music rich in bass will get you the most out of these, but I found a lot of white noise in the acoustic, folk, and classic rock that I listen to.Overall certainly not worth the $289 price tag on Amazon. Though with the level of discomfort they caused me, I probably wouldn't buy these at any price.

VOk, I will try to be as comprehensive as possible, and update it as the earphones age. First off, some background: I use these at work in an industrial setting. There is a considerable amount of background noise, and that's what enticed me to spend $260 on some ANC headphones such as these. Picture the noise of an airplane, times about two.First impression: they definitely seem well-built, you can tell the plastic isn't cheaply made, and the unfold to the regular shape with a satisfying snap, with no worries that they'll fold up on you while wearing. They are very comfortable when wearing, without too much pressure against my head, and without feeling like they're going to go sailing across the room if I bend down to pick up a penny.First use: in a high-decibel setting, I was initially a little disappointed. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was really hoping for an instantaneous ultra-quiet oasis to pop up, surrounding me in peace and serenity with my best music playing quietly and in such exquisite detail, that all my problems melted away. But seriously, they just seemed decent and stopping the noise, though the music quality was fantastic.After heavy use: the more I played with them, the more I found the proper positioning in order to keep any outside noise from leaking into the cups, after that, the noise cancelling was truly phenomenal. It got to the point that if I took them off, I was overwhelmed at the noise that it was preventing from getting to my ears. They stayed comfortable for decent amounts of time, though I did feel the need to adjust them every hour or so in order to give my ears and the top of my head a little break (they seemed to press very lightly on the furthest protruding point of my ears, only a minor inconvenience over my 8 hour shift). The battery was impressive, I still had 25% left after my shift. And the best part: no wires to get tangled up in! I could set my phone down and plug it in and forget about it. I did run into a small quirk regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. It would occasionally decide to disconnect for no particular reason, though it wasn't often, and I just had to turn them off and then back on to reconnect.Value wise, I'd say I wouldn't spend the MSRP on the apple website of $350, but $260 on Amazon was on the high end of reasonable for the quality and features. I previously owned some Jaybird BlueBuds that set me back $160, and comparatively these phones were much more high-quality, with much longer battery, and not to mention I didn't enjoy having buds in my ears for long periods of time.Overall, I am very impressed, and I look forward to pushing the performance of these high-quality earphones.

The noise cancelling is pretty cool, I find it handy when all of the kids are in the room with me.  The are a little heavy, and would probably be a little uncomfortable with extended wear.  My son would say two thumbs up though!

VI purchased this last july while i was towards the end of my "a" school on fort sam houston. With all the moving around i did i never got to open my package until today which is like 5+ months after. To my surprise instead of getting a wireless headphone i purchased i had these regular wired beats instead. Im really upset since i did not get what i bought. But i realize it is my fault for not checking my actual item when it arrived. At this point it is too late to return the item.

VDrops blue tooth constantly on all apps/music but is very bad when using the beats with youtube.  Have only had them for a few days and are very unhappy with them.  They are terrible with Apple, and that is VERY bad because Apple purchased Beats and they are not very compatible.  Did the update on the Beats that was supposed to fix the problem with blue tooth dropping but then they stopped working altogether.  Got a hold of Beats direct and tried to troubleshoot them and I was told to send them back to get a return/refund or send them in for repair.  I only had them for 3 days.  Amazon is sending me a new pair now.  I will update this post as needed after I get the new ones.  New ones are here. Same issue. Will be returning them for Bose.

VI have read reviews that say that Beats are overrated. Well these fit great. i can wear them for hours. They connect to any Bluetooth device that I've tried to connect them to. And they sound great! The highs are crisp, the lows are deep. I also use them with my PC for gaming. I don't need to use a mic, so these work perfect. I'm not sure if the mic would work in chat or not. However, it works great for phone calls! Phone calls are easy to answer and sound very crisp. I love these headphones!

VI like these headphones, but there are some caveats.First, they're great looking. If you like the over the ear aesthetic, I think Beats does it best, especially the black-on-black slickness of the version I picked up. They're stylish without being obtrusive. I'm not the type to want to wear this sort of headphone in public, but this version of Beats is so cool and slickly made, I don't think they draw the wrong kind of attention whatsoever.Next, they're comfortable to wear. While some of these products can irritate the ear, or make them downright sore after a while, I haven't had that issue at all with these. The ear cups are a soft, plus leather, and the fit is spot on.I only get about 15-20 feet worth of range out of these wireless headphones before sound begins to drop out and get choppy. At most, the signal feeds through one wall. I'm not dinging them for that, because it could be a bluetooth transponder issue, or maybe just a problem with that technology to begin with. Either way, the signal is clear when I go from my living room to the kitchen and back, and that's all I'm looking for.Sound quality is fine. Other reviewers go into this area at great length and it's just as, if not more, subjective than style can be, so I'll leave that up to the individual buyer to investigate at length. In my experience, as an average consumer of media, these headphones sound just fine and I've got zero complaints in that department. They're as loud as I need them to be, and as clear as I could hope for.Battery life ain't so great. I don't know the actual span, but if I'm sitting at the computer watching a movie and playing some games, it FEELS like I get maybe 5, 6 hours tops out of them before they need a recharge. However, if I'm sitting at my desk any longer, not only would I go a little stir crazy first, but I could easily solve the problem by plugging them in and charging while listening wired. Not a big negative, but be aware that battery life isn't out of this world great, it's just adequate. It's fine.Last, and here is where it's a mixed bag, comes the construction. I have only ever worn these headphones around the house, and they go on a dedicated metal stand when not in use, so wear and tear is minimal, but I had an issue with durability within a month of buying them around August of 2015. The sound suddenly cut out one day, and for weeks afterward sounded muted and distant. Additionally, one ear was markedly worse than the other, though each clearly had a problem. For headphones at this price point, I wasn't exactly thrilled. HOWEVER, I live near an Apple store and, as always, their customer service was wonderful. They took the headphones, mailed them into their service center, and within three days I got a call saying the problem was found and couldn't be fixed, but that they'd be sending me a brand new pair, free of charge. Two days later, my new Beats came in, and in the 3+ months since, they've run beautifully. Tech gadgets fail, I'm used to it, so I judge manufacturers more on their response than on dinging them for putting out a bad egg or two from time to time. As long as I have no bad experiences with this new pair, I'll be very happy with my purchase. I'll come back to edit this if something changes

VGreat quality beats headphones as is quite known. Very comfortable and easy to use. Slight problems I faced were, if you are playing a video stream on you laptop for example and you have connected your headphones via bluetooth, if there is a delay in the video and it stops and starts several times, the bluetooth connection with the headphones will be lost. Overall though, the bluetooth option gives you great freedom to walk around the room or the net room while listening to your music, movie or audiobook.

VGood Wireless Headphones, Sound OK...
p12259
sg5
VI give 3 stars only because of the pricing - if they were $100 they would be a 4 star item.  The sound quality is solid, meaning they sound good.  They aren't $1000 DJ/reference headphones so do not expect to get your socks knocked off, but do have a good bass response and are wireless.Some people say they have issues with bluetooth, others' say that they actually sound better in "wireless" mode.  I can honestly say that I don't really notice a difference, besides I feel like I hear a very quiet high kHZ distortion when they are silent and paired (could be my imagination but I have a pretty good ear).I do not know what qualified someone as an "audiophile" but I listen to music all day, worth with DAW's (Adobe Audition, Logic, etc.) and video production, so have quite a lot of experience with different sound gear and levels of quality of audio sources...Bottom line - if you're like me and just can't deal with another wire on your desk, and have the cash to spend, go for it, they sound pretty good.  If you wouldn't mind a wire and a price conscious buyer, look elsewhere for a wired pair for half the price that will sound just as good.

VFrequently disconnects
p12265
sg5
VI wanted these because they are wireless and too large for me to lose. The only problem is that the headphones seem to disconnect from my phone often and I'm not sure why. Initially I thought they were dying but I have since learned how to check the headphone battery percentage on my phone and that is not the problem. Sometimes when I attempt to skip a track the headphones will actually turn off. Normally I can just turn them back on and keep going but I for the price of these headphones I have higher expectations. If I had paid $60 I would probably be more willing to let the disconnecting issue slide. I did purchase the warranty and will update the post once I have filed a claim with them.

I bought five other high end types from Amazon and these Beats Studio wireless. It wasn't even close, the Beats were in a league of their own on comfort, and the sound was great.  The ability to eliminate outside noise was best with Beats.  They are also the smallest, lowest profile headphones as well.

VI just exchanged my second pair of Beats. Same problem both times: the lining came apart from the foam. Infuriating. Especially in light of the fact that I did not travel with them, did not walk around with them, and only used them while sitting down and in conjunction with my desktop; not harshly treated at all. Another issue I had was that the mini-USB charging cable had to find an extremely small sweet spot in order to charge. I also did not like how they fit, though I suppose that's a subjective problem that not everyone will have. And finally, there is a ridiculously small number of features compared to other models. Look elsewhere, you can do much better.

Vso far so good
p12341
sg5
VSo far so good, I love these and they are very good at blocking out surrounding sounds. I use these while cleaning the house and occasionally when getting ready to wind down and go to sleep. The sound is very impressive and the bass is quite powerful. At first I wasn't so sure because the music sounded very "drowned out" at first. I would recommend tinkering with your phone's equalizer and sound settings to get the sound you want, especially if you have an android like I do. I did and finally got it to the way that I want it to sound. The controls in the instructions say that the most features can be used with apple devices, but so far I've been able to use the same controls with my android  (skipping songs, backtracking and taking calls). The only complaint is have is when taking calls I have to have the phone up in front of me for the other person to hear me. This can be pretty annoying especially because I get quite a few calls and gave to run to my phone when using the wireless feature. The ear cups are good and I have not experienced any problems-yet. I hope I can be one of the lucky ones who don't have the faulty ear cup issue.I used to have the power beats 2 and hated them because they kept slipping off or pushing my glasses with the rubber earpieces and making them fall off my face. Obviously these have been great and I have had no issues there. If you are like me and wear glasses I know you can also relate to the dull soreness that some headphones give you when they push on your ears against the eyeglass earpieces for a period of time.So far, good purchase and worth the price!

VDON'T BUY IT ! It will be very comfortable for few minutes(5-10 mins). After 5 to 10 minutes, your ears will start paining, the headset will slowly start compressing both the ears and you have to remove it to get rid of the pain. IT DOESN'T WORTH MONEY. My friend told me not to buy it, he told that you can't wear it while travelling, wearing it be will very uncomfortable after very few minutes, but I thought it will comfortable for me as I have smaller head than him. But, I regret after experiencing the real pain of wearing it.Also, never buy products from AMAZON, I guess they are big time scammers. They didn't credit my Amazon Credit Card reward points worth around $70, when I placed the order the invoice showed my Reward points in it and the Order went successful. But, the next day when I logged in to track the status, my Order was cancelled and there was a button to Retry. I clicked the retry button and then the Order was successful again, but this time invoice didn't show my reward points. I immediately called the customer care and the representative was talking nonsense and didn't understand my problem, I asked her to connect me with the Supervisor, the supervisor told me that the reward points will be Credited once the item is shipped. I believed the guy and thought the final invoice will show my reward points credited.But today, when I checked my Credit Card statement, I was SHOCKED. They charged me couple of times worth $102 for AmazonPrime membership, which I never subscribed. Also, they didn't credit my reward points and charged me the full amount of the product. I thought to return the product to get the full refund, but their return policies seems to be not customer friendly. I will call the customer care and see how I can return the product for the full refund.I don't know what prompted me to come to this STUPID website to purchase items, it's BIG NUISANCE, calling customer care multiple times and calling bank to dispute the charges etc. I should have walked in to some electronic store and purchased the item to have the peace of mind.Thanks, Lokesh.

VOld stock, and you'll need to update the software out of the box.
p12461
sg5
VI was skeptical about this purchase in from the jump. The price was almost $130 less than what apple and other retailers charge for these headphones. The reason, I believe, is that these are older stock. My reasoning is simple. When the headphones arrived, I had Bluetooth connectivity problems. The headphones wouldn't stay synced.I was completely oblivious to the fact that headphones could have their software updated. I downloaded the beats updater app from their website, and completed the software update to the headphones. It was surprisingly painless, and felt very apple like, and appropriately so.Now the reason I believe these are simply old stock/overstock... the updated software contained verbiage related all the way back to early versions of iOS 8. At the time of this review and purchase, the current iOS version was iOS 9.2. Clearly the reason for the connectivity issues was the needed update. It worked, and I am very pleased with these headphones.As far as sound quality, that's subjective. I do prefer these over the older beats models, as the sound is much more flat and not quite as bass heavy. Build quality seems to be good, and they have a metal band instead of the previous models plastic headband.

VGreat packaging. Sleek design. Good performance. Nice color scheme. Very soft ear piece. However, it may not last very long if you are not careful with them. I think they can easily rip/tear.. I like them, however I don't think it is worth the price. You are basically paying for the name and the looks. I would honestly choose something else. But these were a gift from my boyfriend.. I would never spend $300 on a pair of headphones. I did not really need these because I have the blue tooth jaybirds already which I would highly recommend over these. These have a good sound and good noise cancellation, but I'm not into the whole I need to be like the crowd and wear beats as a fashion statement... I just use these at home..

VI had gotten these headphones for Christmas and absolutely fell in love with them! But then my little cousin threw them to the floor and broke completely!!! The right headphone piece broke straight off!! Luckily, my sister bought me a new pair! I was happy and relived but still mad about the last pair. When I opened the box and started to hear them they were perfect then I put them away where my little cousin could not reach and then when I was about to use them again the plug in the headphones had sunken in!! I'm so mad! I had very high expectations on these headphones and they did not meet at all (besides the sound quality of coarse). These headphones are pure dissapointment. Oh and did I forget to mention that this was in under 2 DAYS?!

Another example of a product hyped by a celebrity, that is all hype, no performance.

VSony MDR-ZX770BN is much better
p12685
sg5
VThe Beats Studio Wireless headphones are totally overrated.  I purchased the Sony MDR-ZX770BN headphones from Costco, and order the Beats Studio Wireless headphones from Amazon for side-by-side comparison.  I had no problem with paying more for better quality.  Needless to say, I kept the Sony because it is indeed the superior BT headphone.The build quality of the Sony and Beats is about the same. However,  the Sony MDR-ZX770BN is much better in terms of sound quality, weight, and fit.  In fact, my fiends that tried the two headphones side-by-side also ended up purchased the Sony headphone.

VBest headphones I own . I have Sennheisser HD-650 wired and HD 280 Pro wired . I bought these for Bluetooth connection and let me tell you I'm impressed . Tried a couple Sony models took them back. True Bass, Treble, comfortable, built sturdy, easy user friendly controls  and quiet signal with effective noise reduction here sound better than Bose Bluetooth (cheap materials) headphones. Expensive but at 264.00 it's a great headphone for Bluetooth listening or wired. I pair with Apple TV gen 4 and IPhone 6 and they sound great . True bass not overdone . Buy em!

VGreat headphones for a new music producer
p12719
sg5
VHeadphone quality is of high importance to me. Why? Well, I am into music production and need to hear bass, treble, etc as clear as possible. Loud bass with optimal accuracy is what I needed -- Beats Studio Wireless was able to provide that for me.I did not know Bluetooth headphones existed until I saw these, quite honestly. And, let me tell you -- these babies last wirelessly a LONG time.Noteable likes:Dual-mode Adaptive Noise CancelingBluetooth (reaches pretty far)FoldableAttractive (walking around campus in style)Dislikes:Price - You do get what you pay for; A fantastic pair of headphones. However, my paycheck is greatly missed.

VUncomfortable and Constant Bluetooth Dropout
p12731
sg5
VIt's easy to see why these are deeply discounted at Amazon. From my experience, they are still significantly overpriced. The one Pro is that sound is excellent. Other factors make this a non-starter. The headband is cleverly designed but has almost no padding so after just a few minutes it becomes uncomfortable unless one chooses to stick a kitchen sponge between one's head and the headband for comfort. Active Noise Reduction might as well not even be there. It just does not work. Bose has it all over these for noise reduction so if that is a big factor, look elsewhere. From my patio with music playing through these I could hear noise from two houses away. Where these really fall apart is on Bluetooth. I found when I changed tracks or playlists, I would hear a soft click and notice on my phone that the BT connection had been dropped. The only cure was to power cycle the headphones. If you skip around a lot, you will be power cycling a lot. On average, every third skip would shut down the headphones. To get the sound so right and everything else so wrong is a real mystery, but at this price, the shortcomings cannot be dismissed. I bought these from Apple and returned them and came to Amazon and bought a Sennheiser set for a lot less money and they do deliver on their promises.

VA honest review...
p12753
sg5
VA honest review,  I own a pair of wired head phones Schneider Hd 510 which sound amazing their discontinued now,.  payed for them $60 great deal. These Beats Wireless headphones sound like crap hooked up wireless with my computer or tv , lots of static ,.. the sound shhhe shhhe sound,... im sitting on the couch 8 feet from my computer or tv on the couch, normal setting right,. I listen alot of Trance melody and vocal trance music that has very low delicet sounds that the head phones DO NOT acknowledge that they even exist. I recently fell in love with some new songs that I discovered through spotify, and listed to them on my cell phone while at the gym, and started to notice that the song sound was way less beautiful y melodic ,.then when I listened with my wired pair,.. the song sounded way different and dull on the Beats pair.So I thought about whats going on and thought that maybe surtin songs sound better then others so i listened to RAP music and country music and they sounded normal coudnt notice a difference. SO, I think the sound that trance music is it has a huge range in frequency,.. the Beats headphones cant reproduce those sounds nor recognized them, though German made Schneider could have possibly a more larger frequency range,.. I checked on both headphones spec's and in fact the Schneider are more sensitive.So if you listen to Hip hop, rap, country ect youll see no diffrence between wired and wireless, though trance music youll be upset and wont enjoy the moment of trancing out.

Material was faulty and without even looking at it they said it was my fault for over extending.  I placed them on my head only there was no over extensionHeadphones still work you figure they would just swap out the plastic, but they said no and it would cost $200 since its not covered under the warranty.  I buy most things Apple but after that customer 'support' I may not in the future

p12777
sg5
VHoped to like these head phones but, in the end, I returned them.  Two major issues... First the sound is flat and really no better than any other ordinary headphones I've tried.  There isn't really any dimension to the sound.  I think you can get the same sound for under $100.00.  Secondly, for me, the head band is very tight.  I wear a 7 3/4 hat and the ear cup pressure is way too tight.  Would always begin to hurt after wearing for only 10 minutes. Check out lower cost headphones and I think you'll find equivalent sound and greater value.  Sorry to the folks at Beats...

My only issue is wireless phone calls.. others hear an echo like voice, plus the bluetooth connections makes a "chew chew" sound frequently in the background.  I don't hear it during regular music play.  So, for phone call usage in wireless mode, I would give it a 2 star!

VHeadphones are great. I had to send my first pair back because it wouldn't stay connected thats a bummer but I really like the headphones. Took them to the apple store before I sent them back, hopping that they would treat them like there other apple products but thats not the case. The treat them like any other 3rd party accessory although they do offer a repair option that they send the headphones to a place that fixes them. If it was any of their other products they would have reached in a drawer and pulled out a replacement pair.

VI've been this product for about 20 days now and I must say though the sound and base levels are up to my exceptions. However these headphones are not meant for long hour usage and are very uncomfortable and heavy. You can feel the heat if you wear them for more than an hour or so. I've also tried the Bose SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II compared to beats these headphones are way lighter and comfortable. The bose headphones has way more clarity but lags behind in the base department when compared with the beats.

VAfter due diligence finally i ordered one of most costliest headphones. Beats packaging has a conspicuous Apple stamp. Once open they feel a bit heavy but sound wise i do not have much complaint. I first bought it from Fry's and salesman their said "Sir go for Bose, Beats it just overrated and over  priced". I can not comment on that but i tested Bose once as well somehow piece which was there on display was not good on Bose.Overall this is good, some things which i want beat to improve is- Weight- Bluetooth connectivity between multiple devicesOverall i am satisfied with the product so far. It's just 4 days old for me.

VI just got it delivered yesterday, and chose metallic sky color. The sound quality is good, but the color of the headphones shown in Beats site is different, I chose metallic sky to have a techno look but I see bronze and burned look over the Headphone. Not satisfied with the purchase.If this is original piece, either color is defective or its cheating. Please have a look at both the pictures and decide yourself.Attached are the picture, I am thinking of returning.

VLoved these when I first got them. Great sound, design and very comfortable. In less than six months both earpads are falling apart and very confusing as to which replacement earpads fit this model. Also, the volume of the left side was less than the right. I thought my hearing was going until I tried other earphones and they were all balanced. Of course, for the large amount of money paid for these, there should be no such issues. Wanna look fashionable and waste a lot of money? Then buy these.

VThese headphones are exceptional!
p13077
sg5
VThe wireless Beats Studios are some of the best headphones I have bought and are overall a great buy. Having the beats now with a wireless feature is very handy and you never have to worry about losing the cord or getting it all tangled up in your headphones. The Bluetooth that links the phone and headphones, connects really easy and is never a hassle. The sound and bass that the headphones project are astounding. When you want to listen to your music in piece and quiet, and put the world on mute, the noise cancellation that the Beats have are amazing. If you want the headphones to cancel out more of the outside would, ANC mode increases the cancellation of the noise outside of the headphones and makes the daily commute quite. The headphones are really light and easy to carry around, and the durability of the Beats is stronger than ever.  The negatives of the Beats are really minimal. The price is kind of high for just a pair of headphones, but once you get the experience to use them, the price shouldn't be a problem. If you use the beats for quite a long time, you ears start to get a little irritated and you might just want to take them off because of it. The Beats website says that the headphones will last you up to 20 hours, but if you use them constantly and for long periods of time like me, it's feels like it last for about ten hours, but maybe that's because I get so into them!! But other than that, these headphones are hands down some of the best and are worth every penny!

VI came here specifically to tell people not to buy these as christmas gifts. Pick a different brand!
p13082
sg5
VI've owned these since July 2014. Don't trust any of the 5 star ratings.I bought these mainly for the wireless bluetooth and the name assuming the name would be higher quality than other brands. At $380 clams, these headphones should not be falling apart after 1 year, especially with how little I use them. The pleather is completely separated, not torn, effing separating. I am so annoyed that they are falling apart based on how little I use them; mostly road trips and airplanes. Also, the bass does not compare the the original beats that were made by monster. I get more bass out of apple earpods than these. Also the headphone wire is on an angle, so I have to use an extender to use it with my iphone case. Also, the cups don't cover my ears 100% which causes pressure on parts of my ears, almost like they designed them for children sized ears. Plus they're heavy as hell, horrible to wear longer than 4+ hours. I cannot recommend these headphones or the brand, I feel totally ripped off. But I do like the rechargeable battery via microusb, that is really convenient.

VLook and sound amazing but not for long use.
p13112
sg5
VThese are what everyone buys for a reason- They look great on and sound awesome and they are LOUD! Bose headphones are not loud enough at full volume where these I never turn all the way up. These seem to have toned down the bass from earlier versions I've had. I think they are just about perfect. They are also the only ones that work (other than the Studio wired version) where the noise cancelling and over the ear style eliminates wind noise while biking or doing anything where the wind is whipping past your ears and also goes loud enough to compensate for very loud environments. This new subdued matte black color is a much needed improvement. I took off a star for comfort- I cannot wear these as long as I can most of my other headphones. These squeeze your head and are not expandable with force as the padding will pop off and you'll likely damage the hinges. Also the ear cups are not deep enough and will put pressure on your ears. ...but for my intended purposes (windy sports and loud environments) they work amazing.

p13124
sg5
VI was VERY torn between Beats and Bose before making this purchase. I bought the Beats, mostly because of the cyber Monday deal, and I am now returning them. I'm switching to Bose and here's why...These Beats have a terribly annoying hissing sound when there's no music or when the volume is low. Apparently, the white noise hissing sound is how it achieves its noise cancelling feature. I wouldn't mind if I only heard the hissing when silent, but if you play a Jack Johnson song on very low volume, you will hear the hissing loud and clear. It's awful. I tried my friend's Bose headphones and they have absolutely no hissing sound.If you can put up with the hissing sound, then these are great headphones. Otherwise, just go for the Bose

My head isn't tiny and I also have bad sensory issues and couldn't wear them for long periods of time. The top of my head would start to hurt and so would my ears. I tried stretching them out, and that worked for awhile, but now one side doesn't produce sound. So if you have sensory issues, I would look for something else.

VJust had a chance to compare these with two other expensive headphones, listening to well-recorded acoustic jazz music mostly. Gotta say, these Beats sound awful. Guess I'm a different customer than most writing 5-star Beats reviews here. Way too much low end, very imbalanced sound stage. Maybe there's something wrong with this pair?

p13240
sg5
VFairly good sound (bass heavy as we all know Beats are). The noise cancellation(ANC)  is the best I have seen in wireless. To compare, I have the Denon AH-GC20 (great sound and comfort, terrible ANC). I also have a pair of wired OPPO's which are incredible sounding and the most comfortable headphones I have but they aren't wireless and lack ANC. By far the best noise cancellation are my QC20 headphones. They are simply incredible and I won't travel without them but they are wired. The one thing that made these a three star instead of a four star is the comfort. They hurt the top of my head. I really wish they were more comfortable and I would keep them. The bluetooth was ok unless I was talking on the phone with them. Then, for some reason, they had issues. Might be my phone so I wouldn't hold it against the Beats just yet.

VPros:BeautifulBluetooth or wired connectionGreat sound quality (coming from a non-audiophile guy)Nice to wear outside in the winter monthsVery nice packagingCons:Uncomfortable after only short period of timeCan't use headphones in wired mode after battery is deadThese headphones are great! As always, Beats provide a beautiful product. Very stylish indeed. But that's only one aspect. The sound coming from these is simply pleasant. I did notice I don't need the volume as loud when listening to a movie or music. I think partially due to the noise cancelling feature and the fact it encapsulates the whole ear. Well that and I'm sure there's technical advances in the drivers.Another feature that I love is the Bluetooth. I don't always have it on. Mainly because it does run through the battery much faster. But it's nice to know its there when I'm out walking around or don't want to be tied down with a cord.Now a huge downside is the comfort of these headphones. I couldn't believe how tight these headphones are after weeks of use. I certainly thought they would loosen up after some use, but no they didn't. It's so bad, that I find myself almost tapping out in submission to the headaches they give me. Perhaps a break after a couple hours is needed. But I'd like to be the one to make that call. Not the pain of just simply wearing headphones.Overall, I do enjoy these headphones a lot. I only wish they were more comfortable when it comes to how tight they are. Otherwise the cushions feel very nice.

VLooks absolutely magical.In terms of comfort, I'd say these can last around two hours before i need to give my ears a break. These newer generation beats also have less bass than the older gens. The "around the ear" cushion is also a bit smaller in terms of circumference as compared to the older gen beats.In terms of sound quality, these are definitely superior but, ill be honest, it wasn't anything spectacular. I can definitely study with these, blocks out some sound but I can still hear the muffle when people talk.Oh, and the wireless is a nice touch too if you're into Apple products.

VPoor UI and mediocre noise cancellation
p13276
sg5
V-- Overall --As a pair of wired headphones, it is pretty good. As wireless/bluetooth headphones, it is mostly unusable. The noise cancellation is mediocre.-- Sound Quality --Rich, full and immersive. It is exactly what I expected. It is good. Nothing much more to write.-- Wireless Functions --The Bluetooth UI is terrible. There is really no other way to put it. I have been using it with my Nexus 5X and am disappointed. All functions are on one invisible button over the left earpiece, and is rather unusable. The design (from what I feel is a misplaced sense of minimalism) reduces the functions to single, double and triple clicks of the same button for different things. As one can imagine, reducing simple functions like skipping over a song into a difficult-to-master special-move combo out of a martial arts video game can be rather distressing. The teeth. They gnash. To top it all it randomly drops the bluetooth connection. Your phone suddenly bursting into song, in public places can be embarrassing.-- Noise Cancellation --I am not impressed. I generally use the noise cancellation function at work. I have been using plantronics and sennheiser headphones and have been very pleased with them. In comparison this one is rather bad. Hardly manages to kill the hums and drones in the workplace.

VNot the greatest for a person seeking bass on the music. Packaging very presentable, the materials of the headphone quite descent. Audio: too many highs, mids, and a lack of low freqs. The headphones will do great for a person that listens to hip hop, pop,  or other music that doesn't include essential bass. Noise cancelling not the greatest.Great headphones for the looks; for a person who knows how real music needs to sound, the headphones aren't worth the outstanding price. Not a beats hater, purchased them, returned them the next day and still looking for that specific headphone that will exceed my expectations.

p13309

V--- Beats Studio Wireless Titanium Review ------ IMPORTANT ---Make sure to update the software on these when you get them. Plug them into your computer. the software is found on the Beats by Dre site (Google it). I also tweeted to Beats Support as they had to generate an Apple serial number for the device in order to add it into my "My Support Profile" page. This Apple serial number is only recognized by Apple and Beats support, so the serial on the device would still be needed for third party warranties. I hope this helps.They fit and sound great. However... and this is a big however. The matte finish on the pair I got was VERY splotchy. I hope the replacements are better. The noise cancellation is cool, don't expect it to block out voices. It will block out background noises well (air conditioner, etc.).[EDIT] I got the Titanium version and they are perfect. I love the fit and they sound great. For the price $130 off of this writing, you can't beat it (pun intended). IMO, stay away from the matte black.Changed stars from 4 to 5.

I can walk around my house with these on and never have to worry about loosing connection.+ The ear cups are extremely comfortable but the seam in mine separated on one of the ear cups. The 1-year warranty covered the repair. You must have a receipt to prove the purchase date.FINALLY:  Keep the receipt for the 1-year warranty. If something does happen in that year, call the warranty number and a FedEx box will be sent to you to pack the headphones up and return them free of charge. Beats does stand behind their product which isn't always true with many products. The people at the center are so nice and helpful.

p13379

VI think Beats started to cheap on their construction and quality. Makes sense with the price drop. I used some Beats studio wireless over a year ago and was impressed with the sound clarity and performance. I turned the music to the max and the headphones handled it with ease. These same headphones I just got are no where near what I experienced in the past. They started to crackle and rattle at about 75% volume. I thought maybe it was the connection so I tried plugging it in. Same results. I thought maybe it was the source so I tried different devices and different songs. Same result. I thought it must be a faulty pair of headphones so I exchanged them (which was a breeze, kudos to amazon I received new headphones in 1 day and it was Sunday) I was excited to get a new pair so quickly, not so fast... Same results. I am returning both pairs and will likely look into a pair of wireless Bose headphones as I know Bose has a great reputation for sound quality. After all isn't that important?

VNot the original improved - a whole different headphone. Too much hiss, cramped / boxed in sound.
p13421
sg5
VBackground hiss is too noticeable for a product at this price point. I have the first generation Studio, so when I read comments in reviews about the noticeable hiss I was thinking it would be like the very slight hiss that is noticed in the first generation from the amplification + noise cancellation circuitry. Not so, unfortunately - it is quite a bit more noticeable. When switching back and forth between my old Studio and the 2.0, I couldn't even notice the first gen hiss in my kitchen (probably not a quiet enough environment), but I could totally notice the hiss in 2.0.In addition to the unacceptable hiss level, I can't approve of the direction that Beats has gone with the tone in the new generation. It's not just gen 1 but better / clearer / tighter / etc., and with wifi and recharge ability and better build - it's really a completely different sound. If you liked the first gen, don't expect this headphone to be first gen but better. They don't really compare from a sound point of view. You should approach these headphones from the perspective of buying a completely different pair of headphones - you can throw your experience from gen 1 out the window pretty much entirely. At that point, you may then just as well consider alternatives like the Sennheiser Momentums or other candidates in this price range. I find the sound of Studio 2.0 to be cramped, boxy, too mid-rangy, and at times unpleasantly shrill / ringing in the mid range. In comparison, while the first gen admittedly has some issues with muddiness or boominess in its bass, it still overall sounds more open and spread out than this 2.0, and easier to listen to for long stretches. I could tell immediately from listening to 2.0 that the sound would be fatiguing - even in short listening I was wincing at some piercing / ringing notes.The first gen Studio really opened my ears up to a whole new experience of music - classical, electronica, jazz, rock, you name it. With 2.0, I feel the Beats Studio is no longer worth considering as this product category of relatively affordable, semi-audiophile grade headphones has filled with better alternatives. They blew their chance, in my opinion.

VI did some research on wireless headphones and CNET rates these as number one so I was definitely leaning towards these headphones. I went to Best Buy to try them out and saw these new JBL Everest Elite 700 wireless headphones for $299 that are exclusive to Best Buy and the JBL website. I decided to go with those because they have a ton of cool features including an app to adjust the amount of ambient noise the headphones allow in. They were built well and JBL is known for having top of the line products. I was hesitant because they didn't fit has well as the studio wireless and the look of the studios is better in my opinion. The frame of the JBLs sticks out too much making them very wide on your head. The studios fit great and still were very comfortable. I am not a sound hound so to me both headphones sounded great! The JBLs ANC worked while playing music and other things but the studios do not which I think is really weird. After using the JBLs for a day I realized that I just wanted a pair of nice headphones that sounded good, felt comfortable, and looked good on my head so I decided to take the JBLs back and get the beats studio wireless. I have not regretted this decision. Now I feel that the JBLs have a better build quality and way cool features that a lot of people will love! Since they are a new headphone though I don't feel they got the design right and maybe down the road they will but until then the Beats Studio Wireless are the best looking and best fit headphones that I have tried. I even owned the original studios when they first came out and these new design ones are a vast improvement. I did not give these headphones 5 stars because the noise cancelling feature is not as user friendly as others, my box did not come with a cleaning cloth like it was supposed to, and the case should have pockets or enough room for the extra cables and charger to fit.

VFantastic Gym headphone
p13456
sg5
VExcellent overall. I bought this headphone to fill a specific need: I required an aesthetic, robust wireless noise cancelling gym headphone that packed some punch and had great sound quality. From all my searching I did NOT want to buy a Beats product, but through my search I could not find a product that met my specifications as well as this one. This is absolutely the perfect gym headphone! I can do muscle ups with no movement of the cans on my head, I can blast music at full volume without affecting anyone, I can go several days without charge, and not having to deal with wires is a gamechanger. 9/10

p13504

VSound quality is great, especially if you like some bass.  The finish is nice, and the white battery gauge LEDs look great with the color as well.  As others have mentioned, the ear pads feel cheap - cheaper than any other premium headphones I've owned (Bose, Nokia/Monster).  The noise cancellation has a bit of a hiss - especially when it's quiet.  Overall, it's a nice looking and sounding set of headphones, but it also gives me greater appreciation for the quality of noise cancellation of the Bose QC15s I have at work.

VHi I got my headphone today. and I paid for 264 dollars to get the new one, but when I got it, there is no plastic film on the cover. and there is not any sticker on the bluethooth part of the headphone. I have seen alot unboxing videos, and they all do have plastic film on the cover and sticker on the headphone. whats more, It is not charging well. which mean is, it can't not be charged. The whole thing is like a used. but I thought I was buying a new one, and there are three cables in the box, one for charging, two for listening to the music and mic. but it didn't suit the picture on the box, it is like a charging cable puting in a music cable box. The whole thing is just like a used. How can that be possible? I ordered a new one and come to a used.  I already did the replacement, and hope that I won't get the used again...

p13588
sg5
VI see a lot of long reviews here with all kinds of good information to help someone pick what they want.  I'll keep it simple.  I've got the Bose QC 25's and I've got these BEATS studio wireless.  The best sound, noise cancellation or not, is the BEATS.  Period.  In an airplane or loud places maybe the Bose are better....  But straight up sitting in your apartment just chilling trying to block the world out and chill to whatever it is you listen to....  Hip hop, country, jazz, soul....  For a guy like me primarily Trance.....  The BEATS beat the Bose QC 25's.  Sorry Bose, both are amazing headphones but it's not just the advertising being so highly budgeted for BEATS.  They just sound better.  I have to charge my Apple Watch nearly every day too....  Ain't no thing.

VAfter my Bose QC2's finally gave up the goose, I decided to look for some modern cans. These Beats fit the bill in terms of style and sound, but the comfort was lacking.  I could only where them for 10 minutes before I got a headache. I would say that my head is probably above average in size but these phones were pretty uncomfortable after little time. Also, the white noise from the noise canceling feature is a little distracting and quite noticeable between tracks.This was my first Amazon return and it was simply amazing!  Super easy electronic process and no issues with returned funds.

VSo first off one star deducted for price. $300 is just too expensive. YES, they are good headphones, but not worth that hefty price tag. I do like how it has a snug comfortable fit on my ears and cancels any noise when you have it on. The sound quality is very good and crisp and clear. This is my go to on planes and when I just wanna block out relax and listen to music. I'll admit I don't use it as much as I thought I would as I only travel every so often and it is quite big for just walking around and even going to the gym. I try to utilize it as much as I can, but I think it's bulky for everyday use. That is my opinion.

VWhat are now the best headphones for my needs
p13717
sg5
VListening to just a few wireless headphones in the stores but reading about dozens lead me to the ultimate question in the universe: What are the best headphones for my needs?  In a short answer the definitive conclusion was the Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphones. In a long answer the overwhelming conclusion was based on several things. One of which was sound. The reviews were in and the actual listening concluded these are best of the best including the lows, the highs, and the midrange without effort or struggle or false harmonics that some have suggested. I didn't see any high-end headphones where I was going so I took what was available to the masses in regular electronic stores.I've played a variety of music which includes instrumental, dance, jazz, hip-hop, soul (listening to Joss Stone made my ears melt [in a good way]) and a slew of vocal jazz.  Most of the music was 192k up to ~900k Apple m4a lossless and the subtleties are profound! No need to turn these bad boys up very loud because of the noise cancellation which I found pretty good in a very low decibel space. Once I try these out in a noisy environment I am sure the subtleties will change and I will be forced to either turn them up or just deal with it.Besides the quality packaging (better than Apple I'd say hands down), the quality of the hardware are sturdy and durable compared to a pair of HD280 Sennheiser wired headphones just gathering dust now.  Bluetooth capability (Link Quality) to the mac and iphone and ipad are steady at 3.0 (Transmit Power) and 0.00 errors (Retransmission) per Bluetooth Explorer (from the Apple Development downloads - IO Hardware Tools). The controls and functionality of what is available works cleanly with sustenance and quality. These will last a long long time.  I am one happy camper!  And now on to the movies!Updated: 11/22/15: Listening to a few movie and tv shows were pleasant to the ear for many reasons. The clarity of the words were clear and noticeably without harshness or unnatural voice harmonics. Midrange and lows were tight and with no muddiness or harsh booming fluttering sounds indicative of over zealous or under powered speakers. From earlier stated there is no need to crank up the volume to gain anything perhaps on the fringe of voice or sound. Everything is present and clean. The lows never rattled or disbursed fluttering effects which is a new level for Beats from what I gather on earlier first gen headphones. And listening to much more Rap (lots of Eminem) and Hip-Hop was very clean and very studio like allowing me to focus on the lyrics and tonality of the rhythm.

VBest Beats Yet!
p13735
sg5
VAfter a few weeks of use, I am incredibly impressed with these headphones. I've had two pairs of Beats in the past, both of which I returned due to the poor sound quality. The balance, clarity and mix in these headphones really is fantastic - gone are the bass-heavy days of old, with much clearer highs and mids. The only slight disappointment (and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5) is the noise-cancelling - if that's what you are after, I would stick with Bose.

VI bought mine from apple store on January. and after 10 month the seam of the leather got open. I was surprised it is glued instead of stitched. the leather is low quality and it gets open because it is glued. apple store said they will fix it but not replacing it. and they said after one year warranty is over I will have to pay $199 for any repair. It is very costly product and broke so fast. I used it only on my desk at work not even gym or workout. The design is really cool and the sound is great. But now I'm worried if the seam gets broken again I will have to throw it away because I will not pay $199 to fix it. I hope Beats will start to stitch the leather components and use better quality leather material.

VUncomfortable with short range
p13776
sg5
VBought after reading multiple reviews. I expected base centric sound, I did not expect the discomfort of smallish round ear cups that either need to sit on the outside of my ear, where they hurt but don't push in on the ear canal opening, or over the back of the ear where they do push in, affecting the sound quality reaching my eardrum. Additionally, the range of the Bluetooth is more limited than other brands - it starts cutting out at 25 feet of unobstructed distance from the source, be it an iPhone, smart TV or receiver. Back to AKG or Bose for wireless.

VGood sound, Bad wireless capabilities
p13782

VThe sound is good. The Bluetooth functionality is terrible. I expected so much more out a nearly $300 pair of headphones. I have had this product for less then a month and I can't count how many times I have had to reconnect these headphones to all of my devices. I tried only using it for my computer and still have to reconnect it all the time. Maybe I got an unlucky pair that doesn't work the way it should, or maybe Beats skimped on the wireless functionality, which is the ONLY reason I bought these in the first place. I'd buy a different pair if I had to do it again.

VGreat sound but they constantly disconnect. Even if I move my head, the sound sometimes cuts out. Forget about the 30-foot guarantee! I can't even stand up without being disconnected. And it's something a full charge doesn't fix. For $280 I would hope for a pair of earphones that blow my mind, and not disconnect whenever I turn my head to take a sip of soda.Saying all this, the sound quality is 7/10. I've heard better but these are still pro and give rich, deep bass.The noise-cancellation function isn't all that great and it's what is being sold here for so much. I'd give that feature 5.5/10.The wireless capability is an absolute fail. 4/10.I would still recommend these to a friend. After they've fixed the wireless disconnecting error.

VSpend your money elsewhere. Bluetooth didn't work brand new out of box
p13866
sg5
VDo not buy if you want the bluetooth to work. Brand new out of the box, the sound in one ear using bluetooth is completely muffled and distorted. I thought maybe it was the song or something until I plugged them into my laptop and the sound was balanced in both ears (and i did a quick google search to find that many people have experienced the same issue. So i thought, maybe it is my computer's bluetooth. but I connected the headphones to my iPhone through bluetooth and the sound was again muffled in the right ear. I would STRONGLY suggest spending your $300 elsewhere. I specifically sent my working "non-wireless" beats back because I figured it would be worth the  extra money to have the wireless feature. terrible idea. now I have to adjust the sound when they are connected through bluetooth and again if I want to use them plugged in normally.

VTHE WORST HEADPHONES EVER!!!After 4 pairs (yes FOUR!!) we are giving up on purchasing these headphones EVER AGAIN!!  Each of them have broken in exactly the same place because they are so cheaply made.  Trying to get them repaired is an exercise in frustration and a true test of anyone's patience.  Whatever retailer you purchase them from even if you purchased an extended warranty, will send you to the manufacturer for repair who will charge you $199 to repair them.Can't say we didn't give them a fair shot!

VThe sound of these headphones is great.  The issue with these is the leather covering the ear foam.  I have had these just under a year and have had them returned 3 times due to the seam on the ear pad pulls apart exposing the foam.  I finally returned these in exchange for a refund.  The product is defective on the ear cups.  I don't know if Beats has addressed the issue with the adhesive on the seams of the ear pads.  Buy at your own risk.

VI bought these headphones for the bass (I'm all about that bass, bout that bass jk I hate that song) and it definitely delivers.  Two big problems in my opinion: 1. Ear cups aren't deep enough, so your ears touch the hard plastic under all the pads; sometimes really uncomfortable.  2. Blue tooth occasionally disconnects from my mac book pro; I don't know which side is causing the problem, but they're both expensive as hell, so this shouldn't be happening lol.Good sound quality. Less than ok build quality.  I still look cool with the beats branding though, right? lol

VAwesome headphones. ANC so you don't get a disturbance from your environment. The gold and white color or champagne and white is awesome looking, and looks great with my beats 27 inch touch screen computer. They sit on the hanger next to the monitor that comes built into the monitor. But in all honesty I know there are better headphones out there on the market for cheaper that would weigh out to Dr Dre Beats. But I mostly bought them so they would match with my computer. Now I have the set. Beautiful look seems to be made of good quality products. As long as you're careful with them and take care of them like a two hundred and $99 set of headphones should be, then they will be just fine I assume. Will be doing a product review in a year to tell how they wear over time.

VPurchased in June of 2014, My Husband stated using them in November 14. With occasional use, they died on him a few weeks ago. No power, not even with the cables attached. Not worth paying $379 (lasts years price), nor the current price,  if it's gonna die on you in less than a year. Sound quality is very good but that's it. Apple care will offer a free replacement within a year of purchase and a 100 dollar discount off the current retail price (basically $199). Hope this helps someone.

VAfter a long debating and has tried many difference BT headphones i gave a Beats another try on their new Studio Wireless Model.The sound quality is really bad and not accurate, the sound is more like a humble heavy bass but very lack of balance mid and high tone.Compare with my Sony MDR-ZX770BN, the Sony sounds way better and true balance on every aspects and features for half of the Beats price.After 2 days testing, the sound quality really bother your ears and become headache.The bluetooth connection is drop sync with my Iphone 6.The headphone will return and totally not worth the money. It is more for fashion type headphone but very poor quality sound.Quake up Beats. This headphone are way too over-rated. You pay for $300+ for the heaphones equal the value of $100 tag.

VAs a woman I really wanted the smaller ON-Ear ones, but my fiance talked me into getting these. Boy, am I happy I did!! I can absolutely see how the on-ear would hurt, and for women who wear earrings it would just push them into your neck. The sound is amazing. I bought these because we are on a plane at least once a month it seems like, and these cancel the noise wonderfully. It allows you to hear what you want to hear.. and nothing else. Definitely recommend the,!

VBest Headphones EVER!!!
p14042
sg5
VI'll admit, I bought these from another retailer (Best Buy).  Still, I felt compelled to review these headphones and get the word out.  I bought them from Best buy because I knew that I wanted to try them on first before spending that kind of money; and I wanted them in a color that Amazon didn't have in Prime.  Once they met my ears, I was hooked!The beauty of these is in the noise cancelling.  They can get quite loud if you need them to, but often times, I find myself not needing to "crank" them due to the noise canceling.  Perhaps this is how they deliver such clean, crisp, accurate sound?The only slight drawback is that they are a little bit difficult to pair with a windows computer.  An "audio cable" is included for those kind of situations but, these are supposed to be wireless headphones.  Who wants to use a cord?A month later.....  I would still buy these headphones.Further note, I even use these in the car.  I have the Studio Wireless, my partner has the Solo Wireless, and we gave our old wired headphones to the kids.  The price of these new headphones and a couple creative mounts = individual audio / video in the car (using our i devices) that would take THOUSANDS to build into the car.  These are a must have for varying tastes and age ranges in shared spaces.

VLoud background noise like a washing machine on the spin cycle, even in wired mode.

My old Bose headphones (wired) have no sound distortions when connected to the same setup. Returned item after several days.

VYou are getting scammed by Beats
p14065
sg5
VI finally got my hands on the Beats Studio wireless headphones, but i was severely disappointed by the quality put out by Beats. First and foremost, the sound quality was nothing like the reviews stated. As a sound enthusiast, the quality was diminishing as it served to be just average in regards to the high and low notes. Although mid-rang was decent, the sound quality overall was underwhelming. Beats continues to scam people with these ridiculous prices but fails to back them up with good quality sound, Second, when i opened this in the mail, the cushioning on the headset was falling apart, i dont know if this was just mine but it still proved to be a pain trying to stick it back together. I am thoroughly disappointed in packaging and care that beats gave when sending my headset out. Finally, this headset gives a lot of leakage in sound, when out in public these headphones are of no use, because it is as if you are playing sound from portable speakers. Overall, i would recommend not purchasing these headphones. Save your money, and go buy from another brand.

VI wasn't overly impressed with the quality of speakers for the price these headphones are being sold at. Also i didn't like that the headphones completely covered my ears it made me feel a little claustrophobic when using. These headphones are hot when you go outside on a warm day or if you so happen to be in a warm environment. The wireless option was the only nice thing that i liked about these headphones. I decided to stick with my other Beats (Powerbeats) bc they just seemed like an easier option.

p14082
sg5
VI got the studio wireless in matte black. The headphone sure looks classy. Sometimes the price drops 100 bucks below the list price and again go back up, I was lucky to get hold one of those windows. The sound is awesome, I am listening to all my favorite songs with this one and they seems as new. There are lots of music which I was missing earlier which I am able to enjoy now. The balance between bass and treble is perfect. None of them is too much. It also has adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) in wireless which is a major win over other competitor products.There are a few reasons though for which I am not giving 5 stars:-1. Comfortability - I expect it to be more comfortable with the price I am paying. After longer duration I feel some heat around my ear and sweat accumulate around the ear cushions and sometimes the headphone switches off automatically when I do workouts wearing it.2. Battery life - Though in the description it is giving 8 hours listening time but if I turn on the ANC it hardly last 4 to 5 hrs. But it has a quick charge up time. In this price range the battery expectation was a bit more.

VThis product is not for audiophiles.Now that that point has already been laid out, I will recommend this pair of headphones to people who are looking for:1. Bluetooth/wireless2. Noise cancelling3. Comfort4. StyleThis may not be the best product for each of these categories, but its the only one that seems to offer a good combination of these 4.Connectivity is not as superb as other headsets, but if you're just planning to connect this with your phone which would always be at your side, then there should be no issues.I use this on plane rides often and the noise cancellation works well enough to silence the occasional noisy child in-flight.If you listento music mainly through the popular streaming services, don't really see any issues with the sound quality. Heavy on the bass, so it may turn off some people.One gripe I would have is the durability of these things. A year into my first pair, some internal cable probably snapped and the bluetooth connection kept dropping whenever the headset gets moved slightly. My fault though as I haven't really been the most careful owner, sometimes just throuwing them into my bag without putting it inside the case and all.

VThese headphones sound, feel, and look great! I used to have a pair of Bose QuietComfort 15s that I loved, but I love these even more. I'm not an audiophile, but I think the sound is equally good \u2014 rich, warm, and appropriately bass-y. More importantly, these headphones are wireless (if you want them to be), and they are rechargeable, while the Bose went through AAA batteries like fiends. I highly recommend these!

VPositives+ Snug Fit+ Good Frequency Range+ Compact storage with the ability to fold+ They look goodMiddle of the road+- Wireless, no cables but does require charging+- Noise cancellation, it reduces the outside noise, but hurts music quality by pumping out a frequency+- Rubber skin contact, most headphones use this but there are some with more comfortable cloth optionsNegatives- Sound quality, the bass was overbearing, muddy and sound clarity was horridAll of the convenience features were great, the headphones are easy to store, comfortable and there are no cables to get in your way while working.  But the good stops there, to me the most important aspect is sound quality, and the Beats Studio Wireless do not deliver.  I tested the headphones on all kinds of music; hip hop, EDM, rock, classical, good dynamic mixes, poor flat mixes.  I was appalled at how horrible these headphones sounded, especially for the price.  They do have a good frequency range, you may hear bass frequencies you've never heard before and be impressed.  But don't let the frequency range fool you, the problem is with clarity.  A few times I had to take the headphones off for making parts of songs unlistenable.If you want headphones that are convenient and don't care about sound quality, get these.If sound quality is important to you, look elsewhere.  I recommend the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs.  (they have the same amount of noise cancellation but don't transmit a frequency to your ear, therefore retaining sound clarity)

VKicking myself for not buying sooner. Great WIRELESS headphones and perfect for the gym
p14153
sg5
VWow. It took me a year to find the perfect wireless/Bluetooth headphones and should have bought these in the very beginning.I always snubbed my nose at the Beats by Dre brand and went with other headphone brands in the same price range. I thought the Beats were just gimmicky headphone products marketed towards the urban/hip-hop community (although I listen to hip-hop). And I always said you\u2019d never see me wearing \u201cthose beats\u201d headphones LOLThe issues I had with other wireless headphones was a mix of things. For me, size, build quality, controls, comfort, and last but definitely not least sound quality must all be excellent. Pretty much all of the other wireless headphones I tried didn\u2019t have much bass, and/or they were too big, or lacked easy controls.I looked at the Samsung Level Over wireless headphones, a couple of different JBL\u2019s, and they hardly had any bass at all, and two other brands I can\u2019t remember. I then tried several in-ear bluetooth earpods including Plantronics, Bose and JBL. All had terrible volume, bass or overall sound quality IMO.I even tried the SMS by 50 headphones (the ones with that small adapter), which actually sounded decent but was way too big for me to wear frequently in the gym. I also tried the SMS Audio sport headphones, and the volume at its highest setting (both on the headphones AND the phone) was way too low, and overall sound quality was very disappointing.I ended up going back to wired headphones for a few more months, but got so fed up dealing with the cord when I work out, so I finally gave in and purchased these Beats by Dre Studio wireless.For Bluetooth, the sound quality to me is by far the best compared to all of the other wireless headphones I\u2019ve tried. I was actually really surprised that even the volume could even be turned up higher than my WIRED headphones! I\u2019m no audio expert, but for me music is more clear, and it just sounds more \u201ccrisp\u201d overall. And the bass is right where I need it when I\u2019m hitting those power lifts LOL. Overall, the sound quality is right on par with my wired sport headphones, if not a tad better. ESPECIALLY for Bluetooth.The beats were also surprisingly comfortable. The over-ear pads were probably the most comfortable out of all of the other headphones I\u2019ve tried, and I like not having to stick earpods into my ears anymore.Oh and as far as looks, I like the all-matt black version of these headphones that don\u2019t have the big red \u201cb\u201d LOL (I **hate** headphones that have huge visible logos on them. I like things understated).My perfect type of headphone overall.  Sorry Dre, I should have listen to you Lol

p14200
sg5
VI have owned these headphones for a little over a month. Overall, I am really pleased with them. Before I proceed with actual features, I must say that the packaging is nice. Presentation/branding say a lot about a company, though the product can still suck! I even keep the box.The headphones have a great look.  They appear to be well constructed. When I first put them on, they were really tight around my head. Even after six weeks later with moderate usage, they still fell a bit snug. So far, this does not bother me, but it may for some.The pairing with my mp3 player and computer was simple, so no problems there. The sound of the music from the headphones is great for my liking. As others have commented, the sound is bass heavy. If you do not prefer a lot of bass in your music, then these may not be the one for you. The sound of the music is crisp and clear. I was hearing stuff that I did not know exist in songs.The headphones feature noise canceling aspects as well. This feature is okay. You will probably read a lot of reviewer who compare these to the noise-canceling headphones by Bose. I did try those on in the store and I would agree that the feature on the Bose\u2019s headphones did a better job with noise canceling. Now, there is a feature where you can use the noise-canceling aspect only. The Beats try to have that balance between music and the outside environment. I hear very little outside in my environment when the music is playing and a bit turned up. Nevertheless, the noise canceling features is fair and it should be good in most environments. This beats are a bit weighted as compared to the Bose.Another aspect to note is the time you have before you have to recharge. I would agree with the up to 12 hours of wireless usage that are advertised. I can get over 10 hours of usage. You have the option to connect with a cord for longer usage but once they are dead, you will have to recharge them.The aspect that I am worried about is the plastic coming off inside the ear cups. I have seems pictures of this from others and it is not appealing. So, durability is a major concerned ; I will monitor this through time. The headphones are not waterproof, so I am not sure if sweat or other wetness plays a role in this malfunction.So, with me being a month in, I am pleased. I would hope that one year later, I will still be able to say the same thing. These headphones are not cheap and are high end in quality (hopefully) and sound (if you like or can tolerate bass).  I use my headphones about three times a week for gym workout and when on travel, which is not too often. I try to keep them dry and in the harden case that you can place them in.With one month of usage, I would recommend these headphones if you can afford them, adjust to the snug fit, can tolerate the heavy bass in music, and need/desire a moderate noise canceling set. Let us see if my review changes in the coming months.

VExpensive but GREAT!

VFor the better part of the last 3 years I've been through about 4 different headphones as I've been longing for 1 pair of just great headphones.  I started with a pair samsung ear buds that shipped with my Galaxy.  Clearly, I needed something better and so after some research I bought a pair of Audio Technica's ATH-50S that have the straight cable.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED them minus the fact that they came with a non-removable 11' straight cable.  So after using them for about 6 months I begrudgingly sold them for a pair of Audio Technica sport earbuds.  Again, I fell in love.  After using them for about 6 months I realized that ear buds after long use became extremely uncomfortable.  I needed to go back to over the ear.  After a recent trip to Vegas where I got extremely lucky at the roulette table I bought a pair of these Beats Studio at the airport Kiosk.  I'm currently in love and happy again.  These are comfortable, the sound is extremely well balanced and the highs and lows hit as expected.  The build quality feels pretty premium to me.  The one knock that I have is that if the rechargeable battery were to ever permanently die then these headphones are useless.  The reason for that is due to the noise cancellation which require power.  Beats, due to value on aesthetics opted to forgo the battery pack which is usually attached to a wire and went with an internal rechargeable battery.  Barring that, the set is near perfect for me.

VThese headphones are awesome.  They are not perfect but they are awesome.When I compare my new Beats Studio Wireless with my Sennheiser HD-650, the Beats are slightly bass heavy, but the bass is tight and the range and clarity is very good even at high volume.  It has a tight, punchy and clean club sound that I like.  I also get that sound using Paradigm Studio speakers with a Velodyne DD sub.  I like the Beats Studio Wireless a lot.

p14312
sg5
VBought both the Sony MDRXB950BT and the Samsung Level Over with this guy, I was in the quest for the best "wireless" headphones and ended up keeping the Beats Studio Wireless as the sound is much louder than the other two plus if you want more bass, this is better.I've also found a tweak to bring out super bass by turning up bass and turning down treble all the way using my phone's equalizer, then turn on the volume to the max and you get this awesome, club-like super bass.  This would not be possible if the volume on these headphones didn't get loud as it is.Sound quality is actually pretty good so long as you are listening to high quality MP3 files, Pandora on high quality setting is also okay.Just make sure to tweak your sound using equalizer on your phone.  If you have rooted Android, you can use Viper4Android.  Once you tweak the sound, you can really turn these into super bass headphones.Just awesome product, the loudest wireless headphones out of all the ones I've tried plus the most bass.  If you are a bass head like myself, this is the best.

VI'm currently using this headphones right now as week speak on my imac computer. This headsets live on my head. I take them everywhere I go. Sounds very good and I uses it for my Samsung Galaxy phone, Synthesizer Piano Keyboard, and sometimes while gaming. These are by far the best headsets a man can ever buy. The bass on this product sound premium and the music I listen to as a music when I'm learning songs is crystal clear without a strain also with the help of noise canceling. I would recommend this product for all music lovers out there.

p14365
sg5
VI was fairly skeptical on buying a pair of Dre Studios as the original headphones...let's just face it was god awful. The old beats studios at 40% volume would leak out like no other. These pair of babies sound much more crisp, bring the heavy bass but not way over the top like the originals and just look a whole lot better. Highly recommended!

VGot my beats today and still testing it around....1. First thing I noticed after opening the box was that a part of the foam on the earcup was dented because the other ear cup collapsed onto it probably for a really long time (probably since it was made in the factory). But the dented foam seem to slowly get back to its original shape and that really shows how great its quality is.2. I noticed the band is very stiff when compared to my beats wireless (that I own for like 2 yrs and is now discontinued), I remembered my old pair of beats used to be like that when I just got it. So now, I just want to recommend the people who just got it or going to get it to be extra gentle to it for a while and wait til it softens or loosen up to avoid possible band breakage. I know its a very expensive pair of headphones and we'd expect a lot from it but... let's admit that although its expensive its still not perfect. At least I know that the only reason I sticked to beats is because of its stylish looks.3. The wireless connection isn't quite smooth on the first try. Haven't tried it again cuz its now charging. I really hope that nothing goes wrong with the Bluetooth functions in it cuz I had to send in my first pair of beats wireless (discontinued) about a month after I got it cuz the bluetooth function died. Luckily beats send me a new one which I find them to be responsible. Not bad not bad. Though I did heard about the poor customer service beats/apple provide for some people which I have no idea of but do think that's possible...4. Overall: I recommend to be careful to these beats headphones especially ones with wireless features. I do think they are fragile, but honestly, its a $300+tax worth pair of headphones, and that's a price exclusively available on amazon. Its about $400+tax in bestbuy, staples, target... you name it. I treat it like glass made gold (at least in the beginning I do). So if you be gentle/careful to it (so it doesn't Break), its actually a pair of good looking (stylish), good sound quality, known/famous pair of headphones (with some risk which obviously I'm willing to take...). Worth considering pair of headphones.PS: will be updating if anything new comes to mind.

VI'll say it off the bat.  This may not be the most awesome sounding cans that I own.  But if you're not an audiophile or prefer lots of bass heavy music, you will like these headphones.A couple of things really stood out for me:1.  The price was good and better than what you get at the Apple Store (no surprise there)2.  These headphones are pretty plush and comfortable.  I can wear these for quite a long time and have no issues.  Wearing it with glasses on is also no problem. B3.  The Bluetooth connectivity is flawless.  It's simple to link to your phone and turning the headphones on and off without any issues is nice (unlike my wireless jaybird earbuds which seem to disconnect constantly - which is beyond annoying)4.  The sound may not be upper echelon, but when it comes to listening to dance and rock music, I like how those genres really sound good when I use these cans.5.  The gold color looks seriously awesome.If you're looking for a versatile set of wireless headphones that look great and have decent sound, you totally can't go wrong here.

VBeats Headphones by Dr. Dre! I'm in! This was my first thought when the first round of headphones were introduced, unfortunately, I re-learned why I shouldn't become influenced and manipulated by marketing to purchase anything. The style was cool and new, but more importantly they sounded like crap and I hated them. I don't want my headphone to sound like a car rolling down the street with so much bass you could hear the truck rattling.  I wanted sound quality so I sold them and purchased a pair of Bose. With technological advances I wanted to upgrade and experience even better quality so I began researching for the best pair to enhance my experience with music.  Here are the candidates I considered: Parrot zik 2.0, Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless with Active Noise Cancellation, Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones, Sony MDRXB950BT/B Extra Bass Bluetooth Headset and Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone - Matte Black. I spent hours watching reviews and going over the pros and cons of each before narrowing down to Parrot, Sennheiser and Beats. After internal debating I was leaning toward Parrot but their out dated blue tooth capability was a deal breaker. Sennheiser ringing in at $500 was more than I though necessary. Beats were left standing, and needless to say I was apprehensive. After listening to them at a store I was very impressed by concerned that they were somehow amped in their enclosed display cabinet. And I was glad to learn that Monster was no longer associated with Beats. So, lets give this another try.When my new pair of Beats arrived I was happy but not as excited as I had been the first time around. I carefully unwrapped the impressive box and charged them. When I finally put them on and it play I had an instant eargasim.  They sounded exactly like I had hopped they would. Clear, crisp and and properly balanced. I could hear the little idiosyncrasies within songs and the bass was right on point and not disruptive. They are comfortable and sturdy and I'm beyond excited by the many hours I'll spend under the spell of my favorite artists.Hope you enjoy as well.

VSynopsis: Very good sound, noisy noise cancellation, ear cups not roomy enough, finicky connections. Unfortunately had to return them.Sound:  I really liked the sound of these.  I have a number of wired headsets (in, on, and over ear), and these were as good as any in terms of sound.  Good base but not overwhelming.  Everything was clear and not muddy at all.Sound, Pt. 2 (Using these with an iPhone): When I use the iPhone's built in Music app (with music in AAC/M4A format) they sound great with very little (if any) discernible difference from a wired connection, so these headphones definitely support AAC over Bluetooth.  When using the Amazon Music app the sound was nowhere near as good (becomes more obvious if you listen to Amazon Music for a spot that sounds wrong, then listen to the same spot with wired headphones).  My guess is that all Amazon Music is encoded as MP3.  It probably works great on a device that supports AptX, it doesn't on the iPhone.  This isn't a fault of the headphones but of the iPhone and Amazon Music not playing nicely with each other to get the music to sound good over Bluetooth.  Real bummer. I like Prime Music.Noise Cancellation: It did cancel out some noise, particularly lower frequency constant sounds; however, there is some pretty substantial hiss. Also, there are periodic soft beeps when nothing is playing (i.e. if you just want things quieter).  They aren't very loud, but to me it was enough to distract.Fit: Initially, these were very comfortable.  They are a bit snug but the very soft cushions keep the tightness from being uncomfortable.  The downside to the soft cushions is that they give enough so that my ears touched the inside of the headphone covering the speaker.  I bought these for all day wear (at work) and after several ours the pressure and slight rubbing on the tip of my ears caused them to begin to ache. I have what is probably a tad smaller than average head with smaller than average ears that don't lay flat on my head but don't stick out more than average either.Bluetooth Connection: Usually, it worked great, but if the phone and headset were separated by much distance (not in the same room but still in the same house) the connection dropped and I would have to manually reconnect them (i.e. turn headphones on and off or make the headphones discoverable and go through the menus on the iPhone).  Sometimes the connection was a bit wonky: I would get a call and the music would keep playing while the call would come through on my phone.  Disconnecting and reconnecting would fix this.  Finally, these DO NOT support multipoint (i.e. connecting to two devices at once) and DO NOT support NFC pairing.  With them being a new version this year and expensive they should support both.

p14609
sg5
VOk, let me begin by saying that i buy whatever I like, not what the Reviewer's or majority of ppl say. Most ppl don't like Beats Electronics, now I know why. I personally have the PowerBeats2, and I LOVE them. But I needed something with more bass and gave me the erection I need at the gym (while pumping some IRON).So I came across these beautiful majestic Dolphins. Oh by the way I listen to mostly EDM genre. I watched a camal ton of reviews before buying these cause this ain't Hooker cheap. So I got this few days ago and I was pumped and ready to head the gym. BUT!! Upon listening I realized my head is about to explode, not because of the sound quality (which is not worth your hard earn money) I'm talking about the active noise cancellation. I felt like my ears were being sucked in to a black whole. Even though I really like the looks and the comfort of these and was trying my best to like them (believe me these are very comfortable and look Lamborghini good) BUT, I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm not done, the sound on these are not even great, specially the bass. When I'm working out I want to be able to feel like I can pick up that heavy 10 lbs dumbbell and push out 10 reps, not stuggle to do 5 maximum. Honestly boys and girls I'm returning these ASAP, it's not worth the money. If this was $200 then yea it's pretty good for that price but $270 ( btw I got these cheap compared to what they were originally $370 or something, WHAAATTTTT??)ConclusionGet sennheiser momentum 2.0 (wired not the wireless) instead. I know, they are a bit more expensive but believe me when I tell you that you won't regret it.

VThes Headphones fall apart right at the end of the warranty. Check out the pictures.
p14639
sg5
VIf I could give ZERO stars I would. My Beats headphones have a manufacturing defect: the seam-line in the ear cup separated showing the foam, and fell apart 2 months after the expiration of the 1 year warranty. This is called "planned obsolescence" and I shouldn't have been surprised that Beats created an expensive product that falls apart, and set their business workflow so they wouldn't have to shell out replacement parts or product. This is not normal wear and tear, check the pictures, the headphones are fine. I can't buy another earpiece, and Apple customer service told me that they wouldn't replace it. Apple said that the only option was to "repair it for $205 including shipping". I can buy a new pair for almost that price, but I won't. Don't buy these headphones. The product is horrible, Beats is a horrible company, Apple has become a horrible company.

Music sounds great, but video games and tv do not have rich sound.Noise- cancelling wirelessThis is the best feature. I vacuum with my headphones on and the music comes in nice and clear over the vacuum. Headphones are not great for running and I would suggest earbuds if you are a runner.Battery lifeI get 3 hours of battery life, and the rechargeable battery is a great feature.

VQuality Headphones... Worth the Money
p14786

VWireless Studio Beat Headphones These headphones are one of a kind and made perfectly for music lovers that like their music loud. The headphones have a noise cancellation where they block out all noise around you so you can only here the music. The headphones have very good sound built into them with a great bass also for those of you who like that. The Beats headphones come in all different types of colors and you can customize your own beats to make them just how you want! The most popular thing about these headphones is the fact that they are wireless and Bluetooth. Wireless is a big thing these days and people are looking for that and these are the headphones for you. They are great because the wireless connection holds up to 30 feet from your phone. You can set your phone down and run down stairs real quick to get something and still be listening to your music when your phone is up stairs with no Bluetooth connection problems.On the headphones it tells you how much battery life is left. The battery life is very good and more than you will ever need for one day. The battery life on the headphones last 12 hours of Bluetooth connection. If you plug your cord into the headphones they should last about 18 hours of played music. The headphones are also very easy to charge. All you do is plug them in at night and they are ready to go all day for you! On the other side they are a little pricy but well worth the money because they are awesome headphones and wont let you done. They are also a little on the bulky side but when you are done using them they fold up so you can put them away. When you have the headphones on your head you cant even tell that they are on your head because they are so light. These headphones are a lot better than ear bud headphones because they wont hurt your ears after you are using them for a long period of time. If you enjoy listening music and like a good bass or sound then these headphones are for you. The headphones aren\u2019t made specifically for one type of music it\u2019s made for all types of music. They work awesome and wont let you down.

p14802

VHaving been an owner of the earlier generation of Beats Studio Headphones; purchasing the updated wireless headphones with a black matte finish was a no brainer. I couldn\u2019t believe, being a first time wireless headphone owner, how free I felt not having a cord that tied me down to my phone, laptop, or iPad. These headphones are perfect for a student on the go and for anyone working out at the gym.PHYSICAL: The black matte finish is subtle; yet, very sharp looking. The headphones are professionally built; very sturdy and smooth movements of the ear flaps. One of the things Beats really improved one with these headphones is the padding around the ears. They set comfortably and don\u2019t move around much, so you don\u2019t have to worry about them falling off your head. Having glasses, the pad on these are very comfortable and don\u2019t push too hard on ears or frames. Overall, these headphones have a sleek, comfortable, and attractive design.AUDIO: The sound of these over-ear headphones is second to none; I can hear everything the producer intended the listener to hear, its quite remarkable. The padding of the ear-phone part is noise canceling, meaning when you put them on you can\u2019t hear much other than what is coming from the speakers. With the great sound and noise canceling headphones it is worth every dollar of what is now $264.29.I definitely recommend these headphones for a student on the go and for anyone working out at the gym.

VFive star review for a five star product
p14807
sg5
VBeats headphones were built to produce live concert sounds. So if you listen to music while exercising, studying, or just performing everyday tasks, these wireless headphones are for you. They not only stay on your head and hug your ears tightly while performing physical activity, but they also keep you focused with little to no distractions, making it useful to students, athletes, or just plain music lovers.Simple to use:Upon receiving the slick black box that opens like a book to reveal the products, you will find a microphone cable, USB charging cable, power adapter, instructions, and the headphones. The directions give you a step-by-step guide to work the headphones. Any age group that is familiar with technology is able to function the product.Comfortable:They are light, strong, and flexible to custom fit all head shapes. The headband is heavily padded, as well as the ear cups. You will find the ability to use the beats studio wirelessly contributes to comfort enormously; the Bluetooth allows you to roam 30 feet and lasts for 20 hours.Upgrade your listening experience:The creators want you to feel that you are at a real, live concert. You can expect that the music genres that sound best through these headphones include: rock, hip-hop, R&B;, electronic, and pop. Though it depends largely on the song, the treble response creates quality sounds. If you want to cancel all external sound, the adaptive noise canceling feature completely puts the world on mute which increases the experience of the Beats Studios.Affordable:The price of $264.29 for the wireless Bluetooth, high quality sound, lightweight design, and other mentioned aspects of the product make the headphones worth the price. They come with a one year warranty, but they are built to last long when taken care of.In the areas of comfort, simplicity, sound quality, and the price, you can expect positive evaluations. If you are searching for that concert-like sound and high quality, popular headphones, you have found them. Hope this helps you make a decision on the product.

VGreat Sound and Noise Cancellation
p14824
sg5
VI purchased these wireless headphones for overseas flights. They did the job in noise cancellation. The sound quality is great, as well. The bass highlights the type of music to which I typically listen. However, I got these on a great sale ( $100 discount for grey/titanium color) and would not have paid full priced for these, as there are likely better quality headphones in that price range.

VGood, but not great..
p14842
sg5
VI purchased these because I wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones.  These are decent, but not great.  I upgraded from a pair of Audio Technica ATH-MX30x ($69), thinking the sound would be quite a bit better, and in some ways they are much better, but in some ways they are no better.  The base is a little sloppy (not tight), the mids are muted (sound distant), but the highs are fantastic.  Overall, they don't sound incredible, but they do sound very good.  There are things I wish were better, and I am not sure the sound quite meets the price tag, but there are very few good wireless headphones on the market, and I personally really want wireless.These can be listened to in wired mode.  Many reviewers have said they sound better in wireless mode, and I have also found that to be the case.Pros:  Well built, great wireless performance, great battery life, comes with lots of cable (Yes they are wireless)Cons:  Mediocre overall soundConclusion:  One day a decent pair of wireless headphones for half the price will be released.  Probably best to wait.  Stick with wired right now unless you can't live any longer with wires.Update:I have now had these headphones for approximately 5 months, and I could not be happier with them.  Once you adjust the equalizers on your listening device, these sound fantastic.  I imagine my ears have largely adjusted to the sound of these cans, but when I listen to other headphones now, I just don't think they sound as good.  I would strongly recommend these headphones to anyone.

VIn Defense of Beats.
p14872
sg5
VBeats are the whipping horse of the audiophile community. They are well meaning people who want to educate people on how putting effort into good sound can really make your life better. And they may have a point:1. Music just before the digital age was lossless CD's. The only bottleneck was your headphones2. Then when the digital revolution started, ripping CD's to MP3's was commonplace. Rip speeds were slow, 128Kbps was the common bitrate to save time3. Pirating was also commonplace, napster. Shoddy rips everywhere.4. iPod launched with the iconic Apple Earbuds that sounded like screaming babies fingernails scratching chalk.5. Pandora launched was highly compressed music to save bandwidth.6. Bluetooth launched to highly compressed signal traveling to speakers and headphones.It's been a rough 20 years for quality music. Radioshack is gone, Circuit City is gone, and a lot of generalized tech stores has bitten the dust. teenagers simply have grown up around poor sounding music. They probably don't even know what bass is or have ever experienced it.So they walk into their Best Buy with their Apple Earpods around their neck, walking up to a Beats demo booth, with high bitrate MP3's at key moments  of a song ready to play with the hit of a switch. And yeah, they are absolutely floored. Despite messy bass, most teens probably thought they heard the sound of God.And that's why beats has been beneficial for the audiophile community. They are the gateway drug to better audio. To finally get people off from bundled in ear pods. They charged overpriced, stylized phones that were iconic, and it should have been a boon for the audio community to keep pushing people forward. But some resented Beats for being so successful, while their beloved brands have a moderate consumer base. Their complaints weren't wrong, but their head was in the wrong place.With the revisions, including the Beats Studio Wireless refresh here, they've improved the sound signature. I was listening to these at Best Buy and did a quick comparison to the Solo 2's, and the Bose models. I also own Sennheiser Momentums (audiophile endorsed). These cans have a really exciting pop to them. They will not make an audiophile happy, because they are not neutral sounding like the Momentums, but they are simply fun to jam out to. A guilty pleasure. The bluetooth is an added convenience that has come a long way in sound quality. AptX which is popular compression to improve sound through bluetooth, gives the Beats Studios a near indistinguishable sound from a wired connection. Streaming programs like Spotify have improved their bitrates, and if you subscribe, you can get their premium sounding bitrates (320kbps mp3 I believe), which will let these headphones do high quality work while on the go.So don't despair. People might be spending more money, when they could purchase nicer and uglier cans. But at least they're not tied to the dreaded ear bud bundles, and maybe when these things inevitably break they'll be interested to see "what else" is out there. The counter culture nerds are probably already throwing their wallets at Sennheiser or V-Moda.So accept this attractive, and rather fun sounding piece of equipment for what it is. A pricey but pleasant introduction into the world of better music, and just leave people be who purchase this model. In fact, i'd encourage you to give it a listen, you might be surprised how far they've come.

VDecent Sound, Peanut Brittle Headband
p14919
sg5
VYes they look slick, O.K noise cancellation, great battery life, comfortable and I love that they're wireless.  They also have pretty decent bass provided you listen to a lot of bass heavy music but overall the sound quality isn't few hundred dollars worth.  The deal breaker is the fragile headband on this thing. It cracks so easily its infuriating.Got a pair a little after Christmas 2014, at the time they were almost four hundred dollars and by around June 2015 the plastic around the hinge started cracking and splintered away, leaving the earpiece hanging loose. This happening after light in home use and being babied was appalling.  The Apple store switched it out for a new set. A little over a month later as I was taking them off I heard a crack.  Surprise surprise, same area around the hinge between the headband and ear piece.  I was told that my first replacement was a special case and was given an explanation of a sketchy warranty that didn't hold up to logic so they sent me another (that I will not be keeping).  Not even a year's use out of these headphones and as it turns out, the brittle headband is a known issue.  Overpriced, pretty garbage and I'm so done.

VI bought these over a year and a half ago at a military base in the deserts of California. They have survived that and the bipolar weather of Northern California. If you take care of these the right way like anything els they will last. Sweat dose get in them(causes the speaker to stick to the plastic frame, just blow into the speaker a few times) and the pads will eventually start peeling apart but super glue will help and it doesn't damage the the fake leather. Mistreatment doesn't mean they suck. I am looking to replacing them because i can't stand having my things look beat up, but definitely getting the same kind. Worth the price.

VI did a lot of research and even despite the bad ones I read that were just aimed at the over pricing and marketing behind these I knew they sounded great.  The ones I had however picked up a lot of ambient noise even while playing audio and especially while using the bluetooth mode.  I could be playing music loudly and still hear the vent in my office, same thing with the fan in my bedroom.  I would also distinctly hear people talking over the audio I was listening to.  I was pretty bummed that I had to return them

p15036
sg5
VAll I heard about Beats is they are overpriced. As I write this I have a pair of Skull Candy headphones ordered from Amazon. I decided to go to Best Buy and listen to all they had. I listened to the Skull Candy I had ordered, I listened to Bose, Sony, Monster. I liked the Beats Studio the best. I am picky about audio. I know bluetooth is a compromise. Yes Best Buy was selling them for $379.99. I wouldn't pay that price. They matched Amazon for $264.00. Well worth it in my opinion since the rest did not sound as good.

VI know Beats has been getting a bad rap lately, but these headphones are GREAT! I can hear everything in the music, and the sound is fantastic. The wireless tech is to die for, I absolutely hate wires and eliminating one and keeping the quality high gets my thumbs up. The headphones are super lightweight and very comfortable (given you don't wear them for longer than 3 hours at a time), and you have no worries of them falling off your head! Absolutely great! And I play my music at a decent volume (and have had trouble in the past with headphones leaking noise), these Studios have little to no leakage of noise! It's brilliant! Would completely recommend! Cheers!

p15107

VSo pissed, I bought these and then the cushions start to fall apart so then i spent 16 bucks on amazon to replace them to find that the tape used for the cushions isnt strong enough to secure them for long periods of time so I have to keep reapplying the cushions. Thought I would look cool now I dont even wear them in public. Nothing is great about these over priced headphones. 300 dollars wasted because the base hurts my ears.

p15142

VI thought that the dedicated ANC hurt the sound quality more than it helped the listening experience.Also, headphones were really uncomfortable. The fit of the headphones was really tight, putting way too much pressure on the sides and top of the head. Unfortunately in my case, adjusting them didn't help. Ultimately the poor fit was the biggest reason why I was unsatisfied with them and returned them.I'd recommend trying them on in-store, to see how they fit. Also, wear them for more than a few seconds -- ideally, for a good few minutes.

VBest Headphones, Period!!
p15202
sg5
VThe best headphones on the market, period. Battery lasts a very long time between charges and it's very fast to charge. You actually feel the music and cancels most, if not all noise around you. Plus it was an added bonus that it could be used as a wireless Bluetooth device to talk on the phone. I didn't even know that it had a microphone when I bought it. But obviously it's best feature is playing music. There is a big difference between these headphones and others. You actually hear and feel the music like no other. It's also great for watching movies on tablets, phones or any other Bluetooth enabled device. I even use them while working out in the gym because it cancels all noise around you so you don't have to hear other people's workouts or machines going. Also they are very comfortable and just fit perfectly since it's adaptable to all head sizes. Another bonus is the controls on the side since you can raise or lower the volume or pause something etc.. There isn't enough great things I can say about these headphones. You pay for what you get, plain and simple.

People around you will start to listen to what you're listening to even at medium volume!!! When your iPhone or iPad battery is low the sound will be out of sync sometimes!!! If you're OK with all the above then buy it, I personally have mix feelings about it and I think for what I've paid i should've got a better product.

V3 stars only because the noise cancellation is weak at best. Sound quality is very good. Very comfortable to wear.I can tell that it works because if I remove the headphones is obvious that there is some amount of noise cancellation. In my situation there is the noise from the AC vents and it cancels that noise  but people talking normal volume levels a few feet away are not cancelled out at all and actually seem to be heard as good as if I was not wearing Them. Sound quality is very good but Bluetooth does create a small amount of "noise", but it is not audible when the music is playing.

VBest headphones I have ever bought or used. And it isn't close. Absolutely worth every penny. Sound quality is excellent. Volume is more than one could ever wish for. I have used these while I workout for several months and never had any issue at all. Very very comfortable as well, and no issues with falling off of your head. Don't bother with any other headphones.

VThese went on sale and I did not pay anywhere near retail. Due to this I went aheadand pulled the trigger, and I am glad I did. These are comfortable and have synced up to my iPhone and Mac seamlessly. There is slight white noise you can hear when there is no music playing, but I can not hear this once the music starts. I listened to these all day at work and still had plenty of battery life yet. 5/5 would buy again

p15368
sg5
VFantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.----Pros----Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.---Cons----Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.

VThese are awesome. I was super hesitant to spend the money on these, but I'm glad I finally did. I only use these at the office and on the plane so they're holding up very well. The battery lasts about 4 days, a few hours a day, before it needs a charge. Plug them in overnight and they're ready to go again. Super easy to pair to my apple products. I ended up purchasing my wife a the matte black edition and hers pair up nicely with a cheap bluetooth transmitter for the TV at home. These are great headphones. Just wish they weren't so expensive.

VGood headphones, but still room for improvement
p15474
sg5
VTo start off, my headphone credentials are not that of an "audiophile" but I listen to music almost every day on multiple sets of headphones. In the past I have owned the Beats studio HD (1st edition), Beats in-ear headphones, Skullcandy Skull Crushers, Beats Mixrs, Bose QC15, Powerbeats wireless, and the Beats Studio Wireless. Of that list of headphones, I was never satisfied with a pair of headphones until the Bose. Both pairs of Beats had just "eh" sound and terrible build quality. Both pairs were broken, replaced, and returned at least once until I bought the Bose close to 6 years ago. Unfortunately, the headphones finally showed they were made of earthly materials as the speakers began to crackle and fade. After a couple weeks of research, I finally decided to take a leap of faith and go with another pair of Beats. I recently purchased the Powerbeats wireless and they really made me re-evaluate my opinion of Beats. Whether it was the buyout by Apple or years of negative reviews, it seems as if the company finally decided to make a change. Now that I've had the Studios for a few days, I figured I'd share my first opinions:Build:Much better than the 1st edition of the headphones, as they feel much more solid and a lot less plastic feel. The outer layer feels like a metal substance while all clasps/enclosures feel like metal as well. The ear cushions are made of a comfortable and soft leather. The headband is a simple rubber band with a little air pocket/pad inside. This is the main area for concern for me as this was the big problem I had in Beats past, but only time will tell.Comfort:One of, if not the main reason I gave the product 4 stars. The materials used are solid as listed above, but the total weight of the product is definitely felt after a little while of usage. The headband is the biggest problem so far, as it feels like someone is pressing their thumb to the top of your skull while you wear them. I've found a few different areas on the top of my head that are a little more comfortable, but regardless I find myself adjusting them every 20 minutes or so. The ear cushions are a nicer feeling leather but aren't big or deep enough to completely encase your ears. It isn't noticeable until a half hour or so, but the combination of the small ear holes and how the speakers stick out to the point they touch your ears, leaves your ears hot and hurting. While this may not be as big as a problem for some people, I'm used to the extreme comfort of the Bose QC 15's which aren't noticeable after 6 hours of use.Sound:Like I said, I'm not the most qualified to give a review on sound, but I know enough and have heard enough headphones to understand the difference in sound and quality. This is where Beats truly surprised me. The first generation headphones were nothing more than mediocre which caused waves of negative reviews. In the second outing by Beats, they really stepped up their game and put out a pair of headphones that are well balanced through the lows, mids, and highs. With the Bose, I always felt like there was something missing with the lows, and Beats really did a good job bringing down the low levels and balancing them out. Overall they do sound a little heavy, but the mids and highs are still crisp and evident whether listening to classic music or watching movies.Wireless:The main reason I went with the Beats Wireless. The Powerbeats wireless made me realize how annoying wires can be especially moving around or doing something as simple as laying in bed. The bluetooth works well and smoothly with minimal problems so far. The headphones quickly recognize the last device you were using with them and transition to another device quickly. Definitely puts the product above the competition.Noise Canceling:Nothing special here. The noise canceling isn't very noticeable compared to the QC15's which are still the best noise canceling for the price out there. I really do wish there was an option to use the headphones without noise canceling to save battery but then the sound quality would probably go down as well. The noise canceling in these headphones is by no means something to brag about, but a nice feature as it most likely improves audio quality etc.Overall:I've had the headphones for only a few days, but I really enjoy them. The big thing to me is the price. I was able to score these for 225 new on a prime deal. For 380, I wouldn't buy them. I put them at the 300 price range like the Bose or non-wireless Studios, but for 225, it was definitely a steal. The sound of the headphone, to me, was and upgrade from the Bose, but the comfort and lack of noise canceling was definitely a let down for sure. I didn't expect the noise canceling to be anything near Bose (which make those the great headphones they are), but the comfort was a big turn off for the headphones. The overall build of the headphones was a nice surprise, but the big win in these headphones was the wireless feature. I loved my Bose and would buy another pair if the price were the same as these, but the lack of wireless really was annoying at times especially when I have a life proof case which means you have to use an adapter to even use the headphones. The wireless means no adapter and no wires. All in all, the headphones were an amazing buy for the price, and if you can buy them for anything near (I saw the blue pair was around 260) they're definitely worth it, but unfortunately I had to give them 4 stars solely for the discomfort I have when wearing them.

p15549
sg5
VI am very happy with these headphones! I absolutely love the wireless feature. This is my first pair of wireless headphones and it would be hard to go back. I got a nice deal on these. I don't know why the Titanium ones were on sale, but they were only $229. And a bonus, I had a $70 gift card balance. I had been researching headphones for a few weeks wanting a new pair. I'd been keeping an eye of the Solo version, but this was too good of a deal to pass up. Titanium is probably the color I would have chosen anyway. They are a little less flashy. That's the one thing I actually don't like about Beats. Beats in general do feel flashy to me, but these are a fantastic looking pair of headphones.I do feel Beats are overpriced and you are paying for the name. However, they aren't as bulky as other brands and I love a deep bass and I know other brands such as Bose have a flatter more even sound. My last pair was Bose. They sounded good, but so far these are better. The sound is crisp and I'm very impressed with it. I do have a set of the Urbeats earbuds that have good sound as well, so I knew the sound would be decent. Of course, these surpass the earbuds.The fit is a little tight, but that also secures the sound and prevents leaking, which is something I hate. I've asked and been told, the sound doesn't leak badly. That is a big turnoff for me, when others in the room can hear what I'm listening to. If there is anything that annoys me, it's having to endure someone's headphone noise in a quiet room. I've been wearing them to bed at night and after a couple of hours, my ears do get a little sore. However, I've only had these a little under 2 weeks, so maybe I will get used to the fit and that will lessen. I've already noticed it's not as bad.My only con is battery life. I haven't had it last 12 hours. Maybe 6-8 of playback. But I plug them in and they charge fast.Overall, I'm very impressed! Would I pay $379 for them? Probably not, that's a lot of money and I'm not sure if they would be worth that. I guess it will depend on how well they hold up. If they last me 2+ years, then maybe I would drop that kind of money. Time will tell. But so far, so good! If you can get a deal on them, I'd go for it. I'm glad I did.

VOverpriced Headphones!Got them for my son. In the 2nd week the right side stopped working. Checking on net I found many other users complaining about the same. Got it replaced by Apple.There is a lag when using bluetooth, useless for watching movies on iPad etc. (again on the net you find users complaining about that)(I also noted lag on the Beats Pill!)Battery discharges quickly if not used. So you need to continuously watch it to be charged and ready when you need it. No exchangeable batteries, you can't have a spare battery.Sound is good, but nothing you can't get with cheaper options.Overpriced!

VI like the headphones. They look and feel good. The sound is good and all of the features are very simple to use. The only reason I am not giving them 5-stars is because the padding compresses down most of the way and your ears will be pressed in (I have very small ears, and even they get smashed) by the padding, causing soreness and discomfort after 30-45 minutes of continued use.

p15650

VUnderstand engineers during development I don't think were Apple's influence. So let's give Apple time to restructure and correct the Old Beats policy on manufacturing utter garbage. Most beats headphones are overpriced junk! Beats were well marketed and people bought into it for the cool factor-however truth be told-bass is overpowering and sound quality always suffers in one channel. Materials is just cheap bad plastic!!! I wouldn't use these over the ear headsets for workout purposes they will easily break.So far I had two of these headsets replaced! I'll never again spend a dime on Beats until Apple improves materials and build quilts.Wait a few years and let's see what Apples bring to the shelf.

p15667
sg5
VThese headphones are great for whats out on the market right now. They are expensive and while I do feel part of the cost is based on pure hype I just was not willing to purchase another brand on a whim. I read a review mentioning the white noise and how that person did not like it, I personally enjoy the white noise as a noise canceling effect and it works well to me. Its a surprising feature and I did not expect it. The headphones are also cool in the way they fold into each other, much different from prior beats.There is also another variety of wireless headphones from beats that are cheaper, those are the older model and the difference is that they are "on the ear" instead of "over the ear", This is a review of the most recent, more expensive over the ear headphones. I do believe the over ear headphones have better sound quality simply because it covers the whole ear and that is my rationale for buying these ones.I previously had the motorola sd-10, I had one of the original...

VI'm not a audio techie by any means & therefore don't know (or care about) the nuances espoused by audio-phile reviewers. All I wanted was a quality set of "over-the-ear" wireless headphones to use primarily when working out because ear buds do not fit in my ear comfortably or securely. So after a little research, I purchased Beats Studio2 wireless in Titanium. Here's my review on what was important criteria for me: The fit is very comfortable: does not shake loose while exercising but is also not so tight as to cause a headache.  The sound is very good to my UNtrained ear.  Easy to use controls. This "over-the-ear" style, which envelops the ear almost completely (vs "on-the-ear" which merely lays on top of the ear) provides a soothing noise-blocking environment. Yes, sweat does tend to accumulate round the ear during a good workout but, like other reviewers, immediately following my workout, I wipe the ear cups with a non-alcohol wipe & dry them off (when I get in my car) so the set is clean & ready for tomorrow.  My complaints?  I have two. First, these were very expensive -- well over $300. Had I waited a few more days before purchasing, I'd have secure this exact set for almost $100 less than what I paid. That's on me cause I was in too much of a hurry. Lesson learned!  My second complaint is that the case is a pain in the butt. It's very awkward to handle -- it's almost impossible to grip the thing because of the shape & rounded edges. Yes, there is a clip provided to attach to a cloth loop on one side of the case which does provide something to grab on to. All things considered, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

Vif you want AWESOME noise canceling headphones
p15701
sg5
VFirst off I will say, if you want AWESOME noise canceling headphones... You will have to go with a  WIRED headset. These Beats do a great job but you really can't compare their noise canceling to the Bose Quiet Comfort.Now as far as Wireless headphones with noise cancellation....I really think these are great. I have been reading a lot of reviews on here that are really hating on these and comparing them to Wires sets which is obsurd. No Wireless headphones will EVER compare to a wired headphone. Wired will Always produce a better sound.So now that we have that settled, let's talk about these wireless headphones. For a wireless headphone I really think the sound is great. They aren't as bass heavy as before and it appears they have really improved the balance between the mids/highs to the bass. Quality seems awesome as well. These really feel like good quality....they feel "expensive" if you know what I mean. I think these are some the best wireless headphones (for non-Audiophiles) out there. Of course you will always have those "professional" audio gurus that say these suck but at the end, it's really about how you feel about them!!!

VAPPLE BEATS DON'T HONOR THEIR WARRANTY!!
p15711
sg5
VWorst experience with Beats since they went to Apple. I will never buy Beats again! The workmanship is absolutely horrible. almost 400.00 headphones that are known to crack at the headpiece. 8 months in and mine did! #CANTLASTAYEAR ... Apple will not repair saying that there was physical damage but yet these headphones have been in the case every single day when not in use and where never dropped. They cracked at the seam as they have done for many others. In the past Beats simply replaced them under the 1 year warranty but not Apple. So no way I am paying 200.00 to repair and get back a headphone that will eventually crack again simply because of the way they are made. So much as I enjoyed the headphones I am done with Beats Wireless or any other Beats Product! I don't do WIRES!! Apple does not honor the warranty so I can spend my funds elsewhere.

Just wondering why Beats isnt consistent in giving the "Beats by Dre Cleaning cloth" despite mentioning it. Yeah I know its just a piece of cloth and I can use ANY(as replied by one of the sellers that i asked) cloth lying around here in my room but based on my experience by having to purchase the Beats Studio 2.0 Wired Over-Ear Headphone previously, the Wired version did come with the cloth and I did saw some unboxing of the Wireless to having the cloth as well. Just wondering.

VMany audiophiles hate beats i get it and there may be headphones that sound as good or somewhat better.

I have used a wide range of headphones including v-moda m80, seinhesser momentum, bowers and wilkins p5 and p7, bose aew2 wireless, sony mdr1 wireless and all the beats models except the mixrs. They were all good headphones but i did not see how the sound quality on many of them were any better than beats despite what some say. The old beats models werent that great but the new studios are nice. The earpads are so soft, the matte black color is slick and they supply plenty of good cables and a hard case! I would describe the sound as fun and comparable to any of the headphones i mentioned in this review. I would say maybe the bowers and wilkins p7 were slightly better but i didnt like the size of the earcups or how hot my ears got with them. For pop, hip... Read more

VAs many have said, the quality of sound you get for the price is lower than I would have hoped for. Make no mistake, the sound quality is good but I was underwhelmed due to the price.So with that out of the way, it's pretty awesome for blue tooth head phones. They did a good job of combining the pause/play, forward/backward, and Bluetooth connect functions into one button. The cables and case were nice and yes, you can fit the cables and even charging plug and headphones in the same case without forcing it.Plus, the base isn't that much in my opinion; they balance sound pretty well, and if you take into account the noise canceling any type of music genre sounds nice on them. You should be able to tell when a sound file was made with good quality and when it wasn't.On the noise canceling, it pretty much only blocks low tones, so high pitches can be heard... But I wore them while walking next to a busy street and it blocked out noise pretty well.Most I can say is they grow on you. No loss of quality when using them wireless at all.I guess I'll go ahead and give it five stars. After all, they sure make you feel fancy

p15787

VThis is absolutely amazing. Previously I had regular studio beats in pink. Those lasted about a year. I revived these as a gift over a year ago and they still work perfectly. Aside from the charging port having a bit of an attitude, (the charger has to be placed perfectly into the port, but holds snuggly after its placed), they are great quality. All the commands can be executed wirelessly from the left headphone. This includes pause, play, volume up, volume done, skip back, and skip forward. They also connect easily with every phone I have paired it with (iPhone 4, iPhone 6, samsung s6, Motorola G, and HTC phones), while with most other Bluetooth speakers don't connect right away or you have to restart Bluetooth many times.  They charge quickly, and the color doesn't chip or scratch. They hold battery very well and will last all day on a full charge. The headphones extend very far and fit every person I know who has tried them. They also play music from the folded position. It also has a port for a cable, if Bluetooth isn't what you want to use it for. It does come with a white and gold cable, and a red and black cable that has the command box on them. The case that it comes with is very durable and I feel very comfortable with them in the case.  Furthermore, the color IS gold. I know it seems silly to say that, but many times a color is advertised, but when you receive it, it's darker or lighter than you expected. This is definitely gold.I love these so much and I use them constantly. Definitely worth it.

VGreat but has problems
p15809

VThese headphone are by far the best wireless headphones I've ever used. The connection stays strong and you can feel the bass but if you like something like pop it's also quiet good at that. It's noise canceling in and mode can block out surrounding noise such as a TV but when people are talking you can hear them. If you were looking for noise cancelation then go buy a pair of qc25. The build quality is okay but sometimes it feels cheap and flimsy, almost as if you could break it by adjusting the the cups. The comfortablity is great. At around 264 instead of the 379 retail price this seems like a steal. You cannot use it without the battery which means if the battery dies so does the music.

VPoor Craftsmanship
p15815
sg5
VThese headphones are very shoddily made and began falling apart almost instantly. Right out of the box, the leather around the left earcup began to loosen a bit. I thought to myself, "no worries, nothing a little superglue can't fix." After all, I purchased them mainly for the sound quality, not aesthetics. A few weeks later, the same thing happened on the opposite side. Next, I noticed that the catch on the left side would malfunction, prohibiting the headphones from remaining in the default (non-extended) position. So the left side would kind of just hang. Subsequent to that, the headband came undone. I've only had these headphones for five months. They are beyond repair with superglue and duct tape. This is my second pair of Beats and I am extremely disappointed because the sound quality was pretty good. Based on this experience, I'm moving on to another brand. One can get poor craftsmanship at a much cheaper price.

p15827

VOk this is my first review on Amazon and I wouldn't have bothered writing a review if I wouldn't have been so terribly disappointed by Beats Studio Wireless headphones.(I bought it for $264 around a week back from Amazon which I feel is the amount you pay for just having that b logo on your headphones). Firstly, I would say that the bass is good in these headphones(unfortunately only the right earphone provides the right impact.. I don't know if the piece that I received was defective) and that is about it. Highs are muffled and even the wireless performance is nothing to boast about. My cheap Made in China Bluetooth headphones have a better range compared to these headphones. Headphones look good but it wouldn't hurt Beats to provide better quality headphones(such is their profit margin). Some people might like it but then you did be blown away by ATH M50s with FiiO amplifier combo which you can get for like $200 combined. I also have an older version of Sennheiser momentum and even I felt that they were a bit overpriced for what you get from ATH M50s.

p15869
sg5
VI bought mine as a Christmas gift for myself last Christmas.  I had planned on using them occasionally while I am at work, or exercising.  When I received them, I enjoyed the sound they put out, and were very comfortable.  After a couple of months, maybe 10 uses total, I heard a loud pop in each ear and the sound quality went to hell.  I called beats and returned them for repair.  To my surprise, they replaced them free of charge.  Now it had only been a couple months later, maybe 10 uses later and now there is no sound coming out of one ear, and I am about to call them again, and how they can be replaced, again.  I had high hopes for these.  I am not a heavy user, user them on occasion, and they keep having issues.  For how much these cost, I expected them to last longer than they obviously do.  I shouldn't have to replace them every couple of months for a casual user.  The Bluetooth feature was why I got these, and it is looking like I need to look into other brands... I'm just not satisfied with them.

VI got these as a Christmas gift from my wife.  She knew I liked to listen to music via Bluetooth headphones so she got me these.I own quite a few BT headphones (Sony, Parrot Zik, Bose OE/AE, LG, etc.), and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at how good these sounded!  After reading all the negative reviews from all those self-professed "Audiophiles", I now doubt their credibility and tastes in sound/music!I also did a 'blind' test with some of my friends and they were very shocked at the results.  They even admitted that, had I told them that they were actually Beats headphones from the beginning, they would have definitely been negatively biased and not would have judged them fairly.The ANC is good, not great.  But for what I use them for (work and home), they get the job done.The fit is comfortable, just make sure you find a good setting and remember what they are.  I find that when it's properly set to my head, I can wear them for hours.  BUT, if you don't, the top of the band can dig into your skull after a while. So finding the perfect fit is really important for these cans if you want to wear them for extended amounts of time.I recommend them if you are not a snobby, self-righteous, Mr. know-it-all, 'audiophile' snob.  If you're like me, and just want to hear your music with good quality sound and fit while still remaining wireless, than these cans are for you!Thanks all!

VBuying for Brand Name is Great! .. but lack cool features
p15903

VFor a few weeks, I was in search for the perfect wireless headsets to watch movies, listen to music, and possibly take calls. The Beats Studio 2.0 did not match my criteria.CONS:Very high in bass, and can barely hear the lows.Does not take callsHeavy on the headNot ideal to wear over long periods of timeNoise cancelling makes a weird sound that may hurt your ears after awhileExpensive compared to other brands in the marketPROS:Noise cancelling optionWell known brand name will make you look cool in front of your friendsComes in a cool hardshell caseA friend told me about the Bose Wireless, so I gave that a shot. Although a cool case is not included, there are many features with the Bose wireless headsets, including 2 bluetooth device accessibility, lighter on the head, nice lows, and I can take calls. All at a fraction of the price of these Beats.There is no noise cancellation but I am able to use it even after the battery dies by plugging in the aux cord, which you can't do with the Beats... not sure why Beats doesn't have this option, it is 2015 you know..

V**I've owned these headphones for about 4 months and use them every day. I did not purchase them from Amazon.**I would have rated these 5/5 if they didn't retail for almost $400 because they are definitely not worth that hefty price tag. But hear me out.They sound great. They're comfortable. They fold up so they're easy to carry around. They're wireless, so you can sync them via bluetooth to your various devices (I've yet to get these to sync wirelessly with my Windows 8.1 desktop, personally I blame that problem on my crappy Chinese bluetooth adapter)Sure there are better sounding headphones for the same price. But I didn't buy these to be absolutely blown away by the sound. I bought these because not only do they sound good, but they look good and they're comfortable. If you can find them cheaper than retail, I say go for it.

VGave this to one of my Granddaughter for last Christmas that will be a Freshman in high school this coming school year of 2015/20116. She still gives me hugs 7 months later thanking me for her BEATS. The only hurdle for this unit is understanding on how to maintain Bluetooth connect-ability between uses on different devices which I had to teach to her but now considers herself to be a big cheese Tech Guru while others have trouble with this issue.

p16221
sg5
VI didn't buy mine from Amazon, I got them from a pawn shop for dirt cheap. To my surprise they were brand new and never opened so I got the full buyers experience. These headphones are a great quality especially if you like heavy, tight fitted ones. I've had them for 2 months now and the sound is crisp and clear, nothing is wrong with them but the second "Call Wire". You get three wires with these, a charging wire , a music wire that's just an aux cable, and the call wire that has the microphone. The back plastic part popped off a few days ago which is no big deal because when you don't use it for calls but it's still a nuisance. I've learned this is pretty common in the wires but can be fixed with some glue ( just be careful not to get the buttons). But other than that great sound, very sturdy, overall great product just be prepared to order new wires.

p16226

VGo buy the Bower and Wilkins P5 Wireless!! I have the beats studio wireless matte black and I thought they were good until I purchased the P5's, no comparison and they're the same price. I bought my beats in February of this year, the foam was infinitely more pliable on one side making them lopsided and now it's only been 5 months and the padding is falling apart. I just sent them back to apple to get fixed and I'm going to sell them when they send them back to me. I just purchased the P5 wireless from B & W and the first impression was WOW! there was such a clear difference in the quality of sound and build. I thought this was a good headphone and if I wouldn't have bought the P5's I would have never known how much I was missing out on. I'm disappointed in these headphones for the quality and build at their price, these are not 400 dollar headphones, on that same note, after listening to the Bower and Wilkins, I said to myself, I would have paid double. Granted, many people buy these because they're beats. I will no longer being Beats headphones in the future. Just to clarify, The sound is fine, it's not bad at all, but after paying the same price for another headphone that sounds so much better, it's upsetting.

The headphones are more meant for indoor use due to their size, but they can be used for plane trips, car rides etc. If you want indestructible or very strong headphones for rough use, like for listening to music on construction sites or related then these aren't for you. Overall I like these headphones and am enjoying them everyday.

VI went to Best Buy with a budget of $300 to purchase a pair of headphones. I listended to Bose, Sony, and of course Beats. I was instantly surprised with the quality of the sound from the Beats Solo 2 wireless. They were crisp, had punchy bass, and were no where near the sound that I was expecting. I had heard that Beats was all name with no sound. Well, I was about to purchase the solo 2 until I decided to give the Studio wireless a try. I had no intention of purchasing these for they were near the $400 mark, thus well above my $300 budget. I was blown away by the openness, punchy bass, and overall fun that these headphones produced. It had solidified my decision to go ahead with the purchase of the solo 2 wireless. As I reached down to grab the solo 2 off of the shelf, I noticed a studio wireless in red being sold as open box for $285 dollars. I could not believe my eyes. I immediately asked the salesperson what was the gimmick. Were they the  previous model, damaged in some way, for they were just sitting there as the deal of century as far as I was concerned. He said no. In fact, he said they were floor samples that the manager decided to put back on the shelf to sale on the fourth of July. He said I just noticed them myself, and was contemplating on getting them if no one else did by the end of the day. Well, you know the rest of the story. I picked them up, took them home, and have been amazed at not only the deal that I got, but the overall quality of build, and premium sound of these headphones. In addition, my kids were all jealous of how cool these sleek red headphones looked as well.

VA great pair of bluetooth headphones.
p16323
sg5
VI've own these pair of Bluetooth headphones for over 3 months now. Here is my review.I will try to keep this review as short and concise as possible.Pros: Offers a listening experience that is friendly to all types of music. Bluetooth feature is amazing with connection length extending up to 30 feet. I can connect the headphones to my phone and leave it on my wireless charging mat and walk 25 feet to the kitchen and make food freely without any cable mess. Another good thing is that the wireless features doesn't degrade the sound quality. Battery life last 12 hours and there is an indicator on the headphones itself that shows how much juice is left. Some phones with newer OS even have a dedicated battery indicator on the phone itself. A nice little touch. These headphones are also extremely comfortable. I can wear them for hours and hours. Glasses doesn't cause any discomfort. Last but not least these headphones, in my opinion, looks really nice. The Titanium color I got with the matte finish helps prevent fingerprint marks as well as make it not so flashy when compared to the glossy counterparts.Cons: These headphones are expensive. I'd say these headphones are probably not the best bang for the buck in terms of tying sound quality with price. These headphones also won't work without charges on the battery. Even on wired mode. On wired mode you will get about 20 hours of use and on wireless mode, as mentioned above, you will get about 12 hours of use. Luckily it charges relatively quickly. The headphones may be really comfortable but the build material doesn't qualify its price tag. The headphones is primarily made up of plastic which is disappointing at this price point but materials choices didn't ruin the comfort levels or the durability levels.Edit (8/25/2015): With the recent price drop, the cost went down to $240. At this current price range these pair of bluetooth headphones offer a much better bang for the buck than the previous $380. I'll also raise my rating from 4 to 4.5 stars (round up to 5 since Amazon doesn't allow adjustments lower than 1) due to the price drop as well as I realized that after 100 hours of burning in the headphones, I noticed a slight yet significant improvement in sound quality.

VWell, I have to agree with many of the reviews concerning these headphonesStylish = YesPricey = Hell YesSound = Better than mostHowever, the ANC feature works only when headset is plugged into device, excuse me, but I purchased a WIRELESS headphones, I want to have use to all the functions of the headphones without having to plug in the audio cable to use it. Luckily I only paid $260 for these and that's too much. I would feel more comfortable at $125 or $150 but definitely nothing over $200.Unless you work in the music industry and your ears are tuned to pick up every sound, I think for the average user, there are better headphones to choose from, like the other headphones I have pictured here.

VSolid wireless headphones for the price. It's not the quality level of Bose noise cancellation but it's worth the trade off for nicely designed wireless sets. I'm only giving it a 4 and not a 5 because they are a bit heavy and the noise cancellation has a too much feedback.

VThe headphones did not have a serial number on the right ear slider, as do all REAL Beats Studio Wireless headphones. These Are Not real Beats Studio headphones. Do your research before you buy. Product description says "what's in the box" - well the first order came with a used pair of fake headphones with none of the literature the new products come with, and the replacement came in a box with a second pair of fake headphones at least with the literature this time.

p16489

VI just got this yesterday and so far I love it for being wire free. The sound is good and clean, and the bass is just right. But I think I prefer the sound and look from the Beat Pro. I got the Matt Black which is 40$ cheaper in Target and looks less fleshy which I prefer.it appears there are some humm now and then from the noise canceling (with or without music playing) when I was walking in the mall which drove me crazy. But it was dead quiet at home. Hence the 4 stars.It is a bit tight and uncomfortable for wearing long period of time (over 30mins). with that said, I may return it and get the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 Wireless (which is 200$US more.)

VBought in January. Great sound. Great convenience from wires. Comfy. Long lasting charge. Sadly, the cover over the foam at the ear is coming apart & the window for return is closed. If I could, I'd do an exchange bc I do love them! Also, they don't fit anyplace that's convenient for me (pocket, purse...).  So carrying them has to be accommodated. Could wear around neck but not with my kids.

VPlays deep bass and has extremely clear high ends. You'll end up hearing things in songs that you've heard a thousand times that you didn't even know were there. I'm no music buff, but I do like my stuff to sound good. These deliver. The wireless connection to my phone is worth every penny. I use these when I'm doing chores like vacuuming or dishes. I use them while I mow the lawn, and trim the sidewalk and weeds. About the only thing I haven't tried using them for is shooting muffs, although I have thought about trying it. The noise canceling feature makes it a great tool to use for much more than just sitting at your computer, it makes doing chores less of a chore!

VI wanted to like these. I really did. I had a pair of wired solo2's that sounded awesome and I wanted to upgrade to something wireless and over the ear so these were the next step up. Unfortunately the sound kept dropping out for seconds at a time when connected by Bluetooth and once the headphones even crashed on me. They literally turned themselves off then back on. I exchanged them and the second pair started doing the same thing. Terrible quality control. Sadly, I'll be staying away from Beats from now on.

VThese headphones could not be a worse value at the price.  Absolutely do not recommend these if you are any kind of audiophile.Pros:* Nice look* Wireless nice and the bluetooth connectivity works well* Lithium ion batter is goodCons:* Very poor mid-to-high performance.  I had heard these about beats headphones but I was surprised that their top-of-the-line product has such poor performance.  Many songs come across as very tinney and there is a lot of crossover noise* The noise-canceling is sub-par.  My 10 year old Bose Quiet Comforts perform better than these in noise canceletion AND sound quality* The headset is uncomfortable after extended wear.  They put a lot of pressure on the ears with no way to adjust and you have to take them off for a while to alleviate your ears.Overall very poor.  Happy to return these and stick with Bose for $100 less like I should have done from the beginning

VThis pair of headphones worked decently well as I was looking for a pair of wireless, higher quality headphones with good sound. I heard that Beats had made improvements, so I tried it out. Noise canceling was present, but there is a faint hiss, as stated by others. The main reason I am giving this item a mere one star is because after less than two months, the headphones refuse to charge. I thought it was the cable at first, but after trying out three different cables, I can assure you it's the headphones.

I primarily use these for editing video and playing sims while listening to Spotify.  I did have a non bluetooth pair from last year in blue, but they broke due to clumsiness.  These are much more comfortable than my blue ones, so that's a plus.

VThe sound it pretty good. The NC sucks! Not even close to my Bose QC25's. I am actually returning them due to the comfort. ITS TERRIBLE. They are so tight on my head.. and they feel like they are squeezing my temples. This problem is coupled with the nasty hiss from the ANC. The combination of the two give me a HUGE headache. I want to like these so bad.. because they look so cool.. but I can't use them daily because of my issues with them.

VThese headphones were designed to "look cool" but the functionality is poor at best. Save your money and buy BOSE over the ear, noise canceling headphones with one AAA battery for power, and multi-function adaptive plug. These phones can be used with ANY laptop, tablet, TV, or aircraft seat input. They are made to last and that is something Bose has going for it. I've had mine for 10 years and many of my friends do too. They work as well today as they did the day I bought them!

p16751

Vone of the few products i've ever bought that's managed to merge itself into every-day use. walking the dog, playing video games, just jamming around the house, whatever - it's all literally next level with these headphones. the ease of movement with no cable is amazing; i never have any issues syncing with bluetooth (but i also work on bluetooth for a living) and these things literally THUMP they sound good. like, physically. there's some sort of thumping mechanism that makes beats sound great although a bit overwhelming (like they should be) whenever you turn them up to full blast.the sound isn't perfect objectively speaking, but i use these more than my Sennheiser HD25-1 IIs because of how dang slick they are. they feel great, they sound great, and best of all they open you up to an amazing world of accessibility while you're listening. 5 stars, worth the bucks to me

VA little bit about myself, I am a avid techy purchasing the latest gadgets every year. Of course I do plenty of research into products that I purchase.I purchased the beats from the Apple store, since I had a gift card.These headphones are overpriced hence why I gave it 4 stars.The quality of the build is great, feels sturdy and durable. Also, the sleek design is what sold me to the product.The sound sure isn't like other headphones but Beats doesn't advertise to be the best in sound quality. Yet I feel these heads phone do a great job at being headphones, because if you're not an audiophile your not going to know what highs and mids even sound like. Since, I love EDM music this headphone is always my go to.The Bluetooth is probably the best I seen on any headphones. The controls work great even on my Galaxy S6. The battery is 11 hours but I don't even use it for that. I mostly takes these to the gym with me, break at work and walking to class.

p16779
sg5
VOk, so here's my review of the new Beats Studio Wireless. I want to talk about each aspect individually so you know what you're getting. I hope this helps.Sound qualityBefore I start talking about sound quality, please understand that 1) I haven't listened to many high quality headphones so I don't have much to compare it to and 2) I love bass so if you don't like much bass these might not sound quite as good to you as they did to me.  So sound quality is one of the most important qualities of a pair of headphones, and I'm happy to say that Beats nailed it in that regard. The music sounds very clear and they are actually fun to listen to. The bass does sound awesome and the highs and mids are nice to. I also love that I can listen to different genres of music and experience the same great sound. For example, I listened to a song with a lot of vocals and not much bass and it still sounded very good. Now I've heard that these may not produce accurate sound, but I don't really care that much. I mainly use these to listen to music and my main goal for listening to music is to have fun, and I definitely achieve that goal when I listen to these headphones.Comfort and FitThis was another area that was very important to me as I wanted to be able to wear these headphones for a long time. I was happy to find that they are very comfortable headphones. Since they are over-ear, they don't put any pressure on the ears whatsoever. The ear-cups are very soft and the headband has sufficient padding as well. The one problem I did experience is that they clamp a little harder than I expected, however this is not a big problem (the good thing about this is that I do not have to worry about it falling off my head at all) Also, I've heard these do heat up on your ears but I have done household chores and such in them and they didn't get to the point where they were uncomfortable. Overall, these are a comfortable pair of headphones that I can wear for a long time.Update: So I've had my beats for a while now and the clamping problem is not as bad as it was. They are very comfortable now and I don't have any problems in that area. My guess is that either they've loosened up after a while or my ears have gotten used to wearing them. Anyways, they are very comfortable now.Design and FeaturesI purchased the glossy black version of these and I love it. They look amazing. They don't look or feel too big, and they are very sleek. They also feel fairly sturdy and very high quality. As far as features go, I love the fact that they can fold up into a more compact design. I also love the noise cancellation. It does work very well to block out sound, and with the music playing I can hardly hear anything (other than the music obviously). If you listen very carefully, you can hear a very quiet hiss while the music is paused, but I can't usually hear it while the music is playing. The battery indicator is nice, and the play/pause buttons and the up and down volume buttons are great too. They are built into the left ear-cup, and you can't tell they are there if you didn't know better.AccessoriesThe accessories it came with are very handy, including a hard carrying case, a charging cable with a usb to outlet converter, an auxiliary cable with control talk, and a regular auxiliary cable. The case does a very nice job of protecting the headphones, and even matches the style perfectly. The cables also seem to be very high quality and seem to be durable.Wrap-upAs I said, these are great headphones and I would recommend them to anyone. For the average person wanting a nice pair of headphones, they sound awesome and are fun to listen to. They are also comfortable to wear and offer a premium design. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase of the Beats Studio Wireless headphones.

VSo.. these look and feel great, but when I took them out the packaging one of the sides didn't work.  I looked up troubleshooting options with no avail.  I had to send these back.  I would say that this was a 'lemon' but my other pair of beats broke after about three months (hence the reason for ordering these).  It seems that this brand has been hit or miss and it is a shame; the sound quality is decent and they always look very nice.I could rate them on looks it would be a 5.I WILL NOT be buying another set of beats over-ear headphones.

VHeadphone DO NOT WORK without the noise cancelling feature so once the battery is dead, they are useless. They do not survive a standard work day so I end up going back to regular old headphones by 4pm. Obviously, these are not the headphones to take on long trips or pretty much anywhere where you cannot plug them in every couple of hours to juice them up for at least 2 hours each time. Very disappointing.Upside: when they do work, the sound quality is good.

VA compromise between features and looks
p16833
sg5
VPros:-Stylish. There's not much else on the market that has this color selection-Comfortable. After ~2hrs of wearing they still feel comfortable (my opinion)-A hard-shell case is included-Sound quality is decent-I've walked across the house from my device and was mostly interruption-free while listening to music. In my experience the range has been pretty good.Cons:-Expensive given the included features and sound quality. You're paying mostly for the stylish looks and the name.-Only 16 increments from min to max volume. This may seem like a lot, but it really isn't. Often I find that one click is too high, and the next one down is too low. The volume adjustments via the headphone buttons are very "coarse".-Power on indicators are very poor. When powering on while wearing the headphones, you get no indication whatsoever except for some noise canceling that occurs. No voice saying (like my plantronics earpiece does) "Power on, xx hours remaining", no power on chime. For the price, you'd expect better features in this regard.-Pairing/connected indicators are poor. My Bose Soundlink Color actually tells me in a computerized voice the name of the device that has connected to it. These headphones only give you a jumble of tones/beeps when a device has connected, and a similar sound when a device has disconnected. It's very confusing when changing devices to figure out what the beeps mean that you just heard. Also, to enter pairing mode you press the power button and look for led's to blink on the outside of the headset, but to hear the audible indicator when connected you need to be wearing them.-No dedicated track forward/reverse buttons. To change/pause a track or manage devices, you have to press (depending on what you want to do) the "b" button either 1x, 1x and hold, 2x, 2x and hold the second press, 3x, or 3x and hold on the third press. Not kidding. Confusing? You betcha.-The noise canceling "hisses" more than other noise-canceling headphones I've owned-The advanced noise canceling mode (which doesn't allow music to be played) gives no audible indicator, often making me wonder if it's in that mode or just powered on and not connected to a device.Maybe at some point in the future we'll have more manufacturers making wireless/noise-canceling headphones that aren't all black or make you look like you're piloting an aircraft of some sort, but for now this is about as good as it gets, which still leaves a bit to be desired.

VAn old audiophile surprised by the new Beats Studio Wireless
p16851
sg5
VUPDATE 12/12/15: Recently my Beats Studio Wireless headphones began dropping the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone, especially when skipping a song. At first I thought it was the iPhone but after testing the Beats with other devices I realized it was the Beats! Reading the forums reveal that this is a common issue. The solution seemed to be a firmware update. Some people mentioned that updating the firmware "bricked" their headphones but I can say that after installing the Beats Updater on my MacBook Pro and updating the firmware, the problem has been eliminated. The headphones have since maintained a solid Bluetooth connection to any device that I connect them to.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Since my family now owns both Bose QC25s (wife's in White/Khaki) and Beats Studio Wireless headsets (mine in Matte Black), I feel like I can finally write a completely informed review and comparison test between the two. I am also a headphone/earbud nut that owns the now defunct Logitech Ultimate Ears Active Noise Canceling UE9000s and eight decent quality earbuds and I have a brother that owns several products that I don't. I have spent weeks comparing and sampling many of these products so I can give you the best review that I'm capable of writing.Testing procedure \u2013 while it's not scientific I spent a lot of time with these products listening to a wide array of music. I left the headsets on my head for hours on end while exercising, doing household chores and flying across the country on commercial airlines. Also, it took me two weeks to write this review as I continued to test and compare the Bose and Beats with a huge library of music that ranged from Eminem to Emmylou Harris.I didn't test the headphones with lossless audio or vinyl records playing through analog tube amps. I used an iPad, iPhone and a couple of different iPods as audio sources since that's what the majority of us use these days. The songs are Apple AAC files sampled at 256 kbps.I'm going to cover every detail that I can think of since good research is imperative before dropping $300+ on headphones. Let's get started...BUILD QUALITY(Winner) Bose QC-25 \u2013 The materials that Bose uses in the construction of the QC25s are absolutely first class. The plastic feels solid and the aluminum feels like it was intended for use in an aerospace project and the padding on the head band is thick padded velour. One issue is the fabric used on the top of the headband. My wife's headphones are the cool looking white with tan ear-cups and teal accents and cord. The white fabric gets dirty really fast. Bose is very aware of this because when I asked an employee at the Bose kiosk at Lenox Mall in Atlanta about it, they told me, without hesitation, that a Tide stain wipe cleans it up. That area should be leather, plastic or aircraft aluminum, not white fabric. The cord (we'll talk about this more later) plugs in with a satisfyingly snug click. The buttons on the cord are the one of two soft spot for the Bose and you'd have to be really picky to fuss over such a small detail but they feel a little cheap.Beats aren't too far off in build quality but they fall short only because they feel a little more "plasticy" and fragile when folding them for storage in the included case. The shuttle buttons built into the beats logo on the left side feel a little "clicky." Compared to the previous generation of Beats, the new Studios are a lightyears ahead in build quality. While I am testing the wireless version of the Beats Studio, they still come with cords, lots of cords. The one that I use most (to extend battery life or plug into non-bluetooth devices) is the one with the shuttle buttons. The cord is thicker than the Bose and is less tangle prone. Out of the box it does not lay straight but keeps some of it's rolled up shaped, especially in the cold. This lessens with use. The buttons click with a much smoother, satisfying click (again, picky but what the heck). I had a hard time getting the micro USB plug plugged into the headphones for charging. The plug was very tight but over time it loosens up a bit.COMFORT(Winner) The Bose QC25s are the lightest weighing and the lightest clamping headsets I have ever put on my head thus making them the most comfortable, especially when wearing them over long periods of time. After wearing my Beats Studios for 20-minutes I put on the Bose and they felt funny they were so light. They felt like those OLD Walkman headphones that were nothing more than a bowed wire with foam and plastic discs on each end. In reverse, after wearing the Bose for 20-minutes, the Beats felt noticeably heavier.The Beats aren't what I'd call heavy and without the two side-by-side, the Beats feel pretty good even when wearing them for an hour or more but in direct comparison to the Bose, you feel the difference. Additionally, Beats clamp harder so they fall short of the Bose in comfort.To put numbers on the weight:\u2022 Bose 196.6g\u2022 Beats 260gAnother win for the Bose is the depth of the ear cups. They are deep enough that people with large or protruding ears will not have an issue. In contrast, the Beats ear cups are much shallower. They are so shallow that my small, non-protruding ears touch the foam pad inside the cup. It's a minor annoyance will bother some people. See accompanying photo.SOUNDThis is what we buy headphones that cost over $300, right? Just so you know, when listening to music, I like to hear all of the sound that the producer and sound engineer intended. I'm not a bass-head but more of a bass-o-phile in that I prefer full, smooth, defined bass. Skullcandy has these headphones called Crushers that have a slider where a user can dial in the amount of skull crushing thump that they want. Dialed up to the max, these things almost bounce off of your head. While it may be fun, the bass is terribly artificial and completely lacks detail. It's not what I call good listening and the fun wears off pretty quickly.(Winner) Beats Studio Wireless. Beats products are well known for their huge, Hip-hop bass. In early versions Dre and Company made the bass more of a novelty rather than a quality audio asset. Fortunately, they reeled in the bass when designing the Studio models. The bass is now lighter, tighter and so well controlled that it's much more pleasing to listen to across a wide range of music. I was in an Apple Store in Nashville, TN when I first donned a demo set of Beats Studios. I started flipping through the demo music on the iPad Touch and I was very impressed with the sound, track after track. Months later, a demoed another pair at the Apple Store in Georgetown, DC and was again really impressed. So, eventually I pulled the trigger and bought a pair.In order to give you a review that you can replicate and hear the differences for yourself, I tried to pick tracks that showcase the strengths and weaknesses of each headset. If you can get your hands on the hardware, see if you agree with me on these songs.Timbaland and Elton John team up for a song called "2 Man Show." The very first beat is a deep bass hit that sounds rough and unimpressive but stay with it and at 0:44 some smooth, harmonic backing vocals come in with an underlying bass line that is really deep...oh but wait...at 0:48, the bass line goes down about a low as speakers, let alone headsets, like to go. When listening to this song on Definitive Technology home speakers with internal powered subs at moderate volume levels, the room shakes. Amazingly, the Beats fully enunciate the smooth, deep audio with no distortion to the point that it shakes my head. It's awesome and a true test for bass capable headphones.When the chorus starts in "Break Up In A Small Town" by Sam Hunt the Beats Studios deliver every decibel that the sound engineer and producer meant for you to hear, and they throw the kitchen sink at you. Turn them up and at 0:50 (when he sings "She would get DOWN...) you will be treated to a beautiful bass hit that kicks of a window rattling chorus that when heard on these headphones sounds absolutely marvelous. Bass hits like that terrify weaker headphones. The Beats take the challenge so easily that they make it clear they can take more. A cool thing happens in this song at 2:44. All of the heavy electric instrumentation immediately stops leaving only a light piano and solo guitar with Sam's voice. It's like someone suddenly unplugging half of the music. The cool thing is that the Studios handle the transition extremely well. I compared an old pair of first generation Beats using this same track at 2:44, the heavy bass headphones left the mid-tones hanging out to dry, revealing their inability to clear mids and solid vocals. The Studios on the other hand sounded as good with a wall of sound crushing your skull as they did listening to melodic acoustic tones.But bass isn't the only thing the Beats Studio's deliver. They do a great job with details in the upper register too. "No More Miracles" by Kid Ink starts off with Elle Verner screeching out "I never waited on a miracle, there ain't no miracles 'round here" over a strumming mandolin. The Beats deliver her vocal rasp with such precision it's almost like she was in the room with you. As a light bass line enters the mix and you can clearly hear the bass player rapidly fingering the string to keep the line humming along with the vocals. Using the Bose, the bass line sounds artificial, like it's being produced from a synth. Later in the song, at 0:24, well delivered bass kicks in as the song goes full-on Hip-hop. I'm so accustomed to sloppy Hip-hop that when you hear this song on the Beats, it's like hearing it for the first time. This song can be a challenge for some headphone as a delicate mandolin can easily get drowned out by deep rumbling bass but the Beats show their balance as both are forward and clearly audible. Listen to this track on Beats Studios for the first time and once it ends you'll want to play it again. I promise.Diana Krall and Bryan Adams (yeah, that one) cover "Feels Like Home" written and originally sung by Chantal Kreviazuk. Diana's piano is so well reproduced that it sounds like she's playing it right behind you but the best part is that Diana's whiskey, lounge-singer voice drifts like wisps of cigarette smoke gently floating into your ears. Every detail of her complex voice is revealed with crisp audio clarity. If the seventeen seconds of Diana's voice and smooth rolling piano, between 0:51-1:12 don't convince you that these aren't just Hip-hop bass beasts then you are either tone deaf or biased against the Beats brand. This short moment in time is near audio perfection and the Beats deliver it flawlessly.When my iPhone shuffled across Little Big Town's "Girl Crush" I stopped what I was doing, sat down, closed my eyes and took in subtle details of the song that I had only heard through Shure SE 535s or my home Def Tech home speakers.Contrary to what I thought before owning them, Beats Studios are definitely a headphone engineered for serious music listeners. Note that they are not neutral or flat but they are balanced. Purists will still snub their nose at the manipulated EQ but it's perfect for people that stream Spotify or listen to tracks downloaded from iTunes. For those that sit at home listening to Wagner or Beethoven on vinyl through tube amps on $1,500 Sennheiser H800 or Grado PS1000s, the Beats are not for you. But for the other 98% of us, they will seriously impress you.**Interesting note. I had read that the Beats sounded better over Bluetooth than wired. I was a little perplexed and a lot skeptical. After hours and days of testing, I have to agree with that reviewer. The BT slightly outperforms wired. The wired sound is a little muffled sounding compared to BT. I'm still perplexed but no longer skeptical.Bose is not known for bass and the QC25s live up to that reputation. They are on par with the QC15s they replaced but that's not saying much. Where they shine is in the mid range, exactly where the Beats are weakest. The highs and lows sound muffled compared to the Beats but mids are more revealed.Bose produces amazing, but slightly muted, vocals and smooth instrumental tones. Close your eyes while listening to both "Beethoven's 5 Secrets" or "Kung Fu Piano: Cello Ascends" by The Piano Guys and you'll hear a cello sing with such a mellow baritone voice that it'll feel like it melts like butter into your ears. I played "Cello Ascends" for a co-worker to get his opinion of the two headphones. When using the QC25s, he sat there with his eyes closed totally absorbed in the superbly reproduced music. When the song had finished playing he pulled the headphones off and with a huge smile said, "Wow. With the noise canceling on, I totally forgot I was at the office. You can get lost with those things on." I felt that was a solid review of the Bose when listening to songs that deliver mellow, mid-range audio that don't have demanding bass.But, if you go back to Sam Hunt's "Breaking Up In A Small Town," you just don't get the punch that you get with other bass rich headphones like the Beats Studios. Don't get me wrong, these things sound pretty good but they don't deliver the same, full listening experience. They provide detail and precision but without the ultra deep, rich sounds that physically move you and the crystal clear highs. If these are all you listen to, I don't think you'd crave more bass but if you do any A-B testing with the Studios, you'll hear what you're missing and wish for more.The same thing happens in Pittbull and Marc Anthony's "Rain Over Me." During Marc Anthony's main riff a huge bass roll drops from a low to almost sub-sonic in the first two seconds of the song. With the Bose on, the bass fades as it bottoms out. They just can't handle the low frequency.NOISE CANCELINGBOSE WINS BY A MILE...or more. I used the Bose side-by-side with the Beats on a commercial flight and with the music playing at modest levels, the Bose QC25s filtered out what I'd call 90 percent of the engine noise. Bose has PERFECTED Active Noise Reduction (ANR). Bose owns ANR. Even without music playing they greatly reduced engine noise.In the housework test, yes I'm Renaissance man that vacuums and cleans toilets, the Bose nearly drown out all of the vacuum cleaner noise and help take my mind off of the mundane chores.A common side effect of non-Bose ANR systems is hiss. Bose ANR produces absolutely no hiss.I was severely disappointed with Beats ANC (Adaptive Noise Canceling) performance while flying in a commercial airplane or while riding on a Washington, DC subway. While I gave Bose a 90% ANR effectiveness, I'd give Beats 50% at best. I had to crank up the volume to uncomfortable levels to get the jet engine noise abated to the levels Bose was delivering. Without music playing, the Beats might as well not have had any ANC. This is again surprising since Beats claims to have dual adaptive noise canceling modes. From the Beats Website "ANC automatically strikes a balance between your music and the world outside. If you only want to use the headphone to cancel external noise, ANC only mode automatically increases the level of noise cancellation, for a quieter world." Huh? The owners manual does not tell you how to get to these modes so one is left to figure it out them self or just assume that when music is playing, you are in music mode and when it is not...you know what I mean. BUT, I did figure out that if you press and hold the "b" button while listening to music wirelessly, you will get the Beats power up/down tone and the headphones will switch to non-music ANC mode. Press and hold and it will switch back. I could not find this explained in the owners manual.In the housework test, the Beats don't fully erase the noise of the vacuum cleaner but they help. Where they DO shine in the housework area is NO CORD! More on that below.As a general rule, we don't spend half of our life flying in airplanes. Most of our listening is done in residential or public spaces where Beats does a decent job reducing ambient noises that can interfere with your overall listening experience. Subways, street noise or at home with a clothes dryer going in the background are great examples of sounds that are well reduced by the Beats.As for the hiss, it's mild compared to sets like the Ultimate Ears UE9000 ANR but it's presence can be a little irritating, especially when you know ANR like Bose exists.If you want or need perfect ANR performance...go Bose. Period. End of story.WIRELESS(Winner) Beats has proven that Bluetooth can sound great (even better than wired). They have nailed BT with the Studios. I am so spoiled by the BT that I find using a cord to be a tangling, snagging hassle. The one issue I have is that I cannot get Siri to activate using the "b" button in wireless mode (remember pressing and holding the "b" button switches ANC modes). She only works wired using the inline iPod controls. Sad, but not too much of a problem and I can reach into my pocket and activate Siri from the phone.One oddity is that the shuttle buttons on the outside of the ear cups only work in wireless mode. You have to use the in-line iPod controls on the cord when wired. BUT, while wired, the "b" button becomes a bypass button. Press and hold the button while listening to wired music and the headphones mute (not pause) so you can converse with out yelling or needing to be yelled at. Pretty cool I guess but since the majority of my listening is wireless, this does not work.As I mentioned above, while doing housework wireless wins! I have caught the cord of other headphones and earbuds countless times on drawer pulls and yanked the headphones off of my head or the buds out of my ears. When washing cars, working around the house or just multitasking, wireless is the way to go, good ANR or not!For Bose, this is an easy one since the QC25s don't come with a wireless option. Bose does make a non-ANR wireless model but they fail miserably in audio quality. Why not merge the two products into one and make a great sounding, noise-canceling, Bluetooth headphone? That sounds like a winning product to me!While doing housework I have to route the cord into my shirt to keep if from snagging on things. Not ideal.CALL QUALITY(Winner) Beats Studio. The call microphone is on the side of the headset. Everything I know about sound leads me to believe that a caller on the other end of the line should not hear me as well as the in-line mic hanging below my chin on the Bose cord. But that is the case. I talk to my brother a lot using the Beats and he tells me that he cannot tell that I'm not holding the phone up to my ear.Bose put a mic on the back of the inline iPod controller that lies right below your chin. It's perfectly placed for great audio pick up but even in the best conditions it has a slight speakerphone sound that disappoints me a bit. It's still clear but not as clear as the Beats.EXTRASAccessories(Winner) Bose comes with a case, two-AAA Duracell Batteries, a cord (in the white version) with shuttle buttons and mic and a commercial airplane adapter.Beats comes with a case, a red mobile phone cord with black shuttle buttons, a black cord without buttons, a red USB-to-micro-USB charging cord and a USB wall plug with folding prongs.Bose wins Accessories for two reasons. First, being battery powered means no extra cords or wall plugs (no matter how Beats spins the supposed benefits of the rechargeable battery thing) and second, the airplane adapter. Beats can keep the straight audio cord and power accessories and give me battery power and an airplane adapter...although there would be nowhere to store them (see below).Cases(Winner) The Bose case is as thin as you can make a headphones case and comes in a very standard rectangle shape that fits into any messenger bag, back pack or suitcase. The small footprint and thinness mean some origami folding of the headphones to get them seated, but Bose solved for that and even embossed a diagram on the inside of the case (thank you). It has a place for a spare battery AAA battery (awesome) and airplane adapter. One oddity is that the pocket for the cord is on the outside of the case. I'd greatly prefer that the pocket be inside. My wife never puts the cord in the outside pocket, she just sets it on top of the headset and zips the case closed. She's afraid that over time the stretchy material will lose elasticity and the cord might fall out while traveling.The Beats case is oddly shaped like an egg. It fits in my Osprey Spin 32 backpack and in my carry-on-sized suitcase but it is awkward to carry in my average Timbuk2 or leather messenger bags. Beats must know that this is an issue as they include a carabiner that allows the egg to be clipped to the outside of a bag. The egg-shape is much harder to deal with and it has NO pockets for cords and accessories. A very strange omission for a headset that comes with THREE cords and a wall plug!POWER(Winner) Bose uses a replaceable, off-the-shelf AAA battery for power and I LOVE IT! If your battery dies, just pop in the spare battery that's nestled in the carrying case. If you forget to replace that spare? Not problem, the Bose will work without power while you make your way to any store that sells AAAs.Beats website says "Dead batteries can kill your vibe." Uh, okay but what if the internal rechargeable battery dies and you can't get to a power outlet? That kills your vibe even more since you'll have no sound. In this case, no charge means no music since the Studios only work with power, just like the old QC15s did. I'm not sure why Beats decided to do this but it was definitely a conscious decision that I will speculate was done because without the powered amp, the tuned equalization and the minimal adaptive noise cancelation working, the Beats don't sound very good.NOISE LEAKBose are so light and the head clamp is so relaxed, they leak way more sound than the Beats.SUMMARYBose and Beats both makes quality, well engineered products for which people are willingly to pay a premium for the brand name and the performance. It's amazing how opposite these headphones are but that fact makes it easier to decide between the two.Listening to certain genres, the Bose sound good enough to justify their price point. Add in the superior noise canceling and they are worth every penny. If you are a traveler that needs ANR headphones in noisy environments and loves great sound, buy the Bose.If you use headphones in more civil environments and love deep, rich bass and crisp, clear highs that accentuate the subtle nuances hidden in your music, get the Beats Studio Wireless.Or you don't mind your music artificially manipulated to enhance today's music and you like your tunes to vibrate your noggin once in a while and can accept mediocre noise canceling, go with Beats Studio.As both brands evolve and develop qualities of the competitive products, the consumer will be the winner.I hope you find this review helpful.(One word of warning, the Beats and Bose will reveal poorly sampled music. Get ready to update your library to 256 kbps AAC or better)

VThe battery doesn't last too long, and compared to our other (great brand) wifi headphones, it falls behind. Comparing to a second headphone (also from the other brand, non wifi), the noise canceling on the Beats is WEAK. It's almost as if there is no noise canceling. Maybe I am spoiled, but my other headphones have longer lasting battery and a ridiculous noise canceling capacity (same price range).Now, the looks are unbeatable, it is gorgeous and, for listening to music, I like it better than the other headphones I mentioned above. If I am watching a movie, the Beats doesn't necessarily stand out.My dream-come-true would be having the best of these 3 headphones combined into one, but since I haven't found that yet, I will use each one of them according to my needs. In the end, it wasn't that much worth the purchase, but I am keeping it because I need a wireless device - my old noise canceling headphone is wired and the wifi one that the battery lasts much longer is my son's.

VI purchased my Studio Wireless headphones in February 2014, prior to the Apple takeover, and couldn't stop telling people how great they were. They are very comfortable, have a long battery life, do a decent job of noise-cancelling, and the sound quality is outstanding. The reason I only give them a 3 out of 5 stars is because they broke today (5/12/2015) a mere 15 months after I purchased them. When I say they broke, I mean the plastic on the headband above the left ear-cup SNAPPED while I was simply putting them on. Considering most people's heads aren't only 6 inches wide, it's required to spread the ear-cups to put them on. I find it to be ridiculous that there would be such an obvious stress point on the headphones that it wouldn't be addressed before going to market. Now Apple is providing the "support" for the headphones, and of course my warranty ran out 3 months ago.I have taken very good care of them since purchase, having them inside their case whenever they are not in use. For the price of $400 I was hoping that these would last for several years before I decided to replace them with whatever was the latest and greatest at the time.

VI wish I could write two reviews as I love the sound quality for these headphones, but the pair I own have fallen apart. First the left ear adjustment bar came unattached, and now the right ear pad has disconnected from the arm. These earphones are not meant to be worked out in. I

VThe wireless part of these beats did not work for me. I called apple services and they said it was most likely a hardware problem, and advised me to return them, which I did. I still gave it two stars because it worked great plugged in, and the costumer service at Apple who apparently handle the beats product was very courteous.

VThey're amazing, but after about 3 months the battery life has declined sharply. I used to get about 15 hours of use out of them before recharging and now I'm at about 8. If you're considering rechargeable (vs. battery only) definitely go for the rechargeable option since replacing batteries would really add up! A must have for anyone who travels by train or plane a lot.

Vthis is based on the pair i received from huppins, it seems repackaged and used with hair follicles attached and all over the headphones. the right hinge is more loose than the left..bluetooth worked as expected though. while the second pair, the right hinge was looser than the left but  the left side practically dangles, making me feel like it might break, but again the bluetooth is working as expected.Update: since i had 2 bad white ones i decided to switch colors l(and pay extra) for a titanium one, almost perfect pair, alot better than the 2 white ones. Only issue is the cusion on top isnt glued on right. Im just gonna keep this one since i think its the best ill get.Update 3: the cushion is getting worst, its already starting to get undone as pictured.

VI bought these headphones on February 23rd and it's now April 20th and the headphones are already broken. They won't connect to Bluetooth anymore and when I use the actual plug in from headphone to iPhone, the music only plays out of one ear. I love these headphones but I'm incredibly unhappy that I paid almost $400 for them and they only worked for a very few months and now I can't return them.

VI purchased the headphones in spite of reports of questionable reliability. Comfortable, stylish, decent sounding. My teenagers and spouse wouldn't use them because they didn't want to break dad's fragile looking headphones. I was so concerned with physical damage I didn't anticipate that the electronics would be the first thing to fail. Static on the right side speaker. Sounds like noise canceling circuit messing up and makes them unusable. I did enjoy about 10 hours of use before failure. About $38 an hour for use. I can't return through Amazon. I will now test out Beats warranty customer service. I would probably purchase through a brick and mortar store as opposed to Amazon next time simply because a real person is more likely to help me with a product failure.
