VWow, I have been waiting literally years for a quality set of wireless headphones. I listened to many including the previous generation of Sennheiser's. All of them had some low level of hiss and less than audiophile sound quality. The wait is over. These cans utilize Kleer technology and an open design. I always preferred open headphones for the more natural bass response and to my 50 year old ears these sound great. The headphones are comfortable though I would like a bit more padding spanning the entire headband. The buttons on the headphones that control power, volume and balance (handy if you have asymmetrical hearing deficits) are too small and flat but I can now control the volume without removing the headphones. The range is listed as being up to 100 meters and practically speaking, as I can walk on either floor of my house and even outside in my yard without any noticeable effect. Every 30-40 minutes I may get a brief 1 second or so loss of sound but it is infrequent enough to not bother me. Expensive and surely not equivalent sound to an equally or more expensive pair of cans but they are very close in terms of sound and the wireless performance makes them the real deal, totally worth it.

VOK, I've got all these. The RS 160, 170 and 180 's along with the ear buds, MX W1 .THE HEADSETS:They all work well together or separately. Most importantly, when pairing them to the same base and adjust the volume on one headset, the volume will change on ALL the units with the exception of the RS-160 's. They'll work independently and are likely the best choice for adding additional pairs.Not much to say about the MX-W1's. They're portable and that's it. They don't compare to the headsets. They do sound clear. The highs sound good, but there's a noticeable lack of bass.The 180's sound the nicest over-all for all material. They're also VENTED so your ears won't sweat during long usage or in a hot house. They also give the best airiness/surround sound when paired to the 170's base. They're also the most comfortable for long sessions. I never knew it, but your ears do get "tired". Additionally, these provide the least privacy. Not that they're loud, just that they can be heard clearly on it's highest volume with someone a couple feet away and still notable in the next room.. For normal TV usage, it really shouldn't be a problem, but music or a good movie could depending on your situation.The 160's and 170's sound EXACTLY the same and are the best for music, especially bottom heavy material. They're CLOSED units and are best when you need privacy... I.E. bedrooms, late-night. These are my fav's except in late summer.... lol, you take them off and get instant relief..... you didn't really notice how hot your ears were till you take them off. On the upside, they make really good ear muffs in the winter!THE RECEPTION:First and foremost, these do NOT work well through walls when compared to the RS-130's. The MX-W1's work reliable from 10-15 feet away, no matter the base unit it's paired to. The 160's, maybe 25-30 ft with it's base unit and NO walls. I couldn't tell a difference between the 160's, 170, or 180's when pair to a full size base unit. I'd say maybe 100 feet, line of sight and around 20-40 feet through a wall or 2, depending on thickness. After that, they're unreliable. If you want the best reception, you'll need to go back to the old model. The RS 130 's were my goto's for several years and goes through 6 inch thick concrete! Maybe 100 yards through numerous walls. They do start cracking up as you go, but you can still make it all out. Unlike these new models that either work clearly or don't transmit anything. The only thing that effects the reception for me is the microwave. If you're within 5-8 feet, it will come in and out.THE BASES:MX-W1 - Just good when you're on the move. I only use it with my PC when at home.RS-160 - We have several PC's and TV's in our home. We use this were it's needed, usually at night, VERY convenient, works on 2 AA's and is great for portability.RS-170 - I LOVE the 170's base. The BASS and SURROUND work with ALL of these headphones when paired to the 170's base. The 180's left / right function will still work when paired to the 170's base, but WILL NOT effect the other units paired with the 170's base.RS-180 - This unit is the most expensive, least useful to use when pairing multiple unit together. It's got a left/right balance control that is only useful for people with a bad ear. For me, it gets in the way and there shouldn't even be buttons on the headset. You should be able to just set it and forget it, not like your ears are constantly changing. I always find myself screwing up the balance when laying down or simply thinking I'm wearing the 170's and was looking for the bass button.Bottom Line: They ALL pair very well to EVERY base, regardless of how many units paired to the base. The 170's base unit is most useful, especially when pairing multiple units. The 160's headsets are best to use in this situation as the volume control will still work independently of the other headsets paired to the 170's base. REMEMBER, ALL the other headsets will trigger each others volume control whenever any of the volume controls are used.

VI bought and returned two other pairs of wireless headphones in the sub-$200 price range before springing for these, and simply put they are worth the extra money. There's no interference, the sound quality is excellent throughout the range (bass, mids, highs) and the hiss that plagues most other wireless headphones doesn't exist. Range is also excellent. The only thing to note is that the base station does not have optical audio input, only a standard 1/8th jack.

VI have used the Sennheiser RS-130 for the past 4 years, and the surround sound was incredible and delicious, but I was looking for an upgrade, the next generation from a high quality manufacturer. My main uses are for blu-ray movies and late night TV viewing as to not disturb any neighbors, plus it's an intimate experience without any street noise. When I decided on the RS-180 I bought it from J & R because their customer service is outstanding. The DVD product guide estimated an initial charge of up to 16 hours, but mine was ready for blastoff in about 7. I was immediately blown away, swept into a cinematic oasis, a sound panorama that disintegrated any assumptions about how a movie should leave a lasting impression! They are exceptionally comfortable and well worth the price, and you will not be disappointed!!! Without a sound system hooked up to my Samsung 1920 X 1080 HD-LCD TV, I realize now I haven't totally appreciated the blu-ray player and movies until this wireless headphone purchase. Thanks to Kleer's uncompressed audio transmission technology another journey began via listening to some of my favorite blu-rays like Oliver Stones "The Doors". WOW!!! The bass sounds are outstanding and precise. You will venture forth into a new world of audio pleasure. If the Sennheiser RS-180 was a painting it would be a masterpiece by Kandinsky or Dali; a sculpture, La Pieta via Michelangelo, a song, something by Lennon & McCartney. Remember this: escape is not a luxury, it is a necessity if you want to get an advanced degree in sound and mind travel. Now get out and buy these phones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VSennheiser RS 180 Wireless Headset -ALMOST Perfect
p30
sg5
VHaving previously owned the earlier RS 160, I knew the quality of these "cans."  The RS 160 didn't have enough RANGE to cover my home, and wanted the increased range and AGC (automatic gain control) to tame loud passages.  I am THRILLED with the new RS 180!  It covers my whole home and out into the yard for a little distance.  You'll never get the rated 100 metre range unless the transmitter and receiver are both outside and in the clear, but the range of this pair is very adequate!Only complaint I had was that the control buttons are FLAT on the edge of the right earphone.  THAT WAS EASILY SOLVED by mixing up a small batch of acrylic polymer resin, and applying ONE DROP to the volume + and volume - buttons.  After it dried in about an hour, it left those buttons with a raised "bump" that my fingers can easily find.  The on/off/standby button is between the volume buttons, so it is now easy to find with my fingers also.  With this easy modification, I give this headset a solid 5 STARS.  Too bad Sennheiser didn't do this at the factory, but it is very easy to do at homeThe sound of this headset is outstanding.  It fits comfortably on the ears for hours of use without discomfort.  The AGC works VERY WELL indeed.  The two AAA NiMh rechargable batteries will run the cans for 24 hours, and all I have to do to recharge them is to "hang" the headset on the transmitter.  Nothing to plug in.  When, in time, the batteries are exhausted, I can simply purchase replacements at the grocery store and change them out in less than a minute.I was SO PLEASED with the RS 180, that I purchased a second pair to carry with me to field locations.

VOne major flaw, a couple minor flaws
p35
sg5
VI have used the Sennheiser model 130's for years and have been perfectly happy with them.  I found them very comfortable and could wear them continuously without any discomfort.  The sound quality has always been great relative to other headphones I have tried, and I had no reason to change to another model except for two things.  First, the rotary volume control can easily change if you are lying down and make contact against the controls.  I have adjusted to this by switching the headphones around so the volume control is on the side away from where I typically lie down.  Second, I thought how nice it would be if the headset had a line out so I could choose to connect a speaker at a remote location if I wanted not to be wearing the headset.It is for these two reasons that I was curious to see if Sennheiser had a solution to the line out idea.  I called Sennheiser and spoke to someone who said that the 180's do have this feature.  I was excited about this alone, but I also learned that the volume controls are flat and therefore will not accidentally change as per my first point made above.  Of course, I was excited to learn about the other enhancements such as higher quality sound (remember, I was already happy with the sound quality of the 130's), the automatic level control, which has the benefit of leveling out the highs and lows to provide a more intelligible spoken voice, and the potential for the range to be expanded beyond what the 130's have (which don't bother me since I don't travel too far from the base station).Here's what I found about the 180's after one day of use.  First the good things.  Yes, the quality of the sound is excellent.  Whether it is much better than the 130's is a perception thing since I can't at the same time be hearing both.  If I had found an issue with the sound quality of the 130's, then the 180's would have solved it.  I've tried these with music and TV, and both sound great.  Regarding the volume control, there is a tradeoff.  I find the 130's much easier to change volume since it is a simple roll of a wheel but the 180's won't change volume while lying on my side.  The 180's do take some getting used to if you want to change volume while you're wearing the headphones.  You need to go by feel, and I suppose after some time this will become easier.  There was a comment by someone else about this where he developed a workaround by applying a small drop of adhesive on each of the two volume controls, and this gives the same feel as the home keys on a computer keyboard (the F and J keys have raised dots).  Regarding range, there may be some slight improvement but not dramatic.  It is sufficient for my needs.  Lastly, the 180's are as comfortable to wear as the 130's.Second for the negatives.  Regarding the main point of my search in the first place, I was given incorrect information when I was told by the Sennheiser rep that there would be a line out or port on the headphones that would give me the ability to attach a speaker remotely.  This is simply not true, and I don't know why he told me this.  This is not a negative about the 180's since maybe nobody is looking for this feature except me, but it is a severe mis-statement of fact by a Sennheiser representative.Now for the big complaint I have, and a reason why I will probably return the 180's in spite of all its good points.  There is a slight out-of-phase problem with the source sound.  If the TV sound is on while I'm also listening through the 180's, as is the case when someone else is watching TV while I am watching with the 180's on, there is a slight delay in sound at the headphones that provides a very irritating dual sound experience which is hard to explain since it's not quite an echo but just the sensation that the sound is coming from two sources, the headset and the TV.  With the 130's, which I have used for years, this does not exist.  If I'm wearing the 130's and the TV is on, I only hear the sound from the 130's.  Both the 180's and 130's are open, so this is not explained by some type of closed environment in the 130's.  It is something with the technology of the 180's that creates a slight delay in sound transmission.  If you never need the source to be on at the same time you are using the 180's, this will not be an issue for you.  For me, it is very typical for the TV to be on for others while I am using the headphones.This out-of-phase problem is not something I hadn't heard about before.  Prior to purchasing the 180's I read reviews to the extent they existed (the 180's are a new product) and found a review where this problem was pointed out.  In my discussion with the Sennheiser rep, I pointed out this reviewer's comment about this and the rep said to just turn down the TV.  After I said that wasn't an option, he then stated that the 180's won't behave any different than the 130's.  FALSE!  I don't know why this Sennheiser rep, whose name I won't reveal but who sounded like he was in the know, or should have been, couldn't simply be honest with me.  While he did achieve his objective of getting me to try the 180's, he is also now responsible for a returned set of 180's and this negative review.  He has done a disservice to his company, in my opinion.In conclusion, you won't be disappointed with the quality of sound and comfort of the 180's -- top notch.  If the sound source will be on at times when you're wearing the 180's, you will probably be bothered by this.

VGreat headphones (with a few minor annoyances)
p41

VThese headphones are excellent. After listening to music with mediocre headphones for the last few years, the RS 180 opened up a whole new level of details to my music. I'm impressed by the clarity and 'crispness' of the sound and good reproduction of lower frequencies.Pros:- excellent sound quality- comfortable to wear even for an extended time- electronic noise almost not noticeable, no 'hiss'- easy to set up and useCons:- may interfere with wireless network- power button on base station difficult to operate with one hand.- usable range in realistic living environment significantly smaller than advertised, idealistic range- small delay may be a problem when using as hearing aide for TV- noise threshold causes cut offs during very quiet partsLong review:The headphones are light and comfortable to wear even after several hours. In fact, I would forget that I'm wearing headphones if it wasn't for the music. Thanks to the digital transmission there is no static noise and the electronic noise is almost unnoticeable. The sound quality is great and can compete with high-quality wired headphones. The unit is easy to set up and can be operated with normal batteries or rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are charged when the headphones are placed on the base station. I like that the unit includes several useful accessories: the power supply comes with country adapters, the main audio connection cable has decent length (2m), there is a 3.5mm jack socket to 6.3mm jack plug adapter and a 3.5mm jack socket to 2 RCA adapter. A cable mount and binder help to install all the cables neatly. The RS 180 base unit also has RCA outputs. In this way it can be integrated into an already existing connection between a sound source and an amplifier.The overall good impression is impaired by a number of minor problems, though:The KLEER technology for digital transmission promises to work without interfering with other wireless devices, such as wireless phones and wireless networks. However, I observe interference of the headphones with my wireless network: one of my computer loses the wireless internet connection occasionally. Sometimes it would work for several hours without problems, sometimes the connection dropped out every few minutes. Everytime the connection was re-established as soon as I switched off the RS 180 base station, so there is a clear link. This happened when the base station was located close to the computer. After I relocated the RS 180 base station to the other side of the room the situation got much better. So far, I haven't encountered any more drop-outs. I also noticed a negative impact on the speed of my wireless network if the RS 180 base station is located near a computer. In my experience one has to separate the RS 180 base station as far as possible from a wireless computer network. Note that I never noticed any interference effect on the RS 180 headphones.Transmission from the base station to the headset seems to require the input signal amplitude to pass a certain, small threshold. As a consequence, transmission cuts in and out during an extremely quiet part of music. It is therefore a good idea to follow the suggestion in the manual to turn up the volume of the input device as much as possible (but avoiding distortions) and to regulate the volume directly on the headphones.The range within my apartment building is about 70 ft before the connection brakes up (the Sennheiser web page declares a rage of up 100 m = 328 ft line of sight). The usable range certainly depends a lot on the specifics of the building and I can move around anywhere within my apartment without transmission problems.Both the base station and the headphone are easy to operate. It may take a little time to get used to the buttons on the headphones while wearing them as they are not easy to distinguish by 'the feel'. The only real complaint I have is that switching the base station on or off requires two hands: one for pushing the power button and the other one for keeping the base station in place. It would be better if the base station could be powered with just one hand.A general feature of wireless headphones appears to be a tiny delay in the signal. This is only a problem if the headphones are used as a hearing aide when watching TV, for example. If the headphones are used in parallel with the TV speakers I notice a small delay in the audio coming from the headphones. It's tiny but noticeable and causes an echo-like effect. However, I'm not using the headphones as a hearing aide so it's not a concern for me.The RS 180 has an open design so that outside noise is not suppressed. This is a design feature, not a disadvantage and results in a more natural sound reproduction. But if environment noise is a concern then the closed systems RS 170 and RS 160 may be a better choice.In summary, I can recommend these headphones because of the high audio quality and ease of wearing. The problems I encountered could either be resolved (interference) or are only minor annoyances to me and are outbalanced by the superb sound experience.

VIn almost every respect, these Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphones are excellent:- The good experience starts with the packaging.  The main box, the two inner boxes and the inner plastic container are very well designed and built like tanks.  They're also fairly easy to open (the fit of the plastic container containing the actual headphones and base was a bit snug, so there was a bit of tugging there).- Setting the headphones up is very easy.  It boils down to 1) connecting the audio cable to the source and to the headphone stand (I used the LR adapter and connected them to the back of my TiVo TCD658000 HD XL Digital Video Recorder), 2) picking the correct country-specific plug to snap onto the power connector and plugging the result into the wall and into the stand, 3) putting the two batteries into the headphones, and 4) listening to the results.  In my case, I used my own already-charged NiMH AAA rechargeable batteries (900mAh vs their 600mAh), so I was up and running immediately instead of having to wait the 16 hours the documentation says the initial charging should take.  The one minor quibble I have here is that it took me a bit of effort to figure out the pictograms in the setup manual.  Mitigating that, Sennheiser includes a CD with the full manual on it and their web site has a downloadable version, too.  The full manual uses actual, honest-to-goodness words and pictures instead of those pictograms.- Every aspect of build quality is excellent.  Everything is well designed and well constructed.  It all feels very solid.- And, most importantly, the sound is absolutely amazing.  There's no extraneous background noise at all:  no hissing, no hums, no snaps, crackles, or pops.  The only thing coming through the headphones is a beautiful reproduction of the source material.  The sound coming through these FAR surpasses anything coming out of my VIZIO Class XVT Series TruLED XVT472SV 47-Inch 240 Hz sps LCD HDTV (Black).  Even better, when listening through these, I don't lose the voices in the music (as happens through my television speakers).The only minor gripes I can come up with are that 1) the buttons on the headphones (specifically the volume up/down buttons) are not very finger-recognizable:  I have to remove the headphones to adjust the volume (perhaps the problem will go away once I become more used to things), and 2) my head and ears feel a bit warm when wearing the headphones.  But, then again, I live in Florida.  So, that's probably an unavoidable issue.  However, all my complaints combined don't add up to the loss of a full star.  So, I'm very happy to rate these headphones at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.

VIt took me a long time to pull the trigger on these headphones, but believe me it was well worth the the money.  I am not an audio geek by any means....so this review is for the normal everyday person that would like a pair of quality WIRELESS headphones to watch TV at night or sit out on the deck on a summer night with a cold Bud Light without fear of waking any neighbors.  There is no static or hum that comes through these headphones....I REPEAT NONE!!  I ventured about my backyard with them on and at 60-75 feet from the base they tended to cut in and out.  I have the base unit behind my flat screen to keep it away from the grandkids....I'm sure if I had it higher the range would be sufficient enough to go 75 plus feet.  I am the kind of TV watcher that constantly inches the volume up bit by bit until the wife screams bloody murder at me to TURN IT DOWN !!!  No more!!  The last pair of wireless headphones I tried were years ago.  I am telling you what....these are the ticket.  Guys if you are ever banished to the Man Cave and still catch hell for the TV or movie being up too loud......worry no more.  I realize they are a lot of money (I managed to get mine for under $230) but I think in the long run they are going to be worth every penny.  FIVE STARS !!!!  I have never given anything five stars until this product came along.

VThese headphones were a replacement for a set of 5 year old Sennheiser RS120 headphones that we wore out (which had in turn replaced a cheaper set of headphones).  Our 97 yr old mother uses them to watch TV.Positives: The sound quality is much better than the 120's.  Also the RS180's fit on her head better than the RS120s which were always loose (and would fall off when she looked down quickly).  In my opinion The RS180s are worth the extra $.  I would definitely recommend these.Negatives: Our most major complaint is the design of the controls.  The RS120 model used one wheel for on/off and volume control.  The RS180's uses three small flush-mounted buttons for up/down volume with the On/Off button BETWEEN the volume buttons!  All three buttons are in a 1 1/2 by 3/8 inch space with almost no way to feel which button you want.  Not an easy task for any fingers, much less older fingers.  We partially solved that by putting a small foam pad on the on/off button (thus separating the volume buttons).  But why should we have had to invent a solution?  One other complaint, both the base unit and the headphones automatically shut off when the headphones are being recharged.  Then both must be turned back on to use the headphones.  The On/Off button on the base unit is very, very small and not easy to see if a person has vision problems and cannot be easily felt.  A light flashes slowly when the base unit is on, but is dark when it is off.  In an effort to make the units sleek, there is almost no tactile or color differential to highlight any button on either the headphones or the base. Again, we invented a solution which works for us, but the whole headphone unit seems to be designed more for appearance than ease of use.  The whole unit does look nice, however.  I'd rate it a "C-" in ease of use and an "A" in sound quality.

VTop notch, if latency is of no concern
p63

VI've been using the Sennheiser TR120 wireless headphones for several years, plugged into my M-Audio fast-track for practicing and playing guitar along with iTunes, and also for recording.  They worked really well, but were definitely lacking in sound quality, and had a handful of other shortcomings.  I decided to spend more. A LOT more.  The RS 180s, once set up, sound fantastic.  Really.  They are very high-quality.  However, in order to move that much more sound data through the air, more time is needed to get from point A to point B, which means latency.  Extremely noticeable latency.  Probably about 1/3 of a second.  That may not sound like much, but when you're playing 32nd notes on a guitar, what you're playing gets to your ears 4 notes later than you played it, making these completely unusable for the application. For those listening to passive sound sources (stereo, iPod, etc) you can't go wrong.  For those watching TV, as long as your TV or other equipment has delay compensation, you'll be fine, too.  For active applications such as gaming or playing an instrument, however, these are out of the question.  A real shame.

VOk first the particulars.  The evaluation system consisted of the following:  Sony STR-DA5200ES, Sony (Costco) BDP-BX57, Sony CDP-CX335.  The Blu-ray player was connected via HDMI & the 400 Cd Mega-changer was hooked up via analog connects. SACD were demoed both as 2-channel & Multi-channel.The initial impression with the RS 180's is their extreme musicality.  That is to say every note was rendered as a distinct & succint item.  Next, is the warm sound.  If you want headphones that are strident, then look elsewhere. I started off with a SACD (Super Audio CD) sampler from Concord Jazz (Volume 2).  Track 2 of this disc is one that I am quite familiar with as I also have the complete SACD where this song came from.  That song being the wonderful Nature Boy by Nnenna Freelon.  I know this is cliched, but I literally heard notes that I never heard before.  The headphones presented a very wide soundstage with ample presence but not too much "air".  As I stated above these are very warm sounding headphones.  This was, no doubt, influenced by the headphone amp of my 5200ES.  You would think a $1500.00 dollar receiver could do better, but alas that is a nit that I shall pick another day. It is easy to use these cans for long periods of time as the ear pieces are comfortable & compliant.  Listening to the very forward & lively CD, Greatest Hits by Duran Duran instantly transported me back to 1984 (17 is teh best age, evah!) as I reveled in the amazing musicmanship of the band.  I had forgotten just how good (& well produced) these guys were.  Next to Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I don't think another pop act captures the zeitgeist of the 80's as well.Next I moved on to a Blu ray concert of Hall & Oates Live at the Troubadour.  This is were the warm fuzzies of these headphones really paid off.  In this casual close-miked setting I felt as if I was actually there & had to resist the urge several times to turn around & "see" the rest of the crowd.  I should note that while I was listening to this selection I was moving around my approx. 1100 sq foot apartment with no loss of fidelity at all.  I finally ended up with the Blu ray of Transformers.  Now again I have to mention that my Sony receiver was found lacking.  Since it cannot process the lossless codecs via bitstream, everything was fed to it as PCM.  This caused the receiver to automatically apply its own processing (aptly named Headphone 2CH).  In a word I did not like it.  You could tell it was trying to distill the 5.1 mixes down to 2 channels & frankly it did not do a good job.  Voices were diffused & effects were too front & center.  Also, I had to play with my receiver volume & the headphone volumes several times through my listening today.  This was entirely the fault of the Sony.  Having said that, the sheer ability of this set to reproduce sound simply overcame the shortcomings.Setup was fairly easy as there is an ikea like pictogram (with words in several languages) that show/tell you how to get started.  First charge is supposed to be 16 hours, I let them go roughly 24 hours.  Others have mentioned that the controls on the right earpiece take a little to get used to.  Maybe it was the forewarnings, but I had no trouble.  The headphones are light & I hardly noticed that they were, in fact, on my head.  I like that the charging station gives them a "home" to go to.In a word, the Sennheiser RS 180 remote headphones are just about perfect.  I did not give them 5 stars across the board, because I feel that they are about 2 tenths away from that.  The high end could be just a tad more broad, the soundstage is (IMHO) too wide, but for less than 300 bucks, you could not do better.

VSennheiser HD 598 v/s RS 180 v/s RS 170 Mini Review
p75
sg5
VSennheiser HD 598 v/s RS 180 v/s RS 170 Mini ReviewI went to the Sennheiser office for demo of their headphones.I preferred RS 180 in this lot because the sound quality was nearly as good as HD 598 but with more thumping bass and very little difference in clearness and clarity, while being wireless. HD 598 was a bit better but not by much.RS 180 was significantly better than RS 170. RS 180 has more quality and quality of bass compared to RS 170 even with bass boost enabled. The clarity is better with RS 180. It was deeper and more authoritative and with a much deeper and wider soundstage. It wasn't anywhere close to as loud as RS 170 though. And RS 180 didn't leak much sound, not enough to be heard outside the room. HD 598 did leak much more sound though, still not enough to be heard outside a moderately soundproof room.I proffered the sound signature of the RS 180 the best. The treble of the RS 170 was better than the RS 180 however the mids were best with HD 598, almost as forward and good with RS180 and slightly worse with RS 170.All three had forward mids. I tried the RS 180 velour pads on RS 170 and the difference between the two was reduced by 30-40%, the RS170 improved a lot by doing just that. And it was also more comfortable.In retrospect, I would prefer to buy RS 180 over RS 170. The price difference isn't as much as the difference in quality. The difference is not night and day, but certainly noticeable and very significant. Not worth upgrading at full price unless you can sell the previous can for at least 70-80% of the purchase price though.I recommend the RS 180 over the RS 170 at current pricing. Surround option is decent but just Dolby Headphone isn't bad either. And RS 180 has better bass quantity and quality than RS 170 anyway, partly due to the velour ear pads though. The HD 598 is like marginally better than RS 180 except for thumping bass but then the bass with everything nearly as good makes the RS 180 a clear winner if you can afford it. Especially since it is wireless.But all this was with the Lehmann amp which costs about 750 pounds. My Asus STX card doesn't power my RS 170 anywhere close. The difference from the Lehmann amp is nearly night and day with it being far livelier, open, with a bigger soundstage and brighter as well. With an STX card you don't get the same effect with a RS 170. It isn't even close.

VReplaced RS120. Better sound, very poor range and more
p80
sg5
VI bought two RS180's headphones to replace RS120 I used for years. The sound of RS180 is definitely superior to RS120.  But the range is 20-30 ft at best (in direct view!) so that it's pretty much impossible to move around the house without loosing the signal. The signal drops when I go to the backyard, 15 ft away from the transmitter through a glass door (still in direct view). RS120 had strong reception in all these spots.The worst: I use 2 headsets with one transmitter station, RS180 system is self-tuning that is you don't manually tune the frequency, it does it for you. This sounds like a nice feature, as you should not manually tune the headphones any more. But if one headset looses the signal, the transmitter station starts searching for the signal to self-tune and THIS knocks off frequency the second headset!! That is, signal drops in both headsets at the same time even though one of them is in the range. With the clear operation range of only 20-30 ft it make the RS180 pretty useless for me.To the manufacturer: the claim was that 2.4GHz was supposed to boost the range without interference, but it not even close to RS120 running at 926MHz

VSignal detection mechanism automatically shuts off transmission of low-level signals: hearable, distracting and annoying
p86
sg5
VI am very disappointed in this headphone. I simply cannot understand how a fine company like Sennheiser that makes such a marvellous sound equipment decided to introduce a wireless headphone with a signal-to-noise-ratio of 85 dBA and using it with a transmission system (Keen) that shuts off the sound completely at low signal levels, as if that were unhearable.In almost every recording there is some very low, natural sounding background hiss, that you are totally unaware of UNTIL it is suddenly turned off completely, as if the apparatus itself were turned off. Precisely in the most subtle or sensitive passages in music or tensed moments of silence in dialogs, you are distracted by this constantly turning off and on and off and on of the transmission.Did nobody with Sennheiser noticed that?

VA- for wireless headphones

VI'd rate these A- (4.5 out of 5) as far as wireless headphones go, and probably B+ (4 out of 5) out of any kind of headphone out there. The sound quality is nice, they handle bass without breaking a sweat, and lighter notes as well. There's silence where silence is to be expected; if there's hissing present in what you're listening to, you'll hear that as well. You can listen to quieter things like dialogue without that annoying ever-present hissing though, thank goodness. I guess it all comes down to your source, but plugged into a good reciever they can work very well, especially if you turn them up a step. If you go in expecting a revolutionary sound experience, a "lifted veil" and sounds you've never heard before, I doubt that's what you'll find (unless you've been listening through some standard iPod headphones your entire life or something). The real gift of these headphones is how well they are overall; the pads are soft and comfortable with plenty of room for your ears to "float" (there's only a slight pressure on your head, but they don't become fatiguing and are not too heavy), installation is pretty easy (lift the cups and insert the batteries, hook the right power cable into a socket, the cord into your source, add the optional gold-plated adapter, charge them for around a day or so). When they're ready, start the source, hold down the button on the base for a few seconds until it blinks, and hold down the button on your headphone for a few seconds until they blink, done.What are the weaknesses then? They handle sound-levels so well that you might be a little deceived. Playing video games for example, the menus were soft and subtle, and the actual game music explodes with vivacity; it's easy to strain your ears by underestimating how neutral they can be. If your source is turned up enough, you can fine-tune the volume on the back of the headphones with your right hand. There's been many complaints over the buttons being "feel by touch", but they're clearly shaped and easily used if you ask me; your thumb goes right on top for the extra big "plus volume"-button, the middle button is embossed with a power-logo which is easy to feel, and below that is the minus button which has a clearly felt bottom edge. Navigate around it with your right thumb as soon as you begin to use them and you'll be quickly aquainted. The only "real" problem I've run into so far has to do with the charging time. They're supposed to be fully charged after 18 or 20 hours if I remember correctly. After 24 hours and 45 minutes, that little orange light was still blinking, so I gave up and used them anyway. Sure, they worked fine, but I've since found that it takes somewhere between 36 or 48 hours for a full charge (leave them charging for two days and that infernal orange light will finally disappear). But this is just a nitpick really, they can still be used, and it should be noted that I'm using the batteries which came in the package, there are probably a lot better rechargable batteries to use out on the market. I can't vouch for the range though, I have little reason to prance around with these. But as for upstairs and downstairs in the same house, no worries. If you're going out jogging for miles, don't take anything for granted. Take in mind the open design though; if you're in the same room as someone who's planning on sleeping, you can't turn these up too high. If they're in a completely different room with a closed door, you might be able to. I haven't heard any complaints about that, but lifting them off my head, I can tell they're definitely broadcasting the music outwards quite a bit.The RS180 are a blessing as far as wireless headphones go. If you want to get up and grab some snacks while you're watching a movie, sit in the couch and play video games at night, or clean the house while rocking your favourite disco tracks, look no further. If you're an audiophile who demands the absolute best and wants to hear every note of Tchaikovsky, it won't be on these. But regular pop or rock tunes work just fine, same goes for video games and movies, and that's good enough for me.

VOh my gosh! I am so glad I spent the money for these headphones. I have been researching various models and brands and I decided to go with these due to the reviews here on Amazon. I am not a technogeek but I know good sound when I hear it. These have no hiss or any other interferences as of yet. I can walk around my house and not miss my program. I got these because my late night tv watching was interfering with my husband's sleeping, and I can cook and not have to crank up the tv volume in my dining room which interferes with family watching tv in the living room. The set up was fairly easy although I did have to print out the manual from the included software. I would have preferred to have a nice manufacturer booklet. The packaging was so secure, it took me some time to actually get into the box. Initial charge time is around 16 hours but I couldn't wait so I used them after 12 hours. Five hours later, I went to bed but the sound was still great. Customer service tells me that extra headsets are not available until around June '10. These headphones also come with rechargeable batteries. The headset is comfortable and it was not difficult for me to get used to the sound adjustment buttons. I highly recommend these and I wish I hadn't waited so long to buy them.

VNot Perfect, but Best Wireless Headphone Yet
p102
sg5
VFirst, let me say that these come highly recommended.  Sennheiser fixed some of the problems that plagued their previous wireless headphones.Pros:1) Headphones stay on, regardless of source volume level.  This is a hassle with the RS 130s as they shut off when the volume was low.2) Integrated charger/transmitter means no batteries to replace and the phones are always handy.3) Looks far better than the RS 120s or 130s.  If you've got to look at them all the time then they should look good and these do.4) Phones charge faster than the RS 130s.5) You never hear static or noise from these headphones.  When you get to the limit of the range they just cut off.6) Adjustable balance control is a handy feature that, although seldom used, is completely absent on most headphones.Cons:1) Pricey (but worth it)2) You've got to manually turn on both the phones and the transmitter.  I guess you could just leave the transmitter on and save a step, but I'd rather not.3) Hard to find those little buttons on the phones to adust the volume.  You've got to memorize what they do and find them by touch. Too easy to accidentally turn the phones off when all you wanted to do was adjust the volume.4) Range is low.  I've had wireless headphones that you could use outside of the house, but these cut off at around 40 feet.  That said, these are no worse than the RS 130s.

p108

VThis is my third set of Sennheiser wireless headphones. These are the first I've tried with the digital "Kleer" transmission, and it really does reduce the hiss and static compared to my previous RS 130 set.  Comfort, range and sound quality exceed my expectations.My main complaint is the controls, which are much harder to operate than the ones on the RS 130.  The volume is controlled by two little buttons that you have to feel for -- if you're adjusting the volume without taking them off, as most people will want to.  (Even taking the headset off to look at the buttons won't help if you're listening in the dark, as I like to do sometimes.)  There are actually three buttons in a row, and the one in between vol+ and vol- is the on/off button, so if you try for say vol+ and miss, you turn the headset off. This seems completely stupid to me, sorry if that seems harsh, but the controls were so much more copacetic on the older, cheaper headset.  The RS 130 volume control was a wheel, like a scroll wheel on a mouse.  Intuitive, and impossible to get it confused with anything else.I also dislike having to turn the base unit on, then turn the headset on, every time I put them on.  The old 130s would turn off when I hung them on the base/charger, and turn on automagically when I lifted them off and put them on.  The On button on the RS 180 base is stupidly designed also: When I push it, the base just slides out of the way, unless I hold the base unit down while pressing.  All they would have had to do is put the button on top, so you press down, and then the base wouldn't slide away from you when you press it.  Or better yet, just have it turn itself on when it detects sound input, like the old 130s did. I shouldn't have to touch the On button at all.I took one star off for these dumb design decisions.  If my nitpicks don't sound like they'll be an issue for you, then buy 'em and enjoy.

VBest Sound & Worst Performance
p114
sg5
VHad been very disappointed with 3 Sennheiser previous lower-end models of cordless phones, so I tried their top of the line digital RS180.  Initially I was blown away by the best sound I have ever heard from cordless phones -- as I sat in one position in a chair near the base station and listened to an entire CD.  Unit seemed to have good workmanship, fit well and comfortably on my head.  But when I had the nerve to try listening to music while standing and moving about the room, sound was only heard in short bursts of static and music with dead silence most of the time.  Every move of my head or body killed the sound.  Turning on any appliance (vacuum, microwave, et al.) killed all sound.  I even tried turning off my computer's Router (2.4 MHz) at the other end of the house, but no improvement in the headphones' performance.  Once I got more than 12 feet from the transmitter, there was no sound at all other than the occasional brief burst of static.  I had planned on listening while working around my house, a small one-level in the AZ desert, but this was fully impossible.  After 3 weeks of trying everything I could think of to make them work better, they were returned to Amazon for a refund.  I am now happily using  Brookstone analog cordless phones, and the sound is clear, loud, and steady all over my house and immediate yard.  The sound is quite good though not the superb performance of the Sennheiser (on the rare occasions when they worked), and the fit and comfort are not fully up to Sennheiser.  Plus a drawback: my 2.4 GHz router does have to be turned OFF or the Brookstone phones do not work well, but I can live with that limitation.  Definitely, the Sennheiser name (once a proud brand) is off my list of acceptable brands I might purchase in the future.  ---LarryKJ, Wickenburg, AZ

VI got this because I didn't want to disturb my wife when she was sleeping in the bedroom and I was watching a movie in the living room. Once I got the hang of it, it works perfectly. I'm used to listening to 5.1 channel stereo on speakers, and so it's a bit of a comedown to hear only stereo, but the placement of the speaker stage is really good. This particular model tends to emphasize the center channel, which is good for me because I usually find dialogue is mixed too soft against music. So wearing these, I hear the dialogue much better than with the speakers. I think there's another similar model that is made to emphasize the "feel" of a five-speaker system.I find that in my house I can walk ANYWHERE and get a clean signal. I imagine those who complained about a hum or buzz or something else have some location issue, like lots of walls, florescent lighting, or a conflict with the frequency the headphones operate at. I use a DECT 6 wireless phone system, and have a dual-band wifi network in the house, and NEITHER interferes with the clear sound.One last thing, which is amazing: these headphones (which surround the ear) are actually comfortable enough to watch a double-feature (okay, maybe taking a short break in between). I think these may be the most physically comfortable headphones I've ever worn.

VGood, but be aware if you like solo instrument music
p131
sg5
VI've owned these cans for a month now, and I can say this headphone is not bad. I listen to classical music mostly (90%) along with a bit of rock music and others (10%).To me, it took about 20 hours of listening to break in. At the beginning, brass and voice especially sounded rather recessed and dull. But now they sound upfront as they should. Also, the cans sounded too mellow at first, but they sound much more neutral now. It is still rather on the "warm" side, but I would say only to a pleasant degree to my ears.To be specific.... Sound staging is quite good. Bass is full, prompt, and accurate. Range is rather limited, but I was going to use them indoors mostly anyways, so it is not a big deal. Control keys on the headphone is not really well designed as many reviews pointed out, but i can live with it. Convenience factor of a wireless headphone is a huge plus.Then...Why only 3 stars?The main problem that bothers me is the presence of "noise" especially when listening to solo instrument music. Even at a not-so-high volume, quite audible noises kick in when a piano player playing piano sonata, for example, hits keys strong enough. What happens if you raise volume further?? You hear severely distorted sound (or "clipping").(However, for other genre of music where many instruments play simultaneously, RS180 doesn't show a similar issue and it is usually my ears, not the headphones, that cannot take any more before clipping kicks in.)I am no expert, but here is my guess for the issue.Your music is sum of all sound waves at different frequencies. When you listen to a symphony, you typically have a wide range of frequencies going from ~20Hz to ~20kHz. But when you listen to piano sonata, you have narrow peaks at a few frequencies in the sound spectrum at any given time. At a similar volume level recognized by your ears for these two different kinds of music, there should be much larger wave amplitudes to be delivered by your headphones in the single instrument case compared to symphony.The "KLEER" wireless transmission should have a certain threshold for "clipping" for any narrow frequency range. The problem, I believe, is that this threshold is set rather low either due to technological limit or for safety reasons, and this limit leads to sound distortion at a not-so-high volume when you listen to solo instruments. (I don't think the clipping comes from the diaphragm itself, because my other Sennheiser headphones handle similar volume levels without a sweat.)To exclude the possibility that other parts of my system is causing the problem, let me point out that my RS180 is plugged into an amplifier (Rotel) capable of handling lots of amps of currents. I tried various combination of volume levels on the headphone and on my amp, but I couldn't resolve the issue. I talked to a Sennheiser rep to get around the issue, but I figured that they don't have solutions to this either.... And yes, the transmitter is set at -8dB.Despite the problem, I didn't return these cans because they do their job for most other genre of music. Again, convenience of a wireless headphone (and decent sound when it works) certainly secures its spot in my man cave. But still, I should go back to my good old, "wired" cans when I listen to single instruments. Hope Sennheiser comes with better wireless cans next time.

VSound quality is great for these headphones.I have two problems with the HDR 180:1) The placement and size of the buttons on the headphones to turn them on and off and adjust volume and balance is terrible.  The buttons are tiny and placed very close together.  The only way to do anything, whether it be to turn them on or off, adjust the volume or adjust the balance is to take them off, turn on lights if necessary, and watch what you're doing.  I'm a person who can pretty much do everything on a TV remote in the dark by touch.  With these headphones, I can do nothing by touch.  The most important button, the on-off, is between the buttons to change the volume.  It should have been off by itself.  All the buttons are more or less flush with the surrounding case and this makes the problem worse.  In the end, the only way to change anything is to take them off, turn the light on and watch while you press the proper button, which on the face of it seems silly.  I have big fingers and that makes all of this much worse, given the minuscule size of the buttons.2) Previous versions (RS140 for example) turned themselves off when they did not get a signal for a while.  That meant that you walk away from them and they would shut themselves off, saving precious battery life.  The HDR 180 shuts off the sending unit, but not the headphones when the signal stops, for example when the sleep timer on the TV shuts it off.  That means that you have to physically walk to the base station to turn it on to resume.  The RS 140 stayed in some sort of sleep mode and came on when the signal from the TV returned.  The headphones themselves, by contrast, have to be turned off manually.  Given the tiny buttons, that means turning lights on to do it.  This is the exact reverse of the way the RS 140's worked and the previous method was far superior in daily use.Again, I like the sound, but hate the interface.

Simple, straight forward.And the transmission? Yeah! Clean and crisp. These will probably be the best set of headphones around your houseor office and will enable you to rediscover music and put a smile on your face.I do realize it sounds a bit over the top, but it really was like that for me.I love the sound, I love the fact that when the song is over there is no hiss or static... Next song comes on and it emerges out of silence as clean as with a wired pair.IMO it definitely delivers for any listener with a keen ear as well as for anyone who just wants the comfort and ease of use.Very happy with my purchase and worth every cent to me.+ the battery life is amazing too!

VDespite Amazon lists this item as "Sennheiser RS180 Digital Wireless Headphone System with Dynamic Surround Sound", this is NOT the model with surround sound. If the surround sound feature is important to you, RS 170 is the one you want.I purchased the RS180 from Amazon. No until I openned the item, read the manual, and confirmed with Sennheiser's website, I realized that Amazon made a mistake on listing it as "with Dynamic Surround Sound". RS 180 has something call ALC ("Automatic Level Control" enhances speech intelligibility). Sennheiser made no claim to have surround sound feature in the manual or their website for the RS180. Unlike the RS 170, the Dynamic Bass Boost & Surround Sound on/off buttons do not exist on the headset.  RS 170 is the one with Dynamic Bass Boost and Surround Sound simulation features.Amazon promptly accept our return request and we placed the order for the RS 170. Good customer service! Hope they fix the listing title soon. Very miss leading.

VI had the RS130 headphones and they lasted me around 10 years before finally dying. Got great use out of them. I could put them on and go from the TV lounge to my home office and work on my computer all whilst listening to CNBC for the latest financial news or another general news channel. I could even go outside and catch some sun or go to the kitchen and make a cup of tea or coffee. The sound was great and there was hardly ever a dropped signal.So, I bought the RS 180 thinking that these would be superior as a much newer model. What a huge disappointment. If you put them on while your main speakers are on you get an echo delay that is very annoying. Secondly, when I go from room to room or outside as I used to do, the signal cuts out almost as soon as I leave the TV room.However, the actual sound is better than the RS130 but not by much.I will be taking these back to the shop and  using my really old RS 45 instead.

VSuperb headset with some minor shortcomings

VI have owned these Sennheiser RS180 headphones for about a month (bought them elsewhere from a reputed online dealer) and am completely satisfied with them. My positive and negative experiences are listed below.1. Crystal Clear, Great Frequency Response, Wireless Works Great -- After about 50 hrs of breaking-in, they really open up and shine. They are very airy (typical of expensive open-air designs), bass is very balanced (not booming), and extremely good frequency response all the way up as far as I can hear. I can even pick up nuances in some tracks that I hadn't heard before. These are good for extended listening periods since they don't fatigue the ears due to the lack of boominess. Bass heads will be disappointed, but all other music lovers will definitely love these. The earpads are super comfortable too, and these headphones are super-light - almost all plastic, but they seem to be OK in fit and finish and will probably last a decade unless I walk over them several times. The digital transmission system from Kleer is almost flawless, but you will probably get half the range they claim. If I move 3 rooms (3 walls in-between), I get occasional sound drop-outs (about 1 sec) but no loud buzzing or shrill sounds. But that's not a big problem.2. Setup - I had some problem with interference when I first set them up; the transmitter and receiver would lose sync frequently). But after moving them about 3 feet away from my other wi-fi equipment, the problem seems to have gone away. The cords provided are long enough (5-6ft) long to allow placement adjustments. I have tested the RS180 with my HK DPR 2005 receiver, with a Squeezebox v3, an HD TV and a Blu-Ray player, all in different rooms. Seems to work just fine. You don't have to fiddle at all to get them to work. It took me a while to realize that the power led on the transmitter is also the power button. Once you power up both the transmitter and the headphones, it takes less than 5 seconds to sync and begin listening.3. There is a slight delay about 100 ms (in my unscientific estimation) due to the pre-processing/transmission-reception/post-processing. Not enough to cause any noticeable video-audio sync issues - I looked hard, and couldn't see any sync problems. But, if you turn on the TV speakers and use the headset as well, there is definitely an echo effect due to the headset's lag. However, if you turn down the TV volume to a somewhat low level (or turn up the headset volume) so that the headset "overpowers" the TV speakers, the echo effect diminishes greatly. But for general listening from your stereo, or late night TV/BluRay/DVD watching, the quality is superb. There are no sound drop-outs within the same or adjacent rooms. But, of course, since these open-air cans, they will leak some sound. So, that is not acceptable, you need to look at the RS160 or the RS170 closed cans - but remember that those will have slightly different sound quality.4. The supplied rechargeable batteries seem to last 16-18 hours on a charge, which is very good. Best of all, these are standard AAA size, so when these die, you won't have to hunt for expensive proprietary batteries. A big plus!5. The only shortcoming (and for this, the product gets a star deducted) is that there is no optical input to the transmitter! All devices nowadays have digital line outputs. The transmission itself is digital, so it is strange that there is no provision to accept a digital signal as input to the transmitter. Perhaps, it's a cost-cutting decision?

VBest Wireless Headphones On The Market
p163
sg5
VSound Quality-I've had the priveledge of hearing some the best headphones on the market both wired and wireless and I can honestly say, when it comes to sound quality, you will not find a wireless headphone that's better. Sure Sennheiser's HD650 sound better to me, but can they grab a snack from the kitchen, or allow me to keep my little rugrat out of trouble while I can still hear the movie or music I'm listening to clear as the sky is blue?... Nope, they can't. IMHO for under (...) you would be hard pressed to find a headphone, even wired,  that you could tell a noticeable in sound quality difference over the RS 180's if you aren't a headphone aficionado.Transmission-The move to KLEER technology is a godsend, no more crackles and pops found in the wireless headphones of yesteryear or for that matter yeasterday. This is especially important these days with so many possible sources of interference in our homes.Comfort-What's not to like about plush earpads, a well padded headband, and just enough pressure on the sides of your head to keep them snug, but hardly notice they are on?Noteworthy Features-I have always had difficulty hearing dialogue in movies, especially whispering...fortuneatley these headphones automatically adjust volume levels when speech volume is lowered so that speech intelligbility is always maintained. It also has balance control for those of us who need it louder in one ear instead of the other.The buttons on the side are an improvement over the 120,130,and 140 models becuase you can lay down with them on and not accidently adjust the volume. They do have one flaw though, who decided that putting the power button between volume up and down?...He/she was not a smart person. The fact that they are flat buttons isn't ideal either, however I got use to finding the buttons pretty quickly.Additionally, like the old RS 120,130,and 140 models, the batteries are recharged when the headset is placed back on its stand after use, all ready to go next time you want to use them.I can sit here and tell you how much I love the Sennheiser RS 180, which is obvious by now, but at the end of the day you need to know what the consensus opinion on these headphones are and not just take the opinion of one man to heart. So, I will share with you my secret to buying a new pair of headphones.  It's (...), which provides consensus reviews for you...no more searching the internet for user and professional reviews alike. I don't know why there aren't any other sites like this because I've always had difficulty finding enough good reviews on headphones, especially new products like the RS 180's. It not only makes finding reviews easier, but summarizes them all for me...more time for me to enjoy the headphones and less time shopping for them Hooray!

VI have/had both multiple wired/wireless headphones, so I've put together a mental list over time, of what worked, and what hasn't.  These headphones were meant to be multi-purpose: music, primarily classical, New Age, contemporary (a wide range), as well as T.V. (connected to the stereo). This is what I found:Positive:1. Charging is pain free... just drop the phones on the base unit, and they not only easily find their own center, but charge very quickly.2. Range.  There is nowhere I can go in my home (3-stories, 3500 sq. ft.) where I can make it drop out, or even produce any noise/static, including down my driveway to my mailbox. Range is fabulous.3. Sound.  Excellent. Best I've had in a headphone.4. Comfort.  This is a complaint I've had in other headphones, that either didn't have enough padding in the headband, or the earcups, or were not adjustable enough, too tight, etc.  The RS 180 resolves all that.  Perfectly surrounds your ears (as opposed to 'open-air' which press against your ears), and the headband is thickly padded.  The phones are adjustable, hold their adjustment, and apply the perfect amount of pressure to create a soft "seal" without cutting off your circulation.Negative:1. While the controls are very versatile (balance, on-off, mute, volume), I would have liked the on-off/mute button a little more pronounced, or separate from the other row of buttons... perhaps on the other earcup.  However, a small nit, that in no way puts a dent in a fantastic product.2. Pricey.  It's an excellent, well-designed, quality product.  You should expect to pay the price, unless you want to sacrifice/cut corners.

VFirst, let me say that I don't really consider myself a "die-hard" audiophile, that said, besides owning these rs180 wireless phones, I also own Sennheiser hd-555, hd-598, and the hd-650 corded cans.  I appreciate solid performing headphones and the rs180's fill that need exceptionally well and have the big added benefit of being cordless.  I'm not going to go into a full sound quality breakdown here, but I will say for those familiar with the 598's and 650's, the RS180's IMHO fall somewhere between the two.  Closer to the 598's I think.  A little better mids and bass than the 598's.  Brighter, airier, but not quite the very fine overall perfomance of the 650's in regards to soundstaging and imaging. Although, I do think they work better than the hd 650's for movie watching.  But not with music.  This really is an incredible achievment for a wireless headset.Set up was as simple as it gets.  I tried connecting through both the headphone jack and also the zone2 outs on my pioneer vsx-819h (used for home theater).  There was really not a noticable difference in the quality of sound between the two connections, so I decided to stay with the phone jack for ease of use.  Charging the headset took about 8 hours.  Once charged I was able to stroll out into my back yard (150ft) with no signal loss at all.  I also haven't experienced any problems with my wireless network as described in some other reviews that I've read.  I found the headset to be light and comfortable (a bit heavier than the hd555's they will replace for movie watching) and have worn them for up to four hours so far with no sense of fatigue or any other difficulties.  I also connected them to my Denon AVR-3312CI (used for music) and found them to be very competant for music appreciation.  Though as stated above, they won't be replacing my hd-650's for this purpose.  I would also add that so far I haven't experienced any drop outs or noticible back ground noise at all.  I've been very impressive.As for the controls, yes it's a bit of a bother having to turn both the base and headset on before use.  And yes, the controls on the headset take a little getting used to.  However, I find both issues to be very minor and believe the perfomance of these phones far out-weighs the few negatives.Overall, I would most definitely recommend these to anyone looking for solid performing wireless headphones.

VDOA unit... :(
p180

VI have a 170 unit and have liked it for the last few years, but the cushions are wearing out and I thought I would just upgrade to the 180, which (being an open headphone) might be more comfortable anyway.Unfortunately, this 180 does not charge the headphones...  At first I forgot to remove the plastic, so user error.  Once I did that though, the headphones still are stone dead after 2 days charging. The charge light on the base does not come on. Fiddling with the headset only gets it to light for a second at most. Unit is useless.I even tried charging the 180 headset on the 170 base, but that doesn't work either.Worse part is that I cannot return this, so am stuck with an expensive doorstop.  I had this shipped to a friend when I visited the States, but the unit is now with me in Ecuador, so I am stuck. :-(((

VThe sound "seal" doesn't, plus two other faults. Still excellent.
p186
sg5
VThese headphones are excellent in every regard except three.  First, the seal that is to keep the sound from leaking into the room is not much of a seal at all:  My wife can hear the dialog when I'm watching TV using the headphones.  The sound is, of course, at greatly reduced volume, but just loud enough to be annoying. Unfortunately, Sennheiser offers no alternate ear pads for the easily-replaceable open-foam ones supplied. It could have and should be doing so. That doesn't mean they shouldn't also supply the ones they are: The advantage to the supplied ear pads is that, when you pause the sound, you can hear people in the room speak without taking off the earphones.  And they let in enough fresh air so your ears don't heat up, as happens with denser ear pads.Second, the controls were designed by an incompetent.  In order to hear anything, you have to not only turn the headphones themselves on, but the charging/transmitting tower as well.  The tower should blow through 2 cents worth of electricity per year and "listen" for headphones to request it to power-up.  What's worse, the switch on the tower is located in a place that requires you to grasp the tower with one hand while pressing the on switch with the other. Otherwise, it just slides away from you across the table.  Really, really bad design.  But the headphones are worse:  All five controls, the three you actually use and the two you never use, are all lined up together in a perfect row just below your right ear where you can neither see them nor feel them with the headphones in place.  Except one of the five, the one you actually can see because you use it to turn the headphones on before you plunk them on your head, has a just barely raised logo of some sort on it.  This string of five-in-a-row buttons makes trying to change the volume maddeningly difficult.  Essentially, you find a volume you can live with, and you live with it.Finally, and I can hardly fault Sennheiser for this, the RS 180s lose when they go up in battle with my microwave oven, cutting in and out as long as I'm within six feet of the oven.  What's remarkable is that I've never owned a pair of wireless headphones before that could even approach the kitchen before transitioning into white noise, the transmitter being 30 feet away in the living room through two walls, so the fact that the Sennheiser headphones work perfectly in the kitchen and beyond, save when the oven is actively turning, is quite remarkable. The way to have address this would have been to decouple where the headphones have to be vs. where the transmitter has to be, but since they put transmitter and charger together, then insisted that the transmitter be separately powered up, they precluded the possibility of putting each device in the best place.Now, all this may sound really, really bad, but in spite of these negatives, these are the first wireless headphones I've ever elected to actually keep. Other reviewers have talked about the good stuff, and the good stuff adds up to the full four stars I've given them. And I've come up with solutions to the last two problems I can live with: The tower I've velcroed to my side table (I'm hoping my wife doesn't read this) so I can turn on the transmitter with one hand. I've touched the up and down volume controls with a hot soldering iron to to make them so that I can feel them (the DOWN is sufficiently rough to stand out, and the UP ended up with a round blob of old solder melted into it--both easily discernible), and I have a remote in the kitchen that will let me pause the TV while I cook something in the microwave while I'm under the headphones. Now, if I can just address problem one by dampening my wife's hearing a bit by maybe injecting a little caulk in her ears while she's asleep... Well, perhaps not.

VI bought these for work (at home.)  I wanted something wireless, of decent quality with good range.  Setup was quick and easy.  The base station charges the headphones when you place them on top, which I do at the end of the day.  They play fine all throughout the day so they are full charged each morning.  When you take the headphones off, you must press the ON button on the base unit, then press the power button on the headphones before they will work.  The buttons on the headphone are definitely hard to discern without looking at them (ie, while wearing them.)  You can feel the power button, it has some raised edging, but it's rather thin and small - the volume up button is above that, but it's a little clumsy.  I would have designed it with a little knob to press for power on/off and turn of volume up/down.  That would have been so much nicer and easier- especially when you need to quickly adjust the volume to, say, answer a phone or talk to someone.  The way it is, you have to pop them off using both hands (so no holding a phone), and press the on/off button, or click and hold the volume down button, or otherwise adjust the volume from the source (computer, stereo or whatever the base station is getting it's audio from.)I like the "around the ear" design, I find it more comfortable.  These are perfectly comfortable for extended periods; though I find I usually never have them on for more than a couple hours.  Sometimes I just let them hang around my neck instead of putting them down; convenient.My biggest gripe is the range.  Advertised 320', which is quite a long ways.  My mailbox is about 60 feet away and the headphones start cutting out- though the signal IS going through a layer of brick.  Also it cuts out inside my house, at only 30 feet or so, if I am in the kitchen.  But, to be fair, there are a couple walls and partially a refridgerator between the headphones and the transmitter.  I can listen to them upstairs, the signal going through the floor, no problem.  I will experiment with them soon and update this review.  I will move the transmitter just outside and test unobstructed line-of-sight range and also move it to a higher spot- above my bookshelf; right now it's about a foot off the floor next to my computer.  Conclusion: Range can severly suffer if you start walking around corners or have too much between the headphones and the transmitter.  Inside the house I get about 30 to 40 feet before it starts cutting out.  House was built in the 70's and there's not a lot of internal wall insulation.  I'd like to be able to sit in my screened porch and listen, but it cuts out just before I get to the door, which is no more than 50' from the transmitter.  Arg. We'll see if moving the transmitter (use a long audio extension cable) helps any.These are pretty expensive headphones, I had expected to be able to go anywhere in my house (including the porch) and get a good signal, but that hasn't been the case.  I don't know of any good alternatives, though, so I'll keep these and experiment with moving the transmitter so that I can get a better signal in other parts of the house. (It's not a large house, about 2400sq/ft.)  My wireless phones can reach everywhere, why not a pair of $300 headphones?

VI purchased these wireless headphones for quiet listening late at night so I would not disturb other people.  I have used the wired Sennheiser HD 414 headphones for the last 20+ years and have had zero problems with them. They are open air design like the 180's and have very excellent sound quality.  That is what made me decided to go with Sennheiser when I was looking for wireless headphones.  The sound quality is very good and are very comfortable to wear.  Along with other reviewers, The only two negatives that I can see with these headphones is the transmission range and the design of the control buttons. I average around 75 feet before it starts to cut out.  However I have extended this range a bit by putting the transmission base as high as I can reach to put the headphones back on the base for recharging. Control buttons are very close together and when first using them, you tend to push the wrong ones quite a bit.  I consider this a minor inconvenience since after a bit of practice you can determine which buttons you want to use/adjust by feel.  Overall I am happy with the headphones performance.  I upgraded the stock NiMH batteries with a better brand and charge times were greatly reduced since they have almost 40% more capacity (600mah for stock batteries compared to 1000mah for replacement batteries) Power button could be placed on top of the base unit to push down on rather than have it on the front since you tend to push the base unit away when you push the power button so you have to hold unit down when pushing it.  All of these are minor since I wanted quality, comfortable headphones.  I would still recommend these headphones even with the few negatives it has.  With what really counts for me is quality construction, comfort and excellent sound reproduciton, these headphones have it.

VLet me start off this review by saying that if you need a huge rundown on the specifics of these particular headphones, you're better off just searching for video reviews on YouTube since they go into great detail on every aspect of the product. I'll be as brief as possible listing the annoyances I had with the RS 180's, but I will say right off the bat having owned the RS 120 II & RS 170 from Sennheiser - these definitely are more comfortable and way better sounding (at least to the RS 120 II).At the end of the day I really want to emphasize that I do like these headphones a lot, but there are some things that you may find annoying about them as I do. I've listed them below in no particular order.AC adapter has short cabling and is on the thin side. Ideal for traveling, but less so for home setups.Automatic shut off after 5 minutes of no audio signal. Would have been nice to be able to toggle this feature; since I like "always on" setups.Requires pressing of the power button on the transmitter to wake from standby instead of automatically when an audio signal is detected.Flimsy plastic tabs on ear muffs can easily be broken with gentle force. Most complaints about the RS 180 is regarding this.Power on/off button is located right between volume up and down buttons (On headphones). Very easy to accidentally press when adjusting volume.As far as everything else goes - I couldn't be happier. Sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the RS 120 II's and ANY Bluetooth set I've tried. Slightly better than the RS 170's as well. Still nowhere near the quality of a wired headset in terms of full range sound, but this is the best offering we can get for now and I'm grateful for it. If you have questions, feel free to ask in comments.

VI've got these headphones around Jan 5, 2011. These are my first pair of over the ear headphones (i've used IEMS and earbuds before) and first wireless headphones. I wanted wireless headphones with good battery life, sound quality, and comfort. I use these headphones for music, movies, and gaming.Sound: These are the best headphones I've ever heard, though all my past headphones were <$20 so that isn't a very helpful is it? Despite not having a trained ear, I'll try describing the audio as best as possible. I found that the bass had a decent punch, and was very clean. Past headphones I've used tend to have a muddy/blurry bass compared with the RS180. While all genres sounded better than I have ever heard on a headphone, I found orchestra music to benefit the most from these.edit: the "ssssh" sound was due to my poor source. Male sure to check your/source.I found that there seems to be a slight "ssssssh" sound when the headphone volume is less than 4 clicks from the max. One can eliminate this problem by leaving the headphone volume at 4 or more clicks below the max, and instead changing the volume from the source. These headphones aren't as loud as others, but they play loud enough just to be slightly uncomfortable rather than ear deafening loud which is nice. You just need to get used to raising the volume higher than you normally would with other headphones. Of course since these are open headphones you get sound leakage. The leakage is about as loud as a pair of desktop speakers at a semi-low volume. If the big transmitter wasn't a hint enough, it is obvious that these headphones should only be used at home for private listening.Design: I love how the transmitter also works as a stand/charger. I just wish that you could connect it to two different sources at once; I have to unplug the cable from the transmitter when I'm switching from my PC to my TV. I think the volume button issue is a bit overblown. I found it very easy to use, since the power/mute button which is slightly beveled, is actually between the Vol + and Vol - buttons. So I just have to slide my finger from the Vol + button down to the Vol - button if I want to lower the volume. It took me literally less than 5 minutes to get used to this. The headphones are extremely comfortable. They literally feel like pillows because none of the plastic has contact with your head; the plush velour pads are the only things resting on your head. Velour pads can be removed by turning them counter clockwise. They attract dust but can easily be cleaned by rubbing both pads together and blowing away the dust with a hair dryer or low powered vacuum.Range: I honesty only needed these to work within the vicinity of my room but the RS180 had signal within my entire house (even the garage) which is excellent. Though when I went near the kitchen the signal would cut out when I moved or touched my headphones; that however is to be expected with most wireless devices.Build Quality: While good, the materials feel slightly cheap for this price point. While the build quality is definitely not poor, the headphone feels more like a $50-60 headphone rather than a $250 headphone. The plastic though is of good quality, and the gloss surprisingly looks nice while being scratch and finger print resistant. You cant see in the photos but there is a sparkle to the paint job which looks nice. The velour quality of the pads is excellent and is very soft and comfy.Battery Life: The battery life is supposed to be 24 hours which I highly doubt, but even then I don't expect battery life to be an issue at all. I forgot that these even ran on batteries. I wear them every day and place them on the charger when I'm not using them. Never had the battery die on me, but the fact that it takes regular AAA Nimh rechargeable batteries means you can easily replace them if they ever die.Overall: These headphones met my every need. The reason that the RS180 is not perfect is because of the "ssssh" sound volume is less than 4 clicks from the max (can easily be fixed by adjusting source volume and even then it isn't that big of a deal and most would probably not notice it), the build quality for the price you're paying, and the lack of another headphone jack on the transmitter (most probably don't care about this). They retail for $300 but I suggest you get these for $250 or lower as $300 is a bit overpriced for the build quality.

VRS180 versus RS140/RS130
p215
sg5
VWe have three of the older analog Sennheiser wireless headphones (one RS140 - it failed recently after 5 years and two RS130s). The RS180 has zero hiss/pops/static whereas the older units have had these at times.  The bass has been punched up as others have noted, so these do not give high fidelity sound - I am using a home entertainment system amplifier and can adjust for this. I have had no problem getting good reception around our Garrison type house, where as I have AT TIMES with the older RS140 and RS130 analog units; when I go into the garage or outside the house (we have an aluminum covering on our wall insulation) reception becomes a problem, even at 50 ft from the transmitter. Standing within two feet of our running microwave cuts off all sound from the headphones; the sound returns when I retreat 4 to 5 feet away. The one feature that has caused me much trouble is the new method of adjusting sound and turning the headphones on and off. I find it hard to believe Sennheiser did any Beta testing of these headphones in a population with large fingers or toughened finger skin or abraded finger skin. One needs supple, sensitive finger tips to quickly discriminate the buttons and I doubt this applies to most people over 40 and to people who work with their hands a lot! Except for this serious design flaw I would have rated it 5 stars.  They are comfortable, and give clean good sound when the bass is adjusted.  Those wanting a more booming bass are no doubt the target market and they will love the sound as is.

VMost of the negatives mentioned on other reviews are pretty accurate - the controls are way too tiny so other than the up volume button you need to take them off to avoid hitting the wrong button.  Having to turn on the base station every time is also a big negative.  I haven't seen what I consider the biggest negative mentioned previously though - if I plug them into the analog out on my receiver, I cannot listen to any digital (I.e., HDMI) sources - so no Apple TV, Blu-ray/CD player, etc.  I suppose I could run a separate set of analog cables to every source from my receiver (some, like the Apple TV don't have analog outputs though...), but that's just ridiculous.  The other option (and the one I am doing currently) is to plug the base station in to the headphone jack when I want to listen through the headphones...somehow not as slick as I was expecting "wireless" to be.The sound quality is pretty good, no problem with wireless interference at all.  The bass response is pretty weak however, but I can't fault them for that as it is pretty well documented that the bass is not stellar.All in all they aren't bad, but I think I will go back to wired headphones.  The negatives for these just outweigh the positives IMO.

VWorks better than I had expected.  Having a slight hearing loss, compared to my wife, I could never hear the dialogue on the TV without blasting the volume above what would probably be called "normal" hearing.  The best part, my wife can actually turn the volume down to almost a whisper, but I can adjust my volume totally independently of the other audio outputs.  I can hear everything on the TV even without my hearing aids.  My only minor issue is the pads on the ear phone could be a bit thicker/firmer.  The headphones tend to press on my ears after a bit and I find myself having to readjust/reposition them to relieve the pressure.  Then again, it might be that I have weird shaped ears.  Excellent product all in all.

VUpdate #2:  Still going strong after 20 months of use.  We use these daily and they are still going strong and the original Eneloop batteries are still holding a charge.  No issues after almost 2 years of near daily use.UPDATE:After owning these for close to 2 months, I have to say these headphones have changed my life.  My home theater system is a force to be reckoned with, with 5.1 speakers perfectly balanced, a 120" pull down screen and 1080p Epson 8350 projector.  But listening to movies with these headphones is really the best way to experience movies.  They are nice for music, no doubt, but having 2 pair of these (for my wife and I), no wires, no static, perfect sound, is just spectacular.  Movies just come alive.  Of course, you can do the same with any good headphones and 20 feet of knotted cables, and everyone has to sit still or you yank the other persons' headphones off their head...but doing it without wires is obviously the way to go.  The freedom to move around while hearing perfect sound is just great.I'd recommend these to anyone with a home theater system, anyone over 50 who is starting to have hearing problems, anyone who misses the dialog in movies and TV shows, or anyone who wants to enjoy music and movies.  Okay...I recommend these to anyone who can afford them.Again, I have a lot of wireless going on in my living room, and have never had a problem with a single lost syllable.  Even watching streaming movies over wifi with the PS3 right next to the transmitter has not been a problem.  I have had zero issues with these after 2 months of use.  I even dropped one pair once (my heart skipped a beat) but nothing happened to it.I increased my review to 5 stars, even with the terrible button placement for volume and power.Here is my original review:I have two other open Sennheiser headphones:  HD555 and HD518.  My favorite are (were) the HD555, for their crisp sound.  The HD518 have more bass, but I think it sounds fake or muffled.  Anyway, the RS180 sound like the HD555s.  I have the Berringher 4 port headphone amp, so its very easy to compare all 3 headphones at nearly the same time.  The RS180 sound like the 555s but with no cords!  Also, they seem to weigh the same.  How do they do it?  I used these for 1 day and immediately bought another stand-alone set (you can use 4 headphones with one transmitter).  My wife and I watched the last Downtown Abbey with our matching headphones and it was such a pleasure.  Being able to move around, not get tangled in 20 feet of cable (we used to use the 555 and 518 to watch movies on our home theater projector) and have flawless sound with no static or drop or hum.  So the RS180 sound better than the HD518, as good as the HD555 (my former favorite headphones), and have no wires.  So why not 5 stars (I'd give them 4.5 if I could)?Well, going wireless makes life a little more complicated.  Pairing additional headphones with an existing transmitter was harder than it should have been.  The buttons (as every other review says) are hard to press by feel.  They have a balance (why?), which is easy to hit by mistake instead of volume.  The off button is between the volume up and down, so it's easy to turn them off when you meant to change volume.  What a poor design.I was able to get them to lose the signal by putting my iphone5 right next to the transmitter while downloading an app.  It's hard to do, but I was able to get the signal to drop.  But the iphone has to be within a few inches of the transmitter.My first floor is around 1200 feet, and the headphones work all around the first floor.  But if I go out the slider onto the deck, they start to lose the signal, and it's only 20 feet from the transmitter.  So, it seems to work fine in open space but doesn't handle walls or windows very well.But for using it in the room with the transmitter, and have such awesome sound and no wires, it's absolutely worthwhile to have two sets of these.  I'm glad I got them and wish I got them sooner.  I now use the 518s at work, and my son the movie editor grabbed the 555s.

VI really like the headphones as they have excellent quality with amazing sound. It is slightly difficult at night (in the dark) to lower the volume as the buttons are flat but once you get the hang of it they are great and you can adjust without looking at them. I am usually watching TV at night in the dark so it is my particular circumstance that causes this inconvenience. If the adjustment knobs stood out they would rub against my pillow and that would be a disadvantage, so I will accept this issue. Once in a while there is a little pop in the sound but remember these are wireless. It enables me to listen to TV while my mate is sleeping and visa versa. I was really amazed at the quality of sound and the range as you can go anywhere in the house or outdoors on your property and listen to high quality music.  The first week I got them I made everyone that came over listen to the sound.... it was that surprisingly good.These headphones may look bulky but are much lighter weight than they look and cover the ear. It does not block out room sound , just muffles it a little. I didn't want them to block out room sound.I did have a slight problem setting them up as my band new Samsung Tv didn't have a headphone jack and I had them plugged into the wrong jacks but that was quickly resolved and it is my lack of experience. I am very pleaseed with them and would recommend this model as they are updated and perfected to give the buyer a good quality for the $$. The week I purchased them they were 50.00 less in price and I don't know how I lucked out...but I paid under 300.00. Very good purchase for me as I am pleased with this product.These would also be excellent if one person in the house was hearing impaired, they could wear these wireless headphones and everyone else could turn on the TV volume that would be suitable for them. The TV would not have to be blaring to accomodate one person.

VGreat Comfort & Sound but NO Isolation
p257
sg5
VI have five other pairs of high quality phones by Sennheiser and Beyerdynamic, but had given up on finding a decent pair of wireless phones until discovering these. The sound quality is on a par with the best of my other phones, but the comfort and convenience of wireless puts these in a league of their own. My only caution is for those who are looking for phones that will drown out the sound of a lawn mower or nagging spouse. These are open phones and provide absolutely no isolation from ambient noise. If you want sound isolation, consider the Sennheiser RS 170 closed wireless phones; also sold on Amazon. My subjective rating on a scale of 1 to 10 for sound isolation alone follows for the options that I have tried:Sennheiser RS 180s: zeroSennheiser HD 280 closed headphones: 4 *Foam Insert intra-canal headphones: 7 **Bilsom Leightning L3 ear protector:  10 **** I would expect the Sennheiser RS 170 closed wireless phones to be about equal to their closed wired HD 280** Best for airline travel: Fits easily in pocket. Dual driver models needed for decent bass.*** Ear protection only. No phones. Best for mowing the lawn.

VBest Wireless headphones with one hitch.
p269
sg5
VI own both the 170 and 180's and use them for different reasons.  The headphones for the 170's block out a bit more ambient noise than the 180's and I use them when I need to block the world out a bit more.  For anyone looking, I use the base for the 180's to transmit to both the 170 and 180 headsets.  I have never tested if the "extra" features of the 170's (surround and bass) actually work in this configuration. but sound comes out.They are physically quite comfortable, and I have left the house forgetting I have the 180's on.  This brings us to the only downside.  They stretch.  Over time, they will not cling to your head as vigorously.  I spoke to Sennheiser about this and they said they had not heard this was a problem, but were responsive.  They suggested I put a damp towel over the headset in the charge base.  This never seemed to do anything, but I have found using a rubber band around them in the base restores some of the shape for a limited time.  Given that sometimes I wear these 18 hours a day this is somewhat to be expected, but I expect more from such a high-end product.  One star off for this.As for the sound, it's beautiful.  I have super-good hearing and while I'm not an audiophile, I'm a snob about static and overall audio quality.  These are not only the best I've found, they are so by quite a margin.  I hope Sennheiser refreshes the line soon to address the durability and/or make the part that stretches user-replaceable.

p275

VI bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday (at his request).  His first comments about the product came before it was even out of the box.  The outside of the box literally has instructions on how to open the packaging!  Once opened, it's clear that the makers thought of everything; from the various country-specific power adapters, to the cord organizer.  You will not be left wanting with these headphones.The headphones come with rechargeable batteries, which is a great addition for people who want to try out their new toy straight out of the box (without waiting for the full charge).  So of course the boyfriend had to walk all over our apartment complex to see how far away from the station he would still be able to hear the television.  Let me just say that he hasn't found the magical area where the sounds begins to fade.One of the best features of these headphones is that they are open, so even though nobody can hear what he is listening to, he can still hear what's going on around him.  The sound is really great quality, and because they are so lightweight, you can probably wear them for hours without any discomfort.I highly recommend these headphones, especially for couples who don't have the exact same sleep schedule.  Living in a one bedroom apartment, it's awesome to sleep in peace and quiet, while not forcing boyfriend to keep quiet as a mouse as he stays up late.

VSo I bought these because the RF headset that I normally use was starting to break down physically.  I had used it for years with no real problem.  Panasonic I think.  I wanted to spend the money and get something with better sound and more comfort.  I use these for watching TV when my wife has gone to bed or play my video game when so she can listen to the radio and we don't compete with each other for sound.  I have to say the sound quality is there. I am impressed I can hear things on my games I never knew existed and the music and television is awesome.  Plus these are much more comfortable than the older set that I had.  If the game is going very well and lasting a long time I don't feel like my ears are rubbing off.  If I had one suggestion it would be this..and forgive me I'm an engineer.  The control buttons are too difficult to adjust while they are on your head.  You need to be able to easily identify which button is which with feel so make them more distinctive in feel and spatial separation.  Most of the time I adjust the volume or turn them on and off.  I don't adjust the balance much.  The room in many cases is dark due to the fact that I am watching TV and my wife has gone to bed.  The range of transmission is great no problems working and walking around the house. I have even stepped outside in the backyard with no problems. All in all great stuff I would get them again

VBest headphone set I've ever owned
p287
sg5
VI am sure I have not even explored all this headphone set can do. The sound quality is crisp and clear; the stereo sound is almost a surround sound--sometimes I've had to check whether a sound I heard in the "background" was coming from the phones or from my brick-and-mortar surroundings (and so far it has always turned out it came from the phones). The automatic level control is nice especially when watching TV; that feature does make a difference, so if you want to preserve dynamic contrast, e.g., when listening to classical music, leave it off.The ergonomics of this headphone set are nothing short of superb; it adjusts snugly to the shape of your head, fits comfortably around your ears, and stays put as you move, without ever putting too much pressure on. Only the volume and balance controls took me a little while to get used to; sometimes I would accidentally turn off the phones rather than adjust the volume. And when you first plug it into the stereo (turning off the speakers), a few seconds may pass until the sound is played through the headphones, leaving you in the mute during that time; therefore, you might want to not switch from speakers to phones during key dialogue or so.Previous reviewers have remarked on the slight delay in sound transmission; I'll say it is about one-tenth to one-fifth of a second. That I can live with when watching TV, and it certainly is "same difference" when consuming audio-only sources.Brief dropouts can occur when my microwave oven is on and I happen to pass within 2' of it. But I haven't had the experience of the headphone transmitter signal and the wireless Internet signal interfering with each other: the transmitter sits about 3' away from the wireless router, and I sometimes wear the phones while sitting at the computer. The two wireless signals seem to work just fine at the same time.

I can walk anywhere in my home and hear the sound as clearly as I can in the room where my sound system is located.  The recharging system is very convenient.

VGreat sound!  Feels great even after several hours of wear.  I was confused by inclusion of regular batteries (ran down overnight) but once I started using the rechargeable batteries it works great.  The controls on the head set are poorly designed and take some time to get used to.  At first I had to take the headset off to adjust the volume.  Same with the on-off switch.  Those are minor problems so I recommend the headphones highly.

p304

VI am not the person who enjoys writting negative reviews.I received these as a gift, we have a lake no more than 30m behind the house and wanted to lay on the beach without turning the outside speakers all the way up. I was able to correctly install the unit. I let the batteries charge for aprox 30 hours. When I tried the headphones in an unobstructed range of 30m they kept going in and out. I then moved the transmitter to a location that was 27m (I have a digital range finder so my distance is exact) away from where I was standing and the signal still kept going in and out. I was actually able to see the transmitter from where I was standing, the only thing between me and the transmitter was glass and an "open" 4'X7' door. I also disconnected all the wireless electronics I have in the house (the neighbors wireless will seldom even show up on my laptop network and is poor at best), so as not to disrupt the wireless connection on the headset. Obviously there is a problem with something either with the transmitter or the headphones since they claim that the range is up to 100m. I am very disappointed for the price I would expect to get at least 50m of service and thats all we really needed.Sent Sennheiser an email but have not heard back from them yet, hopefully I can update this with some positive feedback.

VIf you LISTEN to music, I think you will like what you hear
p309
sg5
VWhy did I wait so long to buy these?  I have been listening to a very enjoyable set of Sony cans for about 15 years, but the replacement ear pads are now falling off from extended use.  The Sony cans were VERY comfortable, but a bit heavy because component integration back then was not what it is today.  Another problem that has been becoming more troublesome is because wireless headphones in that era used the 900 MHz band and that continues to make them more susceptible to interference. I am old enough that I still have 4 good-quality Reel to Reel tape decks, 4 turntables including a Dual Golden 1 that I bought new in the previous millennium, and a slew of discrete components that can feed me a great signal.  I will concede that I do little casual listening to something in the background while I work. I much prefer to listen to a wide range of jazz, classical, and popular music - closely, and as the main focus of what I am doing. I feel I have a good basis for judging the quality of my recordings, whether they are a seldom played 1970's Quadraphonic vinyl DG recording of the Boston Pops coming over my living room system vs. the same recording digitized and coming from my PC.  Is there a difference? Definitely.  Enough of a difference that I am willing to lug around a couple of tons of media, components, and wiring when I want to listen somewhere else?  Not a chance.Thanks to the RS 180's, I am pleasantly rediscovering my music collection with every new listening session - be it 100% analog or the digital version I can fit on a two terabyte drive in my pocket.  With very gently applied adjustments from a software plug-in called the DFX Audio Enhancer, I find I can re-experience the sound stage, imaging, and frequency profile I remember from before the time (last 5 years) my listening was restricted by living in an apartment! Either way, good electronics all the way is a must.  Purists will say using any "signal enhancer" is bad, and I totally agree - IF your listening room is Symphony Hall or some other first rate venue.  But after a now long ago decade as a high end audio salesman (after several years at Radio Shack helped me earn my electrical engineering degree), I still say the best sound is what YOU like best, and if you start with a great sound, have a great sound chain, top quality reproducers be they buds, cans or the best room shakers a kings ransom can buy, there is still no shame is adjusting for room acoustics or hearing problems due to disease, too much time as a roadie, or just advancing age.Although may the Gods save us from $99 USB turntables and most motherboard-mounted audio solutions, it IS possible to make a decent copy of a recording in any format and clean it up without destroying the visceral experience of what made that recording great.  Again, almost every purist will have a slightly different take on how to get there, but all will agree there are two key points - don't waste your time on making a FLAC (lossless) copy of a 56k MP3, and DO make sure that you LIKE the sound that is traveling that last inch from your headphones to your eardrums.  I have found over the last several months that the RS 180's provide one great way to get there, without breaking the bank, your neck, or your lease. I listened to a half-dozen competitors before buying this model, and I even asked a friend to NOT buy me what HE liked the best for HIS needs ( Bluetooth connection between his iPod and his active-suppression Bose cans so he can listen to e-books and music while mowing the lawn).  Don't get me wrong - his choice was a valid one for him, but if you are looking to kick back a bit and focus on the music without too much racket in the background, the open-back RS 180's are a very convenient and enjoyable option for you to consider.  For me, they are definitely well worth the money.

VVolume - excellent, maximum setting is very uncomfortableBass - excellent.Clarity - excellent - meets Sennheiser reputation.Overall sound quality - surprising and extraordinary -- almost as good as my Sennheiser 580's (which are wired).User friendliness - setup is intuitive.Signal - excellent, was able to walk full extent of home with zero loss of signal.Bluetooth - nope.  The choice here was between your entertainment center/some fixed location vs your iphone/laptop, and the choice was clearly made for home entertainment situations.  Another choice was between the superior "Kleer" audio transmission and the inferior bluetooth signal, and considerations that favored audiophile needs won out.Interference - no conflict with wifi or other signals, as some are reporting.Comfort - excellent, but people with large ears may have a problem right away.  Otherwise these are soft and extremely lightweight.Aesthetics - large and goofy, though nowhere near as ridiculous as the Pioneer SE-DRS3000C.  These clearly favor function over form.Privacy - none.  If your intent is to prevent the world from knowing you listen to Justin Bieber or Katy Perry, then these headphones will not keep your shameful secret.Sound isolation - these aren't isolation headphones.Controls - if you've read more than five reviews then you already know the controls weren't designed to be used blindly.  It would be nice at times to be able to adjust the volume without taking them off, so I'll play around with putting on tape so my fingers can feel out the controls better.  Edit: Solution for the controls issue: glue a couple objects to the volume buttons after you are certain you approve of the other features of the headphones.  I used those little rubber thingies you can get in most hardware stores, and now I can feel the volume buttons (and the power button in between them) with no problem.With tv - this is the unit's single greatest point against it.  What people are reporting about the echo is true, so unless your tv has a special syncing option you won't be able to watch this with your headphones on while other people watch without them.  The only real alternative is to buy extra headphones (the unit can support up to four) and have the whole family wearing them, though people who don't need them will probably resent this pretty quickly.  This single design mishap is costing the headphones a full star, but in light of the headphones greatest strengths (sound quality and signal strength) I'll be keeping them anyway because the primary motive for buying them was for work, and not for the entertainment center.Solution for the problem many people are reporting regarding the signal cutting out at low volumes: Max out the volume on your primary source (in my case my laptop computer) and control the volume from the headphones.  This eliminates the cutout and, oddly enough, a high pitch whine (don't ask me why).

VI started researching wireless headphones when my neighbor called the cops because I was playing Mario Kart 8.  But that's another story...  I jumped straight to CNET and Amazon reviews, but I saw these babies all over the place in top lists for wireless headphones.Already I have sworn to listen to my TV with these exclusively unless I have people over.  These headphones make for an amazing viewing experience!  I was initially concerned because the RS 170's advertised bass boost and surround sound simulators, and I was worried these would be lacking in some way.  PUT YOUR FEARS TO REST.  I popped in my blu-ray of The Avengers for a test run and was blown away by how great they sound.  Music is also clean and gorgeous.This is my first pair of open-back headphones, and I must say they're a nice option.  There really is something to the "larger sound stage" aspect of the acoustics.  It's hard to describe, but people aren't kidding when they say it just feels more natural.  I like the intimacy of wearing the headphones, but love that I can still hear the doorbell ring or the kitchen timer go off.They are light and extremely comfortable.  I can binge watch Netflix or have a movie marathon, and my ears don't get hot or sore.  And the charge lasts for hours and hours, so there's no reason to need or want to take them off.The rechargeable batteries are easily replaceable!  It's so disheartening that electronics are moving in a direction that when the battery dies, the whole device is useless.  Not the case with these guys.  If and when I get annoyed by their ability to hold a charge, I look forward to spending six bucks to fix the problem.Regarding complaints I have seen around the web:Lack of a digital input:This is a legitimate problem if your TV ONLY has HDMI and optical outputs.  But that seems to be a problem with your TV.  Computers, tablets, phones, iPods, even car consoles all have 3.5 mm jacks.  This is not an outdated technology and hardly obsolete.  If you simply prefer digital output, you're being needlessly picky.  Analog is just fine, people. They are stereo headphones.  You're not going to magically get a 7.1 surround sound experience just by using a newer connector.The buttons are difficult:So there's a learning curve to adjusting volume and balance while wearing these headphones.  I don't understand why this is a talking point, much less a deal-breaker.  You have to look at the buttons until you learn how not to.  How is this a problem?BOTTOM LINE: I'm in love with these headphones.  At the reduced price on Amazon, they are absolutely worth the money.

The range is decent, but certainly not worth bragging about.People mention the button layout on the headset being different, and they are absolutely right, haven't decided whether that is a pro or con yet.Cons:  The sound quality is only marginally better than that of my 5 year old USB Creative Fatality headset which was 1/4 the price of the RS180.The way you turn the RS180 on is very, very counter-intuitive.  You have to push a button on both the headset and transmitter, and the transmitter is so light you have to hold it while pushing the button.  Why they don't have it turn on as soon as it's lifted is beyond me.And the deal breakers.  There is a low volume, high pitch whine coming from the right ear cup.  A quick google search reveals that a few (I could only find 2) other people have the same issue, and ended up replacing the set to fix it, so this is what I will be doing.I also experienced having the audio cut off twice this morning while watching a movie, which is a bit disturbing since the transmitter is about 3ft away from where I was sitting.My general attitude towards the RS180 at this point is that they are not worth the price premium.  There are some very similar items on the market at much lower price points.Once I get my replacement set, I will update my review accordingly, but for now it is -1 star for how you turn them on (yes, it's that inconvenient) and -1 for the whine.--UPDATE 24Jun14--The replacement set has the same whine as the initial set I purchased.  This leads me to believe that it is part of a design flaw and not a fluke.  For a relatively high end set and the number of positive reviews, I would not expect this.  The whine is only in the right ear cup, and occurs when the transmitter and headset are both powered on, the audio cable doesn't need to be attached for this to occur.I use this set with my computer, and after every system sound (click noise from opening folders, etc) there is a short, substantially louder whine.  I should also note that I experience none of this with other (wired) headphones, and that it occurs on the RS180s even with no other wireless device turn on that may have been causing some flavor of interference.

VI was upgrading from the RS120's, which I purchased reconditioned through Amazon for about $80 as an experiment to see how well the whole wireless media experience would work for me; it worked well enough with those, but when I began noticing more interference (neighbors' wireless handset phone calls, static) I decided it was time to really jump in and spend more for higher quality. After looking at the various models available from Sennheiser, as well as others (like Sony), I was convinced the 180's were exactly what I wanted, given my price-point and quality requirements.I feel I made an excellent choice--absolutely NO buyer's remorse here. With the digital signal there is absolutely NO interference or lag or anything disruptive that I've encountered. The sound itself is beautifully crisp with what seems like a very full range to me. Full disclosure: I am by no means an "audiophile". But I know what sounds good and what doesn't, and have what I believe are reasonable expectations pertaining to the middle, higher and lower ends of the sound spectrum (high tweets to low bass), and so far I can't detect any faults with the Sennheiser 180's. Explosions sounds deep and rumbly like they should, voices are easily discerned, high-note violin strains are suitably clean and clear. Perhaps these earphones only sound so much better to me because of the constant static, etc, of the 120's, but I've had my share of wired headphones in my day and I honestly can't recall ever hearing better sound. And the comfort! These are SO comfortable on my ears. I was a little hesitant at first because these are "over-ear" as opposed to "on-ear" like the 120's were, but I need not have been concerned at all--the velour cups make it extremely easy to forget one is even wearing earphones, and because the backs are "open", enough air passes through that my inner ear is happy and I don't get that claustrophobic feeling that "closed" over-ear headphones always give me. Also, unlike the 120's, these STAY ON--no slipping and sliding out of place should I happen to move my head into anything other than an upright vertical position, so I'm able to wear these around the house while I do other things with no constant re-adjusting them on my head. What's interesting is that even though I wear glasses and the 180's appear to have better grip than the 120's, I get no discomfort from these whereas the 120's would start to press the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull pretty noticeably after an hour or two. Also, the signal has no problem traveling through the floors and ceiling of my 3-level home.Honestly, these are fantastic, IMO. If I could change only one thing though, I'd have made the buttons on the right side easier to detect and identify. As others have pointed out, they're very smooth and almost flush, so it's a little too easy to click, say, the power button instead of the upper volume control. I plan to try the trick mentioned here with a tiny dab of glue to add a bump to the power button so I can instantly tell what's what.Pro Tip: if you buy these and instantly notice a lot of popping sounds with dialog and such, be sure to turn down the volume of the providing device (like my receiver) and that stuff will go away. With the 120's I had to have the volume cranked up to like 60 in order for the headphones to stop turning themselves off prematurely and to provide more signal strength (apparently), but with these, dialing down to 30 was just fine, better, in fact, and also happens to be the "comfortable" volume level of my surround sound system whenever I'm using it instead, so no more having to remember to dial down the volume if I unplug the earphones, lolThese even look better on the fireplace mantle beside my 60" plasma tv than the 120's did. Very sleek and modern-looking.UPDATE: the "dab of glue" trick for the volume buttons didn't work for me. For whatever reason, the Krazy glue I used wouldn't dry properly on the buttons' plastic and spread out to the sides too easily. Luckily I was able to clean them up without messing up the buttons.So instead now I've settled for small pieces of duct tape with enough extra tape jutting out that my finger can feel them over each button. Not as pretty, but practical.

VI've tried quite a few wireless headsets. Around a dozen from cheap $50 through $270. These have the best sound so far and also one of the longest ranges without interruption. The major downside is that I have a large head, so finding comfortable headsets is a pain, literally. And the Sennheiser RS180 did not cut it on comfort.The packaging that it comes in is slick and easy to open. All of the components are easy to remove. The design of the charging base station is minimalist compared to some larger bulkier units. The smaller size antenna did not impact the broadcast quality. It needs 16 hours to charge the first time, NiMh batteries are included. Connecting everything is a cinch, comes with lots of power adapters, a/v adapter, and a 1/8" to 1/4" plug adapter.It is an open air design allowing the bass to more freely resonate. I typically like the sound provided by those types, but the result is that it doesn't eliminate external sound. So not for everyone there.I ran the headphones through the paces, classical, metal,  jazz, 3d sound from a video game. It all sounded great. Good bass response, the treble doesn't turn reedy.This headset looks like it would be good for someone with a wide head, but my head is tall. The adjustable band was comfortable at first, but after ten minutes or so, I noticed a hot spot where it put pressure on my scalp. I tried moving it to different spots, but still the same problem.The ear cups and headband cushin are made from the same material. It is spongy, but not very soft. The ear cups especially were quite rough. I tried looking for accessories on their website, hoping you could swap out the ear cups with leather, but no such luck.I'll most likely return these as they aren't comfortable for me. Given the price and the sound quality, if you had a smaller head or your skin didn't mind rough ear cups, then this is a set to consider.Pros:Great sound for the valueGood battery managementBase station easily recharges headsetCons:Not for larger headsScratchy material on ear cups

p345
sg5
VI can't begin to describe how much I love these. I've owned many headphones over the years, but I'm on a Sennheiser streak in the most recent of them. I currently own HD590s, HD598s, and now these (with a second headset). The 590s and 598s both have a tiny bit more ear space, but these fit and are very comfortable nonetheless. Given the history, it should be apparent I'm a fan of open air headphones. Not being tethered by a wire but getting the kind of audio quality I've come to expect out of my other sets is just amazing. I've had them on my head for hours and hours since they arrived recently.Before I bought these, I was looking at the RS 160, 170, and 180 models. I read a lot of conflicting info and reached out to Sennheiser and talked with a tech there. He clarified to me that you can independently control the volume on each headset when having multiple paired without issue (confirmed) and that you can connect any of the 160/170/180 to the 180 base station (as well as the other base stations). As I really wanted open air, the 180s were the only option.I don't find the pairing system very complicated, and had no difficulty getting more than one connected. Range has been spectacular, and I can listen to music from anywhere indoors where I live. As I'm not in a single family house, I have to still pay attention to sound levels when it gets late at night, so the plan is to add two more headsets to the mix and have an alternative for group movie watching late at night. The open air backs let you still talk through the headphones...should make for awesome late night movie nights.An extra bit that I really like is that the headphones shipped with Eneloop AAAs and not some other, lesser option. As a result I was able to take them out of the box and wear them right away (Eneloops are designed to ship charged, hold that charge, and be used immediately before recharging is necessary).All in all, I couldn't be happier about this purchase and can't wait to use them more.

VI've heard very-high-end audio systems before (costing deep into five-figures), and I own a pair of Sennheiser HD 600 wired headphones, so I have experience with a good set of cans.  That said, I wouldn't quite call the RS 180 audiophile grade. However, for anything less than highly critical listening, these headphones deliver clean, quality sound that should satisfy just about anyone.I don't use these for listening to music, I use them with my TV when I want to watch a movie late at night.  They allow me to mute the TV's speakers while listening through the headphones at whatever volume level I like without worrying about waking others in the house.  I wasn't expecting much bass response, but they do have a respectable low end.  Nothing that would match a good home theater system, but as much or more than what my TV's built-in speakers offer down low.I debated whether to splurge and get the RS 220 or these.  Reviews I read both at Amazon and elsewhere made me decide the RS 180 was the way to go.  Many have reported having problems with static or broken signals with the RS 220, which, apparently, uses a different wi-fi system.  I've had no problems with the signal using my RS 180.  Sound quality is very clear and static free.  My listening distance from the headphones' base is usually around 15 feet, but I've walked into other rooms while wearing these and found the signal remains clear and strong.  The headphones are comfortable even after wearing them for several hours.  Battery life has never been an issue.  Sennheiser claims these can be used for up to 24 hours on a single charge (two AAA Eneloop rechargeable batteries are included).  I've never even come close to testing that claim as I stop watching TV long before these things run out of juice.  The RS 220, in contrast, only lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge, which could be an issue if multiple people were to use it during the day.  The RS 220 reportedly does have slightly better sound quality, but you pay through the nose to get that little extra bit of quality.  There's a point of diminishing returns with everything, and for my purposes, the RS 180 is the right balance of price and performance.The only real niggle I have is with the volume buttons on the headphones.  The volume-up button is actually bigger than the volume-down button.  It's easy enough to find and press while wearing the headset.  The button right next to it is the power button.  It has a raised surface that aids in locating it by feel.  The next button over is the volume-down button.  It's notably smaller than the volume-up button (form over function) and can be a little hard to find when you're feeling for it while wearing the headphones.  Sometimes I have to remove the headset to find it, although I'm getting better at finding it the more I wear these.  It's not a huge deal since I don't have to adjust the volume often, but it's an area for improvement if Sennheiser ever decides to redesign these.As others have mentioned, there is a very slight time delay in the wireless signal (emphasis on "very slight"), so if your TV's speakers are turned up while you're listening to the headphones, you can hear the slightest echo effect.  If your TV's speakers are turned down enough relative to the headphones, you might not even notice it.  The signal delay really is quite small, so the effect is minor, but, apparently, not all wireless headphone suffer from this, so it needs to be mentioned at least.Despite these minor issues, I still give 5 stars to the RS180 for its solid performance at this price point.[Edit: 12-1-13] Just wanted to update this review with a word about Sennheiser's excellent customer support.  One of my kids knocked my headphones and its base off their shelf, which damaged them internally so that they would no longer produce sound.  I sent them in to Sennheiser with a note about how they got broken.  I acknowledged the existing warranty might not cover such abuse and stated I was willing to pay for the repair if needed.  A couple weeks later, Sennheiser mailed me what looks to be a new (but is perhaps refurbished) unit and base with all of the needed wires (I had only mailed in the headphones and base unit without the wires).  No questions asked, and no cost to me.  First class customer service.

p357

VAfter spending a few days researching the various wireless headset options, I settled on the Sennheiser RS 180 wireless headphones. There was some heavy internal deliberation between the this set (RS 180) and it's cousin the RS 170. Both are overall quite similar, with the most significant difference being the 170 is a closed design, whereas the 180 is open.Others have covered the differences between closed vs open, so I won't reiterate. The other consideration was the comparably priced Sony MDR-DS6500.UNBOXING:I received the order quickly and everything was in good shape. The unboxing experience was decent, and a was pleasantly surprised to find little touches like a vanity sleeve to hide cables. Not necessary, but a thoughtful detail.SETUP:Setup was quick and the rechargeable batteries came pre-charged, meaning I was listening to music in about 10 minutes from unboxing, after a short review of the setup guide.EXPERIENCE:I've owned a number of Senn's over the years (HD 280, HD500's) and they've always delivered accurate sound with a luxurious cushioned feel. However, with the RS 180 being  wireless, I was somewhat apprehensive of the sound quality, being my first foray into cord-cutting. Needless to say I am impressed.Being in my 30's, my hearing is no probably no match for a 20 year olds. That said, for TV and casual console gaming the sound quality is really excellent, even considering the nature of the source inputs. I did briefly consider the true audiophile positioned solution, the RS 220, but at $600 and a spotty wireless range, it was quickly out of the question.The headphones themselves are super comfy to wear for long periods and the open design means you won't get too hot. Wireless range is decent. I was able to walk around everywhere in my 2 Bedroom apartment without any signal loss or interruption.Others have mentioned some lag, however I plugged the receiver directly into the TV (Sharp Aquos) and when playing a game on the Wii with the volume turned up on both the TV and the headphones I was unable to detect any discernible delay. That is not to say there is none at all, but if there is, it's would almost surely below 200ms.IMPROVEMENTS:+ Buttons: I recall reading somewhere that Sennheiser's motivation behind the flat/flush button design of the headphone mounted controls, was to prevent accidental button pushing, when lying on one's side. While it looks like the company has been succesful in that regard, sadly it appears they've compromised on the overall user experience when it comes to changing volume. Hopefully the next iteration we'll see both goals being achieved. One random suggestion could be to have the buttons *indented* instead of protruding outwards? Either way, however it is solved, there needs to be some form of tactile feedback on the two most important buttons (Vol up/Vol down). Additionally it would be a good idea to spatially separate the volume controls from the other buttons.+ Sensor: How neat would it be if the trend towards smarter electronics (ie smartphones) in consumer electronics were adopted? For example, include a simple pressure sensor to let the headset's micro controller know when to turn the itself on an off. Of course, there would need probably need to be a suitable delay built in, so that after 2min or 5 minutes of it not being worn it shuts down, then as soon as you put it on your head it reconnects automatically. No fuss or user intervention needed and battery power is still conserved. As it stands power off is determined by whether a signal is playing or not, but that again places additional behavior (turn off the tv/sound source etc), on the user.+Digital input: One thing that the Sony MDR-DS6500 has going for it is digital input. Unfortunately Sennheiser only includes this on their most expensive model, the RS 220. At around $250 bucks for this set, I think this should be a standard feature on this model too.So there you have it. The RS 180's are a fine (if somewhat pricey) pair of headphones that will almost certainly make you smile.

VThe first thing is to make sure you know what you are getting.  This is a set of wireless headphones meant for use within the home.  The charging base plugs into any sort of audio source just like a normal headphone jack, and the idea is to be able to wander around listening to your audio source with no cords.  They are not sound-cancelling headphones, their primary purpose is to protect your apartment neighbors or others in your home who may not want to hear your electronics at full volume.  Now, on to the review.I bought this product nearly two years ago, and the ratio of cost to how much use/pleasure I get out of this device is one of the best/highest of anything I own, right up there with my phone, PC, and bed.  I use these headphones in my small studio apartment, plugged directly into my main sound system so every device I own can play through these.I don't know how else to say it; they're phenomenal.  I'll try to list some of the highlights:-The sound is crisp and clear, it allows high volume with no loss in quality that I can detect.  I am no audiophile but I do love my music, and these are wonderful.-The comfort on your head is stunning, possibly the best feature of the product.  I can give it the highest possible compliment, which is that I very frequently forget I'm even wearing them and sometimes actually walk out of the apartment in them.  Unbelievable comfort, even when I wear them all day for gaming and music (6-8 hours on a weekend).-Charging is as easy as possible, simply place the headphones on the cradle and off they go.-Battery life is everything you could need.  I've used these for upwards of 12+ hours without needing a charge, I have never had them die on me unless I forget to place them back on the cradle.-Audio is instant, absolutely no delay detectable by the human nervous system (or, I suppose, not detectable by THIS human's nervous system...)I am unable to speak to the range of the headphones, since my apartment is rather small, but I have no problem using them in the kitchen, which is probably 20 feet from the charging base and has a solid wall between.  If you'd like to get more details on distance, I suggest looking to other reviews.  As stated above, these are not sold as sound-cancelling headphones, so you can still hear things around you if they are loud enough, and if there is anyone else in the room with you they will likely hear a faint murmur of what you are listening to, especially at higher volumes.With all that said, I am happy to give this product an 5-star rating with no caveats or qualifications.  If and when this product ceases to function someday, if I am unable to have it fixed I will simply purchase another set.  They're just that good.

VThese headphones get 5 stars from me because the sound is clear, they are light weight and easy to set up and use. I wasn't upset that they had to charge 16 hours before I could use them cause lots of products require charging right out of the box and before use. It took some time to get use to the control buttons because they are small and very close together and there is nothing to differentiate, by touch, which button does what so I have to feel around a bit and go off memory. I have small hands so feeling around is not a problem for me. I did not experience any background noise like a few others have described nor did I experience the headset shutting off during times when the movie had long pauses or whispering. I even paused a movie I was watching for 10-15 minutes and when I returned the headphones were still on. I did experience a split second of sound delay. I'm not sure exactly what that was from. On some movies the sound will be on point then the next movie the sound will lag behind but it has only happend to me once so far. I share a living area with 3 other women so at any given time there are tv's, hair dryers, music, and chatter in the background. These headphones do a ok job drowning out the worst of the background noise and allowed me to hear the movie I'm watching. I compared all of the headphone manufactured by this company and I went with this model because I felt that if I was going to spend a large amount of money on headphones then I might as well go with the best. I purchased the warranty just in case. Overall 4 stars for the quality of the headphones and clarity of sound. I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the small buttons and sound delay.Oh, and don't expect to lie down with these on your head. They are too big for that.

VMy previous experience with wireless headphones were the 900 RCA wireless headphones which I hated because they had poor range and sound quality.  I got rid of them after about two months of use.Recently I needed a pair of wireless headphones for late night listening.  Owning the amazing (for the price of $100) HD 518 makes choosing Sennheiser almost a no-brainer.  These are expensive, but after the bad experience of owning the RCA wireless headphones, I decided to pay more for something better.  The total cost I paid was $303 after sales tax.Sound Quality:These are way better than the RCA wireless headphones I had before.  The hiss and background noise are gone.  Range is decent.  I get about 60ft around my house.  Battery life is fantastic.Unfortunately, the sound quality doesn't compare well to the much cheaper wired HD 518.  I know it's not fair to compare wireless headphones to wire ones, but for $300 I feel they should sound a little better.  Don't get me wrong.  These are fantastic for movies.  For music, they are not as refined as the HD 518.While I have no problem with the buttons, I don't like the blinking lights on the base and the headphones.  Why blinking lights on headphones designed for discreet, private use?  Another thing that could have been better is the ear pad ergonomics/comfort.  While the ear pads on the HD 518 are longer and completely surround my ears, the ear pads on the SR 180 are shorter and sit on parts of my ears making the SR 180 less comfortable to wear than the HD 518.Those minor quibbles asides, I think these are good wireless headphones and certainly recommend them.

VFit, finish, and sound are fine, but the short range is really disappointing. I use wireless headphones while watching late night TV, movies, and talk radio. These are fine if you are plunked down in front of the tv, but they cut out if you get more than 30 feet away. So forget about vaccuuming, cutting the grass, or cleaning the pool with these. I would definitely send them back except that they were a gift and you practically have to destroy the box to get them out. Did I mention I am really disappointed, especially for the price someone paid for these.

VFor the first time in years, I enjoyed watching TV.  I just got these yesterday and I watched TV for the 1st time in years.  I have always sat on the couch and played with my IPad while my husband watched TV because to have the TV loud enough to hear was unbearable  and nerve racking, even to myself.  No matter how loud the TV was, I could not hear the voices over the background notice, applauding etc.  I wear bilateral hearing aides with my left ear having severe hearing loss.  At 18 I started losing my hearing and at 42, I finally started researching products for TV and I think I made a great choice.  I would give anything to find a pair of hearing aides that made everyday sounds with such clarity and precision.  To hear live conversations like this would change my life.  If anyone knows of hearing aides that work this well, please let me know.  My first show to watch with these was Betty White's off their Rockers and my 10 year old son said "Mom, I have never heard you laugh so much".  I heard every word and the other noises were not over powerful. The commercials did not get increase in volume.  I can't wait to try music and watch a movie.  I may now know things that are happening in this world.  The buttons are close together and hard to feel while wearing them, but I don't think that I will be doing much adjusting to the volume anyway.  I love the fact that  I can balance them according to my hearing loss being greater in my left ear.  THANK YOU, Sennheiser! Please design a hearing aide with this awesome sound and clarity!  This would give life back to so many.

VThese headphone can deliver the most amazing sound.  You will be surprised that wireless headphones can do what these do in terms of sound quality.Unlike some of the reviewers I did not experience any interference from or to my WiFi.  I had these set up right next to my Roku Box and was able to watch Netflix while listening through these headphones without any issues at all.Also...I found the range to be quite good. I was able to move throughout my 2700 sq ft ranch style house without a single drop out.I ended up returned them.What???!!!The only way I could get these to work with my Home Theater setup was through the headphone jack.  My receiver has no analog (or digital) audio out that isn't associated to a specific device.All of my devices are connected via HDMI to my receiver and try as I might I could not figure out any way to get an audio out other than to my TV via the HDMI out cable.This is absolutely a shortcoming of my receiver, NOT these headphones.Just do what I did not before you buy.  Check how you are going to hook these up and make sure you have a connection that will provide analog audio out while using whatever input devices you want to use these with (cable box, Roku Box, BlueRay player etc.)Of course, if you are OK plugging and unplugging these into the headphone jack then all is well.

VI have them all.  This one is poorly engineered.

sg5
VI have several brands of wireless headphones including the Senheiser models 110, 120, and now the 180.  They all have good sound, as good as you will get for wireless.  I dont notice much difference between them in terms of sound quality.  Interestingly, when the models 110 and 120 go out of range you get static, but the 180 just cuts off (which is slightly better I think).  The range is essentially exactly the same, maybe 70 feet for the models 110 and 120, and 72 feet for the model 180.Now the downsides to the model 180.  It has completely worthless buttons  on the side that are too small and flat and unusable while you are wearing.  You have to take off the phones to adjust volume, etc.  Also, you have to turn the base on to listen to stuff.  The previous models turned on automatically when there was a signal.  Plus, I have had since initial release and still dont know what the ALC button does, im sure it is some gimmick.  Worst of all, the thing flashes the power light all the time wether on or off.  I find having the base beside the tv flashing at me all the time even more annoying than the complete idiocy of buttons that you cant feel.  Utterly ridiculous engineering.

V100% Satisfaction
p411

VLove these things.  I won't pretend to be an audiophile but these headphones sound great to me.  Prior to these I used a pair of Bose QuiteComfort noise canceling headphones.  While the Senneiser RS180 are not noise canceling their sound quality seems to be on par with my old Bose, i.e. - they sound great.  Set up is as easy as plugging in the base (transmitter) to whatever is playing your sound just as you normally would.  Install batteries, power everything on and you are wireless.The best feature to me is the wireless capability of these headphones.  Great if you work in front of a computer, great if you like to rock out after putting the kids to bed, great for a lot of reasons.  My home is a 6100 sq ft, 3 story solid log home.  Solid log homes are notorious for making life in the wireless world difficult.  Things like WiFi just don't transmit well through the logs.  With my transmitter placed next to my computer in the basement of our home I walked to every corner of every floor and the sound and reception quality of these headphones never skipped a beat.A+ Worth every penny.

VGreat sound but some unnecessary annoyances
p417
sg5
VWell, it just has to be said. These are brilliant headphones in terms of undisturbed sound transmission and quality of sound. However, there are a few things that really frustrate me about these cans. The much mentioned volume buttons that are too small are just one. Unlike others I do get headaches from the cushions, which are positioned on the sides of the head centre. Somehow these cushions seem to press on some nerves and after a few minutes I get headaches that emanate from these pressure points. I get around this by putting half a headband from a HD 280 in the groove between the cushions so that the pressure is spread between the top of my head and the sides. This works well, but why does the customer have to come up with a work around for such a problem? Ah, I get it - custom (er) meaning I have to customise the product.But now to my big gripe with these headphones - They constantly interfere with my WiFi network! About 50% of the time when I turn on the base station and as soon as I turn on the headphones themselves, my WiFi network goes down. And, as reported by someone else, as soon as I turn the base station off, my WiFI network comes back on. The most frustrating part is that Sennheiser Germany are not acknowledging this problem. Their response to an inquiry was "There is something wrong with your WiFi network, talk to the manufacturer of your WiFi equipment". Thing is, I've got two Apple Airport Extreme to create a WiFI bridge between the main house and my separate house on the other side of the pool and the WiFi bridge has been ROCK solid until I started using the RS 180. Knowing Apple, I am very sure that they have implemented the 802.11n standard down to the very minute detail, so I believe that it's Sennheiser/KLEER who haven't done their homework. The Apple Airport Extremes have an 'Interference Robustness' feature but even this is no match against the destructive power of the RS180. I even tried setting the channels of the Airport Extremes manually, hoping that the RS180 had a preference for a channel, but it didn't make a difference. You know, we wouldn't have this discussion if Sennheiser/KLEER had put a knob at the back of the base station with which one could manually set the channel (1-15) of the WiFi frequency. I am a long time loyal Sennheiser lover, but what they've delivered here is simply not up to their standards. Most of all I'm disappointed about the unfriendly, unhelpful and almost arrogant responses I got from the Sennheiser Germany Service team. Their last response was "If you're having these problems then move the base station away from your WiFi network". HELLO? Electronics gear is normally in one area of the room because the cables (audio, power, ethernet) are at a certain length of about 2 meters AND, I do not want to put any cables across the floor, over a door or behind a cupboard. That's the whole point of wireless headphones - To AVOID at least one cable. If I have to extend the audio cable to the other side of the room I've successfully added the one cable I was trying to get rid off back into the equation. Besides, I've put the base station at the other end of the room (and now have 5 meters of said cable across the floor) yet, I still lose the Internet connection due to a WiFI dropout from interference of the RS180. This is VERY annoying, especially since I want to use the headphones predominantly together with the Internet for radio and Skype.So, final verdict - great sound but definitely lacking in terms of compatibility with 802.11n networks. Shocker.If it wasn't for the sound these headphones would get 0 stars from me (In fact, I can't believe that I still give it 4 stars, but that's simply how good the sound IS).Sennheiser, please, please, get it right with the next iteration of the KLEER powered wireless headphones. And while you're at it, give us some bigger volume knobs and a headband that goes across the whole head, not just two small pressure points on the sides.God it feels good to finally get this off my chest. Hope Sennheiser read this one day AND do something about it.Hope this helps,Fazz

VOne Very Annoying Behavior
p422
sg5
VThese headphones work great, with the exception of one behavior.Easy to set up, easy to use (once I figured out how to turn off the speakers on the TV while using the headphones), but, as others have mentioned, the audio signal turns off during very quiet passages in the audio, then comes back on when the audio hits a certain level. The result is this horrifically annoying dropout you can hear quite plainly. In fact, I can't stand it. During particularly quiet dialog scenes, when no one is talking you can hear the signal stop. Then when someone starts to talk again their first word is sort of clipped as the system turns back on. It's so annoying that I will be returning these little gems.Now I must resume the search for a good quality wireless tv headphone.

VThere are not enough stars to rate this wireless headphone. I have owned one for a number of months and have no remorse or excuses to justify the cost. I own Sony and Bose "wired" headphones and have found no comparison to the 'wireless" Sennheiser RS 180. The quality of sound, the wireless distance they cover, and the comfort they afford are second to none. After being so pleased, my wife pressured me to buy her a set. For cost reasons,we tried the RS 170, but found the RS 180 was better considering all factors. Both were great in quality of sound, but the "Kleer" feature on the RS 180 pushed the quality up a couple of notches. The exterior casing is much better on the RS 180. And the headset fit and design is better on the RS 180.They are both great units, but if the price difference does not enter into the decision making, the RS 180 is a much better choice.

VAfter having these for over a year now I can honestly say this is money well spent. With all the noise around my house or when I just want to hear the program with out missing anything these headphones are superb. They are lightweight and super comfortable. I can wear these for hours before they start wearing on you. Yeah, you get an echo if you have the tv volume up higher than the hearing volume of the headset, but why are you wearing headphones then? Anyhow, these things work all over my house (including my basement) and way out in the yard. Awesome coverage as I never have to miss anything no matter where I am in the house. I even bought myself a second headset for the wife and replacement ear cushions for the set. You can add up to four of these headsets per docking station. Sterophonics are great as I listen to music channels all the time.

VI own several Sennheiser headphones and I've never been disappointed with any of them. This was my first wireless and it didn't disappoint either. Sound quality is as good as other corded headphones. At least, I didn't notice any significant difference with my HD598. If you like the sound of the 500s you should like these ones. The wireless system seems very good. No noise and the range seems quite good. I walked around with these headphones putting  3 brick walls between me and the receiver and not only did I never loose the signal but the sound quality remained the same. I would just mention that I found them "hot" at the beginning but now it's fine. I can wear them all day (up to 6 hours) without any problem.

VFINALLY! I've gone though six pairs of headphones in the last three months. None have been satisfactory. They have either been too uncomfortable, had no power, had no bass or clarity. That includes a Bose and several that were at least $100 more in price. With this headphone I have finally found headphone  nirvana. They are the most comfortable phones I've ever worn. So lightweight you hardly feel them. There is crystal clear clarity. They produce what sounds like 5.1 dolby surround while watching movies..  The biggest surprise was discovering that when called for, it has incredible bass, not overpowering, but right on balance. WOW. .All I can say is get one asap.  You'll be glad you did.

VSound on these headphones is great.  Compared to my Bose QE15 headphones the sound is more open and cleaner.  I would have rated these a 5 star but they do not offer surround sound (would like this for move watching/listening and they also do not have a digital sound input, only analog.  Would have opted for the step up to the Sennheiser  RS 220 phones as they do offer digital input and probably have little better sound but in researching them versus the RS 180 the RS 220 is still stereo (no surround sound) and the wireless strength seems to be poorer than that of the RS 180.Overall I am pleased with the RS 180 and see no need to upgrade to the RS 220 at this time

VA step down from the previous generation for TV listening
p464
sg5
VI returned my pair.  The controls are almost impossible to access quickly compared to the previous generation (RS140).  They are digitally controlled, meaning that you have to press and hold them down for a while before they really begin to respond.  Importantly, the controls are so close together that it is very difficult to perform simple tasks such as adjust the volume without taking the headphones off so that you can see their exactly location.  On the RS140s, the volume was just a scroll wheel that could be easily located and adjusted quickly, for instance, when you want to shut up "Crazy Larry's" TV commercial.  The sound is not well-suited to TV listening either.  It seems to have a huge amount of mid-range, which just does not work for TV listening.  If you're a purist audiophile who spends most of his time listening to music, these may indeed have the better audio quality, but I think most people would still prefer the manual controls on the RS140 instead of the RS180s digital controls if they had could try both.  This seems to be a sad case where Senheisser tried to 'upgrade' the product by installing fancier digital controls, but sacrificed, perhaps unwittingly, usability.

VThis will not be a technical review, just a more "normal person's thoughts".  This came packaged well, and I was able to easily figure out how to get everything hooked up without any issue.  The sound is amazing, and it drowns out about 80-90% of exterior sound (which is what i would expect with these type of ear piece configuration).  You still hear a little outside sound, but to me that is good because i dont want to be oblivious to my phone ringing, a possible threat, or anything else that I would not recognize.  Overall, these are excellect earphones, and well worth the money.  I am a happy consumer of this product.

VPeace in the Family. I have recently moved into a new home with my wife, daughter and son-in-law. The kids are blessed with excellent hearing, while mine has been sub-standard most of my life. My wife and kids were constantly telling me to turn the volume down. If I did this, I could nnot hear the TV. The Sennheiser RD180 has solved all our problems. I can listen at any level I wish and no one is disturbed. In addition, the sound quality is superb. I often hear things the rest of the family does not. I would recommend the RS180 for anyone with hearing problems.

You can use the tip of your finger to feel for the raised "power" icon on the power button and then just remember volume up is to the left and volume down is to the right. You don't want to have to take these off and turn on a light to adjust, especially if one of your goals is to listen at night without disturbing your bed mate.

I just got them today so I haven't had a chance to play with them a lot. Maybe i'll figure out something that changes the SQ.The sound is free of any hiss or pops and It seems that the quality of the wireless signal is great, but the headset themselves leaves a little to be desired, Def not as good as my 120$ Sony headphones. If you are a true die hard audiophile, these are not for you. If you want a decent pair of headphones, and need them to be wireless, than these should be considered. With that said, they will not sound as good as 70$+ wired headphones.

VI couldn't be happier with these headphones.  ZERO background noise.  Exceptionally audio and as advertized the headphones enhance the audio clarity, as if bringing the voices to the front of the screen.This particular model -- the 180 -- focuses on "open air" and the audio clarity.  They do not dwell on the surround sound capability.  But, I have found the surround sound to be incredible.  Even much more of a 5:1 effect than I get with my room system (which is also fantastic).  So - I wouldn't even consider any other model, or for that matter, any other brand than the Sennheiser.  Pricey?  yes, but you get what you pay for.

VI previously had a pair of Sennheiser 120's and upgraded to the 180 to add a 2nd headphone. The sound quality of the 180 is only marginally better than the 120 and the positioning of the controls makes it more difficult to use. The 120 could be easily turned on and the volume could be adjusted while wearing the headphones, but the controls of the 180 are flush to the unit so it is necessary to take the headphone off each time you need to adjust it.If you buy additional headsets you will need to sync them to the base before they'll function. To do this, with the base and headset both in the off/stand by mode, press and hold the on/off buttons on both units for approximately seven seconds until both units begin to repeatedly flash. Viola!If you find that only one of your headsets will work at a time, inspect the base and see if the bottom light is flashing more than once or only once. If the light is only flashing once, press and then quickly release the on/off button and the bottom light will begin to blink multiple times indicating it is broadcasting to more than one headset.Hope this helps. Enjoy.

VTypical terrible Sennheiser ergonomics
p542
sg5
VThese are really great sounding and comfortable for me. I've got a big head and it just fits me on the biggest size setting, but it does, and is comfortable. This is not a surprise - I've had other Sennheiser headphones with the velour ear pads and they are super comfortable and they know how to make a good sounding headphone.Having said that, Sennheiser's ability to make ergonomically sound products is dreadful. I've never seen one with sensible button layout or generally well thought out products, aside from the the drivers and microphones.- As everyone points out, the buttons are difficult to tell apart by feel and are all next to each other on the headphone, where they can't be seen when you are wearing them out. It's just a joke that the entire bottom surface of the right headphone is slick and with non-distinct features to highlight the different buttons. The mute / off button is in the middle of the volume buttons. WTF! The balance buttons are right next to the volume and there is no way to see if you have the balance centered, only listening. I can't understand how they make garbage like this. It's only the ergonomics that they are so terrible at. It's like they have someone high up in the company who makes the final decision on ergonomics and is clueless.- I expected the button problems because everyone has been so vocal about them. What really baffles me is that the headphones and base BOTH need to be turned on when you want to listen to them. If I have the headphones on the charging base and take them off, I can't understand why the base can't turn on automatically when I take the headphones off of the base. The headphones should turn on, too.- The main LED (multi-function LED) blinks all the time. I have the headphone base near my TV and it blinks whenever I am using the headphones. It's in my line of sight, so if it is working, it is distracting. It might be telling me that there is one headphone linked or two. It might be telling me that things are normal. It might be telling me the status of the charge. Lots of blink codes, but it never just is on steady. It's not like LEDs are expensive -- there could have been several if they thought it was so important to show all of that stuff.These headphones are too comfortable and sound too good to return, but they are firmly in the camp of products I just don't like, but can't find one that is better. I really wish Sennheiser would get their act together. They have the sound quality down. If they would only raise to the level of mediocre ergonomics, they would truly be great.Update after using these 2-3 hours every day for a month:They still sounds good.The ergonomics are showing even more details of how bad it is.:- You need to turn on the base all the time. The base isn't hard enough to push the button without the base sliding all over, so pushing the on button is a two handed affair.- I use these every day and still struggle to tell what button are which. It isn't impossible, but it's surprisingly hard. I have to focus to hit the right button. I can say that this is the only product I own where I need to focus to operate it.- Adding the balance button nonsense; if I lean my head back on the couch and turn my head to the right, the couch pillow hits one of the buttons, changing the balance or volume.

VVery good sound quality.  I have been using this now for about 2 weeks.  I had been using the Sennheiser RS 130 for about 15 yrs and was consistently pleased.  I finally purchased this new product, RS 180 as my 130 was beginning to cut out even when I was right in front of the transmitter (I think it was the batteries and simply long term wear).  The RS 130 did last a long time with no visible signs of deterioration so I am hoping for the same with the RS 180.  My only complaints is that I preferred (so far at least) the RS 130 on/off switch on the head phones (simple, easy to use on one side of the head phones) and volume control (very simply, gradiant dial on the other side).  The RS 180 requires to first turn on the transmitter, and THEN turn on the head phones.  I suspect that I will quickly get used to this change, but have not yet.  The other thing I initially don't like as much is the volume and on/off buttons on the RS 180.  They are all push buttons (push in and release) for their incremental activation (push repeatedly for the volume to go up  or down).  The power button is in btw the volume buttons and can easily be confused.  It would have been much more intelligent to have the power button on the other ear/side so as to not confuse.Finally, I have not found the  RS 180s to be as comfortable.  I was surprised by this as the reviews I read commented about how comfortable these are.  I may just need to get used to them but I do not find them to be as comfortable as the RS 130s were.The reason I rated them a 4/5 with these short comings is the sound quality.  The sound is very good for wireless.  Hopefully I will get accustomed to the other things I do not like as much with time, but 'getting used to' things is not normally something I expect for a device that costs $200 from a quality brand such as Sennheiser.

VI used Sennheiser 120s for years to help me hear dialogue on TV and movies with good results.  I bought the RS 180 after reading reviews here and elsewhere, thinking I can do even better with improved phones. Overall, I am not disappointed.SET UP:  No printed manual.  The quick setup guide is very sparse indeed - just diagrams, no words.  Although these are headphones (how complicated can that be?) there are different colored lights that blink, multi-function buttons, etc.  A more detailed "quick" setup guide would have been useful. I recommend watching the 4-minute installation video on the Sennheiser site before installing.  The full detailed manual is on the included CD and on line. I recommend downloading it to your computer or iPad for a searchable manual.  Instructions say to allow 16 hours for the first battery charge, but my charge light went out after 2 hours and worked fine.THE GOOD:* RANGE: I hoped the 180 would have at least as good range as the 120, allowing me to wander about the house and garden without interference or drop out. The range on the 180 is at least as good or better than the 120.*  SOUND QUALITY: Excellent, noticeably better than the 120.  Deep(er) base, bright treble. The automatic level control (ALC), which is toggled on/off, boosts quiet sections and quiets down noisier ones (i.e., commercials). I wouldn't use this feature for music, but for TV and movies, the dialogue stands out.* MUTE BUTTON: A small but useful feature: The "multi-function" button on the headset also operates as a mute.  This is handy for those annoying commercials.  On my previous phones if you wanted mute you had to turn down the volume.* COMFORT:  Snug fit, these don't fall off my head when I bend or move, but I can wear them for hours without discomfort.  They are considerably lighter than my old pair, I forget I have them on.* FLEXIBLE USE:  There is a cable included for use with the earphone jack as well as an RCA cable for audio outputs.  This is important, as you have the option of whether to silence the internal speakers of your sound source or have them independently controlled (are you watching/listening alone or with someone else who needs the speakers on?)THE NOT SO GOOD:* CONVENIENCE:  Unit must be manually turned on in two places before use - both transmitter and headset.  My previous set had just one on/off switch on the headset.  This is a minor inconvenience.  Unit shuts off automatically in a few minutes if unattended to save batteries, but it must be manually started.* CONTROLS: As was stated numerous times in these reviews, the headset controls are difficult to locate in use.  I agree.  In my opinion this is the only real downside to the 180 - I prefer old-fashioned analogue dials that you can feel.  Why Sennheiser didn't test usage, read the reviews, and simply put raised guides on the controls makes me shake my head-isn't volume control a rather basic function to headphones? One reviewer here said he used epoxy to make his own raised guide - I may do that if I don't get the hang of it soon.  I'll follow up after a few weeks of use.ONE MORE THING: Several reviews here mentioned a noticeable delay when the headphones are used with the speakers of the sound source causing an annoying "echo" effect.  Unlike my previous set, this was the case with the 180 when I first tried them with my wife listening through the TV speakers.  This would have been a deal-killer had I not been able to correct it.  However, on my late model LG TV under audio settings there are controls called "AV Sync" where I can adjust the audio stream of either the headset or the sound source.  The problem was quickly solved.  If your TV doesn't have this audio setting, it may be possible to work around it another way, such as using the TV or receiver's RCA audio output instead of the headphone jack.SUMMARY:Excellent sound, especially for a wireless set, reasonably priced for the quality, comfortable to wear, reasonably easy to set up and use.  I would give it a 5 star rating if....well, you know, those controls.ADDITIONAL COMMENT REGARDING THOSE CRAPPY CONTROLS: After a few weeks trying to get the hang of using the controls while wearing the headphones, I gave up -- it's just too difficult. I took the advice of one reviewer and placed a drop of epoxy on the control knob (off/on, etc).  It works perfectly, and now using the controls while wearing the phones is easy.  Before you apply the epoxy, be sure to seal the cracks surrounding the button with tape so glue doesn't drip inside and freeze the button.  I doubt the warranty would apply in that case. My 4-star rating stands rather than a perfect 5 -- there is no excuse for the poor design when the solution would be so simple.

VI have waited a long time for wireless headphones that can do what these can do.  I have gone through several cheaper pairs that either weren't comfortable, sounded terrible - and often both.  I was blown away by these headphones after first listen.  I needed a pair of headphones that I could use late at night but wouldn't cripple my movie watching experience.  These things work beautifully, and I am able to keep that quality through every room in my house and even outside.  I've been using them as regular speakers during the day now while working, using my TV as a Pandora/Tune In Radio player and the sound doesn't drop for a second.One note - these are not noise cancelling headphones - if you were these, and there is noise around you, you will here it.  I find it a nice balance, as the soundstage is wide and clear, but if the phone rings I will hear it subtly.  This "open air" design also seems to give the sound a richer, clearer sound - especially during movies.  While nothing can replace a true surround sound experience, these do a great job of giving you that effect.Hooking them up is a breeze - and even though they suggest charging for 16 hours, the batteries (which are marked as pre-charged) worked right out of the box, and the first charge took less than a hour to complete.It's also nice that you can hook into either an analog output (which will allow you to listen directly from any A/V source) or more importantly, if you are using an A/V receiver like mine which cuts the speakers off when you plug in any headphone jack.  Not a problem for me in that I usually want my speakers off, but for someone just looking to "add" the headphones to the entertainment equipment without cutting out the speakers for someone else who might be enjoying the same medium.After about a week, I told my wife that it's one of the most rewarding purchases I have made for our living room.  I highly recommend these!

VGreat sound, lousy controls
p566
sg5
VI've enjoyed Sennheiser wireless headphones for many years. The old pair was showing its age so I updated to the RS 180. These are far more comfortable to wear than the previous pair. The sound is slightly better. I can now make volume balance adjustments separately for each ear.Now for the controls. Not sure why the ease of operation wasn't a goal for this model. With the previous model I could click the on and off button on the left earphone. I could adjust the volume by turning a wheel on the right earphone. (no left/right balance adjustment). Now I have to first turn on the device by clicking on a button on the base. This is actually a two-handed operation as the base needs to be held in place when pushing the button lest it be shoved off its perch. (At least this button goes off automatically when the headphones are charging).Next I have to turn on the headphones by looking directly at the headphones. Although there are raised "pimples" on the on/off button they are very difficult to locate by touch. I have to look. It is difficult to feel the other buttons, all smooth, one each for vol. up, vol. down, L and R balance, since they are all crammed together in a 1 3/4" line and the buttons become smaller and smaller until the last balance button is smaller than the tip of my little finger. So one must look in order to find the buttons. (After a month I have learned by feel to turn the volume up...but not down). Obviously this requires taking the headphones off first and the adjustments can only be tested by placing the headphones back on and then taking them off again if further adjustments are needed. What a shame for a design where form trumps function.This device would easily deserve 5 stars if it weren't for the lousy controls.

VI saw that this set of earphones received many great reviews. I'm baffled at that. Besides looking at the specs the deciding factor...? the reviews. I'm only slightly meticulous when it comes to electronics. I've been using the Sennheiser RS 180's for a couple weeks now. I have to say that I'm not really impressed with this set of earphones. I was expecting much more. In my opinion they sub-par at best. I have two other sets of cordless earphones that I purchased for much less and I don't see a big difference AT all.... I decided to buy this pair for work and thought I'd spend a little extra cash for a "good set". I really don't think they're worth it. I would say these are worth about $65 - $80 at the most. I have went out of my way to give them a fair chance. I plugged them into everything I own: TV, iPhone, laptop, desktop computer, iPad, and even a mp3 player. The disappointment was across the board. I compared them to all the other sets of earphones I own: Audio-Technica, Dre Beats Detox, ZipBuds, Sony MDR cordless, JVC cordless, and even a pair of Skull Candy phones. Still the Sennheiser set remained very middle of the road. I really... really wanted to like the Sennheiser set I bought, but I don't.I will give credit to the weight, very light. However, they feel cheap to me. Like fragile cheap. As for the sound....? I'm not really that impressed with that either. Good... not great. Not even close to the "cinematic oasis" as described in one of the reviews. They have a nice crisp sound and good stereo separation but seem to be lacking the "meat" you'd expect when spending this kinda cash. The best thing I think these headphones have going for them is... They are VERY comfortable, by far the most comfortable I've ever owned. Besides that, I can't give much more positive feedback. I'm happy for the folks that love this set of earphones, I wish I could say the same but I just can't.

VHow I solved the echo problem with the Sennheiser RS 180 and now have a new problem!
p577
sg5
VI have two sets of these headphones.  The first set I bought a about three years ago and I use them with a TV at my main home.  They are wonderful for me.  I have a problem common to many men, hearing loss that interferes with my wife's enjoyment of TV watching with me as I have to turn the sound up too high for her comfort.  These headphones solved that problem.  They have excellent, clear sound  and I can control my own volume.  We have a second home so I bought another set for it.  There I have a modern, 52 inch Sony mounted on the wall.  Like so many big TV's it has analog out and digital optical out.  I used the analog out to connect my Polk Audio soundbar...it doesn't have digital optical inputs and I enjoy good sound from it. I then connected the Sennheiser's to the optical out with a digital to analog convertor.  I GOT AN ECHO!  It was so bad I could only use them when the soundbar was off.  No more watching TV with my wife with the proper sound for both of us!  Too loud for her, too soft for me.  She started using earplugs.  I was bummed.  I poked around on the internet and found that the delay and consequent echo was not unusual and no one had a solution that worked for me.  The headphones, a little pricey, simply sat there holding down paper.  I would revisit the issue from time to time, never finding a solution.I don't know why the last hunt for a solution finally worked, but it did!  I bought , from Cable Electronics Labs, their A/V Distribution amplifier model AV400.  I ran a cable from analog out to the amp and connected the soundbar and headphones to the amp and the echo disappeared!  Marital bliss ensued.March 10, 2014A new problem has surfaced!  I started getting sound only through the right earpiece.  I found that by pulling the 3.5 mm audio cord out a mm or two from the transmitter both sides would work.  A bad connector, I thought.  I tried three others, all the same.  Something must be wrong with the connection inside the transmitter.  Long out of warranty, I'm afraid. I've removed two stars.December 20, 2014Problems all solved!  The fault was mine.  I hooked these up incorrectly.  I'm not a ninny and usually have no problems with simple connections but I have a wall mounted TV and couldn't see behind it and inserted the audio cables by feel.  I finally realized that one cord was in an audio input rather than the output.  Once corrected the headphones work very well and, once again, the echo is solved with the audio distribution amp.  I have changed the rating to five stars and encourage anyone with an echo problem from their TV to try my solution.

VI read many reviews on these before ordering them.  I use them a lot for watching TV and there was one review I read that concerned me some.  It said if you watch TV with the TV speakers on (for other people to listen) that there was enough of a delay in the sound to the headphones that it would sound out of sync and be annoying.  I have experimented with this and have not found this to be a problem at all.  I have my TV connected to a system with 5.1 surround sound and have noticed that if I turn the TV volume up at the same time you can hear both and while I don't like the mixing, it is not out of sync.  The same is true of the headphones.  I can hear both at the same time but they are in sync, there is not really a delay or an echo.  I also read in another review that there is a lot of sound that leaks out because they are an open design.  That is also an exaggeration.  Yes, some sound does leak out, but at normal listening levels other people in the room wouldn't really hear it. If you were lying next to someone in bed with the TV speakers off and they were trying to sleep they might notice the sound but it would not be enough to wake them if they were already sleeping.  I did try covering the outside of the headphones to make them a closed system to see if it would make a difference.  It reduced the quality of the sound I head through the headphones so I removed the covers.  it was just an experiment, I really don't think it's necessary.The range is excellent.  I also have a pair of Sennheiser RS 140s that are 900 Mhz and these have much better range that those do with no hissing or interference at all.  They just sound terrific.  I highly recommend them.  One other comment that is true is the volume controls on the bottom of the right earpiece are difficult to find and adjust while wearing the headphones.  I solved that problem by putting two drops of glue on the volume + and one drop on the volume - buttons and now I can find them with no trouble at all.  I just used 5 minute epoxy for the job.  They are great, I'm glad I got them.

VI've been using a 20-year-old pair of Sony headphones (high-end at the time). I was finally fed up with the cord getting wrapped up in my desk chair. After viewing all of the positive reviews I decided to get the RS 180 headphones.I recently had my hearing tested by an audiologist and found that my word discrimination accuracy is at 88% in my left ear and 96% in the right one. My upper frequency limit is just under 12,000 CPS. As you might perceive, my hearing isn't what it used to be (I'm 67).The RS 180 delivers sound superbly. The nifty right/left control on the headphones allows me to balance what I hear. And what I hear sounds clear and crisp. Music presents itself better than I could have imagined. Freedom to walk around is also a huge plus!One thing I found is that the signal doesn't transmit very well through concrete block walls. Thus, placement of the base unit is a big consideration for my environment.I have a pretty good sound system in my movie room but have been having difficulty with voiced sounds--they are sometimes mushy. This unit fixes that problem!I've been using the device for about two weeks and it has not cut out, no strange sounds or popping as some have reported. It fits well and doesn't put undue pressure on my head. They're quite comfortable.Well worth the money and I anticipate that it will last many years.UPDATE MAY 6 2013I sent them back for a replacement. I was using alkaline batteries instead of the rechargeable ones that came with the unit. That caused battery acid to spill all over the inside of the earpieces. I got a constant series of beeps that I couldn't get rid of. I filled out the warranty return form on the website--they gave me a free UPS return packaging slip and they sent me a brand new pair! (A note on the packing slip in the new package said that the damage was not covered under warranty. The free replacement was a "one time only courtesy". If I used alkaline batteries again it would cost me $119.95 next time.) Great service!!

VI ordered a refurbished RS180 to replace my existing top of the line Philips. The Philips was not bad, but definitely not execellent also. Bass was "hollow" and treble is flat, and its reception was problematic, frequently jumps channel even if I was working inside the living room, where the transmitter was placed.I've tried the RS180 in shop and wanted it for quite sometime but is keeping away from it deal to its price. But the longer I wear the Philips, my desire grew even more stronger, so I ordered a refurbished one from Amazon marketplace at around 50% of the original price.This is the first time I have ordered a refurbished item and I originally expected it would come in some kind of "white box". However, when I first received the package, I was shocked - it was wrapped in transparent polymer only. I said to myself that this must be crazy, who would send a headphone with a polymer wrapping! I opened it, and as I've speculated, it was seriously damaged. The plastic part left hand band had been totally broken and was holding in place by the wires only. Quite disappointed and I filed a claim and return it.Here's the best part I like about Amazon, most sellers were quite ethical and my replacement headphone came in again within 2 weeks. These time I pay special caution to ask the seller to send it with the proper packing - a box.I am very happy with RS180, it was as good as new. Sound quality is the best I have experienced so far. It is open-air designed so your wife will hear a little bit of what you are hearing, but this let it wear more comfortbaly, even for a long time. Reception is good, thpugh not excellent. I am living in a 90 sq.m apartment and there are dead corners, even if I keep all the doors open. But it covers around 90% of my apartment so I am quite satified. It open jump channels (or recover from a weak signal) occasionally which is much better than the Philips.It comes with the SANYO AAA rechargebale and if I am careless enough to forget recharging it, I can get spares to replace it. An interesting point of my Philips is that it is incompatible with the SANYO. I don't know why but if you put the SANYO into the Philips, it will continuously ask you to recharge it.I am very happy with my RS180. The lesson learned though, is you will better always ask the sellers to ship it with a box, even if that will cost you a few more bucks.

VBefore purchasing the RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone System I did a lot of research. When I listen to music during breaks at work I need to use headphones and I also need to be able to move around. Wired headphones were too confining, and I underestimated how much I would appreciate the ability to listen to music and simultaneously get up from the desk, walk down the hall to the copy machine, and move freely about the office.I wanted headphones with a wireless link that was completely transparent, as good as a wired link, because I'm pretty fussy about audio after working in the recording and broadcast industries for many years. The Kleer chipset with an OFDM modulated 2.4 GHz digital RF link that is used in the RS 180 has met my expectations. The transmitter is smart enough to frequency hop to a channel that is free from interference from wireless routers and other signals on the 2.4 GHz band.These headphones can be worn comfortably for hours due to the open-air design. The audio quality is good, although I can detect a little too much harmonic distortion on low-frequency sounds. The midrange and high end are crystal-clear and undistorted. There is absolutely no background hiss detectable, even in the quietest (ambient noise) location that I could find. The OFDM modulation scheme completely eliminates momentary disturbances due to multipath and fading. There is absolutely no detectable change in the audio as you turn your head or move around, something that no analog FM system can match. When the signal is insufficient for error-free audio, the headphones fade to silence rapidly. Upon restoration of signal they fade back up smoothly. The transmission range is adequate for their intended purposes.In short, these are the best wireless headphones that I've ever heard. My only complaint has been voiced by other reviewers. Sennheiser made a bad design decision when they decided to turn off the base station transmitter after a 5 minute loss of link to the headphones. As a result you need to return to the transmitter and push the power-on button again when this happens. The timeout needs to be longer; perhaps 15 minutes.

p607

VThis unit replaced my wired Sennheiser HD-580 phones (I finally got tired of replacing the wires every year or two).While the sound isn't quite as good as the 580's, it's awfully close. Far better sound than I'd expected to find in a wireless set.Range is impressive. I've only gone 50 feet or so from the base unit, but the distance included two sets of 2x6 walls plus 1 2x4 wall. I heard a very brief dropout once or twice, and they may have simply been the transmitter adjusting to the new receiver position. Other than those short quiet spells, the sound and reception have been excellent, with only minimal loss in volume.So far I'd give these phones 5 stars.The only reason I knocked a star off is because, as many have said, the small controls are a pain to find; definitely not something you just reach for by feel. I'll probably put small pieces of tape on one or two of the buttons to make it easy to know where my fingers are.I was worried about the 'ghosting' that some people have commented on. It's just not there if you follow Sennheiser's very clear instructions and turn your speakers off. If you leave them on, then it's perfectly normal for open-ear phones to let the ambient sound through and give that "echo".The other thing I worried about was synchronization with the video source. If there's an audio delay with the RS-180, I sure can't see it. I've watched about 25 hours of video so far and the lips and sound look perfectly fine to me.One other thing: as another reviewer or two noted, these phones do NOT have dynamic surround sound; that's a feature of the RS-170. Frankly, I don't think the RS-180 needs it.Overall, I'd highly recommend these phones, especially at Amazon's current price.Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone System with Dynamic Surround Sound

VJust unboxed this and tested it out.  I gotta say I don't understand some of these reviews from people saying how much they suck and how cheap they are and how poor the range is.  The sound is pretty much the best headphone sound I've heard, short of the sound you can get out of $400-500 MM550s or Dr. Dre Beats or other noise cancelling+SRS headphones.  But the range is fantastic for my needs.  I can go everywhere in my 3000 sq/ft house with no droppage or static.  I can go to the end of my 50 ft. driveway and then it starts breaking up.  So, can I get 300M or whatever they claim here? No, but that's line of site I'm sure.  I can get everywhere in my 3 story home and all the way around the outside of the house and the garage.I also was able to pair up a second pair of RS 180s very easily.  I don't get the guy who claimed the manual stunk.  It said how to do it...I did it...it worked.  Essentially, hold the ON button down on all the headsets for 7+ seconds, then hold the ON button on the base down for 7 seconds...then within 30 seconds, the blinking levels off and they're paired.  I don't understand what was so difficult.  Perhaps the instructions I got on the CD/DVD it came with were more updated?There was also a review somewhere about how cheap they felt and about the sound leakage.  I guess that's a matter of personal preference because I found them just fine for me.  I'm thinking it was a design decision such that if they'd made them solid-feeling aluminum or something, they'd be uncomfortably heavy.  As it stands, they're super light and the light, puffy velvety ear cups are very smooth and comfy.  They do leak a tiny bit of the sound, but it's not quite as bad as someone let on.  It's not like you can hear what someone is listening to from across the room, but if you know the song, sure, you can make it out if they've got it up high enough.  I had to get about 12" from my wife's ear before I could hear what she was listening to.  I wouldn't really call that bad sound leakage and a reason to not get these.  In fact, it's that quality which also lets you hear someone talking to you while you've got them on.  Some over-the-ear phones are so sound-tight that you can't hear a police car if it were in front of you.  These are such that you can easily hear people in the room at the same time without having to pull them off and go "WHAT!!??"Anyway, fantastic sound, great base, great highs, comfortable, good range, and more.  I found them worth the money.  I have 2 headsets with my base so my wife and I can watch a movie or TV show with the kids in the next room without bothering them or having them hear adult subject matter they're not ready for.UPDATE:  Minor con...when you have multiple people listening to the same audio stream on multiple RS 180's, when you turn your volume up, everyone gets their volume turned up.  When they turn theirs down, your's gets turned down.  This is fine as long as you're all the same deafness.  If someone is hard of hearing though, either you're going to get blasted or they won't hear it.

VI bought a set of these a few weeks ago. I'm an overnight worker and try to keep my sleep pattern regular, so I'm often up all night on my nights off. I live in an apartment building, so can't watch TV or listen to music very loudly without disturbing my neighbors. I've been waiting for some time to buy some quality wireless headphones that are lossless and affordable. I listen to music mostly, so wanted something that was highly rated for it. I have to say, I'm very impressed with the sound quality of these. They aren't as good as some wired headphones I've used in the past but they are pretty darned close. As for the range, they have dropped twice, both times when I went out onto my back porch, and then only for a second each time. They work fine out on my front porch, though. I've used them in all the rooms in my apartment without any issues, including my kitchen which has metal cabinets. I haven't used them in the basement yet but I will next time I do my laundry. I forgot the last 2 times. I found the set-up to be extremely easy. Just plugged them into my receiver's headphone jack (I was too lazy to deal with plugging them into the line-out in the back) and held the button on the base until it blinked, then did the same on the headphones. Instant sound. I have found the buttons to be fairly easy to get used to but adjusting the volume required a bit of thought at first. Once I got used to them, it's fairly easy to adjust without hitting the power button. These headphones are exactly what I wanted and I'm so glad they are lossless so I can listen to my music at CD quality. I can move anywhere in my apartment without losing the signal, which is good when I'm in my work shop or in the kitchen. I'm not limited to one room while I still get CD quality sound. Great product!

VI would put myself in audiophile / near-audiophile category as an evaluator. I listen critically and can tell the difference between different CD players, amps, speakers, headphones, etc, but I don't profess to hear differences with different cables and power supplies, nor do I treat every room perfectly with bass traps, etc. for listening. I also don't listen solely to lossless audio, but can tell the difference between bad compression and good compression.I wanted to point that out for similar users. In my opinion, these headphones sound great and are quite enjoyable and offer enough fidelity for the wireless application. It's not *as good* as wired solutions, but it's pretty close, and it's great to have the freedom to walk around without cords. Even the cords of earbuds.These headphones are a little heavy in the low end for me, but I do most of my listening with Martin Logan in-walls and Von Schweikert VR-1s, or with earbuds. Earbuds I have owned and used are Etymotic ER-4p, ER-6i, B&O;, and Ultimate Ears Super.fi 10, v.moda vibe. I'm not a fan of Shure's. Monster Gold was fun because of the bassiness. Only other "can" type headphones I have used are Denon AD-AH2000, which are very good, but a bit heavy.I would point out that the low end is not displeasurable. Just more than I typically listen to.The headphones are easy to set up on a one transmitter to a one receiver set up. I could never get it to work where one transmitter sent to multiple receivers (in my case, 2). So I instead had to daisy chain the audio cable from the first transmitter to the second transmitter.Pros: Very good sound quality for an audiophile ear, but they won't be your best headphone if you're an audiophile. They are light, non-fatiguing and immensely enjoyable. The open ear design is great for enjoying great audio in the house without getting closed off from the world.Cons: Not easy to set it up with 1 transmitter to multiple headphones, had to just daisy chain the audio cable to a second transmitter.Comment: Would be great to be able to remotely turn on the transmitter. I use the wireless headphones somewhat far from the transmitter. Would be great to be able to charge and store the headphones where I would be using them, rather than all the way back at the transmitter. It would be nice if the headphones could turn the transmitter on the way Xbox controllers turn the Xbox on.

VCouldn't be happier with 'em
p630
sg5
VI bought this wireless headphone system to use while watching TV late at night, so I won't wake my spouse who sleeps upstairs above the TV room.  I am very pleased in all respects.  The sound quality is excellent -- on par with expensive, cable-connected phones.  The digital system prevents the hiss often present in analog wireless.  I don't ask much, in the terms of "range";  I'm sitting but 10-15 ft from the base-station.  I can walk into other rooms on the same floor without drop-off, though if I go upstairs from the base station, I do encounter some occasional zones where reception drops off.  I can't say as how good the reception would be if I went outside to deck or yard -- an occurrence unlikely at the moment, since it's sub-zero outside where I live.  I haven't encountered any interference to the headphone system caused by other appliances (wireless telephones and WiFi) in my house.  Nor have I encountered any interference to the other appliances caused by the headphone system.  Your mileage may differ.The base-station cradle unit is relatively compact and hides behind my wide-screen LCD display, out of sight.  You have to be careful placing the headphones on the cradle, to insure the contacts engage for charging.  However, there's an amber LED that lights while the headphone set is charging, so it's obvious when contact has been made.The headphones are rather large and ugly, but not heavy or uncomfortable.  I can wear them for hours with no particular discomfort -- though in warmer weather, I might have a different opinion.  (It's winter, now, where I reside, so I don't yet know if I'll find them "sweaty" around the ears when worn in the heat/humidity of summer.)  The control buttons on the headphones take some getting used-to:  there are small buttons for (in this order, L to R):  volume up;  power on/off;  volume down; adjust volume balance towards the left channel;  and adjust volume balance towards the right channel.  The buttons are very small, close together;  and insufficiently raised above the background.  With practice, however, I've learned to use all of them without having to remove the headset.  They just take some getting used to.All things considered, I highly recommend them.  They're not inexpensive, but they work (for me) really well.

VPicked these up for an xmas present for myself after researching wireless headphones online. My partner can't stand hearing gun shots & zombie screams coming from the living room. Couldn't find them in Canada so purchased them in the US for $254. The suggested retail in Canada on the Sennheiser site is $499.I have used these headphones about 6 times for usually about 2 hours each time (normally playing Xbox 360). As I write this, I am using them to listen to music streamed off my PC sent through my PS3. They sound great!Reason for Buying:-They are replacing cheaper pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones from 4+ years ago that stopped working. I dont remember the actual model - but it looked the same as RS 126 & RS 136Things I have noticed compared to my old pair:-There is no static anymore (if I oriented my head in a particular direction with the old pair, I could get static)-There is no picking up other people's telephone calls yet(I live in an apartment)-They are very light & stay on my head easily (the old pair would fall off if I was doing work around the house like unloading the dishwasher)-The ear pads feel like a dream when you put them on - but I have noticed my ears will get a bit sore after 60 minutes because unlike the older pair, your ears fit inside the padding. It doesn't hurt enough to stop listing to them though.-No more tuning into the correct frequency - turn it on and it just works!-No more dials for the volume - which is great because it doesn't accidently get triggered when I am leaning back on the couch with my head against a cushion-The controls are hard to use without actually taking the headset off and looking at which buttons you are pressing. The volume up and down are aligned left and right of each other... but there is a power button in the middle - making it easy to turn off. To make it more complicated, these 3 buttons are all unique sizes and shapes from one another - and don't feel like arrows or anything relative to what their function is. This feels like a silly oversight from the design team!I would easily recommend these and would buy them again in a heartbeat!Hope this helps

VIncredible clarity for a wireless headphone
p642
sg5
VI've had these about a week and I think they're great.  My previous set of headphones was a wired set of Grado SR-60s, and these sound every bit as good to me - but wireless!  Indoor range seems to be about 60 feet through 5 or 6 walls.  I can essentially use them anywhere in my house and some outside as well.  Near the perimeter of the range you will get some cutting out, but step one foot closer and they're as clear as they are one foot from the base.  There is no static.I wear them for several hours a day and they're quite comfortable.  They have a soft velour pad that goes around your ear and more at the top of your head.  People who are bald or balding will probably find them pretty comfortable compared to unpadded bands.  They twist and adjust quite a bit to fit different size and shaped heads.The base is modern and nice looking.  I wish it were a little heavier because it's hard to turn the base on and off with one hand without pushing it over.  The headphones fit easily over the top for storage and charging.The batteries last about the rated 24 hours before requiring a recharge.  You do get about a half hour of warning that the batteries are getting close to being discharged.  They are just Ni-Cad AAA batteries so you should just be able to replace them with standard, inexpensive rechargeable AAAs when they eventually die.Build quality is excellent.  They feel like expensive headphones and look nice as well.  But they are expensive!  Cost is about four times what my Grados cost, and even a few times more than some of the less expensive Sennheiser models.  I was willing to pay the extra amount for an open headphone with superior sound quality and some extra range, but others might be just as happy with the cheaper SR 170 or SR 160 models given their circumstances.

VWorks fantastic - sound quality is wonderful - Compared to "TV Ears", this is heaven - I can't understand the reviews that complain about the inconvenience with volume adjustment and with establishing a connection between the ear phones and the transmitter - it is a no brainer. I bought this for my wife after her poor quality "TV Ears" crashed. She is definitely no techie. After a very easy setup of 10 minutes including unpacking, minor assembly and connecting to the TV, I spent five minutes with her explaining the only three things that she needed to know and she was off and running, grinning all of the way - She loves it so I love it. I have used it rarely and agree that it is great. I especially like being able to get up and do something somewhere else in our 1,850 sq. ft. house and not miss a thing.- If you can't stand to read instructions then you might not like this but even then you can talk to Sennheiser and they'll politely walk you through any problems with the set up. My first delivery was Dead On Arrival due to poor packaging by the shipper. The Sennheiser packaging is excellent. I read and reread the manual trying to figure out what was wrong with my setup of the first shipment. Finally I called Sennheiser. They walked me through a very simple three step test that took thirty seconds and said "Return it to Amazon, it has been damaged in shipment". After calling Amazon and telling them what Sennheiser said, I had a new set in three days and my wife was smiling.

VApple Macs and Sennheiser RS 180's
p666
sg5
VI just received the RS 180\u2019s to listen to music, internet radio, or any computer audio as I moved around the house. My former solution was to use strategically placed portable speakers attached to Apple AirPort Expresses sending the music via iTunes or other audio via Rogue Amoeba\u2019s Airfoil Software.That has worked getting the sound to various locations, but of course the sound quality was marginal, and the stereo effect was missing.The Sennheiser RS 180\u2019s have given me the ability to listen to high quality sound in full stereo, with unfettered movement.When setting up the 180\u2019s the first \u201cproblem\u201d I faced was that plugging the 180 transmitter into the headphone jack in the Mac killed the sound from the internal Mac speakers. It also meant the transmitter had to be located close to the Mac at one end of my house, preventing reliable reception at the other end of the house.That \u201cproblem\u201d was overcome by plugging the RS 180 transmitter into an AirPort Express centrally located in the house. Now with iTunes I can send the sound to both the computer and the AirPort Express at the same time. Additionally if I want to send any other audio from the Mac to the RS 180 headphones I can use Rogue Amoeba\u2019s AirFoil software. This gives me the ability to move anywhere in the house, or even limited distances outside the house, and listen to high quality sound.The Seenheiser RS 180\u2019s are a great product offering great portable sound. Highly recommended.

VHaving paid a premium price for the RS 180 Im very disappointed in the quality of the product.  The first problem I experienced was that the fully charged head set would not sync to the base unless I unplug the base and restart it.  This has to happen every time I want to enjoy the sound.  The sound, when working both channels is excellent.  The secondary problem I am experiencing is with the Left and Right Channel.  Sometimes it works and most times the Left Channel just goes out and I cannot get it back unless I disconnect the power and reset the whole system.  Anyone else experiencing this?  I have an email in to the company for help.  I want to keep these Head Phones but at this price Im very disappointed.

VThere are already many reviews and little else needs to be said; however, I will add just a bit.  First off, these headphones work, meaning clear transmitted audio signal only, with no static, or other external noise and way superior, in this regard, to my old wireless Sony headphones which were not an inexpensive purchase.  I have been diagnosed as "Profoundly Deaf," \u2026 I actually think that this is  a bit of an over statement/evaluation,  but I have to say that with these headsets, I can now understand what is being said notably better than with the old Sony(analog) earphones.  Of course, so much depends on the frequency of the voice and the speed of the speakers voice.  Network news comprehension is now 95% and on an average, most movies on t.v. are around 80%  -- both instances without hearing aids as feedback is generated with their use.Pricey, yes but I would buy them again and by the way, I receive steady audio signal all throughout my 2400sq.ft. home and yard; also, I will be darned if I see an issue with an echo -- yes, I have the Yamaha amplifier/receiver(RX-V871) with a full set of speakers on at the same time.  With the Sony headphones, this was a big issue!One other thing, I second the suggestion by another reviewer to simply place a drop adhesive like a rubber cement on the surface of the middle button, between the  two volume control buttons to give the feel of their position.

p690
sg5
VReceived these in two days as promised. The good.... Sound is great, snug comfortable fit they won't fall off when you're doing other things. The bad.... as others have mentioned the buttons on the headphones are insane. I put a little piece of peel and stick velcro (loop side) on the off/on button so my fingers could easily find the volume controls. If I didn't I don't think these would be useable. Even at that I have small hands and fingers, someone with larger hands might have even more of a problem.  Also my hat size is 6 3/4, they are very snug, might be too snug for a larger person.  The range doesn't seem to fit the description, my workroom is about 30 feet from the transmitter and they won't pick up the signal in there. There is nothing that should be blocking the signal so I don't get that at all. I'm not to happy that I have to turn them on at the base unit, a extra step that seems unnecessary, small annoyance. But all in all I am happy with them but I think they are over priced due to the little problems they have. At least they don't make that annoying popping noise my Sony TMR-RF970R made. Although I did like Sony's design with the headband, instant off when you removed them. The Sony set died after using them for a little over a year. Prior to that pair I had always bought Sennheiser and was happy with them.  I've only had this pair now for a few days so will see how they preform over time.

VI have been using my Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone System for five weeks now.  It is by far the best performing wireless headset I've ever used.  I went through three previous brands.  Two of them were such a pain to use I threw them in the trash.  Literally!  The third one stopped working after about 6 months of use.  The Sennheiser RS 180 is a solid performing unit thus far.  It charges simply and easily.  It links up between headset and transmitter base in a instant.  No tuning required as with the analog types.  The sound is excellent in my book.  The highs are crisp, the mid-range/speech areas are clear and the bass sounds are very solid but not booming.  The surround sounds are incredible.  It makes watching movies with outstanding sound tracks a real treat.  I have only two issues with this headset.  The range of operation is not what I thought it should be.  The sound starts breaking up at about 25 feet but because I am sitting maybe 10 feet from my big screen 99% of the time this is not a big deal.  The thing I dislike most is the volume up/on-off/volume down button set on the underside of the right ear piece.  It's difficult to feel them at times.  I often turn the unit off while trying to adjust the volume down.  However this is a quality headset.  It is worth it's high price tag in my opinion.  Everything concidered I would recommend this headset highly to anyone!

VI own Parrot Ziks, Shure SRH840s, Sony Monitors (the >$100 ones), Bose top-of-the-line, and several more sets.  Nothing beats the Sony Monitors for incredible sound (I've returned cans that are hundreds more).  However, full cans get hot and keep you tied down.  Bluetooth is great sometimes and when it's best, the skips, etc, are about equal to how many times I knock my earbuds out or they fall out.  In home, however, nothing touches these RS180s for comfort (soft, open ear design means not hot), clarity (couldn't get them to skip if I wanted to), and performance (fantastic!!!).  I change my EQ settings on iTunes depending on which headphones I'm wearing.  Easy, I just do whatever sounds best in two minutes of dinking with settings.  You don't need to do that, but if you've read this far, you probably do that anyway (iTunes->Windows->Equalizer-> fiddle around).  I took these two hundred feet away and behind concrete walls with wires and pipes.  No problem.  I have the transmitter parked next to radios, cordless phones, my super duty D-Link router, and I run two network extenders on the property.  Not a blip.  No interference between any of the electronics (guessing because it runs old school signal?), no drop in any kind of wireless performance for any equipment when these are on.  Bottom line:  PHENOMENAL.  Well, well worth the money.  You will be ear to ear grinning.

VOver the years I have used many fine head phones, including all the top names and professional studio phones. The Sennheiser RS 180 is close to, if not level with the very best in terms of sound reproduction in every sense. Some reviews have talked about an echo when the Television was not muted, as when another person in the room was watching without the use of phones. I can attest to very thorough testing at various sound levels without any evidence of an echo. This is an extremely important point because some of the reviews claiming an echo almost convinced me to cancel my order. I am very glad that I did not cancel. Using these phones is like the difference between sitting in a state-of-the are theater with advanced acoustics and sound reproduction equipment vs. watching the same movie at home on an HD-TV with just the speakers in the television. WOW! What a difference. I was blown away. I am amazed at some of the nuances that I was never able to hear through the TV. And that is with the volume of the phones at a very nominal level. If you can afford these phone don't hesitate. You too will be amazed. Oh. . .  I have no connection whatsoever with Sennheiser, their distributors or anyone else connected with this company. I am simply a consumer with a very well trained and discerning ear who happens to be very impressed with a fine product..

VSound quality is the expected from Sennheiser.  Very minimum interference or static, almost never and barly noticable when it occurs.  Volume is definitely adequate too, I usually float towards the bottom end of the volume spectrum with these headphones, something uncommon for me (I have some hearing loss in one ear).Range is a bit less than I expected but I am using them indoors in a large house with block walls, so upstairs on the opposite side of the house, they loose reception consistently.  However, for regular range (TV-kitchen, etc.) they work flawlessly.My 3 year old son twisted one of the ear pieces till it broke and popped out (a little) to where I cant set it back.  However, the unit still functions perfectly.  It only resulted in an aesthetic detail.  Rugged.I may not be a power user but they have only discharged on me once, and that was because they had been misplaced on the charger the previous two nights and didn't recharge.Pretty comfortable, sometimes after an hour or two, my ears get a little sensitive, the cups could be a tad bigger as to avoid ear rub.  They get a little hot too (I am in tropical climates), even in air conditioned environments.  This would be a plus in a colder climate (I imagine).Charging station is nice, maybe a little tipsy.

VThese headphones sound great and are almost as good as the wired Sennheiser HD 598. Setup was a breeze. All you do is plug the receiver in to your system, press the power button on the receiver, and then press power button on the headphones. If you're using them with a portable music player like an iPod you need to flip the switch on the back to 0 db, and if you're using them with an AV receiver you need to flip the switch to -8db. They sound great with both movies and music which is what I use them for the most. Make sure that you don't turn the volume up too high on your source. I had turned my AV receiver up too high and the sound was distorted on the movie I was watching. This might be not be the same for all systems, but my Onkyo AV receiver volume goes up to 80, and I put it between 30 and 35. when using the headphones. The buttons on the headphones take some getting used to. The good news is that the power button, which is in between the volume buttons, has a slightly raised logo, so you can feel where you are when trying to turn the volume up or down. There's also a gap between the volume down and balance buttons. It takes some practice to get used to the button placement, and Sennheiser could have done a better job on that front. Other than that I'm very satisfied with these headphones.

VWorks very well.  Sound quality is quite good and with the open cans I can still hear what's going on around me.  If somebody walks into the room I hear them coming.  Range is about half of my DECT 6.0 cordless phones, which is more then adequate.  I can go anywhere in my house, to the end of my driveway and a little way down the street before they begin to cut out. They come with eneloop batteries, which is a great little feature.  Eneloop's are probably the best rechargeable battery on the market today.  Sennheiser didn't have to include this good of a battery but they did, which impresses me.I have a huge head and these are still comfortable on their largest setting.The only thing I don't like about these headphones is that you have to turn on the base and turn on the headphones each time you want to use them.  It's not a big thing but just a minor annoyance.  On the other hand, this way if they get bumped off the charger they won't drain since they're still turned off.  But they could have had the base turn itself on when the headphones are removed.  Sometimes I grab the headphones and sit down, then have to get back up and turn the base on.When you're done using them you just drop them on the charger and they turn themselves off, which is pretty neat,

p731

VThis review will not provide sufficient information to people who can hear with both ears.  I have been deaf in my left ear since I was five years old, and thus cannot speak to any issue that regards both ears simultaneously.  That having been said, these phones are just wonderful.  I simply funnel the sound for both ears into my right ear, and the sound is, well, just luscious.  (I have checked both sides of the earphones by reversing them, and the sound is equally good from either ear-piece.) I connect the headphone transmitter to the headphone jack on my receiver (which provides the the sound for all my audio and video systems) and it in turn outputs flawless digital signals to my Sennheiser 180 Digital Wireless Headphones.  I am a musician, and have excellent hearing in my right ear, and I can tell you that what I hear with my right ear is as good as I could imagine from any electronic source.  There is a sense of auditory space in the sound coming into my right ear.  The illusion is that of hearing a a really good natural sound from up close.  And I can walk around anywhere in the house with these headphones on and they sound just the same as if I were sitting in the room with my sound system.  In short, this Sennheiser system is as good as I could imagine.  I am completely satisfied.

VThese are simply the best full-sized wireless headphones that I have heard.  They have very reasonable range and auto-volume adjust.  NO extraneous noise.  If these were stolen, I'd buy 'em again.  The only con could be that, although the ear pads are very cushioned, my ears are a bit larger than the inside of the phone pad.

VAfter very much research, I settled on this Digital Wireless Headphone.  The best surprise, is no surprise at all. They work as advertised right out of the box.Set up was simple, except, I had to print out the instructions in order to refer to them in the room that the TV was in. They are connected to a Sharp 32 inch LED HD TV.  The individual volume setting for each ear was a must for me as I have 40% hearing loss in left ear. Finally, I can hear everything as it was intended, crisp, clear, deep base, and high tones without the volume turned up high enough to disturb my wife. I had forgotten what I was missing. They make me want to go back and view movies again just to hear the total soundtrack! I had no idea that footsteps and door hinge sound was part of what I was missing.I can walk all over my home and not lose connection, except going in the basement, some locations down there will cause them to disconnect, and reacquire.Recharging is simple, just hang them on the transmitter as shown.. So far, the most I have used them for is three hours. No problem. I have to assume that they will continue to work past that.

p749

VI purchased my first set of these about four years ago and just purchased this second set as an add-on. Both headsets work perfectly, even four years into heavy use. I use these for blasting my movies when my wife wants silence. I purchased the second set so my wife and I can both enjoy late night movies and not wake our roommates, who's headboard wall is shared with my home theater speakers.One feature I really enjoy is that they breath. I have a pair of Bose QC2 headphones and had a pair of Beats Studio Wireless headphones as well, both sets have great sound and great noise canceling but part of noise canceling is sealing up the cups. These Sennheiser 180s breath nicely so you can wear them for hours on end without your ears getting all sweaty. Also this means that you can talk to someone right next to you without shouting at them.  I chose to purchase a whole second set with the receiver instead of a stand-alone set of headphones (no base) because i like both headphones to be constantly recharged to their fullest. I have both sets synced to one base unit, the second only serves as a recharging station.Overall I love them.

VMy wife is in school.  She has to study evenings and weekends.  I like to watch movies, and have a surround sound system we enjoy very much.  But, I obviously can't play it if she has school work.  Headphones are the obvious solution, and I have a set of basic corded Sennheisers.  I've been happy with them....But then I read about these.  I found a deal on Amazon and I went for it.  Man I am so glad I did.  Now I get to enjoy high end surround sound without disturbing my wife.  She says this is one of the best investments I have made for her sake.  What stereo component can boast that endorsement!?Basically these headphones make it seem like your surround sound is contained within them.  The dialogue, the effects, the left to right, front to back is all there.  They are really comfortable, simple to hook up, and the charge lasts as long as I need it.  I love that the storage place is also the charger.  The reception is perfect throughout the house.It seems to me like Sennheiser set out the make a top notch product here, and acheived this goal.  I've had them for a few months now.  These are excellent headphones.

VGreat set of headphones. Sound is very clear and I am loving the open design. While I understand the need for noise cancellation and closed headphones, these headphones are staying at home/work. I'll need to hear things happening around me.Headphones are pretty comfortable. I wear glasses and have been avoiding headphones because they press my glass frames to the side of my head. So I'd stick to earphones and wireless earphones. I decided to buy these headphones based on the reviews claiming the great comfort and they aren't wrong. However when I wore these headphones with contacts in, I didn't realize these headphones can get even comfier.One star off due to how bad walls can interfere with the receiver and headset. When I go to the kitchen to cook (kitchen isn't closed off from where the receiver is), there are times when they stop producing sounds for a second. This can happen pretty frequently if there is a wall in between the receiver and headset. I read that this isn't an issue with the RS 170's, so I'm wondering why the RS 180's can't be the same. The only complaint I have about these headphones.

VI Got this RS-180 around Thanksgiving in November of 2010. I was very lucky to have gotten this at a great price from Amazon (about a hundred dollars less than the $329 it is going for now).The RS-180 arrived on time and in new condition.I have used a Sennheiser RS-65 wireless headphone since 2002. The RS-65 was a pretty good wireless set.  Battery life was great, the original batteries are still going strong. the Sound I thought was great.But boy when I turn on the new RS-180 and play some of my concert DVD's, and this is just from a DVD player to my Sony HDTV via HDMI cables, the RS-180 put my RS-65 to shame.  The RS-180 sound is really clear, the base tight, there is no static at all, none what so ever. Wow! And it never drops out like the RS-65 does once in a while!The quality of the RS-180 is pretty good. It only squeaks a little on the right side of the headset when I put them on, but after I have got them set, it does not squeak anymore.  So, I decided to keep it as is!I like the RS-180 so much that I think I will get a second headset, the HDR-180.

VI had some reservations on these after reading some of the reviews saying that they are small or snug, because I have a ginormous head.  My hat size is about 8 1/8, and I'm 6'8 so I'm just a large person in general.  So imagine my surprise when they arrive working as advertised and even very comfortably fitting my head.  The top band that holds the two cups together actually seems to flex quite a bit as I wear them, making for a much more comfortable fit after I'd worn them for a couple of days than when they were first out of the box.  All the parts that touch your head are soft and velvety.  After breaking them in for a couple of days, they fit my head like a large comfortable head glove.  I've worn them already for hours on end with very little ear fatigue.My house is kind of small, but it's on two levels and there is nowhere I go in my house that I don't receive a clear signal.  Sound is very good and bass response is quite acceptable for this type of open headphone.  Whenever I've detected minor static or distortion, it has always ended up being in the source not in the headphones (I need to get some higher bitrate MP3s).  The only minor negatives I've noted is that there is a brief <1 second drop in the signal about every hour or so, the fact that you have to get up and push a button on the transmitter to turn it on (I am not too lazy to manage that), and the button placement.  Buttons are functional and with some practice I should be able to distinguish what's what without looking.  Protip from the manual:  If you accidentally hit one of the balance buttons, you can hold down both balance buttons at the same time to reset.  Oh, and one other potential drawback:  they make the wearer look like a total dork.  But it's totally worth it.

VGreat headphones! The description on these headphones is absolutely true, at least for us. Have had about a month and they have really improved our listening pleasure, especially with low volume movies. Was really irritating trying to listen to movies that have the dialog mostly drowned out by the stupid music tracks. Now we can actually hear what the actors are saying! Its great. And its amazing how much fine detail they pick up from the background. My husband wears hearing aids and was really bothered by the dialog volume on most movies and other shows. Now he is amazed at what he hadn't heard before in some of our old movies. Normal program viewing/listening is also improved. Even sports program viewing is improved. If you wear hearing aids and still have trouble hearing your programs, these headphones are for you. Set up was a little confusing for two non-techies but we figured it out. They charged really quickly and were up and running in no time. They fit well and we haven't been bothered with them being too hot over the ears.

VI am not an expert on headphones but I can only tell you my experience with the RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphones. When I was searching for the headphones, my requirements were long charge life: I used the RS 180 viewing movies and listening to music for more than 12 hours and no sign of power loss or sound quality but now and then you hear a break in the sound for just a half a second; not an issue. The headphones had to have a strong signal distance: I used the headphones in my three stories home and on every floor level I had a clear signal from the headphones. I even tested the distance by walking to my mail box about 150ft from the front door and the signal started breaking up about 120ft at a half a charge. But, if you live near lot of microwave towers you will get a lot of interference. I know this because when I\u2019m in the kitchen and the microwave is turned on, the headphone signal breaks up. I had the headphones for about 3 months now and had no issues with them. I\u2019m thinking about purchasing a second pair for down stars.

VBought these for my husband to replace an older set of Sennheisers.  Debated between the RS 170's and the 180's as I was concerned about sound leakage.  He uses them to watch TV and movies while my the rest of the household is sleeping.  We didn't want him waking us but some sound leakage would be fine.The leakage is minimal, in fact, unless he has the sound completely cranked we don't hear anything even standing beside him.  The quality of sound is fantastic and I am glad I went with this open system in the end.  So much better than the closed system.The set up was extremely simple and the quality of sound these headphones produce is excellent.  For the price, I don't think there is a better wireless headphone on the market.  If your priority is the distance you can use these headphones, I might be concerned.  Ours cuts out on the far side of our condo, which isn't that far, however we live in an a very dense urban environment with countless wi-fi networks about so it is likely an issue with interference.

p803
sg5
VI'm a bit of an audiophile, and I found these headphones to have terrific sound quality and an amazing bass response. About the only time I notice any audio lag whatsoever is when playing music based video games like Guitar Hero. The delay is so small you don't notice it watching TV, but the timing required with video games like those mentioned, it can be just barely enough to throw you off.I do get some background noise when the headphones are turned up to max. I personally never do this (my family sometimes does though... and I have to fix it) I turn the headphones down to where the noise is dialed out, then I turn the source up as needed to get nice clean audio.Button placement is a bit odd. The volume buttons aren't quite where I'd expect to find them. If I reach my hand up blindly, I should be able to feel which ones are the volume buttons. The ones that feel like volume buttons instead adjust the left/right panning.Regardless, I love these headphones and would definitely purchase again.

VBefore I bought this Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone, I had used Beats by Dr Dre for two years. I listen to lots of heavy metal, thrash metal and hard rock music. I have been addicted to the strong bass that Beats provides for the music that I listen to. Before I bought this headpohne, I was a little worried that RS 180 would not have enough bass based on some reviews that I read. After I received it and used it, I am no longer worried at all. Sennheiser RS 180 provides adequate and very natural bass. In fact, not only the bass, all frequencies are extremely precise and extremely clear. The soundstage is spectacular. I am very impressed by the technology employed in this headphone. Plus, this headphone is more comfortable to wear than Beats, largely due to the velour earcups it uses. I had a JVC wireless headphone many years ago. It had so much hiss sound which made it unbearable. Apparently, much improved wireless technology has been used by Sennheiser RS 180. Great work for Sennheiser.

VI have used the Sennheiser RS-130 for the past 4 years, and the surround sound was incredible and delicious, but I was looking for an upgrade, the next generation from a high quality manufacturer. My main uses are for blu-ray movies and late night TV viewing as to not disturb any neighbors, plus it's an intimate experience without any street noise. When I decided on the RS-180 I bought it from J & R because their customer service is outstanding. The DVD product guide estimated an initial charge of up to 16 hours, but mine was ready for blastoff in about 7. I was immediately blown away, swept into a cinematic oasis, a sound panorama that disintegrated any assumptions about how a movie should leave a lasting impression! They are exceptionally comfortable and well worth the price, and you will not be disappointed!!! Without a sound system hooked up to my Samsung 1920 X 1080 HD-LCD TV, I realize now I haven't totally appreciated the blu-ray player and movies until this wireless headphone purchase. Thanks to Kleer's uncompressed audio transmission technology another journey began via listening to some of my favorite blu-rays like Oliver Stones "The Doors". WOW!!! The bass sounds are outstanding and precise. You will venture forth into a new world of audio pleasure. If the Sennheiser RS-180 was a painting it would be a masterpiece by Kandinsky or Dali; a sculpture, La Pieta via Michelangelo, a song, something by Lennon & McCartney. Remember this: escape is not a luxury, it is a necessity if you want to get an advanced degree in sound and mind travel. Now get out and buy these phones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

VBeing the owner of a sound studio, I own a couple dozen headsets. Each have their place when listening to a mix. One use is for the high end audiophile who appreciates engineering that helps filter obnoxious sounds. This headphone and receiver do just that. No schrilling highs (unless you really want to crank them up with an EQ) while the bass response is more than adequate... in fact that's one I, as a sound engineer, EQ'd down so I could hear something closer to what less fortunate listeners would hear and mix accordingly. But for watching movies and listening to music that's long ago mixed and produced, these are up at the top of my list. And they're as comfortable... pardon me, I had to think about that one... they're *more* comfortable than any other headphone I've worn. The digital transmission/reception is ultra smooth. If I'd only had a pair earlier in life. Now I have three pair and a transmitter. Extraordinarily packaged; Delivered on time; Smooth transaction. "Thankaya boys".

VOk. I admit it...my hearing is going. If I didn't already know it, my condo neighbor made it perfectly clear by banging on our common wall every time I turned on the TV. Admittedly, I kept turning up the volume but I still couldn't discern the dialogue above the background noise--instead, it all became a distorted mess.I had been reduced to reading close captions, and I was not a happy camper ...  So I did my research, purchased the RS180, allowed my inner-geek to overcome my technical challenges, and installed it all by myself.WOW!! Chrystal clear dialogue and beautiful background music--where it should be...in the background.I am enjoying a whole new television experience...far surpassing any, even pre-hearing loss.Instead of being ticked at my neighbor for the threatening notes he left on my door, I thought about leaving him a thank you note on his.  Well, it was just a passing thought. I would hate to give him credit for my awesome rS180.

VRS 180 Headphone System Review
p832
sg5
VAs a person who has hearing loss as a result of military action, this product is an excellent solution to being able to hear and understand even the soft spoken words in TV programs and movies.  The sound quality is excellent and I can continue to listen to the program on TV from anywhere in the house and outside.  Now I can walk away from the TV and not miss a thing.  The "open style" headphone allows you to hear everything that is going on in and around you while listening to the TV.  You're not isolated from the rest of the world when you're using them.  Other reviews mentioned an echo when the TV sound is on.  If the TV sound is high when you are using the headphones, you may hear a slight sound delay through the headphones. However, when other people have the TV sound set where they are comfortable, I only hear the headphone sound and do not hear any echo.  I am very satisfied with the headphones!  They have significantly added to my TV listening pleasure.

VGood headphones, frustrating control system
p838
sg5
VThe good: these headphones sound good, are of quality workmanship, and fit comfortably.The bad: the control system will make you want to cry. I use these headphones at the office so that I can listen to music while working. The problem is that every time I leave my desk to attend a meeting or get something from the printer, my impulse is to put the headphones back on the transmitter base/charger to ensure that the batteries stay charged. This powers down the headphones, which is ok. What's not ok is that it also powers off the base transmitter and breaks the pairing between transmitter and headphones. This means that when I come back, I not only have to turn on the headphones I also have to turn on the transmitter and wait for the pairing process to complete before I get any audio. This is ridiculous. The headphones obviously transmit commands back to the transmitter for the pairing to take place so why doesn't the transmitter turn on when I turn the headphones on? Why don't the headphones and transmitter stay paired until I say otherwise? I feel especially bad for people who use these headphones at home where the transmitter is across the room from the listening location. Let's take this one step farther and ask why taking the headphones off the charger doesn't automatically turn the system on so that the phones are working by the time they're on your head? All I wanted is the functionality of wired headphones without the problems of getting tangled up in or damaging the cord and this headphone system falls short.

Well, even though I was expecting a good overall experience with the product, my expectations were more than satisfied. The wireless headphone system has excelent sound and reception. They are very confortable; you almost forget you are wearing them. Installation was very simple to do. The one caracteristic that was accurate in my experience when using them was regarding the control botttoms in the headset. They are difficult to feel and distinguish; really small inconvenience considering the remarkable performance of the product. I guess with practice this can be overcome, with no much frustration.Excelent Product.

VI bought a pair of these for my parents who are in their 70's.  They were having television volume wars at their house, my stepdad in particular is having hearing trouble and really blares his t.v.  I have not tried them myself, but my parents really like them and there is now peace at their house.  They are wireless, they both say they are comfortable to wear (they both wear glasses, and it is not an issue), neither one of them seem to have any problem with the controls and I know my stepdad can actually go out into the garage wearing his and still hear the television, so the range is very good.  I do not know how they are for music but for television and our particular need for them they have been wonderful.  It has been about 6 months now and they are both still very happy and I have not had to listen to my mom complain about how deaf her husband is and how she cannot hear her television shows..........

VI'm using these now for about 1.5 years and I absolutely LOVE them. The have good sound. I purchased other expensive headphones and in comparison I don't have anything to complain about sound wise. With a couple walls in-between they range about 30feet before you get dropouts. I charge them after each use but sometimes I forget but never had a problem using then for over 20 hours without recharging. Nice to have a product that simply works and that I don't have to worry about.I also owned the cheaper versions of these (RS 110) and wasn't as happy with them since they produces a hissing sound when you get out of reach. No problem with these: They just mute which is way more comfortable for your ears.Some people complained about the controls but I must say you simply get used to them. You memorize where each button is positioned after a while and then it's no problem anymore.

I thought after using it for a month I would overcome the the near non-existant change from one button to another.  I havn't.  I pretty much have the volume increase button down pat.  The mute and volume down I still have to remove the headset - look - then choose and push.I would be so happy if they had moved just the mute button to the left side.  I never use the balance buttons.Bottom line I like them but they are not 5 star quality because of the ergonomics.

VGot these for 83 Year old Grandmother- Perfect!
p868
sg5
VWe bought this for my 83 year old Grandmother who has terrible hearing loss. We got a cheaper option at Best Buy but it didn't work very well and wasn't easy for her to learn how to use.THESE ARE SO MUCH BETTER. They allow her to keep her hearing aids in and allow her to hear what's going on around her as well. She loves them so much and she never watches TV without them.They are simple for her to use! All she has to do is take them off the dock and put them back on when she's done and they will charge. She figured out the volume right away. She never misses a word they say on television anymore and she never misses a chance to watch a Brewers game. As her mobility declines, her mind is kept going.Two of her elderly friends now have them because they saw how great they were.Range is great, she can walk all over the house and still be connected.

VSeinheiser Wireless 180 Digital Headphones
p874
sg5
VI have had two previous sets of Seinheiser wireless head phones.  These are by far the best I have ever owned.  All previous phones have had a tendency to catch the volume control when I was lying down and either take the volume up or down.  The controls on this headset are recessed so no such problem.  Comfort is outstanding. If you are going to wear them for a couple of hours this is very important. I walk from one end of house to other and not miss a beat on the quality of sound. When you look at these you know you are looking at quality.  The  only downside is the price.  If you want the best then you are going to pay for it.  The controls are small and recessed but his helps prevent accidentally activating them when lying down or moving around.  These are as good as it gets.Today I have ordered a second one of these head sets for a different location. They remain as good as it gets.

VVery happy with RS 180
p880
sg5
VI agree with the previous posts that say these are great sounding and comfortable.  My wife was shocked by the price I paid, but I assured her they are worth it.  No hiss or buzzing, dialog is very clear, and I am very pleased with the bass.  I like the open sound, although my wife is a bit bothered when she hears the crashes, booms and screams from the movies I'm watching.  Oh, and by the way, I use them primarily for movies streaming over Wi-Fi (Netflix) and I have had no issues with interference between the headphone wireless and Wi-Fi.The headphones were very easy to set up.  Granted, it is a minor hassle having to turn the base and headphones on separately, but at least turning off the headphones is sufficient since the base will then turn itself off automatically in 5 minutes.Overall, I am quite happy with the Sennheiser RS 180.

VSennheiser RS 180 Headphones for hearing impaired.
p886
sg5
VThe Sennheiser RS 180 Headphones have restored my ability to hear Television and Music with all of the Bass, Treble, Voice, and Stereo sounds that I have been missing for many years. I have an 80% hearing loss, and have been looking for something that would allow me to hear well without disturbing others. The Sennheiser RS 180 Headphones exceeded all of my requirements. There is ample room for over the ear hearing aids in the muffs if you need additional sound clarification and tweaking, but the sound quality is so great you don't really need them. The ONLY thing they need is a remote, as the control buttons are too close together making adjustments difficult while on your head. They are very comfortable and can be worn for extended lengths of time. Being able to hear so well again, makes the Sennheiser RS 180 Headphones well worth their cost.

VBig Sound for Small Space
p892
sg5
VI'm not a very technical person so this is a basic user review. For background we live in an apartment and leave the TV volume pretty low to not disturb neighbors. We relied on closed captioning for almost everything. We constantly increased or lowered the volume based on the show's background noise (gunshots, sirens, music). So we started the search for wireless headphones that would allow us to clearly hear the tv and have as close to surround sound as possible in an apartment. First bought 2 Sony digital wireless headphones but only one would pair up and the other was useless. After researching these and seeing you could pair up to 4 headsets to one transmitter base we were sold. It works beautifully. We can use 2 headsets with no trouble and can add more later if needed. They are comfortable and the sound is amazing! I highly recommend.

VThe BEST wireless headphone in the market!!
p898
sg5
VOk guys i will go straight to the point. This is not a headphone for those that desire good bass impact as in my opinion, the bass is a little lacking on the rs180 but well it is a little expected for a open backed headphone. IF you want more bass, go with the rs170.. do not waste time on these. However, if you desire a real good soundstage and good highs and mids are enough, than this is the way to go.  Pros: - Long range of up to 100m seriously  - definitely comfortable [it is warm and it feels great]  - Good battery life [ more realistic is what i should say. it can last up to 6 - 7 hrs continiously]  - GREAT Quality  Cons:  - You can say the lack of bass  - the sound leakage?[ but that is to be expected when buying an open backed headphone]Real great product. i will recommend it to my friends.

VToo Many Negatives
p904
sg5
VLove 'um... BUTThe BAD:1. If you use them with the speakers on at the same time, there is a slight delay in the headset, causing it to seem like an echo.2. Long term use isn't as comfortable as the older style ear-cups on the 120, 130 models... ouchie... achey ears.3. Must turn transmitter ON every time you want to use them.4. If you decide to turn them off for a while, you will have to get up out of your comfy chair, and go over to the transmitter unit to turn it back on again... bummer.5. Controls, even after memorizing their location and position, are very inconvenient, and awkward to use... difficult to tell which button is which by feel.6. Balance? Really? I have no idea why you would want balance on headphones. It did not bother me that they had it; I figured it would be something I just wouldn't use... no biggie. But when you accidentally touch it, feeling your way around the controls, balance gets messed up, and you have to re-balance... Annoying feature.The Good:1. Sound is crisp and clear... very clean sounding. And the clear speech thingy actually works; that's cool too.2. Except for the ear cups being too small and pinching the ear between the cup and your head, the rest of the shape and mold is quite comfortable; still doesn't make up for ear pain though.

VWorks pretty much as advertised.  I haven't listened to anything that would test the sound quality tremendously, but what I have listened to is fine.  Maybe a little light on bass effects in movies, but OK for music.  I haven't worn them for more than 90 minutes at a stretch, but they are comfortable for that amount of time (and that's not the case all the time for me with other headphones).My biggest complaint is that I need to turn the volume up on my source quite loud, so if I forget to adjust it before unplugging, it's extremely loud unplugged.  They also make my head a tad warm, but I honestly think that's to be expected.Bottom line, I'm able to listen to the TV later at night as loud as I want without disturbing the rest of the family.  That's what I wanted to do with this purchase, so mission accomplished.

VYES! These turned out to be perfect.In my household, 2 people work from home.So that means sometimes during the day when someone is watching TV, someone else may be conducting business on the phone or just needing quiet time to think without having to listen to a TV blaring in the background.So we needed some high quality cordless head phones.I had some cordless headphones years ago... but they were just "eh" and the sound quality was only so- so.So I had reservations about going the cordless route again.And then there was the price...These are kind of expensive and I wasn't sure I wanted to invest in them that much money.Well, all I can say is I am glad I decides to get them.They solved the issue of background TV noise disturbing people working from home in the best way possible. .I must say they are a fantastic product!The sound quality is AWESOME.  They are comfortable to wear for hours even.And they were easy as pie to hitch up.All I just had to do was to plug them into my TV's headphone jack. (I have a Samsung 46" ) and I was in business.Un-boxing, skimming the directions and setting up to use took less than 5 minutes.I highly recommend them. Thank you. Todd G.

VI bought these to use with Skype so I could move around or lay down on group calls and studies I participate in. I had tried a cheaper pair that I returned because they wouldn't connect. Anyway, these sound so good, I also use them with my TV watching movies late at night, watching you tube videos online, and my Amazon Prime instant videos both on my computer and TV (I hook them up to my Sony Blue Ray that streams video too).. I find myself wearing them even when it isn't late at night because they sound way better than the sound from my TV and computer speakers and they are actually really comfortable to wear. They were expensive but I use them for so much now that they were worth the money I spent, for sure. And they are so easy to store and charge on the base- they are always ready to use.

VThis product works! I unpacked it, set it up, plugged it into my DVR box and it works beautifully. The audio coming through the headphones is great. I hear things that I have been missing for years unless I turned the TV volume up to where it disturbed my wife. Even when a character in a show is talking softly I can hear them. I was concerned about there being no tone control. I find that it is not needed. The ALC does a great job. Also, when someone speaks to me I still can hear them. Going into another room does not affect the audio reception. It is worth the price. I tried a cheaper version and different brand of these type of product and this Sennheiser product beats it hands down.

VFeel like I am a victim of false advertising.  The product specifications state the headphones transmit for 100 meters, 300 feet.  And naturally I knew not to expect that but maybe 100 feet of distance.  Well either the pair I bought don't work properly or this is plain deceptive marketing because these headphones don't work within my apartment.  I get constant sound drop-outs at a distance of less than 20 ft passing through two thin sheetrock walls.  These headphones are a big improvement over the worthless Sony wireless headphones I had been using previously but definitely fall short of expectations.  Hard to justify $300 wireless headphones that only work in the living room.

VThis is the best looking headphones in the whole Sennheiser RS and new RS RF family, which is the first priority for me to buy them.You might laugh at me about my criteria of choosing, but when you are buying products from Sennheiser, sound quality would not be the issue, since they are all guaranteed above average.Besides looking, the headphones weigh light, are extremely comfortable on my head, and have very balanced sound signature.I was hesitating to buy them when they were 200 dollars, only to miss the opportunity. However, when they appeared again on Amazon for 200 dollars, I bought them with strong determination.Love them so much.

p945
sg5
VThese headphones provide great sound quality (to be expected from Sennheiser), and very easy to set-up. I red some comments before I bought them that they are difficult to pair - I didn't find that at all. In fact, as soon as powerd up the transmitter and put the batteries in, they came right on! The range is excellent too - works everywhere in my 1,300 sf appartment and in the hallway too (when I go to take garbage out for instance).What I do agree with is that the control buttons are pain to use. You are destined to hit the off/mute button by accidend instead of volume up or down, because it sits right in between them two, and balance adjustment - forget it - will never hit the right one - but you don't really need to use it that often. Another flaw - ALC button (to boost speech range)is located on transmitter only, so you have to walk to it to turn it on if you have a hard time hearing dialogs in movies. This is why I gave it 3 out of 5 for ease of use. But everything else - solid 5s all around.

VI have a friend that has an older set (HDR 130) of these head phones and I tried them out. I knew I had to have a set of my own. When I started looking I didn't have to look very far.

When I saw the price that this set was going for on Amazon, compared to the MSRP, I knew I had a great set of headphones and an even more amazing price. I cannot recommend these headphones enough. Fantastic sound quality, range, looks and style.

VThere are many positives about these headphones. The sound quality is great. You can crank of the volume fairly well. They feel light and comfortable. Range is good (I haven't yet lost the signal, but then again I haven't really tested that aspect to its limit). Set up was easy. And best of all there is no hiss. I first tried a $99 Sony wireless headphone, mainly b/c I've always been a Sony sound fan. Sound was Sony sound---but you couldn't really raise the volume too well. Worst for those was the horrible hiss....So these are expensive, but you get what you pay for. These are the first Sennheiser I've owned, and I'm sure I'll purchase more in the future.

VI love the headphones.  The sound quality is great, I can move around with them on and not miss a thing.  My only problem is that we use two of them in the family, and syncing both is sometimes hard.  Once they are synced, everything is fine.  Every few weeks or so, one of them unsyncs (or unpairs) - then it is a big production trying to get both to pair.  I pair one, the other one becomes unpaired.  Then I work on the other - and you get the picture.  I don't know why I have this issue.  I see some other complaining about the same thing, then others saying pairing is easy.  Either way, I'm glad I bought them, even with that frustration in mind.

VThis is my second set of Sennheiser headphones. I've had the first set for years and they were showing their age plus they picked up a lot on interference. The newer digital set is much better, although they still cause hot ears after a while. I wish they had more volume without turning the TV up so high. When I'm by myself, no problem, but when watching with the wife, her comfortable volume for the TV still leaves my headset a little low. I probably should have returned them and looked at another brand but the price was below $200 and I didn't want to pay more. Still better than the old ones, but I bet there are better choices out there.

p975
sg5
VPros:-Excellent range with no connection issues whatsoever.-Sound great for being wireless-The battery has never ever died on me, and I have occasionally fallen asleep with these still going. 8+ hours later, they are always still going strong.Cons:-The construction materials could be better. The plastic around the drivers seems pretty cheap. It didn't take them very long to start creaking.-On occasion, I hear rattling in the right cup that I can't seem to get rid of. It makes this noise during playback, so it is very annoying. Probably related to the issue of cheap construction materials. **edit haven't heard rattle in a long time. See below,**Overall I am still very happy with these. The creaking is only an issue when they are in my hands, so it isn't really a big deal. I said the construction materials seemed cheap because they creak and make noises, but they have lasted me this long without breaking. That is saying a lot considering I have woken up half of a dozen times with these under me (they creaked well before that).**Edit Sep 2015**Well, they are still going strong. I have to hand it to Sennheiser, these are some excellent headphones. While my headphones have continued to slowly come apart (no thanks to the way I treat them), They still sound fantastic. No issues with battery life, they are still mostly holding together, and the rattle is completely gone somehow! I think the culprit may have been a broken clip on the pad plate. One of them is missing now and I haven't heard the rattle for a long time.I'm going to eventually pick up a new pair of headphones for these, especially now that I heard that I can use multiple pairs with a single transmitter. I would give these 4.5 stars if Amazon allowed it.

You can take them off for a second and push volume either up or down ONE time and this seems to work for me.

I wear hearing aids and there is no problem with feed back. The sound is great, much better than the TV alone. The controls are a little hard to get used too but not a real problem. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to have solitude and not diturb anyone else in the room.Thank you Amozon for carrying this product.

VThese are an excellent pair of headphones. The Sound is very good. Easy to setup. I bought these to watch streamming movies through an apple TV. While this setup works great. My daughter who uses an iPad2 next to me has interference with her wireless network. When i turn the RS180 off the iPad works fine.So, i am reporting one flaw in these headphones- they probably do not work with an iPad 2.Thats why I gave it 3 stars only.

VExcellent in all regards except for 2 minor things.  The controls on the side of the headphone are push button.  The fader and volume controls would be better if they were the wheel type.  Second, to turn them on you have to turn on both the headset and transmitter.  Older version of the headphones turned on automatically when you lifted the headset off the base.  Otherwise great sound, range, bass response and feel is great.

They sound pretty good except for the short delay between the source and the headphones. I knew that was coming and accepted it. With a little jockeying of tv level and the headphone volume, I reached a happy medium. For those who bluetooth from your pc or stereo to headphones, it's a great product.

VUnfortunately, none of the digital headphone systems will allow you to watch TV with your loved ones.  All the digital headphones I have tested (Sennheiser, Oticon Streamer, etc.) induce a delay that creates a echo effect when you are listening to sources that also have speakers going.  If you have the sound on the TV or stereo turned up loud enough for your girl friend/wife/kids to hear you are going to hear an echo that makes it impossible for you to listen and enjoy.I am using a Sennheiser analog headphone system Sennheiser RS 130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones and it works perfectly, no delay so I can enjoy my evening TV with my wife.  It may not have the high quality of the digital systems, but it has enhanced my quality time with my family.

VI bought these headphones after all the positive comments I read about them, but either way, one is never sure, as sound is a personal thing, so I wasn't too sure if they were as good as all the reviews I read.Well let me put your mind to rest, that these are just plain, and simply amazing.Setup only takes a few minutes if that, and when I first put them on, I knew that I had made the right choice in headphones.The sound is crystal clear, and there is absolutely no noise, or hiss, or dropouts whatsoever.A few reviews I have read, said they had hiss in the background, and if that is the case, that was entirely due to the input signal not being set high enough.There is a switch on the Transmitter, for 0db and -8db.. If you are using a high level signal source such as a home audio stereo, set the switch to -8db and set the volume of your stereo to roughly about 3/4 of its volume range.If you are using a Laptop, Ipad or something like that, set the switch for 0db, as this allows a smaller signal , to be amplified properly.I have tried using these watching movies, as well as listening to music audio, and both sound equally amazing.The bass is not overpowering, but its tight and definitely present.Comfort of the headphones will probably be a personal thing also, as not all heads are created equal, but on my I suppose my regular size head, the comfort is very good,. I wear these headphones around the house all the time now listening to music while I am doing my chores, and I sometimes forget they are on my head.Of course you will never get the rated distance for the sound to travel, but for me, I can walk all upstairs in the house, and get as far as the outside of the back door before the sound drops off.What I like is the fact, there is no loss of audio quality until you do go out of range, and at that point, the sound just stops, and will come back on once you are in range again. There is no in between loss of audio quality up to that point.My only annoyance, which is a common one, is the placement of the switches on the headphones for volume and power and balance..They can be really hard to find when they are on your head, and you try to adjust the volume, but I think over time, it will become easier. That to me is a very small annoyance compared to the overall positive.I find now watching movies, with the ALC (automatic level control) turned on , I hear things, that I have never heard before.. Every little nuance and subtle passage is recognized, which makes for a very enjoyable movie experience.Keep in mind these are open headphones, as compared to closed headphones ( RS170 ) .Open headphones are not as tight around the ears, and will let some sound out, but at the same time, it gives you a more open , airy feel to the audio passages, which is what I like and also makes for a more comfortable fit . Anyone sitting beside you will probably be able to hear what you are listening to , so if that is an issue for you, then the RS170 headphones would be more your liking , as they are a closed set of headphones, being tighter sealed to your ears, keeping the sound more to yourself.But the RS170's don't have the ALC option, which is what I like very much with the RS180's.So if you are on the fence about these, make the plunge, as you wont have any regrets !

p1086
sg5
V*As a disclaimer, I am reviewing within the first week of ownership. I have no judgement on this product's survivability.That being said, I find these headphones to be very high quality and professionally laid-out, but lacking in headband durability. The sound quality of these headphones is incredible. That aspect alone is worth $200. The open-back design leaks every sound to those around you, but the reason for this is to hit the consumer's ears with every possible tone in a clear manner. These headphones do that very well. Crisp, high tones do not damage your ears with their intensity. Bass is subtle, yet strong. They are simply elegant in sound design.The Stand and headphones themselves are very elegant as well. The button layout leaves something to be desired, but panning the audio left and right should really only happen during initial setup, and the volume controls are felt easily enough. Other than that, the stand and headphones feel very durable. Handle them with care, though. The headband seems very brittle, but the innards of the band seem to move independently of the band, so my fear of breaking these is minimal.The range really should not be a problem for anyone wanting to use these as a home entertainment system, or just an audiophile looking to find a nice pair of wireless headphones. I live in a cookie-cutter neighborhood, and these had no problem sending the signal through the walls of my house. I cannot say this will be true for everyone, in every type of house, obviously.These are hands-down the best pair of wireless headphones on the market. Do some research yourself. Try to figure out what is important to you in a headphone, and then come back and take a look at the 180's. The $200 price tag is well worth it for what you get out of the product.

VQuality matches price
p1092
sg5
VIn this case, "you get what you pay for," seems to be an apt description of these Sennheiser wireless headphones.  In my opinion, the price tag is no small sum.  These headphones match in quality the price of the headphones.  I would add that the quality of the headphones match the price, no more or no less.  My prior experience with Sennheiser headphones has lead me to almost expect far more quality than even the price paid for said headphones.  Over two years ago, I owned the RS120 headphones from Sennheiser.  For the price I paid for those headphones, I believed that the quality far outpaced the price.  I know that hiss was an issue for many with the 120s, but I had a hard time detecting the dreaded hiss.  I found those headphones to be clear and extremely crisp.  Unfortunately, those headphones have never been found since I moved about two years ago.  After months of no success finding my much regarded Sennheiser RS120s, I decided to go ahead and purchase new headphones.  Sennheiser was the obvious choice for me since I was so impressed with my last set of Sennheisers.  The RS180s appealed to me as the obvious next step.  While the price was higher, I was definitely interested in the improved wireless technology.  For comparisons sake, it should be noted that my setup and environment are entirely different than the environment in which the 120s performed.  The 180s are connected to an Onkyo 808 receiver compared to the Onkyo 805 for the 120s.  Plus, I live in town with plenty of interference in the environment to be considered compared to a remote country setting for the 120s where there was little to no interference.  With those conditions set for reference, I must admit that I was not as impressed with the sound for the money with the 180s compared to the 120s.  Not that the 180s are of less quality or poor performance, I was just hoping for something to blow me away since the price was double.  Unless the setup and environment accounts for the difference, it is my impression that I got more bang for the buck with the 120s.  With the 180s, it seems that I obtained the quality for which I paid.  Again, no more or no less.It does seem to me that these RS180s have a more full ranged sound quality.  While the sound can be sharp and crisp with the appropriate content, the 180s seem to have a more well rounded and full bodied sound with both lows and highs.  It should be noted that I almost exclusively use the headphones for late at night HDTV and Blu-ray movie viewing.  As is so obviously mentioned with these types of headphones, they are excellent for superior sound quality when one does not want to wake up the wife and kids late at night while watching movies or catching up on shows on the DVR.  As for the wireless technology, I do not detect any interference or hiss with these RS180s.  Granted, I really could not detect much if any hiss in the 120s.  If I did at all, I thought I might have heard a little come through on the 120s with some high range content that tended to sound a little like that old high treble sound.  With these RS180s, that is not an issue at all.Regarding sound quality, I have no complaints at all.  I do find the RS180s to be an aesthetically pleasing set of home audio technology.  I have no problem setting this product on top of my audio stand in my living room.  Also, these headphones have plenty of range from the base.  I'm able to move around the house without any interference or degradation in audio quality.  If I were to have to mention any complaints with the headphones and base station, it would be along the lines of ease of use with the couple of buttons on the front of the base.  While the buttons are easily accessible and function properly, I find that after six months I still have to check the manual regarding the settings, pairing, and the meaning of the number of blinking lights in the time continuum.  As I mentioned, everything works fine.  I just don't find the set as user-friendly as I would like.  On the other hand, the buttons on the headphones work fine regarding to proper touch and pressure.  I also like the volume control buttons on the headphones themselves.  They are simple and easy to operate without any problems.All in all, I think the Sennheiser RS 180 headphone set is of an extreme high quality.  I would recommend these wireless headphones to my friends and family.  I would add that with the RS 180, that quality does not come cheaply for the typical homeowner with an average AV system.  While the quality of these headphones seem to match the price, I would add that the quality does not sound like it exceeds the price either.  In closing, I continue to be impressed with Sennheiser.

p1098

VOverall, I've been really happy with this purchase.First, it was really easy to set up the headphone system. I'm only moderately technically inclined, but it only took me perhaps five minutes to set everything up.Second, although I'm not an audiophile, I've been very impressed with the quality of the sound on these headphones; I particularly like the audio-leveling feature. That said, contrary to how these headphones are described on Amazon, these headphones DON'T have "dynamic surround sound."  I wish they did and I wonder why they don't, as the lower-level Model RS 170 headphones have surround sound.Third, I've generally been satisfied with the range of these headphones. I live in a 2 story, 2900 square-foot house, and I typically get reception just about anywhere in the house. I do periodically get a brief "hiccup" in the sound when I'm in the remote areas of the house, when I'm outside grilling on the patio, and when I walk into the garage. None of those distances exceed 150 feet, so I do question whether these headphones truly have a 320-foot line-of-sight range range that Sennheiser advertises. But, again, the range is generally fine for my purposes.Fourth, the headphones are really comfortable, and in my opinion, the headphones and base look handsome and cool.  However, the headphones and base don't seem to be constructed with particularly high-quality materials. The plastic feels light and thin -- which could be a positive, but makes me wonder whether they could break easily. (Mind you, they HAVEN'T broken, but I don't have high confidence that they could withstand much punishment.)Fifth, the volume and balance controls on the headphones are a bit cumbersome to operate. The volume and balance are controlled by small, low-profile buttons on the outside of the right ear cup. For me, it's been tough to find and operate those buttons by feel. So, to adjust the volume or balance, I've typically needed to remove the headphones to find and work the buttons. That can become a bit annoying after a while.

VQuality item, but could be easier to use
p1104

VWe replaced a cheaper item with the Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone System.  The cheaper one was half the price, but it was junk.  Don't buy a unit that uses infrared, which is directional, for the signal.  The Sennheiser is well built, sound quality is impressive, and it's appearance is elegant.  The only things I would change are the buttons on the earphones for power, volume and balance, maybe the way the unit is charged, and the way it turns on and off.The controls (volume up, volume down, and balance) are small and right next to one another, and I can't imagine trying to use them with the phones on.  It's very easy to hit the wrong button.  Maybe a knob on each ear pad would be better.  You could memorize which way to turn the knob.You can turn the unit off by holding down (not just pressing, because the buttons are made to do double duty) a button for a second on either the charger stand or the earphones, but it takes two pushes to turn it on (one for the charging stand, which contains the wireless transmitter, and one for the phones).  With a bit more smarts, the headphones could be made to standby in a low power mode, then ramp up when it detected a signal from the transmitter.  Maybe that's too much to ask for the price.For our installation, at least, it was an annoyance to have the charger integrated with the transmitter.  The transmitter has to be physically tied to the TV sound source with a cable, which limits your choices for where to plug in the charging station.  On the other hand, if the earphone charging station and transmitter were separated, I guess they might both need AC power, which would increase the cost of the unit.There is also a split-second delay between the time you hear something on the TV speakers, and the time you hear the same thing on the headphones.  Many people would not notice, and you can turn off the TV speakers if there is no one trying to listen without headphones.These were all minor annoyances, and overall we are glad to have the unit.  I advised my mom, who is 87, to ignore the volume controls on the headphones and just use the TV remote to adjust volume.  And the balance control really only has to be set once.

VSeinnheiser Wireless Headphones
p1110
sg5
VI have owned many wireless headphones. I am not an electronic geek but have all the geek equipment. In the final analysis the most important thing is how do they sound to you, comfort, and ability to deliver what you want.  These have clearly been the best wireless phones I have ever owned. I had been using the Seinnheiser RS-160. My complaint about them was they were heavy and not very comfortable. More importantly the controls on the earphones are elevated. If you are in bed watching TV or doing something else you can very easily change the volume by rolling over on the side of the phone where the controls are located. I seemed to do this several times each time I used them.The new phones are light and extremely comfortable. They sync with the transmitter quickly and you have a light on both the earphones and transmitter that lets you know they are synced. The ear phones have recessed controls for volume,balance,sync,etc. They are small so you may need to take them off to make adjustments until you use them for a while. The transmitter can be placed behind doors or anywhere and they will still perform. The phones automatically charge on the transmitter. I really do not know how you would make a better earphone set than these but since there are some that cost $500 I guess you can. These have been great and I have had them for about 7 months. I have no idea how long the batteries will last and I have used them for up to 4 hours continuously with no loss of sound. They are not inexpensive but quality is not cheap. Like most things some people will not like these and some will think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Good luck. Of course with Amazon you can always send them back. Does not get better than that.

VSennheiser Wireless Headphones (RS 180)
p1115
sg5
VAnother great product from Sennheiser.  The sound is excellant and as someone said in another post when using these headphones this is the first time I hear all of the words in a movie or TV show.  The sound is crystal clear and presents a surround sound type of image.  Price is high but then again high quality head phone that are not wireless aren't a whole lot less expensive.I agree with the majority of reviewers that the buttons on the headphones are not easily accessed (especially the volume controls).  However, having said that in reality once I set the volume I haven't thouched it since so it becomes a moot point.  IF I want the volume changed I use my remove to increase/decrease the volume on the source which solves the problem.Wireless range was satisfactory.  This spec is highly dependant on your individual room/house makeup.  Specs like these are always made in open areas so as to standardize this measurement.  I'm able to go to several different rooms and not lose the signal.Depending on your environment you will either like or dislike the "Open-Aire" noise suppression or lack thereof.  In my case I don't have external noise sources as that would be a real problem as you can hear quite a bit of outside noise/sound when using these headphones.  Open-Aire is good in that when someone comes into the room and asks you a question you can easily hear the question without taking off the headphones.  However, if a constant noise/sound source were present this would be a problem.Headphone fatigue is always a problem when wearing headphones for extended periods of time (like a full length movie).  The Sennheiser phones are the most comfortable that I have worn to date.  I can easily watch a full length movie without the typical ear pain that most headphones give you.  Also they are light enough that there are no other pressure points that become a problem after a certain length of time.Setting up the system was a snap and basically a plug and play process.  For me this has solved the problem of wanting higher volumes when I watch TV, movies, etc. whereas my wife likes the opposite.  Now we are both happy.  The real negative of this system though is now I rarely use my big surround system that I spent so much money on so it sits there gathering dust:):)

VI have been using the Sony RF-985R wireless headphones up till I picked up these Rs-180.  I found the two are totally the opposite in many ways. The Sony are the most comfortable for wearing for extended periods while the 180's are not so comfortable after wearing for even an hour or two.I found the diameter to be too narrow around the ears and they place too much pressure on the side of the head. While the Sony's are  many times more comfortable with their large foam ear pads and head band.  The Sony's provided a rather dull sound field while the 180's are much better.. ..almost outstanding.  The Sony's have a reasonably easy to use volume & on off switch while the 180's are so poorly designed ergonomically -- that you have to remove them from your head to adjust them to either turn on or off or adj the volume.  So neither set warrants a high rating.  Like some of the others posts, one fix for the 180 is to glue on some sort of raised button so you can find the vol up and down ..  I detest having to remove the 180's from the head to simply raise or lower the vol.  The only reason I dont give them one star is they do provide excellent audio response.  Personally,  I think they should re-design the 180 ergonomically ASAP.  Then they might get five stars.. Something else better on the 180's is the range is over twice as far as the Sony's.  So neither one is the perfect wireless headset.  I plan to try gluing on some sort of reference nib on the vol controls to fix it but a user shouldn't have to modify such a product.  So thats why I give them 3 stars. one neg for the uncomfortable head band ear pads and another neg for the poor vol controls.

p1133
sg5
VI needed to replace cheaper headphones that had literally fallen apart.  I purchased the Sennheiser RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone after carefully reviewing their specifications and customer reviews.  I use my headphones for TV viewing. The sturdiest set I found had metal head bands but were bluetooth which I couldn't use.  These have plastic bands (I don't think there is a metal ribbon inside) but appear sufficient if used with care. However, I did notice the set with metal bands were a bit heavy and could become uncomfortable after a while.  The RS 180 is very comfortable due to the light weight, soft velour ear pads, the over the ear design and padding on the head band.  I have some loss of hearing and have a hearing aid (BTE) on one ear. It does not interfere at all with the close fit of the headphones.  The sound is very good.  I turn the TV on, pick up the headphones and press the "ON" button on the stand, press the "ON" button on the headphones and hold them at the stand for a second to sync. I chose these headphones which have the "open" ear design so I could hear other sounds too, i.e. someone addressing you. While being worn the headphones sound adjusting buttons are too smooth to differentiate.  However, it only takes a few seconds to remove the headphones and adjust. Some reviewers have their own cures for this. Since the wireless signal travels through walls, I can hear as I walk through the house. I can turn a second TV on with the same program in another room and listen from the first TV (where the headphones base is connected). I have found these headphones to be enjoyable and hope they stay that way.

VI have owned these for about a week now, and I have to say, these are by far the most comfortable over-ear headphones I have owned so far. After hours of use, they still barely feel like they are on top of your head, and I do not notice any fatigue at all. I gave them +1 star for comfort. That being said though, I am not impressed.My initial impressions going from a corded set of Sennheiser HD 280 headphones that I've owned going on 8 years now, was that the sound quality was lacking and hollow (especially on the bass end). I attributed this to the headphones being wireless and was willing to overlook the diminished sound quality for the convenience of being able to walk around while wearing these. However, that is not the only issue.These headphones cut in and out on a regular basis, even right next to the base station. I checked for interference and found that my router was actually broadcasting on interfering channels, so I made a quick adjustment. I was disappointed that the base station did not pick up on this and switch over to a higher frequency, but then again, these are headphones and not a router, so moot issue I guess. Now that the interference is gone though, and they have no excuse to drop signal right? Wrong. If anything it's worse. They drop off within seconds of going on your head, then fail to reconnect. For the price these cans go for, needless to say I am highly disappointed with how they behave. I may be returning these.

p1193
sg5
VFirst pair received had a fault with the right channel balance button - had to press extremely hard to get it to work. Also, the included stereo mini to RCA cord didn't work for the left channel.Second pair has given me no problem so far and has been impressive in all the ways that matter most. Both pairs sounded terrific to me. I did notice that when watching movies online that have a lot of quiet time, the automatic level control can cause distracting 'dead-spaces' in the sound - going from a very quite hiss to totally quiet repeatedly. Not really a big deal as you can turn the auto level off. The issue with delay mentioned by other reviewers has only been an issue for me when I use them for playing guitar through a guitar workstation (big multi pedal) which makes perfect sense.I bought these headphones because I recently moved into an apartment, I love music, and the soundtrack of a movie is just as important as the visuals to me. They will never replace my surround-sound for movies, but they sound great - and for music they outshine my surround-sound speakers easily. These are the forth pair of wireless headphones I have owned through the years and I can say in this case "you get what you pay for". They are very comfortable, sound terrific, and I wish I had been willing to pony-up the money for them long ago.

VI took my time listening to these headphones under many conditions before choosing to write a review. I think I've done my duty on that now and I am ready to say my part. To begin with, I will state that this review is based on connecting these headphones to the headphone jack of a Denon AVR-2311CI.IF you are buying these headphones for musical interests alone, you may be pretty satisfied - for the most part. The dynamic range is quite acceptable - bass, mid, and treble are fairly represented. I experienced some wireless drop-out 15ft on the other side of an exterior wall and 35ft through one interior wall, but all-in-all, I was satisfied. Note that there are no other RF signals (the signal this unit uses) generated within my home that I am aware of that might cause such a conflict that would affect the range.The greatest disappointment came with signals that varied rapidly from low to high in all dynamic ways - satellite audio, and in particular live events therein. There were pops, crackles, and rattles every time I turned around. Apparently, a dynamic volume adjustment algorithm then triggers a volume decrease in an attempt to address this. This would seem to me to be an attempt at signal processing within this unit that fails in some unexpected circumstances and creates a rather nasty experience. Pop, crack, volume down - volume rises in a bit until the next crackle, then down again. It's like it's choking on the signal.The only way I could mitigate this behavior was to turn the receiver's volume below -23DB. This may also work for some, but be aware that there will be a loss of quality regardless as the circuitry in the unit is always trying to compensate and you will start to detect a sort of hiss in place of the pops and crackles as the unit continues to try and boost the volume. Since these headphones are open, the volume isn't high enough at this level to blot out external noises. If only the RS-180 could be ignorant and let you manually adjust the settings to your own satisfaction. In short, it needs a purely "manual" mode.If you expect to be fairly close to the base and are listening to audio sources that are consistent in their dynamic ranges, such as CD or DVD, you might be golden. If you are outside of the ranges in distance I noted, you may experience occasional drop-out; if you are listening to sources that may change their dynamic ranges or volume levels rapidly, such as satellite/cable sources, adjustments made to the audio signals by the circuitry of this product might create "artifacts" that will disappoint you in the least - or maybe render the product unacceptable to you.All this would have yielded 3 (really, 2.5) stars.But wait - there's more. I don't like the fact that when this unit connects the base to the headset that it fails to extinguish the LED on the base - it flashes relentlessly. I also dislike the fact that when you finally find the obtusely positioned on/off button on the headset to turn it off that the base then continues to flash furiously. Is this a by-product of supporting multi-headsets? Surely they could have done something else. Turn out the lights.And may the force help you if, for "sanitary" purposes (reading your product manual), you need to replace these earpad covers - they are quite specialized in construction, as they snap and twist on. Expect to pay at the least $50, likely more - if you can find them. I did find a UK source, none in the USA at this time. If your ears get sweaty, your time will come.These additional issues take this unit down to 2 stars... would have given 1 1/2, but that is not available. Premium price, not premium design or performance for general usage. The RS-180 may suit audiophiles that are happy with the range limitations. Mileage may vary for other users working with varied audio sources and applications.UPDATE: The ALC is not active and never has been. Not sure why most who would spend the $$$ on this model would need it.

VAwesome sound, poor design
p1205
sg5
VThis is an odd product to review for me, because the product absolutely excels in their area of sound delivery over a wireless connection.  In fact, it is so much better than anything else I've ever tried, it's almost not in the same ball park, but the headphone design is relatively poor compared to the cheaper competition.  (otherwise 5 stars no question.)The great:Sound quality is better than anything else I've heard in a wireless setup.The battery lasts for many, many hours before the headphones need to be recharged (of course YMMV) but I can leave them off the charging station for weeks on end without them running out of power, where other brands would need to charge at least once a week under similar viewing conditions.The headphones are comfortable, breathe well, and provide excellent sound from low, mid to high.It's really nice to not need to be in line of sight of the transmitter and still hear what's being said.  Depending on the show, I might pop into the kitchen to make something, swing downstairs, walk outside to get the mail, and the sound continues no problem.  I've gone at least 100 yards away from the base and haven't lost audio quality.It's pretty easy to set up dual headphones on the same transmitter, which is nice if you and your spouse want to watch a loud/scary movie and the kids are in bed.The bad:For expensive headphones, they have some of the stupidest design choices I can imagine.1.  The volume buttons are tiny, and physically adjacent (on opposite sides) to the power button.  Try to turn it up by pressing the "+" button, and if you're off my a millimeter they turn off instead.  It's not easy to see anything on these buttons, so to adjust the sound you basically need to take them off of your head.2.  While the transmitter will turn off after about 10 minutes if no headphones are on, if the headphones and transmitter are both left on, and the TV etc. are turned off, both devices will stay on forever.  Headphones are not smart enough to turn off on their own.  Most wireless headphones I've owned know to power off after X minutes of no sound input.3.  When the unit is running low on power, the green light on the side of the unit will flash faster, rather than some sort of audible warning.  It would be nice if the low power warning were something you could hear, rather than something you can't really see when they're going to run out of power.I had some really cheap wireless headphones in the past, which used a dial for volume/power (rotate the dial to turn the volume up, all the way down and *click* and they're off, easy to use while you're wearing them) and auto powered off, they were a quarter of the price, and yet so much better in that one area.So for me, 4 stars due to the stupid button setups, but if you care about sound, then 5 stars and you will be floored with the audio they deliver.After over 6 months of usage I still love them, and am very happy I bought them, even with the negatives to the product listed above.

V6 months later - updateJust wanted to leave a quick update now that I have owned these for 6 months. I would guess I spend at least half my waking hours wearing these and simply put, they are perfect. They are so light and comfortable that you never get sore ears and quickly forget you even have them on. The sound quality is fantastic and with a little equalizer tweaking on your mp3 or movie software you can really get these sounding just the way you want. One reason I love these, which may affect you, is that they are *not* sound blocking. I need to be able to hear surrounding noise (children) or phones ringing. If you want to block sounds then these are not for you.The wear on these has been great. After about 3 months they definitely adjusted. At first I was afraid that they were losing their structural integrity but this has not been the case. They are as sturdy as ever and seem to have just gone through a breaking in period where they are less stiff and feel even more comfortable to wear. The cordless comfort and freedom is just a bonus. There is zero sound quality loss from the cordless style.About the only complaint I would have, which is user error, is charging. If you wear them all day and then charge them all night you will have a perfect schedule. However these seem to charge in almost real time. Meaning if you wear them all day they literally take all night to charge. Because of this, if you forget a charge they can go dead the next day with no real warning and you can't just pop them on the charger for a quick refill to get you by.I have owned many high end headphones and now own several Sennheiser headphones for travel and home and these are simply as good as it gets. I would never wear anything else unless I were traveling.-------------------Takes some pretty fancy technology to really impress me these days, and but these headphones are nothing but perfection. I have used high end corded headphones for a long time, and have always preferred Sennheiser. After shopping around for a new pair I finally decided to give the wireless a try. I really did not want to waste a bunch of money for a lesser model so I went all in with the RS 180's and I am truely amazed. Not only do they sound better than my old HD595 pair, the wireless mode is truely the next step in multimedia enjoyment. With a fairly simple set up between my iTunes, Apple TV and an iPod remote I can put the headset on and have perfect high end sound quality at my computer for gaming, then walk away with music playing and then go lounge in bed and watch a streaming movie.Provided you remember to charge them every night, you will never run out of battery life. They are extremely comfortable. More so than my previous HD595. The fit is snug on an average size head, and with the over-the-ear style of these, they have no pressure at all on your ears. They are very well cushioned on your head and the material is very high quality and soft, but durable - it also seems quite resistant to debris and can be easily wiped if neccessary though I have not found them to attract much dust at all.They look great. They are a sleek charcoal/black and the charging cradle looks very cool and saves a little bit of desk space instead of having to lay down a giant pair of headphones like I used to. So far I have gone a few rooms nearby. I can't say the true distance as don't have a need to go that far with them, but within a room or two away I have noticed zero quality loss and zero distortion or buzzing or anything of the sort. They are just crystal clear all the time.I have watched action movies, played the latest CoD Black Ops and many other games and listen to a wide variety of music and have really found no weak spot as far as sound depth. They exceed any wired headphones I have used for any of the same activities.If I had one tiny complaint, and this may be true for all wireless headsets of which this is my first - when you are ready to put on the headset and you take it off the cradle to place on your head, you need to click a little button on the cradle and then a button the headset to "find it" and sync them together. Now this takes all of 2 seconds to do but it is an extra step I find just a tad annoying. Generally this just makes me not return them to the cradle until I am done using them for the day and I still usually just set them down on the top of my desk so as not to lose the connection and have to redo it if I place them on the cradle for more than a few minutes. But again, this is a tiny thing and in no way is a criticism of the actual performance of these great phones.

VI got these for my pops to replace his HD555 wired cans that i got him a year earlier, both to watch TV at night.  even before that years ago i got him some Recoton 900 mhz wireless ones but they were hurting his ears.  he liked HD555 for comfort and excellent speech intelligibility but obviously wasn't thrilled about the fact that they were wired.well this headphone solves the problem.  it has all the comfort and sound quality that you would expect from sennheiser and it comes in a wireless package that has a decent range and for the most part doesn't drop the signal, doesn't interfere with wifi or microwave and otherwise just plain works.  the charging stand / base is excellent as well.my father's only gripe with this unit is the volume buttons on the headphone are hard to use in the sense that you can't see them while the headphone is on your head and they are difficult to locate by touch alone.  all the buttons are more or less same shape and next to each other which is obviously a bad design - they should be spaced out and shaped differently to be more usable.but that is a minor gripe, not enough to take off a star of otherwise excellent product.i am a serious audiophile and a speaker builder and while i would never use wireless headphones for music myself i have tested their sound quality with music and it is quite good.  they have more bass and warmer sound than many sennheiser open back cans, but of course nowhere close to my IE8 sennheisers.  rock music sounds very good on these headphones - very balanced.  for electronic music you would probably want something more bass heavy like IE8 which admittedly are not wireless.build quality is simply top notch both on the headphone itself and the base.  while it is all plastic the quality is excellent.  it feels much more solid than you would expect from its light weight.even with the high price i have absolutely no reservations about recommending these for watching TV at night.  they deliver.

VSo I have an awesome sound system (Klipsch F-20 front Left and Right, C-20 Center and B-20 as surrounds), but unfortunately I live in an apartment with, what I eventually discovered to be, very thin walls. So after finding out that my sound system was shaking the walls of my neighbor (and I swear it wasn't turned up that loud!) I decided that I needed to find a solution to the problem that would still allow me to enjoy my movies/games/tv but not make all my neighbors hate me.After some searching and looking at reviews I settled on the Sennheiser RS 180 headphone system. I'm not gonna lie, I was a little let down. The headphones are really good, don't get me wrong... but they're not a good surround sound system. Quite frankly, I don't think a set of headphones will ever really be able to compete with big speakers.As far as the headphones themselves, I can't really hear any humming or anything when something isn't being played. I haven't yet went out of range of the base-station and it does sound really good. The headphones are really breathable and I don't get sweaty listening to things with them, but they are pretty sizable headphones which won't win you any fashion contests. The bass seems kinda weak on them but I'm still tweaking the settings on my A/V receiver and hopefully that'll help.

VOverall I love these.  I replaced really old headphones (8-10 years old) which didn't reach past my t.v. room (about 14 feet).  These ones work upstairs on the other side of the house.  I bought this set and a separate pair of HDR 170 headphones without the charger/base.  It's nice to be able to have multiple pairs and not have to pay the extra $90 or so for multiple bases.  Another great thing about the 180 is that you can adjust the volume level to make one side louder than the other.  I have some hearing loss in my left ear, so being able to make that side louder is awesome.  I've only had them for about a month, but so far they work really well.Down sides:  they feel a bit flimsy, are really big, and sometimes the sound cuts out for a second or two.  Where the headphones ear pieces connect to the extendable piece, I sometimes feel like if I'm not careful they'll break.  However this could just be because the ear pieces pivot slightly, making for a better fit.  Size: I'm a short woman, and these look silly on my head.  But since no one but my kids sees me in them, not a big deal.  Sound cuts out: it happens frequently as I get further away from the base ((20 - 40 feet).  I'm not positive, but it seems like if I first turn on the base and then turn on the headphones, it doesn't happen as often.

VI did a lot of research before I decided to order this brand and model of wireless headphones .  I wanted them for tv watching so as not to disturb family members that go to bed at an early time.  The headset came in about three days.  I was happy with delivery time.  The outside shipping box was in perfect condition.  However the product box inside was severely damaged leaving me to believe that these headsets were a returned product from someone that had torn open the headsets, tried them then decided to return them.  I was not comfortable even opening them.  Called Amazon with my concern.  The person I talked to was very simpithetic and immediately said they would send a replacement.  The replacement arrived the next day.  Even though the outside box had some damage, the product box was perfect.  I opened the box and was very pleased with the product and simple instructions provided.  Easy to put batteries in.  Look and feel of headset is awesome.  Extremely comfortable even for long periods of time.  Outstanding sound quality.  I can walk through the house and can still hear tv without problem.  Never once does the headset lose signal nor is there any fading or hissing which I was afraid of.  IF YOU BUY THIS I DOUBT YOU'LL BE DISSAPOINTED!  Definitely a must buy product!

VAs a gamer, having the ability when needed to just get up for a quick something or change positions of sit further back from the TV its important not have to remove or put stuff back on or have the hassle of getting a cord stuck somewhere or get tangled. These have given the freedom to get up for those short needed stops while still maintaining the ability to still hear what's going on in the game while I'm in another room. These headphones are not only comfortable, but work perfect in all corners of a 1500SQFT apartment. So far I have not had ant problems with all the wireless electronics in the house, keyboards, mice, internet, game controllers, and other wireless headphones from other companies. With all the wireless mumbo-jumbo going on in the apartment I have not had any problem with them or any other electronic device in terms of interference. The only con, and it has been stated in the other reviews as well is the buttons, all are flush with the set and are close together. And like the other reviews is easily rectified by drops of some epoxy or glue of some sort. I fixed mine with small black sticker bumps. As for the battery, I'm a 12 on 12 off kind of person so the set has time to charge so I have no problems, but If I did, 2 AAA batteries is all you need.

VPros:I don't agree with the negative comments from others regarding quality. I think it's a quality unit and the audio is excellent. There is no issue here with sound leakage to others nearby. It does not however, block out room noises, which is great with me. I found no issues with syncing the base with the headset. It was simple, easy and fast. I liked how light and airy the headset felt on my head and ears. I liked the ability to use multiple headsets which was a major consideration in the purchase.Cons:The main issue is the poor range. I couldn't go into the next room without connection failures - intolerable. I agree with the other comments about the buttons. It's a complete disaster. You can't feel where the buttons are. If only they'd raised them a little or even just raised the power button which separates the > and < volume buttons. What the heck were they thinking? The same source input into the earphone jack will not work at all through the RCA jacks. I never got the RCA jacks to work. Maybe they're only for receiver speaker outs.  No charger supplied with secondary headphones is another failure.I'd be glad to know of other similar phones not having these negatives.

VI love these headphones.  I have been a fan of Sennheiser for years and have pitied people who shell out as much as $ 400 for Beats.  Germans are obsessive, which is why they are such incredible engineers and they did everything right with these. They are lightweight, I have never run out of battery life (of course, I put them back on the stand when I am done with them) and are probably the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned, but the biggest reason I love them is the SOUND.  What I am looking for in a pair of headphones is faithful reproduction of sound, not artificial booming bass, but balanced sound through the range.  The trebles are crisp and clear, the mids and bass are both precise. When I first received them, I listened to a range of music (including the two "standards" I use to sample speakers and headphones, "Abbey Road" by the Beatles, "Aja" by Steely Dan and "Beethoven's 9th Symphony" conducted by Herbert van Karajan and the Berlin Symphony Orchestra on Deutsche Grammaphon.  All were impeccable.  I have also been using them to listen to Blu-ray discs and they are fantastic for that.  I have a 5.1 surround sound system, which I love, but there are times when I want to watch a movie and not disturb others.  When I was shopping, I seriously considered getting the RS 160s, which have a surround sound mode, but I have no complaints about these.  I can walk around the house with them, I listen to music when I cook. I am very glad that I bought them and would highly recommend them to anyone.

VI purchased these headphones and absolutely love them.  I use them nearly 7 hours a day, 5 days a week.  Coming from several various analog sets through the years there is no comparison.  With the old analog ones I would get crossover and interference, but I have never experienced anything of the sort with these.  Also I found the bass to be great in comparison with my old headphones.  You must be aware that the headphones are an open design so there is a possibility that others can hear what you are listening to if you are really jamming.  But that also helps them stay somewhat cooler than other headphones I have used.  It also allows me to better hear when someone walks into my office.  The velvet covers feel great even when wearing them for extended periods of time.The only downside I found to these headphones is the price.  I feel the price point is rather high and it was hard for me to convince myself the end justified the means.  I debated for a month or more until I finally pulled the trigger.  I am not saying they are not worth it once you get them, but I understand the dilemma.  I definitely am glad I took the chance and made the purchase.

VGreat wireless headphones, if your pair isn't defective
p1283
sg5
VI bought this pair of headphones after my old pair (also Sennheisers) were getting old and I got tired of the wires. This pair was on sale at Amazon, so I picked it up. It's pretty simple to use and setup. The instructions/unit are relatively clear and laid out.The sound quality is good and there is no noticeable latency. While I am a gamer and do listen to music, I'm not an audiophile, so your mileage may vary, depending on how stringent your requirements are.Two serious defects in this product are its lack of QC and range. As many others here have noted, my first pair have had a buzzing/static sound (right ear). On the replacement unit, this problem has disappeared, so you should only buy this if you are willing to go through Amazon's (quick and easy) return/replacement system.The second problem is the range. This product will NOT go through more than one or two very thin doors/walls, and will most likely NOT get the promised/advertised range unless you are in a clear open field, so if this is important to you (you like to roam around in a large house, etc.), then this product is NOT for you.

VI don't think I have written more than 3 Amazon reviews despite using Amazon since inception and being from Seattle. Having lived in Asia for the past 20 years I know about the misconception of stuff, especially electronics, being cheaper here. I spent $600 on these headphones.  My brand-new Denon stereo receiver jack crapped out a year after buying these headphones. I have since hooked them up to my iMac and now listen to music rather than movies. I loved them as movie headphones as I watched cinematic productions from a 70" screen while the family was sleeping rooms away. Now, I am walking 100 feet away past steel structures and microwaves to get coffee across the house listening to stereo music. If you can hear any sort of imperfections it is from your music source or other frequency conflicts (wifi bluetooth screens transmitters etc).  The only concerns I have now is how much radiation I am receiving from my new earmuffs? Powerful!! I look for this brand again!They are nothing short of fantastic.

VAside from the mystery of why Sennheiser's 'Quick Start' guide is basically a CD and an 8 panel cartoon, this was actually super easy to set up.  (Cartoon, FTW! But if you don't feel like loading a CD, here's a link to their manual: [...]I used the RCA cable provided to plug this into the back of our cable box, the audio in to the transmitter, and after some robust battery charging action, I was good to go.  (I could have plugged the audio/headphone end into our t.v. - there are options depending on what your audio source is.  TL;DR - YMMV.)Fantastic sound (no surprise coming from Sennheiser), surprisingly good range and very comfy ear cups.  Downsides have been written about in other reviews, and I agree:  the control buttons are impossible to differentiate by touch and these things are spendy.  I may try to fix the button issue by sticking adhesive dots (in tech-approved black, natch) on the Volume UP and DOWN buttons but aside from the annoyance of having to take your headphones off to do anything like turn up the volume, I'd highly recommend these.

VSennheiser Headset Review
p1305
sg5
VThe Sennheiser RS 180 Headsets are one of the best pair of headphones ever owned.Pros:1.  Comfort.  I usually do not purchase over the ear type headphones, however after reading previous reviews I would now say it is possible to not give up sound quality over comfort.  The padding around the ears and the head band make the headphones very comfortable.2.  Sound Quality.  The sound qualities of the headphones are outstanding.  I would even say that in some instances the quality is better than what I hear normally through my speakers.  I was a little concerned about purchasing wireless headphones and the effect it would have on the quality, I would say it is not a concern any more.  I have not heard any interference or distortion due to it being wireless.3.  Range.  I was not too concerned about the range of the headphones since I knew I would be relatively close to the source; however I was really surprised to see the range of the headphones extend throughout most of the house.  The range of the headphones really exceeded my expectations.Cons:None.

p1311

VI am pleasantly surprised by the sound put out by these wireless cans. I have the RS140 but this takes it up another level. The RS180s are lighter than the RS140s and wearing them for a few hours was very comfortable, sometimes you even forget you are wearing them. The only niggle is your ears do get a little warm after wearing, as compared to the RS140.I compared the performance of the RS170 and RS180 before getting these, and I would recommend you pay a little more for the better sound. If you use the RS170 with bass boost, you get more bass then the RS180. But if you use without bass boost, the sound is really lacking bass and sounds flat compared to the RS180. The RS180 has a bigger soundstage, probably helped by the open air design. I am a long time Sennheiser user and from experience I am not a big fan of leatherette earcups, I find they disintegrate after 1-2 years and get flaky. Go for the velour cushions. I had my RS140 for 4.5 years and I use they almost daily, and to-date the velour cushions are still holding up.

VI have had the HDR-140 set for several years with excellent results.  The headband finally broke.  When I went to buy another set of the headphones I found that they were no longer made.After looking at all the options I purchased the RS 180 and am very disappointed in it.The sound is OK, but not as good as the 140.  The ear pieces are smaller than the 140 and tend to make your ears sore after awhile.You have to go to the transmitter to turn the set on.The controls on the headset are so small you can not feel which button you are pushing so you have to take the headset off to raise or lower the volume.The third time I used them there was sound only out of the right side.  After reading the quick setup, then downloading the manual from the disk supplied and fiddling with them all evening I still could not get sound from the left side.  The next evening, and subsequently they worked OK.  Don't know why.I would certainly not buy them again.  The only reason for three stars is that the sound IS decent.

VI looked long and hard for the best wireless headphones for my home theater.  I bought & returned 2 other different brands but none compared to these. ( I hate being an audiophile sometimes)  After reading tons of reviews and speaking with the people at Sennheiser, I purchased these RS 180.  Prior to making this purchase, I ordered the RS190s thinking that spending more $ meant a better product.  Boy was I wrong.  Don't get me wrong, the RS 190s are great if you're primary interested in listening to music but if you're looking for home theater quality sound for movies or games, then look no further.  The RS 180 are prefect for that purpose.  4 reasons why:1.  Light weight & super comfortable.  Can't even tell their on2. Virtual surround sound makes you feel like your at the movies.3.  I love my bass, and these pack a punch thanks to the built in bass booster.4.  You never have to worry about dead batteries, they come with rechargeable  batteries & the base where you store your head phones is a recharging station.

VINCREDIBLY AWESOME SOUND QUALITY & COMFORT
p1329

VI bought these after researching many tech website reviews of headphones for hearing-challenged people.  I wanted headphones that had stereo with clear sound that would help my spouse clearly understand what was being said during difficult-to-hear dialog as well as clearly hearing sports commentators amidst significant background noise.  These are excellent and are recommended for people with hearing difficulties.  Since purchasing them, another friend whose spouse has hearing issues, also purchased these, and they, too, highly recommend them.  They are very comfortable to wear as they have felt along the ear pads and are not heavy.  The sound is outstandingly clear.  Reviewers say the volume controls are not well placed on the headset because when changing the sound (increase/decrease volume), you can accidently turn the headset off; this is true so you need to be careful.  Even so, these are so worth the sound quality, clarity, and comfort, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND them!!  The AMAZON price is also OUTSTANDING!

VThese do have great sound and I can be anywhere in my house and they will still work. The padding around the ears is very soft and comfortable.  You can wear them for hours with no discomfort.  It's also nice still being able to hear what's going on around you. Set up of the unit was also extremely easy.The batteries last a long time and re-charge very quickly.There will be an echo effect if the volume on the TV is also turned up because of the slight delay.As most people have stated the controls are in the worst possible configuration. Absolutely impossible to distinguish one button from another when the headset is being worn. I still rated them as a 4 because I very rarely have to adjust the volume or touch the controls. I also wish the volume would go a little higher as I am hard of hearing and some programs are still a little to low on volume even with the head set turned all the way up.This set is a bit pricey but worth the money.Happy Listening,Ed S.

VHave owned various brands of wireless headphones over the years as I wear hearing aids and they are a necessity to watch TV.  I have had 3 different models of Sony wireless headphones all in the $100 to $150 range and they worked fine.  Then a few years ago tried the Sennheiser RS120's and they had better sound and clearer reception than the Sony's and I was very happy with them but they were not as comfortable as the Sony's.Saw this new model RS180 Sennheiser and decided to givr them a try even though they were over twice as expensive as my RS120's.  Have to say the extra cash was more than worth it.  These headphones are so comforatble I can wear them for hours.  They have the open cell ear cups so hearing people taking to you while you have them on is possible.The sound quality is outstanding and the range is very impressive (they will work anywhere in my house).If you want great sounding wireless headphones, don't hesitate to spend the money for this quality product.

p1353
sg5
VThis is my fourth Sennheiser wireless headphone set /I still have RS 120 and two pairs of RS 140/ and I must state that quality of sound is the best ever. Absolutely no hiss, distortion or audio dropouts. Low and high frequencies are right there. I'm using it with Bose 3-2-1 system, which does not provide me with an option of controlling the audio levels from the source, thus I can only use volume control on the headset and sometimes I wish for a bit more volume /compared to RS 140, which seems to be somewhat more powerful/. Also, I have some concerns about durability of the headband / two of my older headsets have cracks and I am really worried that soon they might break in half. Having said all that, I still believe that there is no better wireless system on the market and RS 180 is the king! Strongly recommend it to people who like to enjoy clean, powerful, uninterrupted delivery of sound from their home audio system without disturbing anybody in the household in the middle of the night.

VUsed these to replace a set of Sennheiser RS 140 wireless headphones.  Unlike the 140, the 180 are digital -- no static or white noise.  If you are out of range, you get some chopping and then the signal drops off.  I prefer this to the hissing I would get using the analog 140.  The range on these is about twice what I got with the 140s (around 40 feet).  These are RF, so walls and enclosed cabinets pose no problem.The sound is excellent.  The controllers are much better indexed than those on the 140.  The controllers are laid out to make it easy to find the correct knob without having to take the headphones off.  There is also an ALC button on the base that amplifies voices -- useful when you have the volume turned down low.The headphones are light weight and comfortable to wear for extend periods.  They are over the ear and so they don't press down on your ears.  They are however vented so you can still hear load external noises like your wife yelling at you to turn the tv off.

VI bought these for my husband who has a hard time distinguishing and understanding dialogue on the television. The Sennheiser headphones isolate the conversation from other sounds so now his favorite shows are enjoyable once again. Not to mention how much I appreciate not having to interpret everything as we go along. Another plus for us both is that he can listen to a program at the sound level best suited for him without blasting my ears off, including when I am ready to sleep and he wants watch another half hour before bed.The reason we rated this product 4 stars and an area of improvement would be to the controls. They are too close together. Volumn on one side and left/right balance on the other side with greater touch recognition would be helpful.We have tried less expensive headphones, but they did not work well for sound quality. These are definitely worth the cost!Check your TV connection options for compatability with these headphones before you buy.

VThe sound from these headphones is second to none.  And the nicest thing is that the headphones DO NOT, repeat DO NOT go off and make a horrible white noise sound when the source goes to silence for any length of time (like the RS 120's do).  You can set them down for a long time and when you come back, beautiful SILENCE until you turn the music back on - then it's total immersion in the sound.  It takes a while to learn the push-button volume & balance controls, but after a while you will know where the on/off switch is and other controls.  The ear cups are comfortable and I forget that I'm listening to headphones after a few minutes.  The transmitter can project a pretty good distance through walls and structures, but I wouldn't push it too far.  I find that I can walk out to the curb before the signal starts to break up.  I agonised over the cost of these 'phones, but now that I've used them for some time, I have totally forgotten the price.  They are worth every penny.

VThese digital wireless headphones don't have background hiss and white noise, so my years of searching are over! I don't like noise, and these headphones don't add any. It has a good range too. When the sound drops out from being too far away, it sounds like a brief, faint chirp (not a slap to the head). I was surprised it works as well as it does with such a lightweight switchmode 5V power supply. I might eventually replace the stock power supply with hefty shielded linear 5V supply, just to see if it can get even better. The no-modification trick to feeling the volume buttons is to use your ring finger or pinky (more sensitive) to find the gap between Vol- and the Balance button. Vol+ is easier to find. Synchronizing the headphones to the transmitter seemed a bit iffy, but not a problem with some sound playing into the transmitter. I used a separate charger to charge the AAAs faster, before twisting the earmuffs unlocked to put them in the battery compartments.

VTransmitter Auto-off feature a nuisance
p1401
sg5
VMy 82 year-old father has been using the RS140 headphones for a few years and liked them. We decided to give him a new RS180 set for Christmas. The sound quality on both is really good, but the new RS 180 set is not as user friendly. To begin with, the controls on the headset are more difficult for him to operate as his hands and fingers are large and he is losing his dexterity. However, the biggest problem is that the new set's transmitter has an auto-off function if the headphones are turned off for five minutes. I believe this is an energy saving feature, but there is no option to disable it or extend the auto-off time. Because my father's mobility is very limited, it is a huge inconvenience for him to have to get up from his chair and make it across the room to turn the transmitter back on. I have provided this feedback to Sennheiser and suggested that they include a disable option and/or options for longer times for the auto-off to trigger.

VI am a ham radio operator.  I bought these for use with my ham radio station.  I did not like being wired to the equipment with the last pair of headsets that I owned.These headsets work very very well in a ham radio station.  The only disadvantage is that they can buzz a little when you are transmitting.  I quickly learned to live with this.  The manual says they are not for use around a transmitter.  By the time you read the manual it is too late since you have already purchased the headsets.These headsets are comfortable to wear for hours at a time.I can walk to other close rooms in the house using the headsets and have clear audio reception.  They do NOT work for 300 feet as advertised in a house.  I would say they work for a minimum of 30 feet through walls.I gave these headsets a 4-star rating because they do not work over a 300 foot range and because of the buzz while transmitting.

VI had original purchased the Sennheiser RS120 but wasn't thrilled with the lack of bass, volume levels and interference issues. My ears also hurt after a short time due to the foam ear pads. After more research I decided to give the RS180 a try.RS180 = What a difference! No interference issues with my home wireless (operates on 2.4-2.8 GHz auto selecting). Excellent bass response that will actually tickle your ears  - depending on what you are listening to of course.Ample volume control when you need it. When I listen to live concert videos and enable the automatic level control, the speech is much easier to understand. The uncompressed digital really makes a difference.The only negative as mentioned in earlier reviews is the buttons which could be more defined which would make it easier when they are on your head but this isn't a show stopper.Very pleased with the RS180 and well worth the additional cost.

They only have a 1/8" input, which requires you to buy a converter instead of just using good quality interconnects that you already have. My only operational complaint. The sound is pretty good. A little heavy on the bass for me, and I think the "soundstage" is just OK. But you have to lower your expectations with any wireless headphones. If you shop around you can get these at a reasonable price. I think you have to be nuts to spend $350 on these when you can buy them new for $220 as I did on Amazon - and free shipping! At that price they are very good value. It's great to listen to music late an night. A must for apartment dwellers. I don't think you can do better for the money.

VExcellent headphones.RS 180 is the open version of RS 170 and thus it doesn't isolate the sound, but in return sounds a little bit better. This quiality makes it a good choice for home use, while RS 170 are better for use in open office. In all other ways 180 and 170 don't seem to differ.As for the signal stength. I keep the base on the 3rd floor. I walked down to the 1st floor, entered the garage and sit in the car. I tried hard to notice any difference in sound quality, but couldn't. The signal stength doesn't seem to be affected by the 3 floors, closed doors and the car between the headphones and the base.The signal doesn't seem to interfere with WiFi: my laptop is connected to the WiFi router on the 2nd floor and so far I haen;t noticed any connectivity problems.They charge in a few minutes (despite the instruction recommends to charge them for 16 minutes).

VUNBELIEVEABLE SOUND QUALITY
p1455
sg5
VI pondered whether to give 4 or 5 stars. My dislikes first:  I think that the controls on the headphones are very difficult to use.  They are small, flat with the headphones, and impossible to use when you're wearing the headphones.  So, any adjustment must be made after first taking the headphones off.  That is irritating.  Then there is the requirement to "pair" the headphones to the transmitter each time you use them.  My last headphones were always paired.  Also, the range is definitely not as large as I'd hoped.  I lose audio in certain parts of the house.All those negatives being said, the rich sound of the Sennheiser RS 180 forced me to bump the rating up to 5 stars.  Yup, that good.  No side tone, no static, no distortion.  I have a Sony 7.1 Surround Sound receiver in my TV room.  The sound out of the Sennheiser is comparable to that sound quality.  For my dime, it is superior to it.

p1461
sg5
VLike many others have stated, the sound quality is very, very good.  The earpieces are comfortable.  Unless turned up really loud, there isn't enough sound leakage to bother others in the room.  However, they don't filter out much, if any, ambient noise.The buttons are OK after you become accustomed to using them.  I don't understand what all the fuss is about.My big gripe is that whenever the base is plugged in, whether it's turned off or on, it interferes with my home wireless network, shutting it down to a crawl and frequently halting it completely.  One could even assume that Sennheiser planned for this problem by providing the little wire clip to hold the electrical cable onto the base every time you have to unplug it, so the cable doesn't fall behind your cabinet.  Bravo, Sennheiser.  (Just a little sarcasm there.)  If it wasn't for this stupid problem, these headphones would merit 5 stars.

VOutstanding sound I was amazed at how good the sound quality was. They were easy to setup and get functioning. After the charging all I had to do was connect to my CD player and hit the buttons. I had no trouble with the buttons on the headphones. The range was good, I have it setup initially at the far end of my house in the family room which is single story room attached to the house. When I went to my bedroom at the other end of the house on the 2nd story I began to notice skipping, that is the only room where I have had this problem. My only serious question is the durability of the headphones, they are all plastic and not heavy. I have been told by others that the phones are fairly durable time will tell. I would prefer a more rigid firmer and heavier construction. But the sound quality is as good as from phones I have heard that are much more expensive

VBest Sound Quality Wireless Headphones Ever
p1479
sg5
VAs far as these go for sound quality, I have purchased multiple sets of wireless headsets in the past 2 months all with extremely poor sound and horrid interference. Finally I found these searching online but after wasting so much money on other units was skeptical.  But the amazon reviews for sound were straight 5's so i decided to give them a shot.  They are well worth the price.As far as Quality goes it is a little sad they are not quite as adjustable as most units out there and they feel like they are made of cheap plastic and not very durable.  The volume control would serve better as a dial as apposed to buttons since they are located in areas that you cannot see without taking off the headset.  Also instead of a power button it would be nicer if it was more like most units out there where they auto turn on and off when you take them off your head.

Nothing should be this difficult. Using the pictures  in the booklet, we attempted to hook our system up but nothing worked.  We called our cable co.  out to see if it was a problem with our  tv hook up, that was fine. Our Sennheiser Wireless headphones just didn't work. I spoke to a  Sennheiser  consultant who,  attempted  to walk me through the hook up. ( which was done correctly) he couldn't get it to work either.  He suggested I return it and they would repair and return them to us.  We declined  because  we paid for a "new in the box" item and didn't want a refurbished item. We were anxious to use our Sennheiser headphones and were  very  disappointed when they didn't perform as expected.  We returned them for a full refund.  I can't believe they don't test their products before they send them to their customers.

VAuto-off feature annoys, can't be changed
p1503
sg5
VSo, I purchased these to use at work with my recent-model iMac to play music without bothering coworkers.  The problem that annoys me is that the transmitter station only transmits to the headphones when it "senses" sound coming from the computer.  This means that even in the middle of a piece of classical music, when the instruments fall silent, the very faint hiss behind the recording cuts out.  When they begin playing again, the hiss returns.  This is even true for the millisecond delays between phrases when an announcer speaks.  I can easily tune out and ignore the slight hiss behind recordings when it is constant, but when it is cutting in and out throughout the piece of music or monologue, it's very irritating.  To be honest, it's irritating enough that I'm not willing to pay north of 300 bucks for these otherwise great headphones.I'm returning them and picking up another pair of the PX 100 wired headphones that have done well for me at home for several years at a fraction of the price.

p1509

VI bought these headphones hoping they would have great clear audio. When I turned them on I immediately noticed a hiss. I turned down the headphones to see if it was just too loud but no, there is a constant hiss no matter the volume level. This makes it very difficult to listen at low volumes and when you turn it up so that the his is hidden you still hear it in between tracks and during quiet moments.The headphones themselves were extremely comfortable and very light, the buttons were a little bit of a pain to use while wearing them, but nothing I couldn't deal with. If the audio was better and the hiss was gone they would be near perfect.I am sending these back, I might try the RS-220 instead, hard to drop $600 for a set of headphones though, I was hopeful the RS-180 would do the job.

I bought a pair for my father in law, and I think he has not taken them off since.The sound is so amazing, I got up while watching TV to go to the kitchen. Suddenly I heard a glass break behind me which startled me, until I realized it was in the movie I was watching.

VThe sound  and physical feel is between open air and closed earphones:  the sound is not as live and transparent sounding as wired Sennheiser or Grado open air phones, but, it is not as boxy as closed phones often are. Bass is elevated and lower midrange is slightly recessed.The sound is very clean and interference free, the range indoors is excellent. The phones are comfortable, not light but not too heavy, and they are secure on the head while walking or in other non-athletic indoor activities, much more stable than the RS120. The on-off, volume and balance controls on the earphone are a bad design. They are small push buttons that blend into the surrounding plastic surface and are hard to tell apart.  The RS 120 is much better in this respect.

VHere's a quick review for you.Pros:The quality is absolutely great, and the range is incredible. The rechargeable batteries last a really long time, and charge very quickly. The base station is stylish, and the charge mechanism is really easy (there are three contact points on the top, and when you rest your headphones on top, it charges them).Cons:The setup and daily use could be easier (the status light blinks differently depending on what the status of the device/headphones is), and the headphones don't fit comfortably on my ears. I have another Sennheiser set (PC 360) and those fit very comfortably, but the ear cups on the RS 180 are smaller and oddly shaped, and may not  fit comfortably on your head at first.

VSimply incredible - surround sound is crisp and distinct, easily separating audio from Blu-ray movies and TV Premium channels so that the sounds are reproduced accurately just as my Yamaha system and SRS speakers  would. What really surprised me was the bass response - you would think the source of the bass was the powered sub woofer. Set up was extremely easy. You can easily walk around the house and still enjoy the sound of whatever show is on. The very best thing is that my wife no longer shouts down our steps to our rec room, telling me to "Turn that thing down."And I don't even care anymore that the Yamaha SRS isn't enhancing the movie experience. The RS 180 Headphones are that good. Awesome.

VHate giving it 2 stars with such good sound quality, but don't think  I would buy again if I had known that the ergonomics were so awful.  Seriously.. they put the tiny power button right in between the tiny + volume and - volume on the headset.  I'm sure it saved them a few pennies per unit but makes living with them aggravating.  Also, and much less significant, the tower weighs nothing.  Brush against it and it knocks over.  And finally, the materials look cheap and feel cheap.Unfortunate this sounds like a bunch of complaining.  As I said at the start, the sound quality really is much better than the other Sennheiser wireless headphones I've owned.  It just wasn't enough to make me like these.

VThese headphones do not work very well with a Samsung home theater.  It seems that Samsung in its infinite wisdom does not include an audio output jack on its theater system and if you try to use the audio jacks on the Dish Network receiver, while using the Samsung, there is such a delay in the sound that it is totally unacceptable. I found a workaround by using the headphone jack on my Hitachi LED with the headphones and an included audio adapter, but it limits the sound from my Samsung to only two of the 6 speakers.  The sound through the headphones is pretty good but the distance that it transmits from the transmitter is not even close to what is advertised.

VI have two RS-130s to compare with this.  Those sold for about half the price of the RS-180.  They both have high quality sound; I can't tell a difference, but I don't have a trained ear.  The RS-180 holds the signal better, while the 130s have little periodic static glitches.  The RS-180 seems a bit overpriced in comparison, for just a stronger signal.  Also, the volume control on the 180 is a dumb design and is hard to use.  You practically have to read braille to find the up and down buttons when its on your head and I am always pushing the off button by mistake.  The balance is even worse.  The older models had a volume wheel, which was much better.  I also find the RS-180 to be uncomfortably tight on my head, but I have a big head.  I had to stretch the plastic out before I could wear them.  For the price, they should have an adjustable metal band like the Grado's do.  All in all, a bit overpriced.

I don't know if it has to be wired to a decent DAC to deliver it's full potential. But on my Marantz receiver (SR 5002) the sound quality was just average, with a lot of emphasis on the low frequency, but the basses are not tight or clear. It's really meant to use on a home theater setup to watch movies, not for listening music.But again, I think that with a proper DAC it should sound better, as I realized that plugged directly to my iPhone It actually gained in quality, balance, and fullness of sound.

Sennheiser needs to survey some of their customers as their step-by-step instructions are all over the board. The following is one of many unclear instructions: Do I charge the headphones first? If so, tell me. Don't say, when the transmitter is first turned on, it's enrollment mode searching for headphones. Isn't the transmitter charging the headphones when first turned on?

That to me is a real deal breaker, it is very annoying to find the receiver is searching for the signal everytime I went to the bathroom from the lounge.The sound quality of the RS180 is magnificent, its crisp and vivid; the fit is very, very comfortable; watching movies with this set is a bliss, the RS 180s sound is well balanced across - bass, midrange and treble.I will return the set though, it could be that there is manufacturer's fault on the set I received but a 9m range is simply not on.

VVery Nice...  I own a few different types of Wireless Headphones
p1634
sg5
VThe $50 pair the same company sells is nice, and great for a work headset, but this is great for watching your movies at home.  After listening to these, the only reason you will not have a pair for work and home *might* be the price - love them.  And if you don't want to spend a fortune for 7.1 surround sound, this might be an excellent option.  The only downside is they can get a little warm (would not exercise with them on, for instance).  But day to day, incredible range and quality (I live in a townhouse and I can go between floors).

VAfter reading other reviews I chose the Sennheiser RS 180 headphones for TV viewing. The noise-free clarity of spoken words was just as I had read about, and they are extrememly simple to operate. The head set is light for its size and quite comfortable. I saw some comments that suggested that it was best for spoken word but I have been satisfied with the music quality as well. It is true that there are no tone adjustments and bass can seem a little heavy in background music but spoken dialogue remains clear over any background.

VOverall not bad. It's a real upgrade from my old ones (RS120). Good crisp clean sound. Real easy to set-up.Ok. Here's what I didn't like, but I can deal with it. You have to turn on the base and the headset to use the earphones.With my old ones all you had to do is turn on the headset and you were done.Next the buttons are a little hard to distinguish when you're wearing them. Easy to confuse up or down and the on off button.It will take some getting use to, but for the sound quality I can deal with it.

VI love these! I used them to watch TV, when my kids are sleep. They fit comfortably, and audio quality is good. The headphone attaches to the base very quickly and easily (on power up). They are a little warm if worn for extended amount of time, but that is to be expected. One thing to note, that even with the headphones on, you can hear outside noises - i.e. they are not noise suppressing, or noise cancelling. That is one reason I go these, since I need to be able to hear if my kids cry..... I am really happy!

p1664
sg5
VI have had mine 11/2 years.  Still work great.  Mine lose signal around 40 feet on most days.  I am hard of hearing and for me they work great.  They were replacements for an old pair of RS140's that my father still uses.  That pair is old, worn out, and still sound great.  I hope these last as long.  The sound of the RS 180 seems a little better than the 140, and that's good!  The plastic looks cheap and flimsy, but I have not had an issue of any sort with everyday use.  I conclude that looks are deceiving!

VThe good news is the headphone is light and the sound is good.  The bad news is that the ear piece is tight on my average ears.  If you have big ears they will be too small.  Also, the user interface is poor.  I know it is connected because a green light on the transmitter blinks twice every two seconds and a green light on the headphone blinks once every two seconds ( is this intuitive or what?). Also, you must remove the headset to see the small buttons to increase or decrease the volume.

VConnecting everything up makes these no more convenient than audiophile headphones with cords. Less so in fact. You basically need to locate the transmitter by the same chair or something. It's almost a worthless product concept for me. I have headphones with wires that sound better and are actually more convenient. These headphones simply can't be used for so many basic applications that most people want wireless headphones for. I have a pair and rarely ever use them as a result.

VMy husband is almost deaf in one ear.  Before these headphones our tv was so loud the neighbors probably heard it!  He told me that these headphones allow him to clearly hear the voices.  The volume was always up so he could hear voices over the background noises.  He has walked all over the house, even onto the deck (which is fairly close proximity to the TV) and says he had no loss of signal. They are a little pricey but this is definitely an area where you get what you pay for.

VThe sound and comfort is first rate.  However, my only concern are the controls on the headset: When one has the headset on, it should be easier to feel which are the volume, balance and off/on buttons. They all feel much the same, except for the raised on/off indicator. There should be some sort of raised button indicator on each of the buttons that can be felt with the right index finger --- would also help blind people too find the right button.

VI'm somewhat disappointed with these headphones. I upgraded from RS140 to the RS180. And the sound is a bit better. But every time I use the RS180, they need to be re-paired with the base. And this is a 7-second process (to quote the Sennheiser support person I just spoke with). This is quite an inconvenience. With the RS140, re-pairing with the base was not required and they would begin working almost immediately.

p1945

VThese are wonderful headphones. This is my first set of wireless headphones and I love the freedom they provide. I am still getting used to not getting snagged on a cord. It's incredible getting up and going to the kitchen or the bathroom and being able to hear everything. My purpose for buying headphones is to be able to watch movies silently so as not to disturb my neighbors. These are great. The sound is very good. I find that when I watch one of my favorite TV series (The Good Wife) that they seem to do something with the background noise that somehow creates the illusion of sound coming from other parts of my room. I don't know how to explain it but I will try. For example, when I watch a scene from this show and there people chatting (in addition to whoever the camera is focusing on) in the background I almost feel as though I hear people talking in my apartment in the next room. Oddly, I don't seem to experience this with any other show or movie I have watched so far. It's truly an incredible audio effect and I feel as though I'm hearing sound from speakers somewhere in the room and not from the actual headphones themselves. The headphones fit quite comfortably on my large head but the sound truly is good. It doesn't seem to have a lot of bass for listening to dance music but it serves my purpose well; watching television and movie disks.I've had these for about three months. The instructions in PDF format that comes on a CD-ROM disk are a lot more thorough than the small booklet that comes with the headphones. I bought the receiver with headset and also an additional headset so that a guest and I can watch television and not disturb my neighbors. Pairing is a breeze and I am very pleased with my purchase. I would buy these again.

p1951

VFirst, let me tell you, if you need some information before buying these headphones you can discard the 1 and 2 stars reviews right off the bat.  They are from two kinds of people for the most part.  One would post a review before even trying the item, like r William ward who wrote \u201cHaven't figured out how to install it\u201d yet.  The other, received a defective unit and is pissed, like Robert E. Kirk who chimed \u201cThe Sennheiser RS 180 Wireless Headphones sounded great for one time, after that I could not get them to connect to the base.\u201d  Once you passed this crowd you might be able to read some meaningful reviews.For my part I am satisfied with these headphones.  I use them for TV and music and they have comported themselves well on both counts.  The major drawback with them is the design of the volume and balance control.  What was the engineer thinking?  I compared them to only one other headphone, the V-Moda Crossfade M-80 which I like because of their size and comfort.  The Sennheiser is better in terms of frequency response as they seem to reach the entire spectrum.  They seem to keep going in the higher frequency region where the V-Moda had stopped.  I compared them mostly to my Hi-Fi system and they seem to hold their ground pretty well.  They are not as complete but I didn't expect them to be.  I have two 12-inch Martin Logan subs and my room is acoustically treated so I can for instance adjust the bass to my liking whereas with the phones I don\u2019t have that luxury.  The bass is nevertheless adequate.  Sound stage and imaging is what it is with headphones and I don\u2019t think they can be changed.  The center stage is always going to be on top of your head instead of in front of you.  Apart from that, they are very competent.  I have them connected to the stereo output of my venerable Sony C555ES and couldn't hear any difference when I introduce a headphone amplifier (FiiO E11) in the path, so I am using them without the amp that does make a noticeable difference with the V-Moda.  I am very happy that I can move around the house and be able to take the music with me.  I doubt any reasonable person would regret buying them.

VThe RS 180 is the first large headphone I have ever purchased.  So, nothing to compare them to.  But, they actually provide a more enjoyable tv listening experience than my high dollar surround system.  Wife is early to bed type and I work a crazy half days, half nights shift work schedule.  We needed something to allow tv watching without waking one another.  For our particular single listener situation they have performed flawlessly.  If you need a simultaneous set-up for someone who is hard of hearing, these are open ear cup and will probably give the slight echo effect that other reviewers have noted.  Purchase accordingly and get a closed cup design if that is what you need.  Also, these may not be the best for in bed since sound does leak from the open cup design.Our reciever allowed for either optical or standard output so, no issues there as some with optical only have noted.  Set-up was extremely simple, standard base input cord to the back of the receiver, power cord to strip or outlet, then nothing more than plugging to receiver headphone jack when using and unplugging when done.  The sound is wonderful and volume more than enough for anyone with normal hearing.  We can move freely around the house and have never had any dropouts with 100 ft probably the max distance we ever get from the base.  They are quite comfortable and not overly hot to wear for extended periods even though a large headset.  Also, we have never experienced the slightest buzz, hum or feedback problem while using these.The only slight issue with these is the volume and balance controls not being easy to distinguish from one another.  We have found this to be a minor inconvenience compared to the quality in every other respect.  As other reviewers have noted, you can simply put a drop of glue or, glue a small bead on a couple of the buttons to help with this if you don't want to or can't remember the configuration.  Simply put, if your needs and intended use are the same as ours, you cannot go wrong with these headphones.  If you have any problems, all I can say is you must have received a subpar set.  We could not be more satisfied with ours.

VGot these when they hit their lowest price on Amazon for $201.88, so pretty happy about that. I have one other wired set Sennheiser headphones which I've had for a decade and I expected the same superior quality, however I'm slightly disappointed. I really want to love these headphones, I really do, but the interference in the headphones really destroys the experience.The build quality is good (4/5) and very lightweight so I can easily watch a movie and remain comfortable. The buttons are difficult to press without taking them off your head which can be annoying. The worst part about these headphones is the audible hum/white noise which can be heard in moderate volume scenes. If it wasn't for this I would give the sound quality 5/5 but this hum is unacceptable. It could be interference from mobile phones or wireless networks in the house, but these are things which aren't going away.I don't have the best hearing in the world and I'm not an audiophile but to me when there is silence in a TV show or movie, then there should be silence in my ears. These headphones could not produce that. In addition to this the hum was actually noticeable in moderate to low volume scenes. So in summary, if I had the money in my pocket again, I probably wouldn't buy these without seeing if there were better options available.Recommendation:Only buy wireless headphones if you REALLY REALLY must buy them. You will get superior sound quality with no interference in a set of wired headphones half the price.Note:Just to give you an idea, I also have a Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound which suffers from no interference when using my computer, however the sound reproduction isn't as good as the Sennheiser RS-180 headphones.

VGood but one minor annoyance.
p1969
sg5
VI purchased these after my Sennheiser RS130 wireless headphones finally died after 5 years of constant use. And if I were basing the review entirely on sound quality alone these would get 5 stars. The sound quality is fantastic, instruments can be heard very clearly in music, for movies it makes the sound effects sound more realistic and the dialogue more clear, and they work well for gaming, though they are not ideal for games due to the lack of simulated surround sound, which is something that the RS130's did very well.The build quality is also quite nice. I normally hate glossy plastic but the plastic on these is pretty nice. The headband feels pretty sturdy and the earpads/headband pads are all replaceable. However the first few days of use gave me massive headaches due to how tight these headphones were squeezing my head. However I have a very large head, I wear a size 8 in fitted hats so this probably won't be an issue for most people. They have become more comfortable each day as they get stretched out.However not everything is perfect. I discovered very quickly that these headphones will sometimes change frequencies all of a sudden and kill my wireless network. Its not a constant problem either, sometimes I will go a few days without this happening, other times it will kill my wireless to the point where I have to reset everything. I tried the suggestion the Sennheiser tech support gave me but it only fixed the problem for about 36 hours. It could just be a compatibility with my specific router. I have considered returning these because of this but so far the annoyance is minor enough to keep them. I would hate having to go back to wired headphones as I have a tendency to break wired headphones very quickly.Don't let this wireless issue dissuade you from getting these though. It seems that most people who bought these do NOT have any issues with interference at all. And I have to say, Sennheiser's tech support responded very quickly to my email and was very eager to try to help.

VThe good, the bad and the ugly.
p1975
sg5
VI purchased two complete sets of RS180s. Four previous wireless headphones sets I've owned transmitted in the 900mHz range and had the typical problems of constant hiss, dropouts and clicks. It was like having someone with a dog clicker right beside your ears. We use wireless headphones in the living room and the master bedroom so sometimes they even received audio from the wrong base.Perhaps past experience has heightened my expectations for such a premium-priced product. That said, I'll attempt to balance the good, the bad and the ugly.Pros:  * Great audio. Very dynamic with good voice definition.  * Good range compared to previous 900mHz headphones. I haven't found a single dead spot in the house.  * Comfortable cuffs that keep extraneous sounds out and the headphone audio in.  * Multiple sets of headphones can be used in the same home at the same time without interference or crosstalk.  * Headphones from different sets can be manually reassociated so they work on the same base at the same time.Cons:  * Both the headphones AND THE BASE shut off when the headphones are placed on the charging cradle or if the headphones are shut off for about 5 minutes. Neither one powers on automatically. Other headphones (at a fraction of the cost) turn on as soon as the headband expands from being placed on the head. No button pushing. Simple. Elegant. This is a major shortcoming. Nothing has required me to physically go to the entertainment center to turn it on for at least 30 years. What were they thinking?  * The pushbutton controls on the headphones are too small and too close together for reliable use by touch alone. The combination mute/power button is placed between the volume up/down buttons so missing it is a challenge when a single finger tip can easily press all three buttons at the same time.  * All controls and markings on the base are tiny and don't contrast with the base color so are virtually illegible.  * One's ears may get hot after awhile simply because the cuffs do fit so well.  * The "multifunction button" backlight flashes constantly as well as an LED on the headphones. I can see having them flash during base to headphone association but once that's successful the flashing in a darkened room is just annoying.  * There's no printed owner's manual included. You have to print your own from the enclosed DVD or from an online download. Not including the manual at this product's price point is inexcusable.The worst part is there was a 50% failure rate. Someone else submitted a review noting that he could not get the headphones to work farther than 3' from the base. One set of mine worked fine for a day and a half and then did exactly that. With two complete sets I could associate both headphones with each transmitter base. Sure enough, both headphones worked with one base but neither worked more than 2' away from the other base. A call to Sennheiser support confirmed that the base had failed. Amazon replaced the failed set since it was only 3 days old. Hopefully, this won't be a recurring problem.I'm going to risk keeping both sets only because the audio clarity is so much better. The constant dropouts and clicks from the old 900mHz sets were infuriating.

VThe Best Solution for Apartment Living
p1981
sg5
VA neighbor complained about my surround system to my apartment management complex. The subwoofer was driving them nuts, as it would me. I thought I was destined to go back to regular TV audio (which is lousy these days). I like movies and I like to hear the effects, so I was really disappointed when I thought my relaxation hobby would come to an end as my Sony Bravia has less than adequate audio speakers.I started to research headphones as a solution. I never considered wireless an option. Wireless? Really?  The more I researched on line, and talked to folks at electronic stores, Sennheiser was the one constant suggestion. Skeptically, I purchased the RS 180 system. Problem solved.They transmit sound quite well (not quite as potent as a good surround system, but I will say I hear voice/speech better with headphones, just by their very nature). They offer freedom to roam about, obviously, because there's no cord. They are easy to set up and operate, for the most part. And I often forget I'm wearing them. They have actually become the preferred way I watch TV (and listen to my iTunes) in my apartment because they offer such clear audio and I don't have to worry about disrupting others.I keep the unit out of sight; behind the TV. There's no interference. There's no hiss while in operation. There's no frequency to have to find. Plug and play, basically. There is a speech intelligibility button the on the base which I leave turned on; it seems to give the audio a bit of a boost. I'm not exactly sure why I'd want to keep it turned off and the instructions don't offer much of an explanation, other than "when turned on, this seems to make voice intelligibility better." So, what's the point? Who isn't going to want to hear their audio?! It's a bit confusing.The only real downside is what many reviews mention: The audio controls on the headphones themselves are difficult to manage without taking them off. And the L/R balance buttons are a little strange but they are meant for folks with hearing difficulties so I can appreciate them, even though they are annoying when accidentally touched. Again, all of the function buttons are difficult to adjust while wearing the headphones. I have to take them off to adjust volume, for example, leaving me to guess at  adjustment levels before putting them back on; and I miss some audio this way. It's not a deal breaker by any means. I do think the developers would be wise to find a solution to the operational control functions in their next generation.Bottom line: An EXCELLENT solution if you live in an apartment and wish for better audio from your TV but don't wish to disturb neighbors with a surround system. Or, if you live in a house where others don't want to hear your audio, etc. The technology is very satisfying; more than I ever would have guessed.

VI've had three different wireless headphones over the past decade-plus and none have sounded as superb as the Sennheiser RS 180. The only slight knock I have is that the range isn't as good as I'd hoped it would be. I can walk around the entire top floor of my house and the sound is absolutely PERFECT. If I go downstairs, about 90% of the downstairs is covered; there's a slight dead-zone in the garage. The problem becomes most prevalent when I go outside while mowing or working around the outside of the house. There are certain dead spots around the property where the sound will just drop out and then come back as I move around. I'll try moving the transmitter closer to the outside and see if that clears the problem, but it's really not that much of an issue.I almost thought I had a problem, at one point. I'm studying Chinese and the lessons have pauses while it waits for your response. I heard the usual question about how to say something and then - total, complete silence. I mean DEAD silence. Not a single, solitary sound. No subtle hiss, static or anything else. I can't emphasize how disconcerting it was to hear (not hear??) such silence. I thought something had gone wrong because when I'm wearing the earbuds and listening to my iPod Touch, the silence isn't as total and complete. As I started to worry that something had gone wrong the lesson continued. The sound is so clear, it's wonderful. I later changed over to listening to Norah Jones and I heard subtle sounds from the instruments that I'd never heard before, even while listening over external speakers connected to my laptop. I do have a bit of a complaint about the placement of the switches on the side of the right earcup. The volume and on/off buttons are in a strip roughly one inch long and about a quarter of an inch wide. You have three buttons: up-volume, on/off, down-volume. Invariably, I end up turning off the unit when I'm trying to raise or lower the volume. It's not particularly cold now, but I expect that I'm going to have a problem discerning which is which when my fingers are frozen as I rake mountains of snow off the solar panels on my roof. It's not a big deal, just something to be aware of. I would've designed it differently, but I'm certainly not regretting my purchase. I have to add that the left and right channel adjustments are there, also, but I don't really fool with the channels, so it wouldn't be an issue with me. Because of volume adjustment/on-off button placement and the range problem, I only gave it a four-star rating. Otherwise, I would give it a six-star, just for the sound quality, if that were possible.

VI've been in search for good wireless headphones for years. I've finally found them and I'm impressed. I'm an audiophile on a budget. I listen to a lot of music, usually on my wired Sennheiser HD595s. I've been really happy with them and sold on Sennheiser's quality. These are almost as good as the wired HD595 cans. So good in fact that I will probably only use the wired headphones for mixing/monitoring. I would give the RS180 a solid B+ in terms of sound quality, which is as good as it gets for wireless so far (I'm excited about the RS220 coming next year). The range on these is amazing. I have a bunch of wireless devices around the transmitter, two wireless keyboard/mouse adapters, bluetooth, and a wireless router (using both 2.4 and 5 for N). I was able to walk all around my house without these cutting out. I was even able to go outside well into the back yard with only a couple drop outs. I purchased an addition set of HDR 180 to pair with the RS 180 transmitter. It was very easy and now I have two sets working perfectly for those times when I want to watch a movie with another person late at night.A lot of people complain about the location of the buttons on the right headphone, but it took me all but 2 minutes to get used to it. I was walking around the house adjusting the volume without a problem. This issue is a non-issue for me.SO to sum it up, these have excellent range and the best sound quality that I've heard on wireless headphones by far. If you're thinking about purchasing...don't delay. You won't be disappointed. I usually don't write reviews, but these really impressed me.EDIT: These were so good that I purchased another set for the living room. For those who are curious, you can run two transmitters simultaneously without any interference between the two. Also, even with two separate transmitters, I still don't get any interference with my WiFi.

VIve used Amazon for well over 10 years, bought tons of stuff, but never wrote a review.I just had to write a review for these puppies.Quick Review: AWESOME! Just BUY THEM! well worth the price! They just work, and they work AWESOME!They just came in the mail today, and i quickly plugged them in, and put them on the charger... The instructions say to charge them for 16 hours. I couldnt wait.. after an hour on the charger, i had to hear how they sound.AWESOME!I listen to music while I work on the computer, a lot of electronica, so you know how that can bug some people. especially hearing the bump bump bump at 3am. And you need to listen to electronica on the loud side. It keeps the heart rate up, and keeps ya in the zone.  If you are a "vampire coder" like i am, you know what im talking about.Very light weight. Yea..they feel a bit cheap, but hey, they need to make them light, and plastic is pretty darn light, and economical. They are already pretty darn expensive. So I can understand their choice in materials. I dont think they were meant to be used while paint balling, or while you spar MMA style. And they were not meant for your 8 year old overly hyper active, A.D.D. kid.Distance. I have the base transmitter about 3 feet from my head. Its next to my computer. Tons of cables, octopus power outlets and wireless crap nearby.. no troubles. Perfect sound, and apparently my wifi still works.  I walked out to the back yard, and it was perfect sound.I just did a test..it doesnt like SCREEN DOORS.. screen doors, how they are fabricated will kill the signal. Screens are used to control Wifi signals too (google it). So if you are getting some cut out, then look around for screens. Its probably blocking the signal.But going through the garage, i made it 1/2 way down my drive way. 2000 Sq Foot house, built 2000, So Cali. to give you a rough idea.The transmitter is located in the office on the back side of the house.I dont know what that KlearSound technology they use is, but it seems like its transmitting digital signals to the head set, and the head set is decoding and playing them back. So you dont get any fuzzy buzz sounds like those other cheap wireless headsets.. You might get cut out, but no fuzzy. And i think they buffer it too. Sorta like the skip buffer used in Car CD players. But thats just a guess. The quality sure sounds like its doing something like that.Ok..something that immediately caught my attention.. was the ear muff material. Its like a velvety feel. and WARM. If you are a girl who is always cold (arent all girls always cold?) then you will love em.. Im HOT BLOODED (check it and see) , and they feel warm on my head, not hot, but warm. I took a quick search on the net to see if they have that other material (cold plasticy feeling) as a replacement..didnt see em..i will keep looking..And the infamous BUTTONS.. if you read reviews on these guys, everyone crys about the buttons..Yes..i have to agree, they should have put more time in the button design and placement.But if you practice a bit.. you can feel the Volume Up..its big and angled.rub your finger down and you feel the raised plastic of the POWER button.Well the next button is VOLUME down..then you get a flat "spacer", and the next two are Left/Right balance.Although not perfect, quite usable without taking the headsets off. But heck.. i dont do hard labor, so my finger tips are not callused. :)And remember you can still control the volume from your audio source (Computer, Receiver, TV, etc) using its own remote. So no biggy for me.The "Open design".. its odd, you can still sorta hear the outside world. Like right now, i can hear my puppies barking in the back yard. but just barely.If the purpose of the headsets was to COMPLETELY drown out your crying baby, you might want to look at a closed design one. Or duct tape the vents.If you just came back from Best Buy, returning those PIECE of SH***EET Sony 900Mhtz wireless headphones, and wondering if there was anything decent out there, you found em! the rs180's!!!! And they are not just decent..they are AWESOME!If you are STILL on the fence after reading all these awesome reviews, just remember you can return them if they dont meet your majestic standards.Amazons Customer Service has always been Triple A+++ in my experience.The search is over Indiana Jones... you FOUND IT!Ok..need to get back to work..the wife isnt going to be too happy knowing that we are $224 dollars short on the mortgage. j/k :)

VIt could have been other reviews that had me overly anticipate the wave of goodness that I'll hear when I put these headphones on. So I guess I can't say my first impressions were that great.I just didn't find the sound quality THAT great. I'm not saying they're bad, but blow my mind? Wasn't sure. (Note: I've never tried any other wireless headphones before, so nothing to really judge against, sound is purely comparison between other earbuds I've listened to)I noticed a high pitched buzz in the background, not good, so I was wondering what the heck it was. Well after some digging, turns out that the input for the headphones are best if there's more power supplied, so my TV was pushed to 80% of the volume, background noise (because the Auto leveling didn't have to kick in) was gone.And of course then there was the source of the track I'm listening to as well. Youtube and downloaded videos well, just don't really cut it. I put in some lossless classical sound track... okay NOW I'm blown away. Cello pieces were amazingly clear, to the point where I can make out the musicians' slap on the 'fret board' (okay dunno what its called on a Cello) during more dramatic bars. Fantastic.I don't know if these headphones require burn in periods as some earbuds do. I hope they do though, because I'm just liking them more and more.Build quality, I like the lightness of the product, the plastic bits, don't scream 'high quality' but they're not bad. The felt ear cushions feel nice against the skin, don't over heat too bad, and I'm someone who is sensitive to heat.Range, personally within my 2000sqft house, I've had a few places that cut off (my room is top floor corner). Far ends of the house I get cut off, but thats through walls and floors... not bad at all.Overall, I'm really liking these headphones. Price wise, if you get them at a decent price, its totally worth it, I'm not sure MSRP, but that's me.Surprises to me, were that these were open headphones, so noise isolation is not its strong point. Having never had a headphone before (only earbuds) it'll take some adjusting for the weird hair I end up having after long periods of wearing them.

VSennheiser RS, HDR 180: good performance - medicre build and poor ergonomics
p2011
sg5
VThe Sennheiser HDR 180 has been well-received and reviewed and that's why I bought my pair. The overall sound is very good and so I have no complaints about that.  However, though the apparent line-of-sight range will not be a factor for the average home, intervening walls and corners will - so if you wonder behind a couple of walls and/or corners you will lose your sound. If you plan to work in the garage while your RS 180 is in the living room you are not going to be pleased.What I must severely criticize is the dunderheaded ergonomic stupidity evinced by - not the engineers - but stylists and industrial designers. They had to get their fat, untalented little fingers on the cosmetics and general design/appearance of the headphones; it would have been far, far better had the same guys who designed the RS 120 been called upon to design the RS, HDR 180. In a nutshell: all the headset's controls are on the right earpiece - aligned in a row -without hardly any space between buttons. The volume control buttons are separated by a "multifunction" button - all flush one to the other, followed by (with but a slight space) L-R balance buttons. All work as you would want them to, but you have to take the phones off your noggin to look at what button you are activating and then put the phones back on to check the results; it really helps if you have Lilliputian fingers. I have no doubt that with enough practice one will be able to do this with pure feel - but why go through a frustrating, time consuming training process? Also, as is done on the RS 120, why not place some controls on the otherwise barren left earpiece and why not give each button ample space separation and a distinctive shape?There are a total of four LEDs - the important one being the red LED which tells you the base unit is charging. There are two others on the base unit and another on the headset which of course can't see when wearing the headset.  Steady and flashing LEDs, as well as the interval between flashes have different meanings and one has to look these up in the owner's manual - I refuse to commit them to memory. The utility of the foregoing LED messages is extremely limited and borders on the useless - other than for the charging and signal lights.The construction is nicely executed but all plastic; the headband really calls for spring steel but it too is plastic.  Each ear pad is held in place to its respective ear cup by two small plastic ears which have to align perfectly with matching holes. In each cup resides a rechargeable battery. If you drop the headset on a hard floor there is a high probability at least one ear pad will come loose and allow the retained battery to fly away to a no doubt hard-to-access place. How much shock and physical stress those little plastic ears will take remains to be seen. A better, foolproof, choice would have been to use Velcro tape to hold ear cup to ear pad. I may have to do that if the plastic ears break.All-in-all, I am pleased with the performance of the HDR 180 but the build quality and ergonomics are far less than remarkable.

VWere it not for the lag and hissing...
p2017
sg5
VThe Sennheiser RS 180 is Sennheiser's top US wireless headphone setup; and, with what Sennheiser usually delivers, I expected more.The PhonesThe phones are Sennheiser's usual top notch construction: the plastic is solid, the joints are dependable, the velour padding is immensely comfortable, and the weight is acceptable. The operating buttons on the right-hand phone, however, leave much to be desired. The buttons are flat and depress shallowly, leaving for difficult button-pressing. The power button is, oddly, between the volume buttons, leading to some referencing each time volume or power is to be accessed. Furthermore, the volume controls are on the phones exclusively and consist of  holding, not  pressing. Several attempts at discovering the change in level resulted in these findings: pressing the button rapidly results in no change of level while holding the button results in a constant change in level; therefore, to achieve an exact level which is not the highest or lowest, careful half-second-presses are required for meaningful measurement. The battery life of the included AAA rechargable batteries is respectable (16-24 hrs), though the time is diminished as volume increases. Even with the long life, though, the recommended recharge time of 16 hours is unacceptable. Users report that recharging can finish in 8 hours, though reports are mixed. No rechargable device that is conceivable for everyday use should need to charge for longer than an average night's sleep.The TransmitterThe transmitter, too, is top notch in construction: it's light because it's plastic, but it sits firm and looks good on a desk, with unobtrusive LEDs which indicate transmission (about one flicker per 5 seconds in sync with the phones) and a dim charge light which goes out when the phones have finished charging. The audio cable from source to transmitter is a gold-plated, good-feeling mini stereo jack on both ends while the AC has an international, exchangable head design with US, European, and Asian prongs included. While this is probably not intended for travelling convenience, it could prove useful to a select few.The SoundEven with the usual, Sennheiser construction, despite being marred by some thoughtless design choices, the sound that comes out of these has two big problems: lag and hissing. First, while we expect wireless headphones to be slower than wired headphones, users shouldn't be noticing this difference in movies, TV, and games. While this doesn't affect music or other non-visual media, visual use will suffer: expect .1 to .2 second lag even if the transmitter is within inches of the receiving phones. The result is a movie, show, or game that is visually ahead of its audio; expect lips, frenetic action, and aural cues to all be off. While users might grow accustomed to the lag, a price tag like this one shouldn't ask them to. Second, while reviewers here and abroad have raved about the lack of hissing, popping, and static, expect some. If the phones are near their max volume, the speakers will produce unacceptable levels of static to the point of hissing. The source volume affects this less, but silent sources are met with audible static regardless of acceptable source levels. Popping, too, can occur, though not to an excessive degree. Again, despite being wireless, users should receive what was promised for this price tag: inaudible hissing, popping, and static at all but the highest volumes and no noticable lag in audio.Until Sennheiser demonstrates that their wireless solutions can match the performance of their wired ones, I'll be sticking with the Sennheiser HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channeling.

VVery good sound, but terrible usability details make them frustrating
p2023
sg5
VI bought these as an upgrade from some very nice Sony IR wireless headphones that lacked in audio quality and range that were about the same price as these headphones 6 yrs ago when I got them.These headphones are a huge sonic upgrade.  I love the sound quality, I love that it's RF and I can walk into another room.  The stand is fair, the headphones are reasonably comfortable.  There is a lineout on the back of the stand so that these headphones can sit between your source and another device--for me, these are plugged into a computer and I have some cheap speakers downstream.  It's nice not to have to re-cable or adjust things to change the sound output.  Previously I was using a rackmount headphone amp to serve a similar purpose.I also own Sennheiser noise canceling headphones and the top-of-the-line HD 800s.  I really like Sennheiser headphones.However, where these fall hugely short is usability.  First, there's two power buttons, one on the headphones and one on the stand.  This is ridiculous--the Sony headphones these replaced had 0 power buttons.  Lifting the headphones off the stand should turn on both the stand and the headphones.  The user doesn't should have to do both.  The Sony headphones also had an ingenious on/off built into the band of the headphones that would conserve battery life by turning off the headphones when they were not on my head.  I'm sure Sony has patented this but Sennhesier needs to figure out something similar.So when I want to use these headphones, it takes me several attempts at hitting buttons to get things on and going.  It's frustrating and it's distracting.  There is a light on the headphones that flashes when the power is turning on/off, but unlike, say, my Plantronics bluetooth ear bud, it doesn't change colors for on/off, so I never know if I am turning it on or off.  I can't tell from the base either.  The headphones come with a complex grid of LED blink rates and what they all mean, but who has time to sit down with a headphone manual?Great sound and so I keep them, but the usability sucks really bad.  I might try the newer Sony models at some point.

Vno missed dialogue
p2047
sg5
VI ordered these partly to be able to watch TV without disturbing others and partly in the hope of clarifying dialogue, particularly in the genre of dramas in which the characters tend to mumble or whisper in the background. It really delivered. Dialogue is crystal clear, even the background stuff. And the fidelity is stunning -much better than my surround sound speaker system and no noise at all. Unlike my speakers, they are absolutely silent during breaks between scenes. I did not experience any delay between the TV speakers and the headphones as some users have described. I suspect this problem may be more prominent with home theatre systems than with the TV speakers. My only quibble would be the tiny control buttons.Setup was simple, except for a problem that was the fault of my home theatre system, not the headphones. There was no headphone jack on the back of the sound system! Moreover, while the home theatre setup had a setting for HDMI sound to go to the TV (and therefore out using the TV jacks), it automatically switched back to its own speakers and would not allow the HDMI setting to stay locked. After removing the system completely and plugging the headphones into the TV, I discovered a better workaround solution: connect the phones directly to the sound sources: The DVR/cable box and the DVD player. This worked like a charm, permitting the TV to be muted at will and still get sound through the phones. If you have more than one sound source, you will just need a couple of (1 female to 2 male) audio splitters from Radio Shack to plug into both sources. And you will never need a home theatre again!

VPros: Awesome sound (usually), very comfortable, very good battery life, good range, can use standard batteriesCons: Long charging time, charger is a little flakyI've these for just over two years now, and they are pretty much awesome. The sound quality is excellent (particularly with music),the batteries last from 6-10 hours (depending on volume) and they are extremely comfortable - possibly the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. The range is also quite good; I've walked from my second floor apartment to my car in the parking lot with no dropouts.The primary reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars has to do with charging. While the batteries last quite a while, recharging takes forever (according to Sennheiser's site, it takes 16 hours from zero to fully charged). This seems excessive, considering that there are only two AAA batteries. The other charging problem has to do with the base itself.The base seems to be very particular about placement. When placing the headphones on the charger, it seems as though they should just slot in and begin charging; unfortunately, this is not always the case. It is very easy to place the headphones on the base, get the charging light, and then any movement stops the charging. The headphones need to be placed just right. There is also no warning that the batteries are about to die; they simply shut off.Overall, these are very good headphones. The sound quality is great, they are incredibly comfortable, and the charging problems can be defeated by having some AAA batteries arround.

VActually, this is my second set of Sennheiser headphones. I owned a pair for several years now, for my living room TV. My wife only recently tried them on, and I had to get an extra pair for her, despite an important shortcoming. The buttons, are almost impossible to access without removing the headphones and turning the light on in the room.- They are too small, with no space between them. Your tactile senses are futile.- They are the same color as the body of the unit, making them impossible to see in low light conditions.- The balance buttons have proven to be useless after several years of use. They actually add another annoying factor: if you push one of them by mistake while trying to adjust the volume, you're bound to miss a good part of the movie you're watching. You have to turn on the lights, take them off and put them back on several times while you try to find the correct balance setting through trial-and-error. It really sucks!I took off two stars for this. I'll give it five stars when the manufacturer removes the stupid balance buttons, places the volume and power buttons at a reasonable distance from each other, and makes them white or a another bright color, DIFFERENT from the rest of the device, so they can be distinguished in the dark.On the bright side, the headphones reach every corner of my 1,200sf home without static or drops, and the sound quality is great! Kudos for using standard-sized rechargeable batteries, and reasonably easy to replace when the time comes.

VYears back my brother and I picked up some Sennheiser wired around the ear headphones for some home studio work and when I started to look for a good set of wireless those memories brought me to Sennheiser.I bought these to use with music and home theater for when the kids are in bed and the wife does not want to be disturbed.  My main system is a 7.1 with a mix of CerwinVega, Klipsch, Infinity and Advent speakers.  Even my 'normal' pc speakers are Infinity.I tried the RS120s and was dissappointed. The static bump between tracks and when automatically shutting down was unacceptable, even if the sound was acceptable. Plus the on-ear feature was not something I could endure for several hours.When these arrived I was impressed. The sound is good.  When not in use - end of album, film, etc they are silent.  They have just enough pressure to stay on the head without being uncomfortable.A feature not highlighted is these use removable standard AA rechargeable batteries. So if you find that you ran them dry (because you did not set them back on the charger over night) you can swap them out with a fresh pair. I also like this for longevity.  My last pair of cheapies had non-replaceable cells and after a year would start to alert the battery was low after only an hour - then proceed to chirp and work for nearly to more hours - talk about ruing the experience.  (Thanks GE.)I even went for the Amazon Wherehouse deal and had no problems - save a few dollars.

VThese sound great if you plan on simply sitting in a chair or walking around a quiet house. The open back design makes them less desirable in noisier environments. If you plan on trying to use them with your musical instrument, don't bother. There is about a 1/4 of a second delay which makes playing the guitar frustrating. I was hoping to use them at home late at night. I know they were not intended for that purpose, but it is a little irritating that you can connect up to 4 headsets. Seems like that would be a great option. The open back design does allow you to easily here your amplifier if you want to play over a music track. I do that with the drums quite a bit and it works really well.They sound really good and the range is great if you don't have too many walls in the way. I have two sets of headphones that each have independent volumes. They are just loud enough to wipe out most moderate background noise. Battery life is not bad and they are super easy to recharge. The design is cool and they are well made. These are defiantly for the audiophile on a budget, headphones can get REALLY expensive. These sound way better than a lot of more expensive corded headphones I own. If you listen to Rap or music with heavy bass, these might not fit your taste.

VI have the HDR160 set, and while the sound quality is great, using them can be very irritating which is why I am considering the RS180. Unfortunately the RS180 seems to have the same poor design that made me come to dislike my HDR set enough to want to replace them.Instead of using separate led's or color states, the status of the headset is determined by a single green led that seems to flash randomly, if at all. You are expected to memorize a timing chart and then count pulses within the timeframe of a second, and be able to differentiate those between pulses that occur within the span of 5 seconds in order to tell how the headset is operating. Not exactly intuitive.The ritual of having to keep the power pressed on the base station, then doing the same for the set, gets tiresome since the base station does not automatically power on and wait to sync the headset as soon as there is an audio signal. It is happy to turn itself off, though, even though it is connected to wall power. Hold and wait. Hold and wait. Was that long enough? How many blinks was that? Is it syncing? Is that low battery? Is it on mute? The indicator is next to useless.These sets seem designed for an android with a built in chronometer and endless patience. Morse code operators might like them too.

VThese headphones boast exceptional clarity especially for a wireless set.  I have had some very bad wireless sets before - Sennheisers included.  I have the Sennheiser (wired) HD598s and usually have to eq the treble up to help distinguish dialogue.  I do have some hearing loss in the higher frequencies so I was surprised I could understand the dialogue much easier (no eq) with the RS 180s.  I am not sure what that means in the audiophile world (given my hearing loss) but I like them since they do what I am looking for.  The RS 180s have a nice open sound stage and provide solid bass response (slightly more bass response than the 598s but still very tight) making music listening and movie watching enjoyable as well.  They also have noise leveling so the loud passages do not further my hearing loss.  They only get 4 stars because I hate the adjustment buttons.  They should have spread the controls out - perhaps even putting balance controls on the other phone.  I am always hitting the wrong buttons.  Also, these phones are not as comfortable as my HD598s - a little more clamping pressure than I like.PS:  And neither the RS180 or the HD598 play Celine Dion like my old HD540s did!

VAn Honest Review
p2178
sg5
VIts been about 24 hours since I received my Sennheiser 180. FIrst impression is that it looked cheap. Its all plastic which is fine if the plastic was durable but this plastic seems like a good drop would crack them. I feel like I just bought these from a dollar store because thats how the plastic feels like.I am nervous that my kids or wife will break them.After getting over the plastic that makes up all of the 180 the sound is really impressive. I live in a high wifi area and I get no distorted sound. I did buy a couple of wireless headphones before and I heard nothing but click or distorted noise so I am happy with this alone. I also walked all over the house and the volume stayed the same and that is really impressive. They feel comfortable and very light. Only problem is that the headphones can be heard by others. So I wouldnt buy these for plane trips because everyone around you will hear what you are hearing.Overall I think they are charging you too much for what you are getting.I am happy with them but if they break because my kids drop them or they fall off my desk that 230 I spent on them will leave me feeling very unhappy.

VI'm a software developer and I work crazy hours from home.  In order to get into my "groove" while coding, I listen to music, usually too loud.  Recently I moved into a condo downtown and was concerned that my music habits would bother neighbors given my weird hours.These work great, sound great, and are comfortable.  I routinely wear them for 6-12 hours without removing them and they have not bothered me once.  My old set of wired headphones put too much pressure on my head and would start to ache after a few hours.  The spring in these is very gentle, and they cup your ears so they don't put pressure directly on the ear itself.I was planning to buy these at the higher $300+ price, but I paid $211, and as of the time of this writing they have gone down to $209.  I recently bought another set for our television, my son likes to play video games much too loud, and we have 3 headsets for the television, 1 headset for my computer, and two transmitters.  They have a great range within our 1700sf 2 story condo, and don't interfere with each other at all.Our neighbors have commented many times that they thought we were gone while watching a movie.  :-)

VThese were easy to set up, and, they worked great, for 2 weeks. Yesterday, they shut off after 2 or 3 minutes, after many attempts to get them to work again, went to sennheisers web site.  I will admit, they made it easy to send in for repair. Even made out the shipping label for me.  So, they are off for repair, I have no idea how long that will take.UPDATE 1:  Received an Email from Sennheiser service center, the headphones have been received there. Given a repair number. Looks like Sennheiser is working to repair my headphones, will update when I know more.UPDATE 2:  I received my headphones back from Sennheiser yesterday, Nov, 19th. they are working perfectly. One reason it took so long, their repair faculty is in Connecticut, and was shut down for more then a week because of lack of power from "sandy".  I am now happy with my headphones, and give them and Sennheiser a 4.5 star ranking.UPDATE 3:  It is now almost the end of January 2013, and the headphones have been perfect since i received them back in nov.  I would say I am pleased with my purchase.

VI spent two weeks deciding on a new head phone and finally decided on this.My biggest concern is the quality and the potential for interference.I wanted to buy RS 220, but decided against after hearing bad review on interferrence.On the RS 180, interferrence occurs occasionally, but is tolerable in general. Interferrence is worse when I walk next to the micro wave (obviously) or if I am in intense gaming over the wifi, but usually it is not too bad.Quality wise, at first I thought the head phone is aweful because the sound would fade in and out slowly and constantly. (as in becoming loud slightly for a while then becoming quiet slightly, in a periodic fashion). This went away after I bought a DAC to the headphone to. I am surprised that with such an expensive headphone it didn't come with it's own DAC and you needed to actually go but an external one. I got the sound blaster x-fi 5.1 for around 55$.the bottom line is, if you have a good receiver, this head phone works. sounds better than my wired low-end image s4, but does not sound so good that would blow me away.

p2226
sg5
VThis is a great wireless product with excellent sound but it has one really annoying issue.  For some inexplicable reason the manufacturer has decided to have the front on/off green light on the transmitter blink constantly every few seconds while the transmitter is transmitting.  Since the transmitter is located in your peripheral vision while watching TV the blinking light is really distracting.  BTW: Don't expect these to be a substitute for a good surround sound system.  Although the dialogue through the headphones is clearer, you really do lose the surround sound effect.  Also, the batteries that come with the unit take forever to charge.  I tossed them out and replaced them with the ones that are listed as accessories here on Amazon and they work great.*** 19 months after purchase: Watching Transformers DSOTM 3D, action sequence.  All the impact sound effects turned into static.  Put my old wired Sony MDR 7506 on and the static went away and the sound was great.  Tried the wireless phones on regular programming and they seemed to be okay again.  Will test with other source material and repost...

VRS180 worth the upgrade from the RS120
p2231
sg5
VUpgrading from my Sennheiser RS120s. Great to watch TV at night when everyone else goes to bed. My old RS120 was great but a little annoying having to tune the frequency in at times and it would get static if you turned your head wrong.  The RS180 has excellent sound quality when the volume to the TV is set to 0. Because of the slight time delay due to signal processing the sound of a faint dog barking like sound can be heard when the TV sound is able to be heard along with the head phone sound.  To Sennheiser's credit this is noted on their website.  One thing I liked about the RS120 was that you did not have to turn the power on to the headphone stand.  The RS180 requires you to press a button on the base for a second and one on the headset for a second.  On the plus side the RS180 does not hit you with eye popping static when the sound signal on the TV is not present when a movie is paused for a few seconds.  Overall, the upgrade to the RS180 was worth it, the digital sound quality is great.  I daisy chained the old RS120 base off the RS180 base for a second headset for another evening viewer when needed.

VI have a pair of Sennheiser HD 580's that are wired, and I keep tripping over & tearing the wires. I've replaced 3 sets already and to top it off, I sat on them awhile back and broke the headband. It was time to go shopping for a new pair. I researched wireless and chose these due to the KLEER technology, the ratings and the ability to mate up to 4 pair to the base. Another great feature is the audio pass through port, so I don't have to tie up another audio out from my devices. I am hard of hearing and am always struggling to understand TV dialogue, but with these on, vocals are crystal clear and I no longer need to turn on closed captions. These cans are extremely quiet, I have not experienced any background noise at all and am able to roam around the house freely with no drop in sound quality. They play way too loud for me, so I've not turned them up as far as they will go. Sound great with music and have a very natural sound. If you are into OTT bass response, aka BEATS, these are not for you. If you like music the way it SHOULD be heard, then I recommend these.

VHaving had mixed experiences with wireless headphones in the past (including an older set of Sennheisers), I was a little skeptical when I ordered these. However, I am very happy with them. The set-up is dead easy, the sound is terrific, they are comfortable to wear.My only quibble is with the range. I used these first in an office environment with a very open floorplan. I didn't have the chance to test the full '300 range claimed, but I never had any dropouts. I recently brought these home, and the experience is a little different. Our house is a bi-level that is '48 long. The headset transmitted is on the lower level at one end, and the signal doesn't reach reliably to the bedroom on the upper floor at the other end. To be fair, we have two wireless networks as well as cordless phones so it might be an interference issue. But if you are planning to try these for roaming all around a big house you might have problems.But when you are in range, the sound is really terrific, with no hiss or interference. They really do sound like a good set of wired phones.

VWell, I've had to update my earlier, glowing five star review.The headphones worked great for a while, then the audio started dropping out. I contacted Sennheiser, and they quickly responded with an email explaining how to re-associate the headphones and base unit. Their instructions were clear, and I was able to get the phones working properly.Unfortunately, now the headphones and base lose their association every time I use them, usually within the first few minutes. Five minutes into my listening session, the audio drops out, and I have to re-associate again.It's very frustrating, and it's a particular shame because it's otherwise a very good product. The buttons are small as other reviewers have mentioned, but that doesn't bother me. The sound and range are excellent.I still gets LOTS of use and enjoyment out of these headphones. It's just annoying to have to spend 30 seconds to re-pair them every time I use them.

VGreat Headphones with Minor Nit-Pick
p2285
sg5
VI bought this RS 180 headphone set to replace an old RS 140 set that I have had for six years but which are wearing out. The new set is superior in important ways: very nice design, much less interference from WiFi, much greater range, excellent sound quality, and improved Automatic Level Control for better speech intelligibility. I use them for watching TV with my wife so I can adjust the sound level to my liking without disturbing her. The more open ear cup design allows exterior sounds to be heard better (like comments from my wife, phone calls, etc.). My only nit-pick is that there is a delay in the sound arriving at the headphones through the system as compared to the direct air pathway -- others have commented on this as well. The result is an echo-like effect, particularly for sharp sounds (gun shots, clicks, etc.). It is much less noticeable for continuous speech, music, and background sounds. The delay is not so great that lip synch is lost in watching and listening. Despite the nit-pick, I am very pleased with this headphone set.

VI have trouble listening to TV or Movies when sound levels are set to 'normal'. My preferred listening mode is set at above normal. This of course causes audio problems for others. Investigating into wireless sound transmission led me to Sennheiser and their wares and the RS 180 Digital Wireless Headphone System is my answer. The ouput and sound amplification is about as good as can be and the audio-out connections from the source are simple.The quick reference guide booklet is a bit short but all needed info is found on the supplied CD. My receiver is not the latest so I had to wire into the TV Audio Out to the RS 180 Transmitter and its output to my receiver. All necessary wires are supplied and all works perfectly. The reception works all through the house which is all I need. The ear pads do get a little warm but they are comfortable. The controls leave something to be desired, too tiny and I'm sure Sennheiser will address this in later models. For what this system does for me, I would highly recommend the RS 180.

VI have been a Sennheiser fan for years and bought my dad the RS130 but wasn't really impressed with their sound since they sounded like other wireless headphones I have tried which were also not good.  I bought the RS180s for $230 and I'm glad I did.  They sound great!!  I use them in my apartment when I want to listen to my stock shows after work but also want to be getting stuff done like dishes, clothes, that require me to go from room to room.  They really free you up to multitask.  I also like them because my girlfriend can be talking on the phone beside me and I can just pop on these bad boys and watch my shows and sports.  Oddly enough I was watching a basketball game the other day with them and I could hear more background noises (like players cursing) than you can listening to it over speakers.  I have an expensive set of Polk Audio speakers and was kinda surprised at some of the extra stuff I was missing. They are very comfortable and the charger stand is also pretty tight.  I would definitely buy these again.

VExcellent Headphones . . .But
p2315
sg5
VThese are excellent quality headphones with an amazingly faithful sound. They are a joy to use. The big issue I have keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that it is a royal pain to get them to recognize their transmitter each time you turn them on to use them. I constantly get frustrated holding them next to the transmitter and holding the "on" button until, after many attempts, they finally lock on. My several previous pairs of headsets were not Sennheisers and were not of this quality, but the moment you lifted them off of their cradle and put them on, they worked. There was no switch on the headsets that you had to fool with to get them to work. It is a shame that these beautiful headsets are tarnished by being frustrating to turn on and use. Plus the power switch on the headset is poorly placed so that it is not possible to turn them on and off while on your head. Once married with the transmitter, they are great.

I was debating between the Sony MDR-DS6000  and the Seinnheiser RS 180.  the Sony's are sitting pretty at $500 and I know sony's name but decided to go with these for less than half the price.  I don't know what the Sony sounds is like, but these are INCREDIBLE.  I have a 7000 sq ft house and it doesn't really matter where I go as long as there isn't more than 1 wall between me and the receiver I can hear completely crystal clear sound.  As far as style, I like the style of these, they don't look like some of the other "clunky"  Wireless headphones that I looked at.  The ONLY con that I would mention (And I'm not sure it even is a con)  Is the headband itself seems like it could break over time, If your careful with them I think they will be perfectly fine, just don't let a young child use them.  overall I would rate these a 10 out of 10!!  great product for the money.

VWell,I received the product on time...Wow!  the sound on this momma is pure quality! All wireless headphone company wanna bee's should use this product as their BENCHMARK!(in this Genre of Wireless headphones...of course).  Easy installation, although a bit confusing and difficult to connect via receiver/amplifier....but, other than that, the input audio on the RS 180 is a breeze.  I would give it a 5 star...but, the buttons on the headphone is somewhat retarted?....its sooooo small and a little difficult to play with....I wish they made the buttons come out protruding so as to make it more tactile friendly.  The buttons are not spaced in a way, that sometimes you end up pushing the power button.  Nevertheless, This is an awesome product and if one day...Sennheiser decided to re-invent this product(make sure they separate the buttons on the earphone from left to right)....I would definitely buy it again!Your on my A list Sennheiser!  Achtung!!

VSuperb set of cordless digital headphones
p2339
sg5
VSuperb set of cordless digital headphones. Would have been nice to have seen a socket on them so they could be used as regular corded phones if you really wanted to, but that's nitpicking. With decent CD rips or downloads, all you need are a pair of these and your iPod/iPhone to have top-quality audio.Bear in mind these are digital cans so the A->D / D->A conversion causes a slight delay of about 20-50ms. This might annoy you if for example you're using them to listen to the TV while the TV speaker is on loud enough for you to hear it in the background, beause you'll hear a pre-echo from the TV's speaker. They are probably also unsuitable for use in a home recording studio, because for example if you use them to listen to a backing-track while recording your vocals, the delay will put your vocals 50ms out of sync with the backing track.But for the remaining 99.9% of us, these are probably perfection.

VThese wireless headphones are extremely comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. They're well worth the price.I ended up getting two pairs, one for me and one for my spouse. And that's where they lost their fifth star. Two sets of headphones with two base stations doesn't work perfectly all the time. Once in a while, the signals will get confused; suddenly I'll be hearing her base station's signal and she'll be hearing mine. Or sometimes my base station will "take over" and we'll both hear it. Or hers will.Resyncing the headphones to base stations is fairly awkward, too. You have to hold down the power buttons on both, wait a few minutes, and hope it all worked out right. It would be easier if there was a "sync" button or something.Overall, I'm very happy with these. I can live with the occasional glitch for the comfort and quality they offer otherwise. Would buy again.

VQuality Product but Limited Range
p2356
sg5
VMy wife was looking for a better set of wireless headphones to use with audio books as she works around the house.  We purchased these based on the positive reviews and technical information but when they arrived and she started using them the range was quite limited compared to the 320 feet specified in the product description.  I realize the range is dependent upon the area where the transmitter and receiver are used but the signal cuts out at 60 feet from the transmitter when my wife walks with the headphones from our computer room to the back yard of our single family home.These are otherwise a quality product with exceptional construction and clarity of reception; until the signal is lost; but the short transmission distance with no apparent interference in our area is a problem.  Without the range limitation I would give these 5 stars; we are going to keep and use them; just not outside the house.

p2362

VOnly downside are the controls, everything else is fantastic. Sound is unbelievable and the comfort (velours earpads) is perfect for me.Definitely hate the volume buttons but I got used to it by first locating the power (mute) button.Had the RS 120 before but returned them.Considered RS 170 as well but the open design and the better sound of the 180's won me over. Ear cushions much better than on the 170's.180 are an open design and I like to hear when the door rings while watching TV.They do not cancel outside noise at all but on the other hand the sound is much better than the 170's.Overall I consider the RS 180 the best wireless headphones until Sennheiser makes absolutely necessary changes to the control layout.Again, what was Sennheiser thinking when signing of on the controls? Probably nothing, it's a real shame, however, everything else is pretty much greatboth for Music and Movies.

VI'm using this to watch tv with and I'm very pleased with the sound quality. With this pair of headphones I can hear much more, the level of details and focus I'm getting in the tv watching experience is similar to, if not more than the experience of watching movies in a movie theater. I also love the fact that I can walk around the house to get something else done without missing out what's going on in the tv show. I love being able to hear the tv so clearly when watching tv at night.I've tried watching tv for over four hours with this pair of headphones on, and my ears nor head didn't complain. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I wish I could still lie down on the couch while watching tv, I wish there will be a headphone model that has great sound for tv watching while also can let us enjoy the couch, as a full experience.5 stars for the detailed sound.

VVery Good Wireless Headphone
p2386
sg5
VI needed a good wireless headphone for watching TV while exercising on a treadmill.  Bought this based on the reviews in Amazon.  It sounds good but a little bit flat.  I have a 25 year old Koss wired headphone which sounds almost the same.  That one I bought for 25 dollars.  So go figure.  However, this does its job.  My issues with the headphone system are: 1) I cannot make it a wired headphone if I am travelling on an airplane, 2) Does not have bluetooth capability.  For a headphone in this price range these 2 should be a must.In terms of range, etc.  I do not seem to have any issues with loss of signal...  I do agree with other reviewers about the controls, these are terrible locations.  Even after 2 weeks of using them, I cannot "feel" them to use it without taking the headphones off.

VI have been waiting on getting a wireless headset for awhile. This is my second pair of Sennheiser headphones and I am a big fan. These headphones are light, easy to use and work very well. I play starcraft and team fortress video games and love using these headphones. I am constantly walking around the house now with them jammin to music while doing house stuff. Definitely worth the 220$4 months later UPDATE ::::: The quality of the headphones has not changed. My biggest complaint is that I have moved my computer to another room and am no longer using a wired connection. I am using WIFI for my computer now and it is interfering with my headset almost constantly. This is a big deal and something you should be concerned with. I am going to buy a new router that is 5ghz signal so it will not be on the same frequency as my headset. Will update afterwards accordingly.

VThese headphones have partially open exterior porting, so I can hear the phone ring, a doorbell, etc.Being somewhat hearing compromised, particularly with regard to speech recognition, I need speakers close to my ears to get the dialog in TV and movies. The RS 180 allows me to hear the media as well as not acting as tarmac ear protection.I can retire my fully enclosed Pioneer headphones after 45 years. With the fully enclosed style, someone could break in, rip me off and leave without me noticing.If you want to hear a media source without being isolated from your surroundings, and have the $ for the RS 180 or RS 220, I would recommend giving them a try.I took off 1 star because I have not run the headphones through all of the tests that I need to do before being certain. They are a bit pricey for the masses, but getting exactly what I want usually is.

VI love the sound produced by the Sennheiser Rs 180 headphones, but the button placement holds them back from earning 5 stars. They sound great, picking up everything well, from voices to explosions. The bass is also pretty good. There is absolutely none of the hiss that I have experienced with the other two brands of wireless headphones that I have tried out. They are also comfortable to wear, and conveniently docked on the transmitter. Unfortunately, the controls are poorly placed. The buttons are all too small. The power button is ridiculously located between the up volume button and the down volume button. The left/right balance buttons are placed right next to the other buttons, when they should be isolated, as this feature is commonly not used nearly as much as the volume is adjusted. Overall, a very good product with some frustrating and puzzling design features.

VFor the most part, I love these headphones.  The sound is excellent.  They are incredibly comfortable; I've owned a number of high end headphones, and these are the first pair I can wear for hours without any issue.  I also love that you can pair a second set to the same base station for a reasonable price.  My wife and I use them to watch movies after our baby has gone to sleep, and that feature is great.I have one issue with them though, both the base station and the headphones have a power button that is used for three different operations.  This one button is used to turn the power on and off, pair headphones, and switch between sending the signal just to the master set or to all the headsets that are paired.  Similarly the light that should be indicating if they are powered on flashes various morse code signals that tell you what mode it is in.

VBest money ever spent!  love to watch tv after putting the kids to bed and this is a great way to watch.  able to select a volume that suits my needs and they feel comfortable.  we have a pair so we both can listen at the same time, at different sound levels. the batteries last a long time, but it would be nice to have a second charger just incase you forget to charge a pair and you end up with both sets drained.  you could just put in fresh batteries if youre in a jam.  so far I've been able to rotate charging them and haven't had to worry about batteries being dead.  The range is great, they work all over the house and even in the garage while I'm listening and trying to do chores at the same time.  you can even attach a mp3 device to the transmitter and listen to music.  they only negative is that there is no hdmi connection.

There is a delay in signal processing so it will be frustrating to use in a music band setting, however if listening to the radio or CD/mp3,  it is perfect. Watching movies is varied. The delay is minor and seems to depend on the source, however it is not is bad as the old chinese karate / kung fu movies.2 - 3 mins into the movie, you'll forget that the delay was even there.Definitely getting another set and tuning to a different frequency for a second alternate listening source. You can buy extra headphones to allow more than one person to join in.The range is good too. It allows freedom to move all over the house and yard.The open back can give others a clue to what you are listening to.

VPurchased these online looking for a clear sounding  wireless headphone.  Virtually no hissing which has been a problem with wireless headphones in the past, and a full clear sound.  They could use a little bass boost, but overall I'm happy with the sound quality.  Also, was able to add connect a second set, sharing the same transmission, which allows me and my son to watch movies late at night while the rest of the family sleeps.  I have minor complaints about the power buttons on the headphones which is nestled in between the volume up/down.  It's a little difficult to find in the dark until you have the headphones long enough to get used to the power button location.  Also, the power button must be held for 1/2 second to 1 second to turn power off.  Initially this caused us to inadvertently leave the headphones on

The range is great, I have not lost signal anywhere in our house, even on second floor, garage or outside on patio.  I have no experience with Senheiser's other models but the HDR-180 has surpassed my expectations with no noticeable static or other interference sounds.  These are high quality and very comfortable.  My kids have also now begun to use when playing PS4 which is something I didn't consider but is also very nice not to compete with that noise.  I did buy the warranty and like that peace of mind, but seeing the product now? I don't expect I will need it.

VThe headphones are comfortable, the sound quality is great, and the range is great.  Balance control is a nice touch.  The build quality seems to be great.  The base looks like a futuristic gadget, and I like gadgets!As an engineer, I think the process of pairing the headphones to the base could have been designed to be much easier.  I don't really like the fact that I have to manually turn the headphones and the base on after they both go to sleep.  And the buttons on the headphones are pretty much unusable when you're wearing the headphones.  Personally, I control my volume through my A/V receiver anyway since my TV only has digital outputs, and the headphone base only has an analog input.  I think for the price, the unit could have been designed to take digital inputs (coax or optical or both).

VI received these wireless headphones as a gift and like them.  The lower star rating is due to my perception that the frequency response and dynamics of the music were somewhat muffled compared to high quality speakers.  Overall, I like them a lot and their comfort, mobility and quality is excellent.  To serious audiophiles, they may not make the grade, but for the majority of listeners, they'll be a great way to appreciate music while doing other activities.My only recommendations for improvement would be easier to use controls on the ear cups and longer transmitting range, but that may be limited by FCC regulations.  All in all, I would recommend them to anyone who wants a way to enjoy audio content while on the go around the house or workplace.

VAs a wireless headphone, this is the one with the best reception that I ever encountered. No matter what type of wireless technology used. As a high end stereo headphone, it sounds a little "boxy/echoy".The weight of the headphone is good and comfortable to wear. The battery life is amazing, two AAA Eneloop battery is included , last for a long time.Meant to give it only four stars but that might seem unfair because I was comparing to HD650 which cost almost twice the $$, plus this device has some budget has to invest in wireless circuitry.The clean wireless sound beats every one of my BT  or analog/digital. It ranges to every corners in the house no matter how many walls inbetween. Open range is about 40-50 ft.

VIt is a fantastic set and elegant design. It looks good with your decor. Althought is made out of plastic it's sturdy enough to last a long time. It's is not the best sounding option but it depends on the sound source. For everyday late night tv listening is great and the range is more than sufficient; you don't need to be 300 feet away. Stay away from microwave ovens, it will affect it. As far as wi fi interference at least in my home it is not a problem and we have the 90 mbits service so the signal is strong. Although some what pricey in comparison with another set I have that costs half the price and it is 7.1 surround and by far is a better sounding pair. It's the Logitech g930 7.1 surround and you can get it for around $125.00.

I hear things that i do not normally hear.they are absolutely unbelievable once you get used to them its hard to take them off.YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THEM.they sound better then my surround and my surround is not cheap .man let me tell you you are in the movie with theses phones..

p2528

VThe two main reasons I purchased  these phones were for sound range and because they were Sennheisers. I,ve had sennheisers before and was always pleased with the quality. I can walk around the house and on my back deck and still get great sound and no loss of signal and no hiss. I must admit the sale price encouraged me to purchase  a lititle earlier than I expected, but I glad I did. The only reason I gave them a four star is because they were not  bluetooth, which  I did know but was not a big factor but would have been nice. Comfortable  to ware, great battery life, and nice looking. I bought these mainly for music and not for watching TV, not that you can't. I'm pleased and think you will be too.

VRight-left volume balance control good for one-sided hearing impairment.
p2534
sg5
VThe reception is very clear.  There is no sound delay with the picture but I run the phones from the fixed audio output of the Comcast Cable Box.  .I have less acute hearing in the left ear vs. the right so a big advantage of these phones over the other Sennheiser wireless line is the ability to adjust the right-left volume balance to accommodate this problem.  The phone design is open so if you can't mute the TV speakers when using the phones, you will hear that sound as well, which degrades clarity.  It is possible to get around this by physically blocking the vents with a material of your choice.  The closed designed Sennheiser 170s unfortunately do not have right-left volume adjustment.

VThere is a bright blue multi-function LED on the right side of the headphones that flashes to provide information about contact with the base transmitter. Problem is that once the headphones and transmitter are docked and working well the LED flashes every five seconds. It can't be stopped. If you watch TV or videos with room with low light this is IMPOSSIBLY ANNOYING to a person on your right and potentially even to yourself as the LED is so bright that it reflects off walls and is visible all around. This is a ridiculous design error for a $200 headset.Aside from this, and the tiny control buttons on the headphones, these are easy to use and sound is great.

VAll the 5-star ratings for the RS 180 are true. I have been missing so much good sound coming through the digital cable signal.  I have a big phat sound bar that is top of the line, but does not compare to the detail and clarity you get with these headphones.  Worth every penny, the RS 180 lets me listen to my favorite bands as loud as I want without disturbing anyone, or anyone disturbing me for that matter.  My wife likes the volume down low, too low for me, and I have excellent hearing. Now I can hear everything loud and clear.  The distance rating is accurate as well.  I can go outside and still hear everything crystal clear.  What are you waiting for?  Get 'em!

VThis headphone may have saved my marriage.  We can now watch television together with both of us having the volume level to our liking.  My wife uses the television volume; I use the headphones.  They don't block out all external noise so we can still converse.  Yes, they are a bit expensive.  Yes, they are worth it.  Easy to install and easy to move.  The one thing that would make my rating five stars is this:  The buttons on the bottom of the right ear piece are flush with the rest of the case.  This make it very difficult to raise or lower the volume or (my favorite button) to press the mute button.  A small engineering change would make this headphone perfect.

VI discovered I liked these for a different reason than I bought them. My wife and I bought these so one of us could watch tv while the other read, in out apartment. Turns out one can hear what the other is listening to. Still, it's an improvement over no head phones. I have not noticed a lag between actors' lips moving and the sound track of their speech. And I've discovered some shows are enhanced by using headphones. I recently watched Band of Brothers. With the headphones on, the effect of the sound engineering was much more immersive: I could hear incoming mortar shells launching from my right, whistling passing me, then detonating just behind me to the left.

Extremely comfortable even after wearing them for hours. I would truly recommend these to friends and family without hesitation. They are a bit expensive, but once you try them, you will see that they are worth every penny. No interference what-so-ever with router of the same frequency.  Bottom line...great product!  "Rico"

VI can easily wear those for hours without sacrificing any mobility or dealing with heavy wires that get in the way. I also own the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro and noticed no sacrifice in sound quality or bass when listening to Rock or Pop music with 180s so that's all good. My only complaint is a mildly annoying hiss sound that manifests while listening to quiet conversations in movies with intermittent moments of silence in between; instead of complete silence I hear a hiss sound that goes away once the conversation is back on.I highly recommend those for listening to music but proceed with caution if they're supposed to be your movie night headphones.

For me the sound is fantastic and love the way the headset fits,  I got a second pair of  the headset because it allows you to use more than one headset at the same time. I love watching tv at night and now I don't disturb anyone at home.

The sound quality is awesome for wireless headphones and this set is unbelievably comfortable.  I have a few pairs of "cheapies" that destroy my ears after 30 minutes of using them.

I tried different batteries, no dice.  Returned that set for a working pair, and I was very happy with it till it quit working.  Second pair does not charge properly.  I now have to deal with Sennheiser directly to see if they will stand behind their product or not.  I am quite hard of hearing so this is a significant matter in my household.

I also find the adjustment buttons, other than the volume up, are too small and these are used often because of the sound level from ads to and from the programs.

VI wear these while I walk on a treadmill.  It was so noisy I had to turn up the TV and it disturbed my family so I upgraded from the RS120 to this. I like the sound quality better and there is less noise and drop out of sound, however the top of the head band of the RS120 was more comfortable and had more cushion.  There are VERY small buttons to control volume and difficult to locate-extremely user unfriendly.  I would like these if they had the thumb wheel volume control or a more obvious method of changing volume but the clarity of the wireless system makes up for that.  I did not feel it was worth 2x the price of the RS120.

VExcellent sound, comfort and construction.  Enjoyed the first set so much I purchased a second for our winter home.  Only negative comment (and then not so much) is that the on/off button on the headphone can't be located by feel.  So I followed the advice of another Amazon purchaser and epoxied a small plastic dome on it (Find a common pin with a 1/8" plastic ball for a head and grind it down to a hemisphere.  Pull it off the pin and epoxy it to the button.  Rough up the button surface first for good adhesion).  My second set has now survived being cooped up in the house in Arizona 115 degree heat without ill effects.

They are comfortable to wear for long periods and the sound is good. My biggest beef is that the headphones become unpaired every couple of weeks and it is really beyond annoying.  Also the button location and design need improvement as you can change the volume if the headphones rest on a pillow and while the off/on button has a bump to locate it w/o looking there are NO tactile bumps for the up and down volume buttons.

She jogs on the treadmill with it and is fits comfortably on her ears, charges easily and quickly PLUS, it blocks any background noise.  Would highly recommend to buy this one.

The only reason I did not give it five stars was the buttons on the headset are hard to locate and individualy operate unless you take them off. A strong suggestion I would also make to Sennheiser, for people like me who hate commercials, would be a handy mute button. As far as the main issue of sound quality and comfort I am very pleased and would recommend them {with a friendly warning about the buttons}.

It may be due to the wireless network in my house (which others seem to have identified as a source of interference) so I don't know whether to blame Sennheiser or not - in case it's helpful to anyone, I've got an Asus RT-N66u and I'm able to get maybe 20-25 ft of range, through two walls.  This isn't any better than the RS 120 that I previously owned, and in some ways is worse, as the sound cuts out completely when the headphones are out of range (vs. the RS 120's analog signals, which didn't).

VThe sound quality is great.  I replaced the Sennheiser 120's and am very happy with it.  As with other reviews, the range is not going to be 300 ft, but it works well with in my 2 story house.  The only problem I have is when I walk around a center room fireplace or a wall which I know contains pipes.  The metal in the chimney or the pipes will block the reception.  This is a brief interruption as I walk past but noticeable.  That being said, I am still very happy with the headphones.  They are leaps and bounds better than their analog cousins.

p2717

VI expected better for the price. The sound is good, but the volume range is limited. Both upper and lower. The controls could be a lot better. The buttons on the headset are very small and not designed well for by-feel operation, and they can be easily pressed by accident if you want to rest your head on something. The on/off controls for the base unit and headset need to be held for at least one second to work. Why, I don't know. You should be able to just press it and go. I also don't find them to be as comfortable to wear as was represented.

VThese earphones are very good, especially for their price. While they are not cheap, they are an excellent start point for someone looking for good base and sound detail. My only complaint is that the range of the transmitter seems a bit limited. However I do have multiple wireless networked devices in my apartment. There are also six other wireless networks in my building. But in the same large room as my multimedia equipment the RS 180 work flawlessly. These earphones are getting older, but they are still around at great discounts.

VSo far I love these things. They are comfy, and i haven't really had an issue with the volume buttons like everyone else. You know there are 3 buttons so I just know the way left one does one direction of volume. Pretty simpleSometimes takes a few seconds to connect, and only experienced an echo situation once, but otherwise the sound has been great. Playing video games with them has been pretty sweet too. Feels like im in the game. Just make sure no one sneaks up behind you, cant hear a thing when you're in these things.

VI have put these phones to good use, such as listening to loud music and movies late at night, without bothering the others sleeping down the hall. The open backs do allow for someone next to you to hear a somewhat muted program and for you to hear conversation nearby. The fidelity is very good, however.  Another drawback, at least for my 75 foot rancher house, is that the range is limited to 50 feet or so, where it cuts out. 300 feet seems like a dream.  Still, it is a high quality product, albeit with less than hoped for utility.

VI like every thing about the headphones except the controls are very difficult to use without removing the headphones to see where the buttons are located.  I've  been using a less expensive devise that need new foam "ear buds" often, and the headphones themselves had to be replaced after just a year or so.  I find it much more practical to spend a little more and have a product that performs better and is made to last a long time.  I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble hearing a TV set at normal volume levels.

I no longer miss any dialogue if the voices are low and the speakers speak quietly. No longer do I have to increase the volume to hear my programs to the point where my wife, who watches a separate TV downstairs,, is disturbed.The Sennheiser Headphones are all I had hoped for, and more.  They have been the answer to all my TV viewing problems.

VI'm pleased and surprised at the quality of this wireless headset. Currently using on my computer with an Asus Xonar ST sound card. I plan to eventually move it to the TV for late night viewing (Will probably purchase a second set). Good range, bass is clean and tight; not overwhelming. Mids are rich with clean highs.Zero hiss which shocked me for a wireless headset. Can't tell the difference vs a wired set in that regard. Overall I'm kind of blown away at the sound quality when you consider this is a wireless headset.

USPS all the way, no drama. 2 headphones and 1 base station costed around AUD$430 including forward shipping cost, a saving of around AUD$150 plus shipping. Great deal and thank you Amazon.The 7 seconds sync when powering up to activate the second headpohne is easy to do and is documented in the user guide.

They do not have quite the level of refinement that my HD600's have but those are much more expensive headphones without the wireless capability. I don't think most people would notice the difference.Even though our house is loaded with devices that use RF, I have no problems with interference in either direction between these phones and my other electronics.

But once it is set there is little reason to be  making adjustments.Never had any battery problems.  Recharge quicklyTransmitter/recharging stand is excellent, looks good and works great.

VThe issues arise in pressing a button on the stand, then pressing a button on the headphones. All the buttons (5 each) on the headphones are to close together an adult finger will press 2 or 3 at a time. You have to take them off to set the sound level and other adjustments put back on and then remove to adjust again. Until you get the sound right.  But once they are set the are good to go unless you accidentally push one of the 5 buttons on the headphone. So design is a one, sound is a 10.

I would have rated them 5-star, but the ear cups are just slightly smaller than my ears. The rim of the ear cup overlaps my ear lobes. I enjoy using them for an hour or so, but after that I have to take them off to let my earlobes rest.

VMost comfortable headphones I've ever worn. Ever! Other headphones get uncomfortable after maybe 30 minutes ... but I can wear these all day.Sound quality is very good.No futzing with Bluetooth -- hooray!I love the Open-Aire thing ... closed-back headphones have always made me feel like my ears were underwater.Not real portable, because the transmitter is so big.

VGreat sound (I can finally understand what they are saying during the loud music in a movie).....It's just like you are in a movie theater and you can go to the kitchen for a snack without missing anything...The reason for only four stars is that they get a little heavy on the top of your head.... Just adjust them a little and your good for another half hour....I would buy these again....

VGlad I selected the 180's.  Open design allows me to hear what's happening, like a phone ringing when I wear them. Balance control allows to to adjust for my weak ear. Sound quality and voice quality is better than expected, which allows me to keep the volume surprisingly low. The controls on the headset are the weakness, as there is no tactile feel to the buttons and require you to take them off to adjust

VMy husband is very hard of hearing.  This is the second pair of the Sennheiser headphones that I've gotten him (try to have them near each tv).  They are pricey but are far superior to the cheaper brands that he's had in the past. I really like them because when he's wearing them then I can listen to the tv at a volume that I can tolerate and not have to have the sound so loud it blows my hair back!

VGood sound, BUT major issues
p3243
sg5
VI've had these for a month or more. The have a beautifully comfortable fit, a high quality sound that reaches out to the end of my yard and everywhere in my house. BUT here are the things that would prevent me from buying them again or from recommending them: 1) The settup is different from other wireless headphones I've purchased. This would be OK if the instructions were clear about this. But I didn't find them so. 2) The size of the buttons and their labeling are so small that anyone over 40 will have serious issues about using them. 3) When I use the earphones to watch TV while my wife is using the regular TV speakers I get both sounds but at slightly different moments in time. This makes it impossible for me to use them in this way. Since I have hearing issues and is why I buy earphones, I really can't use them for one purpose that is very important to me. 4) Every time you take the earphones from the charging cradle you have to synch the earphones to the cradle. This is an annoyance. The Sony MDR-RF925R wireless earphones which I bought from Radio Shack several years ago for $99 have none of these issues and I will probably go back to using them instead of these $199 earphones.Also, the signal seems to interfere with my wireless home network system if I don't have them placed properly.Finally, even though I let them charge for a week before using them, I only got 1.5 hours the first time I used them. They are getting better as I let them fully discharge and then charge up again each time. NOTE: I hve been charging and allowing the phones to completely discharge for a week now and I'm getting 8-10 hours listening time. I'm still far from the 24 hours they claim however.The sound is great, as is the range.

VSounds as good as a decent wired headphone which is saying a lot for wireless. Excellent bass, without being overdone and stupid. Plenty of mid and upper range detail. Full bodied soundstage. The range is awesome, allowing me to roam 100' away with no perceptible loss of quality or volume. Try that with your $30 blew-teeth 'phone! Sennheiser quality hardware + Kleer tech = kickass product. Of course, it isn't cheap, but well worth every centavo. Pairs up easily, unlike blue-teeth junk that drops out and causes baldness due to ripping your gd hair out, and having feelings of wanting to punch the liars who told you how great blew-teeth was. RS 180 is extremely comfy and soft. I can wear it for 2 hours without ears getting too warm, plenty for a music binge or a movie. Then, take them off for a few minutes, let your ears air-out, and your good to go for another 2 hours. The open-back design helps with this. I love cranking Godzilla volume up to hear every menacing, scary shriek of the monsters, every primal-scream of the T-Rex in Jurassic Park, without having the police break down my door and tase me for disturbing the peace. And no, I'm not destroying my eardums, you can easily modulate the RS 180 to provide crystal-clear details of movie dialogue, or streaming audio, without causing your ear canals to run red with blood. Step up and pay the money, this product is an investment and will give you years of quality service, if your personal audio needs warrant it. Build quality is great, without using metal that would increase weight on your melon.

VThe unit didn't work and there was no technical support available from Amazon or Sennheiser.The Sennheiser web site wanted all questions Emailed to them. There was no phone number displayed.This fact was confirmed by the Amazon Support lady who tried to help meWhen you're trying to get a unit set up or trouble shoot it Email is not the answer.I would suggest that Amazon review their Policy with regard to Sennheiser Sales and Support Services

VBest thing since I installed my HDTV. I can hear sounds very clearly even though I have a sound bar attached to the TV. Only drawback is trying to use the volume controls on the earpiece. Could be slightly larger. Otherwise a good piece of equipment.

VI didn't really know anything about these headphones. There are very few wireless on line to choose from. They are just wonderful. I wish I could afford to buy a couple of more right now. They are worth every dollar. I will buy more in the future,

VAwesome sound, really rockin' bass, and keeps my wife happy because she can hear her music in the same room Only reason it wasn't 5 stars is that the commercial volume control doesn't work consistently. I find I have to adjust it once in a while.

VWrote a review for the additional pair I bought of these, Love them overall, pairing could be slightly more user friendly perhaps with an additional button on the base just for simplicity when its dark and you just put some children down to bed.

VMy only criticism is that of my own lack of cleverness in being so non-techno savvy.  Sennheiser has doubtless covered the one question of "how to" that I have.  All I need to do is put the instruction cd in to play and solve my problem!

VWhat a GIANT waste of money

VWhat a GIANT waste of money !!!I'm an owner of RS 120 and RS 220 and now I've decided to get RS 180 for my house.  After receiving them I was stunned as how cheaply these headphones are made. Plastic band which goes over the head is flimsier than $20 headphones you can buy at Target. Plastic components of the head band are not screwed or glued together, they are just holding to each other with small plastic notches which immediately snapped as i as putting headphones on.Comparing to RS 130 and RS 220, for some reason ear caps do not go completely over the ear, they are little smaller which makes these headphones on ear. Sound has decent bass but dull compared to RS 220, definitely is missing thigh and mid frequencies.I'll be returning this junk shortly, originally these headphones are $300+ but I got them on sale for $199, well to tell you the truth, they don't worth than $50 to me. I would rather spend extra 100$ and get another pair of RS 220 than use these headphones. It's a shame how Sennheiser could produce such a lame product
