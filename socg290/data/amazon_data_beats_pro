VI had a good listen comparing these to the original Beats. In the end, I must agree with the many others who've tried these, they are MUCH better than the beats. Bass is still predominant, but highs and especially mids are much better represented. I think it's due to the lack of noise canceling, but these are much more lively than the original BeatsAt 400$, you're really not paying for sound as much as durability. These are ROCK SOLID, the entire thing is really mostly metal, except the parts with the cushions. I must stress that there are much better offerings from Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, Ultrasone (google them if you've never heard of them) IN TERMS OF SOUND. But if sound is not as important for you as durability, such that you're not an audiophile but just an average listener. I promise you these will last. Let me say again, ROCK SOLID.My biggest warning for everyone who is reading this is the comfort factor. Unlike what you've been hearing from others from youtube (there are so many unboxing videos on these already), these are not necessarily comfortable. Let me explain why. Unlike the original Beats and other around ear headphones, these are ON EAR headphones. Usually, ON EAR headphones are built so they can swivel to how much you ears "stick out" if you know what I mean. Like how much you ears wedge out. A well known example of a comfortable ON EAR headphones would be Bose QC3, and they do swivel. NOTE THAT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BEATS PRO ARE ABLE TO SPIN, WHICH DON'T HELP COMFORT IN ANY WAY. Since these headphones don't swivel, they hurt, and HURT ALOT, for me at least. If you still don't understand me, just imagine the fact that these headphones will flatten an elf's ears towards its head when worn. do you think the elf would be in pain?I can't listen to these for more than one song, because they hurt so much for me. This is why I didn't give a more detail description of the sound. I would really suggest people interested and potential buyers of these headphones to TRY THEM ON AT BEST BUY. Trust me, it does no harm to take a look at the Best Buy nearest to you. But it's better than getting them and regretting, which almost happened to me.EDIT JULY 28, 2011: I was around best buy again and a test model was available, so I tried them on again. It appears that the clamping problems has been resolved by Monster. I did not feel the pressure around my ears anymore. Nonetheless, durability is top notch which is perfect for full sized portability but for sound and cheaper options for BASS I would suggest other headphones. For instance, look up the Sony XB-700 which I also reviewed.Sony MDR-XB700 50mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass Headphones

VIf they had spent as much effort in creating a quality product with sound to match their packaging, then these would be killer headphones. But, as it turns out, the sound is mediocre. It is bass-heavy without the mid-tones or higher tones popping out in the mix.These head-phones are over-priced for what they deliver.I am disappointed.

VThe Red Paint Over Metal Chips Easily
p19
sg5
VI don't manhandle my headphones, yet the paint chips in tiny spots. Mind you, paint does not adhere well to the metal they painted over which is why the paint chips so easily.I own the Solo HD's, Studios, and now the Pros, so I am no stranger to Beats. The Pros are comfortable. I don't understand why people constantly complain of discomfort, maybe they need to invest in a smaller head lol.Overall, the audio sounds great & they are comfortable. My only complaint is the paint chipping even in the least bit. I'd rate these 5 stars if the paint didn't chip.To ensure you receive a genuine pair of BeatsPros, order directly from Amazon and make sure it's packaged by Amazon. Avoid third party stores. Amazon IS a legitimate seller on the Beats By Dre website in case anyone is wondering.

VWhile these look cool, they fit really bad and the audio is not that good for the price.They fit on your ears,  not over them and they press pretty hard so are not at all comfortable.I've done direct listening tests compared to the following other headphones. The first 2 are in the same price range and the third one cost more:Ultrasone PRO 900 S-Logic Surround Sound Professional Headphones - BlackDenon AH-D5000 Reference HeadphonesDenon AH-D7000 Ultra Reference Over-Ear Headphones (Black)All of these are *definitely* a lot better than the Beats Pros.  They are also like 10 times more comfortable.The Beats Pro look cool but really are only equivalent to $150 headphones.

VThese Beat Pros Will Not Disappoint! ( Long Review )
p43
sg5
VThese headphones are by far the best i've ever had, and I've tried and bought many.I have the Bose Qc15's and I have to say, if you don't mind not having noise canceling, these beat pros blow them out of the water. Not saying that the beats don't have any noise isolation!At half volume, you won't hear a thing outside of these headphones unless someones screaming or something! I've also worn these on airplanes with an airline adapter that I picked up at the stores, and they literally block out most of the cabin noise.The bass is just unbelievable. I play some of my Dubstep, House, Techno, Hip-Hop, Ambient, Classical, and even Vocal songs on these headphones, and I can tell you right now, they sound fantastic.I can turn up the volume to the maximum and The bass is still there! No more ugly distortions and loss of sound. And the best thing is, the bass never overpowers everything else.The highs on these headphones are unreal, and very defined, as well as the mids. No complaint for sound quality, as I believe that these headphones offer the BEST for what they're worth.Despite what other people say about the comfort of these headphones, these feel absolutely fine on me. I've worn them for hours-on-end, and never experienced any discomfort whatsoever, but if you're looking for the best comfort has to offer, chose the Qc15's.These headphones are extremely durable, as they are made out of very smooth feeling aluminum. They feel solid, and I myself have dropped them once or twice, surprised to see that they're still in mint condition.I cannot emphasize more that these headphones are VERY VERY durable. Once you've felt them, you'll know what I mean!Unlike the Studio beats that are reported to break or snap, these headphones are like a five star hotel, there are very little complaints, except for those posh critics :PNow onto the style of these bad boys.Basically everyone knows and respects the "Beat" brand of headphones, and anyone will recognize you're wearing them instantly.They look and feel amazing, starting with the flushness of the joints. Every metal piece joins perfectly, and there are no awkward jagged edges or un-fitting pieces anywhere, unlike the pros predecessor, the studios.The red beats logo on the ear cups are beautiful to look at, and you'll find yourself staring at yourself in the mirror with your headphones on thinking, "What a beast ;)"The cable that comes with the headphones is very thick, so it NEVER gets tangled, and protected very well, so you won't find yourself replacing the cord anytime soon! ( Soon being 8 years! )The "springy" part of the cable also comes in handy so many times, because accept it or not, everyone yanks out the cord once in a while by mistake, and this spring prevents anything from going "SNAP!"I would recommend using these headphones on a laptop since they use a fair amount of energy to work, but if you have an iPhone 4 or iPod touch, they work fantastically!Which is another great feature of these headphones... NO BATTERIES! So no more having to spend that 5 dollars on batteries every week. It's basically saving you money in the long run if you decide for these headphones over the StudiosThe sound leakage is near to none since these headphones cover up and mould to your ears fully. I did a test with my brother last night, and I told him to put the volume up to half. I couldn't hear anything but some little noises in the background.I then tried the headphones on at half volume, and the music was BOOMING!Overall, i'm very impressed with these. They are amazing headphones no matter how you look at them.I've travelled to America, and Dubai with these things, and I can tell you now, they perform very well while going places.You'll find yourself using the alternate audio input jacks a lot, or at least I do, since i'm always changing seats, positions, and the pocket which my phone is in!If you want a well-rounded, stylish, amazing sounding, and durable headphone, then really, this is the right choice. Even for you people who aren't "Studio" producers, these are amazing for everyday listening and walking around.You aren't just paying for the brand here, you're paying for some serious quality headphones that will blow your mind the second you hear them!Just make sure the songs you play are high quality, because these headphones truly pay attention to detail.I was unsure when I bought these as I saw many reviews encouraging that there are better headphones out there for this price, but for the quality of build and style, equipped with sound quality of these things, I beg to differ...I really hope this review helped all of you people who aren't sure on wether to get these or not, because for the extra 100 dollars up from the Studios, it's worth it, no matter what anyone says.And yes, these sound FAR better than the cheap plastic, poorly built, and lesser sounding Studios, and have much more value for price than any other headphone i've tried out.For those of you who've read this far, Thanx ;DP.S, i'm listening to Alejandro - Skrillex Remix, and my gosh, you have no clue!^To all you Dub-Step techno DJs and *listeners* out there, get these headphones NOW!^

The pro's are nicely made. A little too heavy actually. I used them at the gym and my ears hurt after awhile. Sound quality was alright, around the same quality level as other ~$150 headphones.

VPros:  Extremely sturdy construction.  Thick headband.  Feels well made.  Thick cords.  Sound quality is good.  Able to reproduce deep bass tones without distortion.Cons:  Overall sound quality no better than my 8 year old pair of Bose on ear headphones which cost less than half of the Beats (The new Bose OE2 headphones fall way short of the Beats though).  Highs are present but not crisp...some distortion.  Thick leather headband did make my bald head sweat after prolonged use.  Heavy weight of headphones takes some getting use to.  Gaudy "beats by dr.dre" emblazoned on top of the headband in large print.  Expensive and it doesn't even come with a hard carry case.  Soft pouch provided looks like a shortened Crown Royal bag....but not as nice.

VThe Beats Pro's don't deserve so much criticism
p66
sg5
VI purchased these headphones from amazon over 2 years ago, and they still work and sound like new with minimal damage. I purchased these headphones because I listen to R&B;/ Hip-hop, which is what these headphones are intended for. With this in mind, don't listen to the people who say, "the bass is too overpowering, wah", or, "My Sennheisers sound better". People who write these reviews are the people who buy these headphones and then listen to smooth jazz or something other than it's intended genre. These headphones specialize in performing best to R&B;/ Hip-Hop, and make no claim to perform better than other brands in genres outside of these two, however for the price it should be at least a little more flexible in it's range of performance. Outside of the sound, the physical quality of these headphones is insane, there are no other headphones on the market that are as well put together as these. The frame is made of a low density gun metal, so dropping these headphones will make a dent in the floor rather than the headphones. These headphones are also extremely comfortable; they use a very soft material, (which I am unfamiliar with) for the ear cups and head bridge, however, since the fit of the headphones is so tight, after about an hour of wear, they do begin to squish your ears which can be uncomfortable, but this is not very noticeable when wearing them, normally you will notice this after taking them off. Finally, the fit is fantastic; these headphones are very adjustable so almost any sized head could fit them. Since they fit so well, there is minimal noise leak, which is a huge bonus If you have owned headphones that leak noise before. To sum everything up, these headphones are great and don't deserve all the criticism they receive, my only piece of advice would be to consider the genre of music you listen to before you purchase these.

VNot an audiophile per se, but I really appreciate great sound. So I am willing to pay more if I need to. I bought these over Bose QC15 and Beats Studio and solo after listening and comparing them back and forth at My local Best Buy. I also checked out the Bose AE and OE's as well as  all of the other models in the 100 to 200 range.  Prior to trying them out i person, I also spent a decent amount of time reading reviews here. My original intent was getting the QC15 but avoiding the beats line in general because I hate overwhelming base drowning out the rest of the music. I thoughts the Beats were only for heavy base loversAfter trying all of them out, Beats Pro was my clear winner. When I realized these were $100 more than the other options, I went back and forth to make sure these were worth the price... And they were. The sound I heard was incredible. Everything was so clear with a tight but not overwhelming base. Knowing myself I knew I would regret it if I passed on these just to save 100 bucks.  Plus BB was also offering 40 bucks gift card - so I made the move.I love how theyse headphones sound! These are definitely on the heavier side, but are still quite comfortable on my head. ( I have yet to take them off because they are uncomfortable or feelmtoo tight). Not noise canceling but I can't hear any external noise, which is a plus.  In short, I am more than satisfied  with my purchase.Now I am sure there are cheaper and possibly better sounding headphones out there for the price I paid  - especially for those true audiophiles out there, but I don't really care. These are perfect for me, so I feel no need to look into other options.My advice is to go and actually listen to them before shelling out the cash.  Also be careful about the knockoffs. There are bunch of YouTube videos comparing the fake vs real ones, and I have to say it is very difficult to tell them apart. But I heard they sound just okay, and are extremely uncomfortable on your head. I wonder if bad reviews are from those with the fake ones.Just FYI, there is also Beats Executive coming out soon. These are supposed to be the same price as the Pros.

VAs a DJ and huge music fan, I defend these headphones adamantly. The best part about them for me is that they are so tough.  I've owned my pair for about two years now and have screwed up three cords, which for most headphones means you're SOL.  However, 7 bucks later I have a new cord, and in fact you can use whatever auxiliary cord you want, and on either side.Now, to the sound quality. In my opinion, the Beats Pro's are the best all around headphones for anyone who produces and/or DJ's.  The sound is very balanced, almost like having your EQ set completely flat.  No one eq range dominates over the others, unlike the beats studios which overdrive the bass.  These can handle extremely loud sound output, and yet are very responsive even at very low volumes.  I couldn't be happier with the sound.So, what sells these headphones for me? My pair has been through 120 degree dance floors with dripping humidity, trips in suitcases/backpacks, and have endured being dropped about 800 times, and yet are still trucking along.  The ear pads have lost some vinyl, but other than that the headphones look good as new.  I get compliments on them all the time, and they make me look much more professional as a DJ and producer.  In summary, are these headphones for everyone? Of course not, they're $400.  But, they are certainly right for me.

VPros vs Studios
p81
sg5
VI've owned these and the Studios at one point.compared to the studios, here's how they fare:The good:-Sound clearer, the highs are better-transportation is easy because they fold up-no need for batteries-bass is still clear and loud, almost identical to the studios' bass but not as overpowering-aluminum instead of plastic, so more durable and in my opinion better looking-comes with a better aux cable-fits tight and comfortable over your ears-no noise cancellation but noise isolation, so if you're playing music it still is hard or impossible to hear outside noisesThe bad:-are obviously more expensive-they are heavier, so walking around with them or having them on for a long time can get annoying-doesnt have noise cancelation like the studios, but noise isolation insteadOverall: If you're choosing between the Pros and the Studios, I would make your decision based on these factors:- if the extra money isn't a problem, you're using them for music production or serious music listening, and want a more full, clear sound; go with the Pro's- if you're on a budget or the extra money could be problematic, you plan on walking a lot with them, don't like a little weight on your head, and aren't super hardcore with music but just want a lot of bass without sacrificing very good overall sound, I would go with the studios.Overall, both are equally great, but each seems to be for people with different needs or expectations with their headphone use.

VOK, I'm not a music professional. I love the sound these headphones give. I don't know why other reviewers felt they weren't comfortable, I feel mine are very comfortable and wear them multiple hours. I'm 6'4" 300lbs. I'm big and they are very comfortable. On to the bad. The included travel case SUCKS!! At a $360-$400 price range this bag is unacceptable. I could make a better one myself. Also the price, is it worth $400. I think maybe. The durability of the aluminum is great.UPDATE: August 2011. The hinge for the right earpiece broke under regular use. The headphones still work, but now they are no longer comfortable on the ears as they don't sit properly on the sides of my head. For $400, this is a ripoff. Do not buy!!!

VExpensive.. but overall I do like them. (Infinite Black color review)
p93
sg5
VFirst off, a bit of background information.I'm a big fan of headphones and audio. I own a number of other headphones that I use regularly:Reloop RHP-10Sennheiser HD595Sony PULSE Wireless 7.1 headphonesSony DRBT50 Stereo Bluetooth HeadsetI've never liked the smaller headphones (particularly the in-ear ones). I purchased the Beats Pro infinite black headphones as an upgrade for my "portable music headphones".NOTE: I purchased these directly from Amazon as full MSRP - these are not a review copy or a possible fake.I've never used Beats before. Devices tested on: Home computer (with "Beats Audio" branding), Surface tablet, Windows phone and iPod (with E6 headphone amp).Right off the bat: The packaging is beautiful. One of those things that looks like it added about 50 bucks to the pricing because it seemed so nice. I'm hoping that's not the case :)Included with the headphones are:* Headphones themselves* Red audio cable (with in-line remote controls)* Black audio cable (no in-line remote)* Carrying bagThe carrying bag is a thin, multilayer bag (soft interior, felt-like exterior) with a pull-string and beats branding. Both the SONY DRBT50 and Reloop headphones had a similar bag, but this one is definitely nicer (the sony one flaked apart after a year, the Reloop one works but just isn't "nice". I definitely would have preferred a hard-case, but this one is nice.The headphone cables (NOTE: The headphone cable is not attached -- it's a double-ended cable which is nice. My big concern with most headphones are usually the cable.. ones like the Sennheisers include a non-removable (and non-replaceable) cable). The BEATS PRO Infinite Black headphones are replaceable AND can be used on either side (meaning you can plug it into the jack on the left earpiece or right earpiece). Each cable include a straight-plug on one end and an L shaped one on the other. The black cable is very thick  and seems high-end. It's gold plated on both ends and has a larger (1/4"?) adapter with a strap on the cable. This is nice as it's default to a 3.5mm jack and has the attachment connected via a cable/strap.. with my Sennheisers, you needed a separate piece (to downconvert the 1/4" jack to 3.5mm instead of the opposite).The black cable used a screw-lock whereas the red is a standard plug-in connection (screw-lock would be great for DJs to avoid unplugging headphones by accident). The black cable also has about 6" of coiled cable on one end.The red cable works.. unfortunately the built in controls (play/pause/vol+ and vol-) are designed for ipod/iphones.. didn't work for my uses for the most part (mostly using it with a computer). I didn't see mention  that it was ipod only before buying. The black cable is also nice for keeping the heapdhones somewhat normal looking (opposed to a bright red cable)Headphone look: This was actually important for me. There are better headphones, but most are kind of ugly. I love my sennheisers but they're not nice looking by any means (and they look better than most). A lot of the high-end headphones look like air traffic controller headsets. On the other hand, I wasn't feeling the bright white and red combo of most beats. I wanted something nice looking but not too flashy. The Infinite Black model is just that. It's a nice mix of flat black, shiny black and metal/silver. Unfortunately, beats charges 50 bucks more for the Infinite Black color compared to the other colors. I didn't care for the big "beats by dr. dre" on the top of the headphones, but it's not bad. I think some people do buy these to show off that they're "beats"Quality: Quality actually seems really high. I love my sennheisers and Sony's but feel that if I dropped them, they'd break off an earpiece or snap. The Beats Pro's are all metal and feel sturdy.Comfort: And here's a big downfall. The Sennheiser's are incredible.. they float over your ears, you can lay on the couch with them, you can fall asleep in them. Best headphones I ever wore. The Sony's and Reloop's are fine for a few hours but you definitely feel them (and after 5-6 hours you regret wearing them). The Beats Pro's hurt form the minute you put them on. I'm guessing this is due to all the metal and it wanting to remain tight and not stretch out.Audio quality: So here's the most important part. How do these sound?I was kind of disappointed in them.. For the price, I expected to be blown away. Unfortunately I wasn't. I listen to a lot of bass-heavy music and wanted the "super bass" I kept hearing about. I was actually kind of disappointed by the amount of bass until I put the sennheisers back on and could barely hear or "feel" the bass in comparison). the PRO line apparently has less bass than the other Beats headphones, but it is supposedly more accurate to the original sound.Music was actually pretty good. Not "WOW, Thats amazing!" good, but it was good. The biggest issue is having GOOD quality music.. any old MP3s will sound pretty bad, but high-quality ones will sound nice. Often letting you hear stuff you didn't notice on other headphones.In the end, I'll keep it. I'm not perfectly happy with them for the price (include 50 buck markup for black), but they sound good, they look good, and seem like they're built to last.

VThe Beats by Dre Pros are the next level up from Studios and it is very evident in both price and construction quality. The Pros are about $200 more than the new Studios, and close to $300 over the first-gen Studios. While all three do a good job at blocking out ambient noise, the Studios are the only one that employs active noise-cancelling technology. With the Pros, the construction and padding provide very similar noise reduction while improving the quality of sound, plus you don't need batteries. The rationale for this is that the technology in noise-cancelling headphones result in slight to moderate decrease in clarity since it cancels the lower-frequency portions of noise, which results in reduced audio quality and an audible high-frequency hiss (doesn't bother everyone).The Pros utilize and steel and aluminum construction which is infinitely better than the plastic used in other Beats by Dre headphones. This might not seem like a big deal if you're careful with your possessions but I've had countless people tell me that they broke their Solos or Studios due to the plastic construction.The overall sound is okay. If you haven't experienced other headphones brands like Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, or AKG then you might want to read some reviews or try to find an audio store to audition them as their sound stage is way more accurate and they have a variety of models at different price points. However, if you mainly listen to digital files acquired from iTunes or Amazon and prefer hip hop, pop, or heavy bass then I would opt for these over the Beats Studios.Personally, for this price you could get Sennheiser HD-650s, Beyerdynamic DT-880 Premiums, or AKG Q701s, which I would have no hesitation opting for over the Pros. None of the above have noise-isolation so if you're looking for an alternative that provides great noise-isolation for significantly less then check out the Audio-Technica ATH-A900x Closed-Back model.

VI did not buy these brand new. I got them for $200 refurbished from monsters website but when they came in I couldn't tell and they looked brand spanking new. I compared them to a friend who just got his brand new and there was NO difference. I also own a pair of refurbished studios ($120) and Sennheiser 595hd and the Pros have jumped up to my favorite headphones for listening to music. The music I mostly listen to is hip hop, dubstep, drum and bass. I also listen to Rock and R and B quite a bit, all differnt years from the 70's to today.The pros have the best overall sound from heavy hitting bass (not over the top drowning bass), great highs and the mids especially when listening to a vocalist like Mariah and Whitney.  I always thought Studio beats were fine with hip hop but lacked mids and highs and sounded sloppy all around where as the pros are tight all over.  The Sennheisers were great for mids and highs but the bass is full sound but doesn't hit hard. When I listen on my computer I connect my headphones to a Fios7 amp and that adds to the better sound.As for comfort level, hands down the Sennheisers were better, studios then the pros. Pros are still comfortable and I don't have that clamping issue people talk about but there is still pressure to the ear that the other phones don't do.  Senns I can wear for hours and not even tell they are on, so I'll use those for movie watching or watching tv on my computer.  When using my Android phone, I'll switch between studios and pros but prefer studios smaller size and weight for better portability.A gripe I had with studios were the cord. The cord was crap and went through 2 sets of them already within a year.  The Pros cord is top notch, it doesn't tangle and is well made.  I also like the locking feature to the headphones. Quality build hands down goes to the Pros.  Barely any plastic and I believe these will last me 10+ years no problem. Plus no battery replacement you have to worry about like you do with the Studios.Are they worth $400 brand new? To me, no. I honestly don't think any of the beats line is worth any of their listed price.  But for $200 they beat out any headphones that come within $100 of that price. What's even better is that I have been getting lost in listening to music again. I haven't been able to do that for years and listening to my old music is like listening to it again for the first time.

VBadass Headphones!!! Built and design for what they were designed to do. Great for DJ's. Excellent sound quality for techno and hip hop. I was also surprise of how rock music sounded, $#*%in great! I also could hear all the instruments in classical music very clearly. Get these headphones if you have the money!! Also the comfort might not suit all people, I guess others are saying its a little too heavy but I find it just great you would just have to get use to them. I'll rather have these aluminum headphones then those plastic Studios that I know will break in 4 months.

VI was psyched about these coming out. First they sound amazing. I have had the studios and honestly I think the studios do better with bass lows. But when it comes to hard hits these babys win. Second they look awesome. I love the silver aluminum. Now to the down side. They are kinda of uncomfortable. I constantly have to readjusted my headphones. They do leave your ears soar. My theory is though you'll get used to them. Just like a tattoo or piercing. For style and good bass hits go with these cans else if you are planning on long extended periods of time of listening go with the studios.

VIf you wanna blow your money to look cool, this is one way to do it. These headphones are insanely overpriced. Though they sound decent (considering you dropped that kinda money, they better sound good), they rely more on their marketing campaign and celebrity endorsers to beat out the competition by yelling louder than everyone else. I can list for you at least five pairs of professional quality headphones that are used in professional recording studios that cost half to a quarter of the cost of these.If you're buying these headphones, you aren't buying $400 worth of sound quality, you're buying $400 worth of social acceptance.

For me, it's very comfortable. Maybe because I'm Asian, kinda petite.My point is don't make the decision just by reading reviews. You got to try it yourself.

If all you're after is bass, and don't want any clarity, just buy a $50 pair of Skull Candy earbuds and call it a day. If you want to buy a good pair of headphones, I highly suggest you look elsewhere.

p164

VThis is really my first review of anything, and I must say I'm glad it's about these awesome pair of headphones. Not gonna lie, you get A LOT of looks when you wear these around. The sound quality is Amazing, probably the best out there right now. Nothing is overpowered, all the frequencies are equally balanced. Even though they aren't sound canceling, once they are on your ears AND playing music, you won't hear a thing on the outside. Surprisingly the sound leakage wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was still able to blast some music at a very descent level while people around me couldn't hear a thing. (Yes I tested this out plenty of times).When I first started wearing these headphones they were slightly uncomfortable, but after a week, they got a lot more comfortable as I continued using them. I've gone 6+ hours straight wearing these now without a problem. Now $400 is a lot of money for a pair of headphones, I just got lucky and decided to use some Christmas money. Also since I'm in college, I use these headphones A LOT more than the regular Joe. One feature I love is the rotating ear cup! Any time someone goes up to talk to me, I simply just flip whichever side they are standing on. Whether it's studying, to even getting in the zone before a race (track meets), and especially during those long road trips, I couldn't have gotten a better pair of headphones. I have used them for just about everything, music, movies, and even listening to lectures. I have yet to use them during flights, but I'm sure they'll do their job just fine.So basically, if you've got the money, love music, and listen more than the average person, BUY THEM!

VBeats Pro: Great quality construction, materials and sound, but with a VERY hefty pricetag
p176
sg5
VThis is another sort -of comparison review between my Vertex headphones and the Beats Pro. I love my Vertex headphones more than any headphone I ever owned because they were super comfortable, had gorgeous range in sound and didn't break the bank. I loved them so much, I had 2 pair. Bluntly put, the Vertex were such a bargain at $60, you would be a fool to spend more simply to get a 'popular brand of the moment'.Then came my new iphone 5c. I could no longer use the Vertex headphones due to the new jack on the iphone 5c not accommodating a triple click plug as in my iphone 4s, but a double click plug instead. So, I was relegated to using a crappy pair of Sonys that were given to me as a gift years ago as that had the proper plug. I looked for an adapter plug to no avail, so I was stuck with my lousy Sonys as a temporary solution until my Beats Pro, which I found through a wholesaler, arrived in the mail.I just received my Beats Pro headphones 3 days ago and I can say that they are an excellent sounding headphone with all the richness of highs and lows of sound I was accustomed to in the Vertex headphones, and then some. Certain songs do shine a bit more based on how they were recorded. The layering of sound is more evident in those certain tracks and for that reason the Beats are superior, but as an occurrence like that is rare, it only gives the Beats a slight advantage in the sound department.But then, there's the way the Beats are made. Nowhere are you going to readily find such a well constructed product. The metal and leather are top notch and the attention to detail is excellent, as is the range of adjustability for a proper fit. Those who have complained that they can't find a comfortable selection for ear fit clearly haven't tried hard enough. Within seconds I was able to encapsulate my ears in sound comfortably within the soft, generously padded leather cushions. (I found that tucking the top of the ear into the cushion a bit while allowing the bottom to rest on the ear lobe was the best bet.)I obviously am enjoying these Beats Pro headphones immensely, but I can't bring myself to go all the way for the 5th star. Why? Well, because they are just not as good a value as they could be. Oh sure, it could be argued that they are the best constructed headphones at an electronic store, and that is true, but electronic stores don't tend to carry the range of professional headphones that a professional music store would. Against those other choices, many of which are constructed equally well, the Beats are simply overpriced. They are a $200 headphone at best when compared against other true studio variants, and they are not worth the $450 Dr Dre expects you to pay just because he endorses them. My feeling is that the Beats should exceed more consistently in sound in order to warrant their hefty price.I can say that I am grateful to have been able to acquire the Beats pro at a wholesale price, as other Beats models costing less at retail are far short of every mark and are way overpriced to a degree much more pronounced than the Beats Pro. I listened to one Beats model that was as lousy as my $60 Sonys and had a pricetag of $180. Adding insult to injury, that Beats model felt cheaply constructed and like it would not last long before falling apart. Doesn't matter how good something looks if it doesn't have the quality to back it up. The Yugo GV looked a lot like a Volkswagen Rabbit, but how many Yugos survived past the warranty period versus the Rabbit? How many even made to THOUGH the warranty period?Bottom line: If you are a true studio dweller or consider yourself an audiophile, the Beats Pro are a good choice, but there are others equally as good or much better for the price if you shop at an actual music store (NOT the average electronics store). If you're just an average listener, you'll enjoy the Beats Pro in every area except how much cash you have to plunk down to acquire them. No matter how tempting it may be, steer clear of other less expensive current models of Beats, however, as they are NOT worthy in any way. If you gotta have Beats, this is truly the only model for you.Time will tell if I will remain as pleased as I am overall right now with my Beats Pro, but I can say that I will definitely be paying closer attention to my songs on the journey, and that's really the true mark of a good set of headphones. I say good for Dr. Dre and Monster for creating the Beats Pro as it's a very good way to bring better accessibility of studio quality sound to the masses and it's created a resurgence in the mainstream interest of quality headphone sound that was long overdue.  4.25 stars overall

VI picked up a pair of the Beats Pro headphones as part of a trade from a friend.  Overall, I really like them but I'm glad I didn't have to pay the $400 price tag for them!I'm pretty particular about my music and my speakers.  I don't listen to music that is heavily bass centered, but I do have a wide variety of music tastes - Beethoven to Collective Soul and even the occasional Ambient or Electronica.  These headphones shine - great, clear high and mids even though they are a little heavy on the bass.  A basic equalizer, however, quickly remedies that if it is too much for you.Mostly, I pair these with my HTC One with Beats Audio and Pandora.  The sound quality is excellent and it gives me a few precious moments of uninterrupted peace while working in my particular section of hell (cube farm).  If the volume level is TOO high, others will be able to hear what you are listening to, but at lower volume levels you still get head-filling sound.Physically, these are LARGE.  It isn't a drawback, for me at least.  I'm a big guy and they simply work for me.  It helps to keep people away when I'm working on a project - they look over their cubicle to ask a question and easily see that I'm not wanting to be interrupted.  Heck - they even work at home and keep the wife from bothering me (sometimes)!Others have complained about their heft.  Yes - these are heavy for headphones BUT they are made of metal, not plastic.  That is a GOOD thing in my opinion - they should last a VERY long time.  Initially, they were a tad uncomfortable, but after a couple days of use, the pressure lightened up and they are a joy to wear now.  I can easily go 9 or 10 hours without the heat build-up common to other kinds of headphones.For noise-cancelling these work well.  They aren't 'active' noise cancelling like my Bose headphones, but they do mute external noise.  I will occasionally find myself working in a data center filled with hundreds of servers, fans, switches, etc.  The noise can be pretty intense - about the same volume level as sitting in a particularly loud airplane.  For a couple of hours, not a big deal BUT 8-10 hours it can become very tiring.  I used to rely on my Bose (which do a FANTASTIC job!) for muting the noise, but I often would be crawling under the floor, running cable, slipping in and out of server cages so the Bose would get bumped and knocked around a bit.  I use these now because they should be able to take more abuse and they block 70% of the noise as the Bose without the sound on.  It's a trade-off I'm willing to make.In the end, I think I might have purchased these on my own, but I would have found them on-line or lightly used for $250 because they become a MUCH better deal at that price.

VI consider myself an over-the-ear/on-the-ear headphone connoisseur.  I prefer mostly closed-back headphones with minimal sound leakage.  Among others, I own:- Fanny Wang 3000 Series- Audio Technica ATH-A700- House of Marley Exodus- Beats Studio- Beats Mixr- Sony MDR-XB700For a while, I have wanted to purchase the Beats Pro, but couldn't justify the price tag.  When I went to the local Best Buy or Fry's, I'd try them on and noticed their comfort and seeming durability.  Still couldn't justify it.  This past week, I noticed the price drop about $80 on Amazon, and couldn't hold out any longer.  I purchased the headphones ... and I couldn't be happier.The first thing I noticed when I opened the box, besides the usual nice job Monster does in creating a great unboxing experience, was the quality of materials used.  The quality of the material comprising the headphones leaves me feeling comfortable that they will last for quite some time.  The cord, in addition, is high quality.  Additionally, this is the first of the headphones I have where the cord "locks" into place with the headphones when plugged in - a nice feature to have.Then, I put the headphones on.  Like many over-the-head type headphones, these are almost too small for my exceedingly large head ... but fortunately they fit just right at the most extended setting.  When I turned on the music from my iPhone, I couldn't believe my ears - the experience was incredible.  I really don't think I've heard as many nuances of the music in other headphones.  (For reference today, I tried the Fanny Wang 3000's - which are in the same class, supposedly - and the Wang's sounded good but not great, compared to the Beats Pro.)I purchased these because I will have the opportunity to take a long trip by plane for work (about 24 hours total), and I'm confident I'll enjoy these on the trip.One con to note: the bag they give you with these is quite flimsy.  I don't understand why a semi-rigid case couldn't have been provided.  I'll look for some sort of hard case on my own.Despite this one shortcoming, I still rate these headphones 5 stars, and would HIGHLY recommend them.  If you have a recommendation of another headphone in this category, that I didn't mention, that you think are better, please let me know in the comments!!Jon

VAmazon shipping is fast!  Ordered on Monday and received the headphones on Thursday.The Beats Pro headphones sound great with hip hop, R&B; or any kind of music with bass.  I am just an average music listener and I am not a professional in judging how music should sound, but when I hear something great, I know it's great.I tried them on at Bestbuy and I love how great they sound and how cool they look.  I was thinking about buy the Beats Studio instead of Pro since the Studio is cheaper, lighter and more comfortable on the ears, but the Studio leaks sound a lot, even playing music with low volume.  I need a pair of great looking headphones with heavy bass that don't disturb people who sit next to me at home or in my office when I pump up the heavy bass. I personally like to keep loud music to myself, because many people don't like to listen to 2nd hand music coming out of the headphones.  It's quite annoying to others on the train or a bus.  I have experienced those people who did that to me on the bus and on the train, it is not good.  Beats Pro is pretty good in this area.  I turn up the music to very high and my friends who are sitting next to me can't hear a thing from my Beats Pro.They are well built and durable.  I know the metal frame adds some extra weight to the headphones, but they are more solid than those made from plastics.Ok, they are expensive.  I thought about it for a week and went to Bestbuy twice to try them on before I made my decision, but at the time I made my decision the Pro was only twenty-five dollars more than the Studio here at Amazon and it is seventy-five dollars cheaper than the price at Bestbuy, so of course it's no brainer to go with the Pro at Amazon.The only down side of the Pro is that they make my ears sore after using it for an hour or so.  It may be a matter of time to get used to them or it will take time to have the metal frame broken in and loosen a bit.  With that, I dropped it from 5 stars to 4 stars.If you are interested in buying a pair, just make sure that they are "sold and shipped" by Amazon, there are many sellers or unauthorized retailers out there selling fake ones.  Watch some "fake vs real Beats Pro" videos on Youtube before you make your decision.Thank you for reading and have fun shopping.

This is great listening. As far as comfort, I have not experienced any problems. Great value for the money. One of the best purchases I have made in audio equipment.

VJust want to say I didnt purchase my headphones off of amazon. I bought these headphones 4 years ago, and I was very skeptical. I was and still am a DJ, I mix for a job at weddings, proms, birthdays ect and I was sick and tired of breaking headphones. Ive tried everything, Pioneer, Denon, Sony, and i broke them all. Back then I tried my friends studios and solos and was not impressed. I thought Beats by Dre was just overpriced and mediocre quality. When I saw the Pros and noticed they were all metal, I decided to shell out the outrageous $450 for the headphones. Long story short, after hundreds of DJ gigs, road trips and parties, 4 years later I am wearing them on my head as I write this and they sound phenomenal. They are all dented and "beat" up (pun intended) but they still friggin work perfect.The hinges are fine, the ear pads aren't cracking, the leather headband is in great shape, hell even the original cord still works! If i had to guess these things will probably keep on ticking for another 4 or more years.Even after all this time, the sound quality really is amazing. Better than any of its competitors. Sure, there are cheaper headphones that sound just as good (ex. Zone XD53) but are no where near the build quality. Are these expensive? Yes. But if you work with sound for a  job, this is the way to go. Put it this way, 7 pairs of headphones all about $200 is about $1400. Thats how many I broke before I bought these for a meager $450. Just get these off the bat and save yourself some money DJ's!

VThe product arrived 15 days earlier than expected and was in the shape that it was said to be. There's great sound in this headset; especially if you like electronica, indietronica or anything where the bass has an essential role.

VGreat Pair Of Headphones
p232
sg5
VThe construct good quality is solid-these will stand up to a couple of knocks and tosses on the couch, or on the floor, and they feel very sturdy. The huge padded headband attaches to adjustable brushed aluminum sides, ending with complete-size earcups that rotate upward for storage. Each and every earcup is rounded and padded in a leatherlike materials that is exceptionally cushy, and every single contains an input/output port. The ear cushions can be eliminated for washing.The Beats Pro uses a single red audio-cord cable with a secured connector that locks into spot on the bottom of every earcup and can be swapped to either side of the earcups. The unused port then becomes a second output for hooking up one more set of headphones and "daisy-chaining" the sound from the Pros to the second set of headphones for communal listening. We found daisy-chaining other headphones to the Beats Pro decreased the sound degree really a bit on the Pros themselves, but not to the point of significantly hindering efficiency. Two sound sources in addition to headphones can also be plugged into the Pros-1 into each and every earcup-if, for whatever purpose, the need to have to listen to two songs simultaneously comes up. The possibility for amateur mixing may match someplace in there, but most DJs use mixers with cue channels for this.The cable cord is thick and rubberized with a coiled area, providing some additional extension if you need to be an extra foot, or two, away from your music supply for a second. It does take some conditioning to get the headphones to stretch additional out, without having stopping brief, when you 1st get them out of the box, as the cable is initially coiled extremely tightly.Even with an adjustable headband, the Beats Pro are a tight fit on the ears and can result in some discomfort right after an hour or so of continuous use. It may not be the exact same for every person, but it was a problem for us at the time.There has been concern that some MP3 players can not energy these headphones. Not like the authentic Beats, the Pros are not battery-powered, which indicates the energy consumption involved in powering the large speakers is pretty high. Although the Pros will work just fine with the majority of the players we've utilized-iPod Touch, iPod Classic, Nano, Zune HD, and Inventive Zen: Vision M-the Shuffle wasn't as effective, as it did not output enough energy for the headphones and hampered the audibility.In use, the bass is booming no disappointments there. As we'd count on, the genres that truly shine are electronic (dub, drum and bass), dance, challenging rock, and hip-hop. Robust kick drums and wandering bass lines were usually prominent and delivered a proper thump. The lows are wonderful, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp without having staying tinny.Other genres had been also extremely great for the most part, but neither as stellar, nor inspiring. Percussion and strings, or subgenres consisting of intricate and layered sound, weren't as nicely defined as we would like. It requires some tweaking on the user's aspect (through EQ settings on your player) to get the very best sound for some subtle music kinds.We had the best final results when turning the volume on our player up halfway. Anything higher and the bass tend to overpower the highs and mids, generating the all round sound muddled and messy. There is a reasonable quantity of sound isolation in heavily trafficked environments (the subway, for example). In a quiet workplace setting, nonetheless, the Pros do leak a bit of sound-a frequent complaint about earlier Beats headphones, but there is a definite improvement given that the Studios were introduced.Each and every earcup swivels up inside the headband, which cuts down their size in length, but they do not fold flat, so the travel pouch included was a bit of a disappointment. We would've preferred one thing comparable to the difficult-shell case included with the Beats Studio and Beats Solo.In addition to becoming sold in the two black and white versions, the Beats Pro come with a cleaning cloth (even though the headphones are essentially smudge-proof) and a threaded 1/4-inch gold-plated adapter-tethered to the 1.eight-meter cable to prevent getting lost.Despite the fact that the value is fairly high for the casual consumer, it is steady with how much expert DJs spend for headphones. At the identical time, these headphones possibly won't satisfy the challenging-core audiophiles who demand uncolored, accurate sound. For faithful, correct, organic tone in your headphones, these cans do not supply that kind of precise audio reproduction. What they do supply, nevertheless, is a massive volume of swagger. We see these headphones satisfying aspiring DJs or anyone with a great deal of spare cash who really enjoys blasting the wax out of their ears.Construction (Durability): In contrast to the Beats Studio, the Beats Pro are made for Club DJ use and for that reason are constructed to withstand the kind of abuse a mobile DJ would place them via. The frame of the headphones are made of solid aluminum that in no way bends or flexes. Not like some other headphones I have used, the Beat Pro nevertheless feels sturdy when the earcups are extended or flipped up. This is simply because even the extender piece is created of solid metal. Only time will tell if the electronics hold up but I can say with full certainty that the frames of the Beats Pro is virtually indestructible.Sound: In our overview of the Beats Studio we talked about that they delivered a really crisp sound that emphasized the high end of the music. On the other hand we located that Beats Pro puts extreme emphasis on the low finish of the sound spectrum. When it comes to booming base, the Pros cannot be beat. However the emphasis on the low end implies that on some songs you will discover that the mids and highs get drowned out and dont sound as clear or crisp as they do on the Beats Studios or other DJ headphones. Fortunately snares and kicks come through strong, which is a ought to when beat matching. I was capable to turn my mixer up to the maximum listenable volume with out the Beats Pro showing any indicators of sound degradation. We have heard that some smaller MP3 players are unable to properly power the Pro's, because they do not need batteries, as opposed to the Studios. We tested the Pro's on an iPhone as well as an older iRiver model and in the two circumstances the sound quality was excellent. It is probable that an iPod nano or shuffle could not be able to supply the correct juice to the Pros and as a result the sound high quality could endure.Attributes: The Monster Beats Pros come with a amount of capabilities targeted for the DJs. I was most impressed by the potential to connect the incorporated red patrially-coiled audio cable to either the proper or left side of the headphones. This may possibly sound trivial, but I discovered it quite beneficial since I personally have my Traktor X1 on the left of my turntable and for that reason was in a position to maintain the cord on my proper out of my way. The dual inputs can also be utilized for daisy chaining (you can attach one more set of headphones to the Beats Pro and a good friend can listen to your music) or even listening to two inputs at when (can't feel of any cause why you would want this). Also the inputs have the capacity to lock the audio cord into them so they do not fall out if they get pulled. Lastly, each earcup can be flipped up so that you can listen to the output while you mix in a new track.Comfort: The Beats Pro's solid aluminum building indicates that it weighs considerable far more than other headphones. I identified the Beats Pro to be significantly heavier than my Allen and Heath Xone XD:53 headphones. Also, although the earcups are made of padded leather, I discovered that the tightness of the headphones produced them somewhat uncomfortable following extended listening. DJs with larger heads (my hat size is 7 ) could discover that the Beats Pro squeezes their head as well tight. The round shape of the cups also implies that the headphones rest on your ears instead of above them. This helps isolate sound but ends up creating the Beats Pro less comfy in my opinion. In comparison the Beats Studios have earcups that fit over your head and are light and loose adequate that you forget you are wearing them.Conclusion: The Monster Beats Pro are a excellent selection for a skilled DJ seeking for a sturdy pair of headphones that are built for club use and deliver booming bass. They could also be a great choice for a non-expert user who is primarily interested in style and bass. However, if crisp highs or comfort are your main considerations, then you really should probably look at the Studios or yet another brand. At retail, you might also be able to find a similar sounding headphone at a decrease price, but if you are not on a spending budget and you worth type as nicely as strong building the Beats Pros can't be beat.

p244

VOkay, I've literally bought every type of Beats headphones there are.  From the buds, MixR's, Studios (old version) and New Redesigned.  and finally the Pro's. I am no Audiophile by any means.  I just like to listen to my music that sounds great.  These 400 dollar headphones disappointed me.  I kept trading in my beats for better sound.  Seems like the more I spent the worse they got.  My original Studios I got were probably the best sounding of them all.  Still a little bit bassy.Anyways.  About the Pros.  They sound actually pretty good.  I like the swivel headphones and the sturdiness of the frame.  The ear pads are actually rather small considering how huge the frame is.  They are not overstuffed enough.  Just didn't feel to good on my ears.They are very very heavy.  Unless you plan on sitting down and using them, You can't really do too many activities with them on your head.  They will fall right off with simple left and right head shakes.  I am now looking away from the beats.  I guess I finally have turned away from the "name brand" "popular fad" and decided I want some great sounding headphones.  I'm looking into buying the Sennheiser Momentum's. Heard good things.Very pretty and Flashy,  But not very practical.  There are way better headphones out there for the money.  It took me about 5 pairs of beats to learn.  Thankfully Amazon is great, and let me return everything.  Until I finally made up my mind.

VI have 3 pair of Beats. I have the noise cancelling pair that need charged and the Wireless Beats that need charged. When I am out walking I wear the Wireless ones, but they are not the most comfortable. The Noise Cancelling ones are the most cofortable and sound really great.But when it comes right down to it, the Pros win hands down on sound I listen to these 2-3 hours every night as I am retired and can do what I want. They do cost  quite a bit, but they are not like eating out a few times. These are made to last a lifetime. I have tried different makes and models, but you cannot beat the Beats for sound quality. A lot of these bad reviews ought to have their hearing checked. I grew up with music all throug scholl singing solo's and playing in the band so I know what good music sounds like. Take it from me, if you have the bucks (even if you don't) you will catch up eventually.Just put these on and lie back in your bed and you will be in a different world. Takes a lot for me to write a report so take it from. BUY THEM!!!!!!

VI own the ATH m50s and I traded a friend of mine who owns these for a week. My source is a 1g Ipod touch, with a fiio e6 amp + LOD (Not really necessary but the playback on the ipod sucks.)I listen to a wide variety of music including metal, hip-hop, electronic (dubstep,dnb,trance,etc), rock, jazz, country, and blues. All of my tracks are 256k-320 kbps. These are my impressions:Build/Design/Comfort: These headphones are not going to break. Period. There are no weak points, I've owned many pairs of headphones and I've become apt at knowing where the weak points are. As for comfort, they are good but not great. The metal design makes them very heavy and they clamp quite a bit. The soft ear pads help but these become uncomfortable after extended use.Sound stage/Noise Isolation: I clump these two together because they are related. Closed headphones don't do sound stage very well but isolate well,vice versa for open headphones. These are closed. The isolation is pretty decent and the sound stage is very weak for headphones in general but not bad for closed cans.Bass: Excellent for the casual listener. Very powerful, pretty clean. Still has a little bass bleed but is definitely better than the studios and solos. Bass is clearly the focus of these headphones and they deliver quite a bit. It is mostly midbass, and the powerful bass fades as it extends into sub bass frequencies, which I noticed on many electronic tracks. I don't have audio equipment to measure, but I can tell without a graph these would not be good for tracking/recording because they are not even close to reference.Mids: Slightly recessed in most tracks due to the bass bleed, however, only noticeable if you are paying very close attention.Trebles: Once again, slightly recessed. The highs are much better than the studios and the solos. There is a slight recession, but only noticeable if you are paying very close attention.Sound separation: Good, not great. Highs/mids/lows are easily distinguishable and do not meld together very much, although there is slight meld with bass and the other frequencies.Bottom line: I would not suggest these for professional use because of their bass orientation. These are great for casual listeners who enjoy a lot of bass. However, these headphones are low value. For 400$, an individual can buy much better headphones. There are headphones in the 150-300$ range that perform better than these. That being said, those headphones don't have the coolness factor that these have. It all depends on the person, if the look and coolness of the headphones is very important, I would suggest these. However, if you are looking for performance, they are better options out there, even for bassheads.

VThese headphones were great(The siding is made out of steel, so I attached a Microphone magnetically onto the side).

Sides are Steel, Cups are Aluminum. The only plastic parts are the driver coversCons:EXTREMELY Pricey(Get the Bose Quiet Comfort if you don't care about how you look. Boses look nice, but when you walk around with these, people just STARE)Steel Sides are pretty sharp. I cut myself all the time, until I took some sandpaper and took care of the edges.HEAVY(Will break your neck if worn over an extended period of time. Remember, it's Nearly full metal construction)The tensile strength of the headband crushes your ears.Other: Have not rattled yet, even during Bass testing, remained stable.

VFirst of all these are very very high quality built headphones, thick plush leather, strong dense aluminum.  They are over the ear head phones, and are very snug and comfortable.  I have heard of people saying they hurt, that is a total lie unless you have huge ears but my ears fit perfectly inside the cups.  I would buy these again and again. They are the best Dre headphones out there.  They were $[...] with shipping, but I guess I have them now, lol.  They were very expensive to what I really think they should be sold for but they are worth it if the Studios are $[...].  These are total show stoppers and have a very clean sound.  I have used but not purchased ones over $1000 but they were for more of a recording purpose type of headphone.  These are truly a great product but think they will require alot of juice to run off of an iPod.  Again these fit well on normal size ears.

VThey're really heavy, uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, and not remotely worth the price.  I wanted to like them, I really did.  They are their own fashion statement.  The construction is rock solid.  Fabulous, clean, endless bass that can really wow you on a first listen.  Highs are decent, mid-range is a little muddy but respectable.  And that's a great headphone formula... if you're are willing to look past some skull soreness and a weary neck.  I've owned a lot of different styles and ranges of headphones, from Ultrasone PROs and UE triple.fi's to Sennheisers, Bose QCs and $20 Sony's, and the lack of comfort and lacking midrange removes the Beats Pro's from being an option at any price.If you're already considering headphones at this price level and aren't blinded by the name brand and the look, do some research and get something more comfortable with better sonic versatility for the same price or less.  This price point can easily get you some stellar headphones that are comfortable and still have intense bass, but these aren't them.

VI decided to update my Beats Solo's to the Beats Pro a few weeks ago and I couldn't be happier.  The Solo's are good headphones (they are light weight and more compact), but the sound on these Pro's are amazing!  I'm not a huge audiophile, I just like listening to music with a great pair of headphones.  I was able to get a very good deal on these headphones and they are worth every penny.  There is no sound leakage with these headphones at all.  That was a big factor in my deciding to go with the Pro's over the Studio's after watching several reviews of both on youtube.  These headphones are very comfortable to wear as the cushioning is very soft and although these are heavier in weight than the solo's that I have, I don't find these heavy at all.Bottom line:  If you are looking for a high quality set of headphones that sound unbelievable and are also stylish and comfortable, then don't think twice about picking up a pair of these.

VNOT audiophile headphones
p329
sg5
VThese are not great headphones, and this is mainly because the mid-range is very absent. For example when listening to movies when there is a lot of bass sound (e.g. when bombs are exploding in a war scene), the voices are blurred and difficult to understand. These are of-course are designed for bass heavy music like electronica (and this is why I bought them), but I found the Denon AHD 2000 to work better for this kind of music (the mid-range is more there). When I bought them I was hoping they would be of the same quality as the aforementioned Denons plus a bit more bass. I was disappointed. They are not audiophile headphones, and for electronica affectionados (if you like Deadmau5, Distance, Benga, Skream and the alike) like myself I would recommend the Denon AHD2000s instead.Finally,I agree with other reviewers in that: 1. the build quality is very good, and 2. they are also less comfortable, and tight against the head.UPDATE: Also if you like the  music mentioned above check out the Ultrasone Pro 900 headphones. They are about the same price as the beats, but are said to be a lot better.

VDurability: 5 StarsThey are really solid, almost completely made out of metal. Very well designed as far as durability, I feel that these could last me years and years of use versus plastic headphones.Sound: 5 StarsGreat sound. Contrary to what others have said, there IS a huge difference in sound between these and the Beats Studio. The sound in the Studios is more subdued and sounds more canned. The sound in these is more powerful and you can really hear each of the individual instruments. As expected, bass is booming and powerful, but doesn't overpower. I listen to all genres of music from Hip-hop to rock to jazz to classical to pop...you name it, and the Beats Pro sound great for it. Despite not being battery powered, I still get a powerful sound when using them with my iPhone 4.Style: 5 StarsAs you can see from the pictures, they look fantastic. Probably the most stylish headphones I've ever seen.Bass: 5 StarsPunchy and responsive but not overpowering.Comfort: 1 StarThis is the deal breaker...as others have said these headphones really are not comfortable. The circular pads sort of squeeze your ears into the headphone, leaving them sore after a short period of time. The headband is very tight as well. I've been bending the headband to try to make them fit less tightly, but the circular pads still make your ears sore no matter what. It's really a shame they are so uncomfortable...Padding: 4 StarsThe padding is good and thick, but it's the shape of the pads that makes the headphones so uncomfortable as stated above.Sound leak: 4 StarsThey leak sound alright, but it's really not bad at all. When they're on your head sound leakage isn't bad unless you're really blasting the music.Overall: As you can see from my review, I think these headphones are great in every aspect except for comfort...after trying them out for a few weeks I think I might go back to the Studios. Although the sound isn't as good, at least they are comfortable, unlike the Pros. Hopefully they fix this problem soon with a new version of the headphones. It's really a shame because of the great styling and sound...but I just can't justify holding onto $400 headphones that hurt to wear.

VIf you are considering purchasing Dre Beats it is worth shelling out another 100 bones to get the Pro's.  The quality of the sound and the headphones themselves are a leap ahead of the Studios.  My only gripe would be after considerable wear they tend to become uncomfortable and need to be adjusted, especially when you first get them.  I have a pair of Sennheisen HD650's and the Pro's are slightly more comfortable.  In terms of sound quality I would chose the Senn's over the Pro's but if you want to sport the style of the Beats this would definitely be the pair I would recommend.  I've had mine for over a month and I'm very pleased with the Pro's.

VOkay first of all i looked at many reviews before buying these and was worried about the comfort. It was the main reason i was hesitating. I finally got mine and they are very comfortable. The sound of course is very very good! I compared these to my Sennheiser HD-201's and it is the equivalent of michael jordan playing a primary student in basketball. The bass is very good as i expected but does not drown out the mids and highs, the studio's have much more bass, but i tell you these will not disapoint. Again very durable as everyone says, these built like a rock. Everything is to love about these headphones!!! Buy emmmm!!!!!!!!

VSound was excellent, but it killed my ears after 30 min or so. I read this from others but assumed they were wimps and whinny.  I am pretty tolerant, but found myself trying to shift them on my head after just 20 minutes.  They are NOT light and over-ear like the other Beats.  They are burley and sit ON your ears.  Ouch.I returned them and got the Studio wireless.  The wireless is just awesome and still has the click control built in for volume, play/stop, next song.  However, then sounded acceptable but limited on my iPhone 6.  On my new Sony Walkman A17 they sound ridiculously good.

VI really really really want to like these! Although I'm in love with the look and color these just fall very short for me compared to the beats studio's.. The studios are so comfy and these just squeeze the life out of your head, almost feels like you have a weight on top of your head while someone is squeezing you in half. I don't think I'm being dramatic at all. The sound is eh okay. A lot of base, but the mids are just very low so I always have to put the volume up. If you wanna stick with beats just get the studio's! I think you'll have a better experience.

VBe aware of fake ones if you are buying it from a 3rd party sellers. Amazon requires you to have a written proof from the manufactor of a couterfeit merchandise. And Beats company will do notjing about it if the seller is an unauthorize reseller. So you kindda stuck in the middle when thi person needs proof and the other person will not giving you proof. So you lost your money on a liece of junk and ended up burning it. And be aware of carlosmiguel21 he sold me a fake pro and closed my return request twice, this seller is dishonest and lies. From what i've been experienced, most confident way to buy these headphones is from an authorize resellers because if anything happens, Beats will kick in to resolve to problems.

VMy son loves these and wears them around his neck as a sort of teenage fashion accessory as well as for listening to music. I like the hinged earphone so he can flip one ear back and hear me speaking to him! He loves the performance and styling. He has made a couple of tiny chips on the red coating in normal (not rough) use which disappointed him and he is now careful to carry them in the soft bag they came with. They were expensive but he loves them. Buying from the States was easier than I expected and the import duty handled easily. Thank you

p379

VOkay. So I was reading a lot of reviews of these headphones and was really hesitant to buy them because so many people complained of their comfort.Everyone was in agreement that they sounded amazing, however.So I went ahead and ordered them, knowing I could return them if they were unbearable in the comfort department. When I got them, I nervously put them on...and they are SO comfortable! I've been wearing them for hours and they are awesome. I have an average sized head and all and I have NO complaints about them!EDIT: After having them for 3 months, I am now noticing the discomfort. They start to hurt your ears. It's not the soft cushions that are on the oustide, but rather the inner part of the earpiece that is the "speaker." It really starts to get sore after about 30 minutes of use. Although this is true, I have tried the Bose quietcomfort series and they just don't compare to the beats. But they DO get uncomfortable and therefore get a 3/5 stars for me instead of 5/5.

VI have been doing live sound mixing for 20 years now, and I really like these headphones. They are more comfortable than any other over-the-ear headphones I've ever worn. I can wear these for hours before my ears start to hurt, unlike most over-the-ear headphones that I can only wear for an hour or so. They also really cut down the outside noise, and you can hear every little thing in the music when listening with these headphones. I highly recommend them to anyone interested in a set of pro-level headphones.

VI actually ordered this pair because of a good price that i was able to get them for. I was hesitant in buying monster headphones because others say how it's not worth it. I like them though. They are sturdy and quite comfy because of the padding. It is a bit heavy though, so on late nights when I get tired, it's weight is noticeable. Other than that I don't mind. I think the music here is quite balanced since I don't really hear any muddiness or anything. Compared to my other headphones, this pair makes the music a bit louder. I think this is a good pair of headphones, but the price is too high. I'd give this a 5 if it was cheaper.

VI absolutely love these headphones. I looked at the Solo HD Beats by Dr Dre before these; they also sounded incredible, but seemed a little flimsy and I heard they've been snapping in half quite easily. I decided to spend the extra $200 and buy these because durability means alot to me. I love these headphones, great quality all around, the only con is really expensive price tag..they could've sold them for $200...although they're a great set...I think they charge the extra $200 just for carrying the Monster/Dre name and for looks...they are one sexy pair of headphones

An one-hundred pair of headphones could do it, with better quality. Can't give them a high rating. They are expensive and not that good.

VA big difference from the cheaper models
p475
sg5
VI come from an audio engineering background so I have used a lot of headphones.  This model rates high for me.  The sound is crisp and I can make out all of the subtleties that I would demand of a good pair of phones.  I will say that there is a quality loss if you play your music quietly.  I don't need ear bleed levels but I find that I cannot have the volume low enough to hear my surroundings while also hearing the full range of the music being played.  And this kind of makes sense - the mfr claims to have noise cancelling qualities in this model.  While I suspect it's based on padding and the metallic construction of the body and not an active mic noise is fairly well canceled.This model came with 2 cords - one which adapts to 1/4" (a must for studio use) and one that has phone controls (a must for personal use).  The cable can plug into either ear phone - I like that a lot.  I prefer my phone on the right but my mac input is on the left.Construction is VERY SOLID! I like the idea that I'll have these for a long time.  I also like how they fold up - the ear phones rotate inward to rest inside.  The lower Beats models hing inward and lay on top of each other.Oh, and here's probably one of the biggest sells for me:  No batteries.  You NEVER need to charge this (as you'd expect with most headphones).  I was shocked that the cheaper beats need to be charged and am sick of things that need me to charge them.  This is one object I don't charge.Oh, and a last thing, I LOVE RED!  I have a lot of red stuff - sneakers, shirts, speakers - heck, I'd have a red trumpet if it made sense.  No offense to LIl' Wayne, but I didn't buy these for his name (and they are not on the item btw).  I bought them because they are freaking cool looking.

VBeats Pro Headphones
p481

VI bought these headphones about a year ago and they have been wonderful.  Let me start by saying that I am no audiophile.  I am a casual listener, but as an architecture student there is nothing better to do while working on projects (literally almost 24/7) than listen to music.  So let's get into it...Good Stuff:The sound quality is VERY good.  Everything you would expect from Beats.  The headphones are bass heavy but have exceptional mid and higher ranges.  I have been able to compare these to the Bose QC15s and must say that the sound is noticeably better, in some cases you hear more than you thought was there with the Beats.  The Beats Pros do not have active noise cancelling like the QC15s but given how heavy the earpieces are padded you barely need it.  Simply wearing them will not cancel noise like the QC15s, but with music playing you can barely hear anything.  The Beats Pros are VERY solid.  They are made almost entirely of aluminum and have held up through countless trips in my bookbag to campus and back.  Very durable headphones, you would have to try to break these.  I bought these headphones when Monster had been a part of Beats and the Monster cable it came with is very nice.  It is thick and pretty heavy duty as well, and also comes with an adapter for a large stereo or amplifier.  I can't say whether or not the newer versions will have as nice cables (it seems after Monster was dropped cable quality went to the wayside).  The cable can be completely removed from the headphones, can be plugged into either side and lock in so you don't accidentally pull them out.  The empty plug on the opposite side of the headphones becomes an audio out which I suppose is fun if friends want to listen to your music too.Cons:As much as I love these headphones I give them four stars because they honestly aren't for everyone.  With the earpieces being round instead of oval or ear shaped they may be uncomfortable for some people.  Also if you have bigger ears or have ears that kind of angle out from your head more the headphones will smash them against your head (very uncomfortable).  As I said before these headphones are made almost entirely of metal which makes them pretty heavy.  They can get uncomfortable after a few hours of use at first but if you use them everyday you get used to it.  I wear mine all day some days and have no problems; the heavy padding in the arch and earpieces do a good job compensating for the weight).  The price is very high for these at 400$ especially given that they come with the worst case ever (basically a small pleather sack with a draw string).  They must have thought the only damage that could be done to these is that they could get scratched.Either way I think these are GREAT headphones and would recommend them to anyone if you could find some under 400$.  People buy and re-sell these all the time for a fraction of the price and you can find some pretty good deals here on Amazon.

Vexcellent headphones the best I ever tried!
p487
sg5
VI bought this headphones some days ago and I have to say that from the first moment I say them I said WOW!I judged them based on sound, comfort, durability, accessories.Sound:They sound perfectly bass, miss, highs are perfectly balanced compered with the studios. I tried bose and the beats studio and I think pros worth the price (400$). They really sound perfectly everything is clear; in fact I heard things I couldn't hear with studio or bose.  5/5comfort: this headphones are not really comfortable, but not as bad as people think. The ear cup can easily cover all the ear. The only problem is that they squeeze your ears and since they weight 400 grams they begin to hurt a lot after about 40 minutes. They don't hurt so much as people say if you don't think about it's ok.  4.5/5durability: this is the key point of these headphones they rare made to last a lot, because they are made of aluminum and leatherette.  5/5accessories: this headphones have pretty good accessories: they have 2 cables iphone and the beats cable which can elongate up to 2 meters, classic beats cleaning cloth, classic book and instructions and the spongy custody. It is not like the studio one; it doesn't have a zip instead it has a string which has to be pull to close the custody. It is not as horrible as it seems the 2 cables, the beats and th cloth can easily fit, so it is ok.  4.5/5They worth the price and I think they are better than all the other beats headphones, I recommend them to everyone. If you want to ask me questions subscribe to my youtube channel: fred zanna I will soon make a video of this headphones in italian and in english thanks I hope you like this review i also hope I have been useful to youBROFIST

Vbetter than my house speakers?!?
p499
sg5
VOk, lets begin by saying I really focused on my stereo from the time I was thirteen years old till now (36). I have five Infinity SM152/SM155 speakers and a 15" audiopipe with plenty of carver power. My neighbors hate me. They hate me all the way down the hall and in the next building. This was the reason I purchased these. I figured the cost was high, but compared to what I already shelled out I decided it would make a good addition. I must admit, I do miss the bass through your chest with my home set up, but darn it, these things shake on your ears! They are almost a little too warm, but for me that is PERFECT. If you want crisp highs, great mids and vocals and most importantly wonderful sounding, warm, clean, blaaam bass... you want these. I did end up purchasing them from Best Buy so I could get the extended warranty. I have had these for about 4 days and already listened to them for at least 15 hours. Of course I will keep updating this one as I go. I suppose they do get a little sweaty after long periods and aren't the most comfortable thing to wear for hours on end, but I honestly don't think these would stay on if they weren't clamped on your ears. I noticed one of my buddies kinda headbanging to them and they were slipping around, they are a bit heavy. Well, as far as power goes, they do sound better hooked up to my receiver with more power... however, I have a sansa sandisk player that cant put out more than next to nothing and it totally drives these to respectable levels. The receiver is only necessary if you seriously want them to shake... and kinda hurt. I wouldn't crank them for too long at once, just do short burst. I think these could cause serious hearing loss with only mA's. As I type right now, I have decided to turn the volume down on the sansa player cuz after an album (long beach dub allstars) its getting to be a bit much. I would be shocked if I found a pair of headphones I think are better than these. Ok, I'm sure you could blow me away with $1600 headphones. For what its worth, I'm not rich. I worked hard for these, and placed them above a car... yes... I ride my bike to afford these!

VTHIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINIONI purchased mine directly from monster cable's outlet store on their website. They cost $200 came with leather pouch, cloth, headphones, and cord. I have built a custom foam padded wooden box that now houses six sets of headphones, so the box is no big deal. AKG 702, AT M50, Shure 440, ah-d5000, hd650.Pros:Sturdy- definately Diggging he metal vibe off these. Amazing cord(as per usual from monster, how do you think monster CABLE started)Style-you can't wear too many headphones as a statement but these walk that fine line. I don't mind riding the train with them.Bass- these cans are definately colored, but that is why i bought them, I needed something for my r&b; and club music, Sometime the doctor knows whats best. These are for my digital music collection, not my vinyl which i am thinking would be much to warm.Ambient Noise-For a passive headphone they block out much of the ambient noise in my house, not so much the train, but it quiets the train to backround noise even at low volume levels.Middle of the Road:Soundstage- since they are a closed back can, you need to understand that their soundstage isn't as big or open as other cans. But it's not horrible but it's not the best. But i doubt you should be considering this set if you want an amazing stage. The cans however do not fatigue my ear drums, lots of bass(which again is what i wanted) and yet i can listen to them for hours at a very reasonable level.Sound:The lows are great but the mids and highs do not blow me away, even when i opened them up out of my dac and amp. I have not allowed burn in time and i doubt it will do much to help that range. The bass is super tight, low and clean. Props for this since i have been looking for a good ol' fashioned bass head phone and now i found them. The bass is well balanced and although you never forget it is there you certainly hear everything else accordingly.Cons:Price-$400 thats why i went with refurbed for half the price and i can't tell the difference besides no box and paper work. Honestly for my money i got what i wanted and am enjoying them. but asking 400 for a new set....they better blow my pants off and impress my parents during the holidays.Comfort-I read a few revies on these stating the comfort factor, it is true. A bit tight, and i wear howard light ear protectors at work. I am assuming one's dome will get used to it after a while, but like others have said please make a little more comfy.Over all- this is what i was looking for and i am beyond pleased with there overall performance. Definately a keeper, but make sure to shop around and know that you like the sound!!

VSo I purchased these headphones on Cyber Monday for a great deal. So far, I have to say overall I am quite impressed.Now that is out of the way, I will explain what I found to be the pro's and con's of these headphones.Pros:Fantastic build quality, they feel sturdy and don't feel cheap.Cable; quite thick and tangle-free. If you need to toss this in a bag and head out, no need to worry about tangling.Dual audio ports, when you connect a cable to one port, the other port automatically becomes an audio outport, if a friend wants to listen to some music you are listening to, just have them plug their 3.5 jack into the outport and you are set.Style: It doesn't matter if you love or hate the Beats by Dr. Dre line of headphones, these headphones are stylish. Great work by Monster.And finally, sound: I have to say that I am by no means an audiophile, but the overall sound is quite good. I find these headphones to shine most in the following genres: Pop, Hip Hop, Rap, R&B;, Electronica, House, Trance, and Dubstep. Usually genres that have more bass involved will really bring out the overall satisfaction with these headphones. If you like to listen to any of the following genres, I would highly recommend these headphones.Cons:Price: These headphones are quite overpriced ($400) which is why I waited for a sale. The actual headphones are probably worth about $250 (Which I consider a fair price) but you are paying the extra $150 for the Beats name.Can be uncomfortable: If you have a big head like I do, these tend to start slightly hurting your ears after about an hour or so. Usually if you take them off for a few minutes and put them back on you are ready to go. I took 1 star off for that.That is my review, I hoped this help clear some things up if you are considering purchasing these!

VA look beyond the bias and hype
p515
sg5
VIn audiophile circles, these headphones (along with most Beats products) are generally laughed at and ridiculed.  Browse through just about any "hardcore" audio enthusiast site, discussion board, or publication and you are sure to find endless caustic comments (these folks tend to hate Beats with a passion). Meanwhile, on the trend front, you'll see that Beats products are quite "in style", with Beats Pro being THE high end status symbol. Any "Must have" pop culture gadget list of note is sure to have the Pros on its roster and the "in crowd" swears by anything with a bold B on the headset. Basically, there tends to be a lot of "I'm too cool of an audio coinsurer to like Beats" and "I'm too cool of a hipster not to like Beats" surrounding the Pros.Casting aside the two opposing demographics' biases, here is my take on the Beats Pro:Sound - If you like deep powerful sound and heavy bass, the Beats Pro more than delivers. Even at high volume, the tone remains rich, without distortion. However, if you prefer a more "clean", balanced, sound, the Pros can prove far too heavy on the low end; overpowering some of the subtlety found in non bass oriented music. In sum, consider the kind of music you prefer before buying.Build - Unlike the lower priced Beat lines (and far too many other headsets for that matter), the Pros have abstained from lightweight plastics, in favor of an all metal (aluminum) build. Additionally, the cord is more durable than you'll typically find in headsets. The only potential weak point I have noted is the ear cup hinge.  There is an overall feel of substance to the Pros and they are up to some rough handling.Comfort/fit - Unlike many reviews, I have found the Pros to be quite comfortable (I have a rather large head too). The ear cups are generously padded and the frame pliable enough, so as not to pinch, while firm enough to maintain a firm hold. I have found the Pros to perform admirably in both sedentary and active use.Misc. - As with most full sized headsets, the Pros are a bit power hungry. Not an issue if used with a "system" or supplementary amp, but something to consider when using your standard mobile listening device.Price - Perhaps, the Pro's one Achilles heel. They are certainly a well made, quality, product, but one has to question if they are truly worthy of the $400 range. In that price bracket, there are unquestionably better sounding headsets to be found, but I would argue the build quality/durability is a notch above most entries in the category. In the end, you are likely paying an extra $100 for the brand name and marketing.

VI bought these 'phones after listening to the Studios in a shop. The Studio's blew me away on first impression but I wasn't impressed by the build quality so decided to give the Pro's a go.Let me say I'm not a fashion conscious teenager, nor am I into bling or street cred. I have holes in my shoes and the down payment blues.These Headphones produce awesome clear powerful sound and have a sound signature I really enjoy.Straight out the box the highs were a bit harsh and the bass quite boomy but after 70 hours play time much has changed. Bass is strong but tight and controlled. Highs are less screechy. Trust me they improve with use.They sound great in any genre despite some claims they only shine with bass heavy music. This isn't true. Try listening to Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. Astonishingly beautiful. They may not be the best for classical but they still do Ludwig Van proud.Sound signature...Some cans are great for enjoying quality audio as you drift off to sleep on the couch, which is fine. The Pros's though.....make ya wanna jump up on the table, kick someone in the face, lob a bottle through the closed window and swing from the light, screaming like a nut job. I love them for that but I'm considering buying a pair of Sennheiser 598's for evenings/late night before I lose all my friends and get evicted.Build quality is superb and unusual in this plastic age. They work well with a portable player. They felt really heavy initially but I have go used to them and they feel comfortable to me but my ears do fit inside the round cups.Are they worth the price? I think hearing AC/DC sound the way they should sound, is worth the price tag. Maybe I should buy new shoes instead but that's just me.Edit: The supplied cable has a peculiar 3.5 mm jack with locating flanges which lock into a similarly peculiar female connection on the headphone. Not all replacement cables with 3.5 mm jacks will fit these headphones. Some will some won't, its a bit hit 'n' miss.

VI can honestly say these are easily the best headphones Ive used and honestly the best headphones when you take practicality into account. While I have to say Sennheiser makes better sound quality headphones, theyre for simply recording, not everyday listening too. With many Sennheisers you need a headphone amp just to power them off of an ipod, which most people who listen to music use. In addition, those are open cans, so any sound outside you can hear with the headphones on, meanwhile with beats pros even though theyre not "sound cancelling" you can hear practically nothing once theyre on your head. In addition, I have read just about every review for these headphones on amazon, both the good and the bad and after doing much research realized that most if not all of the bad reviews were simply not correct. They were reviews for counterfeit beats pros since many people complained of them being uncomfortable and overly tight on their head, which is a characteristic of the fake pros since the counterfeiters do not use the correct material and dimensions, which end up making them too tight. Secondly, people also say that they are overly bass heavy, and "terrible mids and lows" which is not true at all. I am a moderate level audiophile, I have a great home theatre with Polk Audio floor standing speakers and center speaker, bose surround speakers and a polk psw505 subwoofer. I know what good sound is both in home theatre setting and in headphones as I have used Bose Quite Comfort two's to Sennheiser HD 598's and the Beats Pros really are a great pair of headphones in all sense of the world, they are comfortable, great sounding, fashionable and a little pricey but not overly expensive. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.

VBeats Pro High Performance - Absoolutely Fabulous Phones
p531
sg5
VI just got them, plugged them in and OMG!!!!...That was my initial reaction to these beauties when the first notes came out.  The sound quality far exceeds any phones I've owned to date and I don't by cheap gear.  The balance between the lows, mids and highs is absolutely fabulous.  Yes, the bass is pronounced and clear, but NOT booming.  There is clarity within each of these frequencies without any crowding or irritating crossover between any frequency...nearly absolutely perfectly clear response. Yes, YOU WILL HEAR SOUNDS COMING FROM YOUR RECORDINGS THAT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD BEFORE!!!  I put that in caps because I was a bit skeptical when I read that in some of the other reviews while doing my research on these phones.I hesitated for about a month on this purchase, because initially I was concerned about the price point for these phones.  Now that I have heard them for several hours now, I must admit they are WELL worth the money. and I am very glad that I purchased them.  I am totally satisfied with this purchase and if you are particular about the sound of your music, like I am, you should be as well.  My music taste is extremely varied and includes Jazz, Classical, Gospel, R&B;, Easy Listening, and POP, all of which have tested out fabulously on these phones!The build quality is excellent.  They are very sturdy and look very impressive.  THEY ARE COMFORTABLE!!!  I'm not sure why some of the comments were a bit critical about the comfort of these phones.  I have a fairly large head, and the headband is not binding at all, neither does it squeeze my head, and the ear pieces are very, very comfortable on my ears.  Perhaps improvements were made to the design at some point, but right now I'm very pleased with the comfort.  Yes, they are a bit heavier than my Bose Quiet Comforts, but I attribute that to what has gone into these phones to produce the nearly perfect sound that comes out of these babies.You might want to make a note that they are advertised as noise isolating, not noise cancelling.  Since I just got them, I have not had a chance to take them on a plane yet, I'm almost positive the engine noise that my Boise Quiet Comforts do such a wonderful job cancelling out, may not produce the same results with these.If you are hesitant about the purchse, price, comfort, sound, take it from a guy who is VERY particular about the sound of his music, the Beats Pro High Performance Headphones have met and exceeded my expectations.

VRapper endorsement + sleek styling + sub par components = Beats ProPay $400 for a pair of headphones worth abut $100 in actual audio reproduction; the other $300 is of course for the status symbol price. Beats Pro are by far the best in the Beats line-up but a far cry from what A premium headphone should be. First and foremost I own the pros, the beat buds, and the solo HD's all of which I acquired for well below retail. I have a bit of a headphone fetish. I feel like HD tv's and monitors need something as equally complementing in the audio department so my pursuit of great headphones is constant.Beats represent a marketing ploy and a fantastic one  at that. Its hard not to feel proud, and entitled when you are wearing them. Like the 50 year old who has to buy a Corvette to regain his confidence the beats offer the same gratification. As if saying, look how much I spent on "designer headphones" I have disposable income.Now if status is what you are after then the $400 price tag is more than justifiable. Just as fashion goes, the more expensive it is the more prestigious it is. Gucci, Versace, Dolche & Gabanna are all in the business of putting functionality on the back burner and focusing on the brand itself. Monster has integrated a Studio household name into its line of sub par headphones with its focus on "hear what you are missing".The Beats Pro do sound fantastic. That is assuming you have never listened to actual studio headphones. It will be more than adequate for the average listener. It is fun to go through your mp3 collection and rediscover how good songs can actually sound vs some cheap pair of skull candy cans, or Coby 10 cent earbuds but in actuality it could be loads better. I don't pretend to be an "audio-phile" to classify yourself as one is presumptuous considering sound is relative. What sounds good to an audiophile could be the exact opposite of what you prefer. That being said and avoiding all jargon I will say that the pro's have very satisfying bass. It is not distorted in the least as some cheaper headphones try to replicate hard bass but it is muddled and distorted at higher volumes. Messing around with EQ settings on your device will yield a pretty good range of sounds but the Pros are obviously intended or Bass heavy tracks. It will still handle acoustic strings very well but nothing exceptional in terms of fidelity. Its synthesized tracks that lets these headphones achieve.One of the problems with other Beat products is durability. They are simply cheaply manufactured. Monster doesn't use premium materials. Usually a mesh of pleather, and sqeaky plastics. Numerous reviews will tell of the Solo's cheap plastic headband snapping, or the earbuds plastic and decorative bezels falling off. Luckily the Pro is manufactured to take a hit. Metals are used consecutively to strengthen the unit at a cost of weight. These cans are pretty heavy. Long term most Beats products will begin to short out but these have been the exception. Go to Best Buy and try them out. If you are sold on them then look on Ebay as you can snag a new pair for around the $250 mark. I purchased a new in open box pair for $150 during a lucky ebay bid.

VJunk headphones
p542
sg5
VBeats Pro headphones are junk.First of all, the base is noticeably less than the less expensive standard Beats headphones. Save the $100 and just buy regular beats: they're a better product which delivers a superior sound. There's nothing "pro" whatsoever about Beats Pro headphones. They just look cool is all.Then there's the discomfort. While the standard Beats headphones were smartly shaped with an oval over-the-ear shape that is slightly tilted backward to comfortably rest over the ears, Beats Pro headphones have a circular ear-muff that doesn't sit around the ear, but on top of it. After listening for an hour or so, your ear will ache as if circulation is being cut off. Believe me, Beats Pros are very uncomfortable earphones and very poorly designed. They are also heavy on the head, and you'll always feel like they want to slide forward or backward every time you twist or lower/raise your head with them on.Beats Pro also don't have the handy zipper-close hard-case that the standard Beats come with.My Beats Pro headphone broke after only three months. I noticed that the base just wasn't there one day. I thought it was the software. I looked at iTunes and not one equalizer setting had been changed. Music was playing so I knew my computer wasn't the problem. I plugged my Beats Pros into my iPod and the same problem. Then, the left ear-muff suddenly popped out of place. I couldn't get it to snap back into position. The ear-piece kinda' dangles now and the sound is tinny with no base and slight reverb. I threw them in the trash and am out four hundred dollars.Dr Dre, your products are cheap, plastic crap made in Chinese sweatshops. You ought to be ashamed to put your name on such poorly manufactured products.Folks, there's only one name you need to know when it comes to electronics: Sony. Always buy Japanese. Dr Dre's Chinese-sweatshop toys are overpriced rubbish.

VI have tried many different kinds of headphones including Beats Solo(Junk)and the Studios(Hated The Battery)and the Noise Cancellation was great, unless your a drummer, everytime you start playing the sound would cut out.They sounded pretty good, but nothing compared to my Pros! I have also have had the Ludacris Souls(Nice, But not nice enough)as well as several other higher end Headsets, and a dozen in-ears.These headphone are very comfortable, very stylish and lightweight! The sound is extremely clean and very well balanced. I am very picky, being a drummer, I need to hear everything, very clearly, and these deliver, with great outside noise isolation, beyond what I expected.If your a big music geek, or a drummer or musician like me or a studio engineer, BUY THESE!!! They are literally like having a pair of High end studio monitors on your ears.I have read reviewers stating they are too bass heavy, or uncomfortable, and as far as I am concerned, that is just not at all true. I looked into this, because I can't believe what I am hearing, and after hrs of research, alot of those complaints, come from owners that have purchased fake Pros.There are several ways to tell if they are fakes or not. Look up fake beats pros on youtube, lots of videos describing, also another good way is the serial number, Fakes don't have them. Just go to monstercable.com and enter the serial. There are TONS of fakes, ONLY buy from a authorized dealer!! I bought mine from Monster Outlet Store Online for only $199, and the only difference is they were not in a box.

VI took a chance buying from this excellent seller. He gave me no reason to think I would buy the fake headphones, but I suspected for the price he was selling them for that they would be fake.  I was scared as hell, and looking at all types of videos on the internet to try and see how you can tell if they are fake or not.  The seller came through and delivered the headphones in 2 days and they were perfect.  As for everyone negatively critiquing these headphones: let me say they have to be craaaaaaaaaaaaazy.  These are the best.I own a pair of Sennheiser's that cost me $225 a year ago and those do sound great, but they are not as good as the Dre's.  They are close tho.  These headphones carry that professional sound and the highs and lows and perfect bass.  I don't know how else to say they sound good. Another small thing, is I wear them around work a lot and work in a corporate environment and the style of the other Sennheiser's I own look to DJ'ish and too awkward for style. It was a hard choice to spend this much money again for cosmetics and I didn't want to sacrifice the sound.  When I heard the sound and did song for song comparisons I was happy man.That's about all I'll say.  I'm just glad for once, I didn't get ripped off.  Usually, when I think I'm going to get ripped off....I do; and that's why I prefer to shop at retail stores instead of random warehouses on the internet; but I had to give credit on a good seller and great product. I'm not mad one bit for spending $200 on a pair of Beats Pro Over the ear headphones.

Vi actually like the beats studio, which i feel are bashed simply because they are made by Monster.  in addition, i own other quality headphones - sennheiser 650s, beyerdynamics 990s, akg 701s, etc.  yes, i have too many headphones.  of those, i like the akg 701s in terms of sound and the beyerdynamics in terms of comfort.  but, you really can't go wrong with any of those headphones.i like the semi-hard case that the beats studio came with that would prevent the headphones from being crushed when thrown into a backpack.  the beats pro comes with a pouch.  seems like a downgrade to me for something that costs significantly more.  i don't really care about the box, or the swiveling earcups.  the ability to hookup another headset to this one is kind of an odd feature to me - one that i would not really use.  i do like that you can hook up the cable to either side - for example, on my laptop, i like the cable on my left side b/c the laptop headphone jack is on that side.overall headphone quality seems to be quite high.  style is what it is - either you like it or you don't.  i do.the beats pro sound pretty good - especially if you like a lot of deep bass - i don't.  as others have mentioned, the biggest problem with these headphones is comfort.  it's like a vise on your head and ears.  too stiff and too much pressure is applied.  it isn't circumaural which i would have liked.  for that reason, unless you have a tiny head, i would not recommend these to anyone - especially if you pay the price which it is currently being sold at.

p565
sg5
VNow, don't get me wrong. These headphones have really good bass, the structure of the headphones feel stable and strong unlike what people have said about the Studios. You can really hear certain things that you normally wouldn't be able to hear on your typical type of headphones. they look good, and offer good sound.now the bad news..unfortunately these headphones are ridiculously uncomfortable, the weight literally sits on top of your head, and since the bass is deeper that means that the ear cushions are tighter on your ears, which also makes it uncomfortable.when i was looking at reviews for these headphones before i bought them i didn't think it would be that uncomfortable, i figured they were just being wussies about it, but they are actually right, these are super uncomfortable, when im listening to music it sounds amazing but after 30-60 minutes of use my ears need a break for about 10 minutes to be able to handle it again.you would think $400 headphones would be comfortable, these arent.Now..if you really want these and do not care for comfort, then go on and get them.but if you are seriously planning on using these often like myself, then it is a terrible idea, im actually considering selling these to someone else and i can buy cheaper headphones with the same kind of sound but with better comfort.but like i said, these headphones DO sound good, and they also DO look good.but i can 100% guarantee you that when you do buy them, and when you are wearing them, you're going to realize how uncomfortable they are.

VHey hey, it's your boy Emko.  I know it's been a while since I wrote but hey, I gotta keep it real.I have read so many reviews for headphones and everyone's got an opinion.  And pretentious ones at that. Are these truly reference headphones?  Hell no.  Do they sound incredible?  YES!For the right listener and the right music, these will change your life.  Trance, hip hop, dance, etc., don't waste your time with anything else, these make it *fun* to listen to music again.  Bassheads rejoice!  I have been comparing them at home to other "audiophile" headphones and while these are definitely not neutral or flat, they will have you bobbing your head and enjoying your music, which is what it's all about.  The other Beats models may have their problems but they really knocked it out of the park on this one.  Sure, you are overpaying for the name but we do that anytime you buy a "brand name."  Don't let that deter you, these are really something special.  Rock solid build, comfortable (after using them for a while to break 'em in a little), and the bass is sublime.  Just play Bass Mekanik's Doctor Oblivion and you'll see what I mean.  These would not be my first choice for classical music but with just about anything else, they kick some serious a$$.  Let them burn-in for a good 40 hours, the bass really tightens up and the mids become more prominent as well.  Add a small headphone amp and the bass BOOMS.  My jaw dropped when I did this.  I'd say at $400 they're overpriced but anything in the $300 range and it's a no-brainer.  Get 'em!

VBeats Pro by Dre - one sick pair of headphones
p582
sg5
VHappened to stumble upon these while shopping at Best Buy one day... tried them on a whim and totally dug the sounds.At first, I was skeptical as to whether the sound source that these headphones were plugged into would greatly influencethe listening experience, but after plugging them into my iPhone 4 and iPad, these babies, although a tad on the priceyside, are definitely a nice-to-have for an audiophile or serious music listener with 4 bills to blow.Great sound quality - over the range of it, beats all the in-ear headphones that I have (blew my $150 Shure earbudsout of the water, and I like those headphones).  Even on something as simple as an iPhone 4 as the audio source, and theBeats Pro shows you the difference between headphones, and HEADPHONES.  Definitely recommend activating the EQ settingon the iPhone, even if it's relegated to presets (Hit "Rock" or "Hip Hop" settings for better listening experience, IMHO).They are perfectly comfortable to wear for hours as I've worn these whilst cooking in the kitchen the day after I got them...no soreness on ears or head.... those who complain about discomfort must have odd-shaped heads or are not adjusting them right(my hat size is 7 3/4, so I have a large dome).The long cord rocks, although be careful about moving around areas where the cord could get caught.... it can happen...If you've got the cash to blow and are an avid music listener, get 'em.  If you don't have the cash, save it up.

VFirst of all these headphone are expensive but for 400 dollar u do get a good looking and a fairly good sound. For 400 dollar is alot of option out there. like beyer,AKG,audio technica, grado, sennheisers. the ATH M50s are compareable to this but for fraction of the price. but however. these headphone does not sound bad. now speaking of sound if u dont like bass dont get these headphone because these headphone bass are just so strong. the beats pro will not break if u drop them or throw them. i have play these on the loudest volume on my ipod and i can hear bass, mid and high its pretty good but could be better  these headphone are huge and they dont fit in ur pocket no matter how big ur pocket are. the wire is the best headphone wire i see and i love the part of the headphone where u can take the wire out. there is a lock on the wire so u can lock the wire to ur headphone. i didn't get these from amazon i got these in best buy which are the same price because its the black one. know one thing these does no have HARDCOVER like the studio, these has a soft bag which look pretty nice. these headphone look well with my alienware m15x laptop. the beats pro does put some weight on ur head but not too much. these headphone are comfortable that is if u adjust it to the right place. last thing.  u have the money and love bass+music go for these. if u dont have 400 bucks and does not listen to music that much than dont buy these because like i say they are very very expensive

p593
sg5
VThe headphone is great when it works and when it doesn't clamp on your head like a vice (its been 3 months and it has not eased up).I purchased Beats Pro in February and the red wire begun separating from the silver end in mid April thus making the sound sporadic with any slight movement. The glue used to hold this together is clearly visible at this point.I called monster support and beware of the following :- When you call a company for support you expect assistance and not being grilled like a suspect with regard to whether the product is a fake/replica version of the real Beats Pro. Well, all I know is that I purchased it from Amazon, have a receipt and trust that it is authentic.- After verification and questioning, they offered to replace it however the process takes 3 weeks so yes, three weeks without the headphones.- Finally, the customer pays for the shipping costs. From my vantage point, this is a defective product due to poor workmanship and careless ness. This particular version headphones is supposed to be durable and of good quality to justify the $402 price tag. Because of this carelessness by the manufacturer , factoring in the cost and advertising verbiage on the product, the manufacturer should bare the full weight of the poor quality which should include paying for the shipping cost to ship the product back and forth.

I think they are very stylish and not like any other headphones I had seen before. Loved the heavy feel of the headphones. They fitted over my ears just fine. In fact, everything was hunky dory until I tried playing a track. What! no vocals...where has the vocal track gone! I tried another trackvia iTunes. Same thing. The vocal was inaudable. I tried with the iPhone, iPod and MacBook. Every track lost the vocals. I even adjusted the iTunes equalizer. No difference. I sent the Beats Pro back and received another set from Amazon. Yet again, the same problem. Monster customer service told me I shouldn't be experiencing a loss of vocals on my songs. I decided to return the second pair and rsigned myself to buying one of the more conventional headphones.I would love to own a set of the Beats pro, but I didn't want the hassle of ordering a third set only to discover the same problem. I have to say Amazon were great and I had no problem returning the faulty phones. They even sent UPS to pick up the package. I never have had a problem with ordering from Amazon and this experience will not put me off using Amazon in the future. I just wonder if they have a faulty batch of the Beats Pro? perhaps I'll pop to Best Buy and listen to how they are supposed to sound when they work properly!

VI just got these bad boys today, and I have to say, they are worth every penny. Especially if your a kind of person who listens to alot of Hip-Hop, Rap, R&B;, and Techno/Electronic music.  Sound wise, they have the perfect amount of bass. Not to much, not to little, just right. Your able to hear the lyrics perfectly. You can't hear ANYTHING when your listening to music. Awesome for me when I'm trying to focus on high school work. Just great for the people for who listen to those music genres I listed above.  Now these headphones are very comfortable. The cups are much larger then what I've seen from pictures and Youtube videos, which was a plus for me, since I have big ears. Now for the weight..  The weight for these headphones aren't heavy for me, since I play Xbox with Turtle Beaches, so I'm used to the feel of headphones. For those that never owned a pair of headphones, you might find em somewhat hefty.  With the weight, these Beats are built like a tank. You won't break these headphones, unless you purposely try to do so.  Overall, the Beats Pro are worth the money. Great sound quality, Comfort, and the Tank build to these bad boys. 5 out of 5.  P.S., these are my first pair of music headphones that I've owned, but I've tried a few different ones from my buds, but I just wasn't impressed. Also, I listened to music while writing this review.

VYou are purchasing the name "Beats by Dr. Dre" that's all. I just received my pair today (black) and honestly, my Boss are a lot more comfortable.1. They're too heavy. I live in California and the weather tends to get hot, so having these around your head will make you even hotter.2. The tightness around the ear muffs. It's pretty darn tight, unlike my Boss where they squeeze perfectly, these feel like it needs to be loosen some more. I read a review where "Monster" actually fixed this problem, so either they've sent me an old pair, or they never fixed this problem. I'm 5'8 160lbs and my hat size is 7 1/4, my head really isn't big, it's more long than round.3. The quality is good. I mean I don't see where people get the whole "bass" from, I really don't hear it to a point where I'm amazed. I mean the bass is their, but it's not impressive.4. $400. Overall I feel like I just supported a trend rather than a pair of headsets. It's the brand that you're buying. If you're looking for clarity, I'm sure you can find it in Boss, with a better price range and A LOT more comfortable. (I don't work for Boss, I'm just speaking from my experience of owning both pair)If you feel you have to buy these and can afford to loosen $400.00 then by all means, go for it. But you should really go to your best-buy store, try'em on and see how they feel. That's your best bet.

VI don't know what these so call fake audiophiles problems are... I guess they need their hearing checked by a professional specialist, but dissing these headphones is completely incorrect. Stop the bad reviews haters, these Beats Pros delivery true high-fidelity sound reproduction... case closed !!  I didn't notice any missing Highs and/or Mid sounds while I was listening to my music... they are all there. I just don't stick to one genre, I listen to all types of music, so I know what I talking about. A true audiophile wants to listen to the music and feel it too !!  The bass is booming, sharp mids, and clear highs, so you don't have to crank up the volume to blow out your ear holes like some other headphones I know... I'm not going to drop any brand names here. I will agree with the other reviews though that these headphones are a little pricey, but you are paying for quality here not some cheap plastic. These headphones are metal, mostly lightweight polish aluminum, so there is a little weight to them.  Fit snuggly to your head, so they won't slip off if you're a nodder, or fly off your head if you're a headbanger. The Beats Pro is designed for heavy use (long sessions) and built to last for the true audiophiles, bassheads, DJs, and headbangers alike. Give these professional headphones a try, and you decide !!

VAwesome Headphones for Hip Hop
p629

VReally surprised by the quality of these headphones.I own several different sets of headphones and have a pretty sensitive ear thanks to years of musical training. I can compare these headphones to the Senheiser 598, Audio Technica ATH-M50, Beyerdynamic dt990, AKG Q701, and Monster 24K model headphones.The Beats Pro "beats" (lol!) all of them when it comes to bass. They are fantastic headphones for hip hop, electronica, R&B;, and dubstep. They need a bit of equalizing for other genres, but generally sound excellent. I tend to go with my M50's when I'm listening to a wide genre of music, but if I'm down for some rap or drum & bass, these bad boys give an excellent full, rich sound.I'd agree they're a bit overpriced. Try to get them for around $300 if you can, as the price fluctuates a lot among the different colors. They are very sturdy and have a generally solid build quality. The accessories are nice. I love the dual headphone jacks. The ear pads are super comfy and plush. They can feel a tad tight on my head after long periods of time, though to be fair I have a really big head.Totally love these headphones. Definitely recommend them if you don't mind the cost. If you want good bass headphones much cheaper, go with Sony's MDR-XB series.

VI bought these beats pros in black about a year ago, and i got an excellent deal on them. They sound very good to any average person, but an audiophile just wouldnt be satisfied. Look to sennheiser or other high-end headphone brands for excellent sound. These are extremely durable unlike the beats solo's and studio's which are entirely plastic, and easily broken. Also, the headphones swivel up, which i find helpful when I'm listening to music, but want to hear what people are saying around me. Another cool feature of these headphones, is the audio passthrough. So, you plus in your aux. cord which goes to your device playing the music, and the other end into one of the 2 jacks on the headphones. It doesn't matter which jack you plug into, the empty jack will automatically work for daisy-chaing your friends headphones or whatever. This is excellent for viewing movies on planes, car rides, and a friend or family member wants to listen as well. My headphones have hold up very well and i wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone whos not as interested in sound as they are in quality of headphones.

VI bought these headphones because I wanted a pair of headphones so I could listen to house music and other upbeat tunes. These headphones were EXCELLENT at delivering a pristine, beautiful, sound! I can hear every element of the music and I am in no way disappointed. I do not know why people say they are uncomfortable. I tried solos and were beyond uncomfortable. The pros are very comfortable for me. All in all, these headphones work FOR ME. I like house music and things with significant bass and crazy high's, varying midranges and very low lows. I think the beats are super amazing at delivering the sound I want for the music I like. Yes. You can feel the bass in your chest. After trying the Executives, I am glad I got these. These are everything I wanted from a headphone. If you really want these, but are hesitant, do yourself a favor and go to an apple store or a best buy and try them out first. I am totally satisfied with my purchase, but only satisfied after trying out a lot of other headphones and discovering that these deliver the type of sound I want. Absolutely recommend if you are into pop, House, Trance, Electronica, Rap, R&B;, anything with a wide range of sound or some bass you want to feel.

VThere's been many reviews that say these headphones absolutely hurt their ears. I have had no comfort problems and I actually like that they are tight because I wear these at the gym and for running. I have pretty big ears too, but to each his own. That's why I'd say if you want to buy these, try them on first at a Bestbuy or wherever.As for the sound quality, I think it's great. I'm not an audiophile but I can't complain. It's very hard to go back to earbuds after wearing these. They are a bit of a pain to carry around though and the travel case is garbage. On a plus, unlike the studios, no one can hear what you're listening to when you wear these. They muff out the noise.The two qualities in which this product stand out are in its durability and design. These headphones are strong, the wires are thick, and they absolutely got some sex appeal. Note that, for whatever the reason, the main profile pic of this product is not the Pro's. It looks like the studio's. All the other pictures are of the Pro's though. You can tell from the other pics that they look different from the main profile pic as well.If you're a casual listener who has some cash, these are worth it. If not, shop elsewhere.

VI'm coming from an excellent pair of B&W; P5's that had everything except the bass I sometimes want when I'm in the mood.  Deciding to go against the advice of some others who said that I wouldn't enjoy them after getting used to the P5's, I purchased the Studio Pros in black.  I can't stress how much I really wanted to like them, but they simply don't sound like what they should.  The bass is very present, and it works for rap, but even some electronica I listened to got completely drowned out behind the muddy noise.  There also really isn't as much low-end bass (that deep, long vibration you can get out of your car stereos) as I wanted.  But what really killed the phones for me was the complete lack of attention to the mids in these cans.  I just can't stomach anything song more complex that a beat with some vocals.I must stress that anyone supporting these headphones doesn't understand what the music should really sound like.  If you're new, try going to a location that lets you try out different high-end cans.  I ended up going with the Ultrasone Pro-900's after returning the Beats, which though a bit more expensive pack more bass, mids, and everything in between.

VHonestly, Beats Pros are a decent pair of headphones. It is higher quality than a lot of in-ear headphones and you'll have (Slightly) above-average sound quality.But for the price, I should love these headphones and the honest truth is I don't.They are uncomfortable to wear after 2+ hours, they are WAY to heavy on the bass, and the sound quality is meh. These headphones should be priced at around $80-$100, tops. Their only pro (no pun intended) is that they look decent. Granted you will look like a total jerk wearing them in public but they look half decent to me.And if you want to waste your money on an average pair of headphones, please, be my guest.I know Beats look cool but seriously, do you really want to spend this much on a pair of average headphones when you could get better headphones for a lot less?Beats are all hype. If you want some real headphones check out Bose, Sennheiser, or Sony.Pros: Very Sturdy Stay on headCons: Over-Priced Very Uncomfortable after 2+ hours Not very portable Sound Quality is only slightly above average

VWhy "waste" 200 + on headphones
p674
sg5
VThis review is for people who say that these are not worth the money. First off the quality of the headphones is amazing, when you hold them you can tell that they aren't gonna break anytime soon. Comfort is good but some people may say it's too tight on their head also can be irritating when wearing with glasses after some time(the cushions are really soft:). And best of all the sound quality, this is best part because the sound is amazing compared to other headphones (not saying they are the best sounding headphones on the market)I say this because the sound is clear and "even". By this I mean each individual sound is defined, for example there even voice and base and almost no outside noise. So unlike other headphones where some have too much bass or more voice or to much outside noise, these headphones are perfect in that sense. I also make beats so I know when I have good headphones when I am able to hear ever kick, hit, and clap clearly with the other music. over all great clear defined sound but can be uncomfortable if you wear for extended periods of time.

Vthese headphones are fantastic, and look great. they heave the best sound quality out of every other headphone brand. they are stylish in white or black, and they have a red cable. the cable is made by a brand called monster, and it is top of the line. you can tie knots in it all day, and all you have to do is pull to untangle it. they have amazing sound quality, and feel great. when you are listening to music of all kinds you cant hear anything around you. lots of people have bought them, so you know that they must be good. they are however severely over priced, but it is well worth if for the quality and looks. they are very comfortable, and are snug of your head. it comes with three different types of wires one with a volume control, one with nothing, and one with control talk. they also come with a cool carying case, and a lifetime warrenty as long as you have the recipt. they look awsome weither you have them on you head or around you neck. created by moster, and designed by dr. Dray beats are the top of the line headphones, and you should get them if you want the best sound quality.

VThese beats are very nice. Although comfort is really not an issue once you manage to put them on right (its actually not as straightforward as I originally thought), they might not be as comfortable if you're gonna move around with them on your ears.When it comes to sound I have no complaints, bass is obviously predominant but nothing excessive.The design is nice, as you can see. And these beats DO NOT feel cheap. They are heavy, look durable, the foam around the ears and for the top of the head feels very nice. One thing I didn't know though is that you have 2 ports for the sound cable, but if you put it in the left one you will only have sound in that left ear piece. If you put it in the right one, sound will come out of both sides.Only thing that im sort of disappointed in is the cover they give you. For a headset of this price, that you do want to protect they give you a thin sleeve that doesn't really provide any protection (except maybe from scratches). I would've preferred a hard case, but thats just my opinion.

VI bought these roughly two or three months ago and I have to say im really impressed with them.They sound great! But for $400 I could be expecting some more bass. Although I didn't really buy them for the sound quality, I bought them because they're beats. They are made out of some type of metal that is very hard, solid, and durable. They've been dropped once and they still sound perfect. Very well done I must say.Comfort: If you wear them for long sessions you might have to rethink getting other ones, that's about the only con I have about these, other than the high price.Overall they sound great. You get to hear every single detail that the artist wanted you to hear.. Its amazing in comparison to my iPhone 5's ear-buds.Pros: great audio quality, nice bass, built of solid material, comes with neat accessoriesCons: High price, and a little uncomfortableOverall: If you have some money to spend, and like beats I greatly recommend getting these they're great, you wont be disappointed.

VIf you're looking for a headphone with powerful bass and clean sound that is yet stylish and comfortable, you can make your choice right now.The Beats Pro By Dr. Dre is a headphone with incredible sound quality that makes you hear the music just the way the artist wants you to - crystal clear. You can hear all the instruments and sounds at their time, still having the perfect balance between a powerful bass and a clean treble. Some people may find it too heavy but it doesn't really bother me.Its very long cable gives you the freedom to move and walk around and it is very durable because of its metal construction.It has its Patent-Pending Dual Input/Output Cable that let you plug your headphone cable into one earcup, automatically turning the other into an output port.I'm a very demanding person when it comes to sound quality and I have found myself more than satisfied with this headphones.I really thank Monster and Dr. Dre (who is a great artist) for the great work but I really think a headphone like this should come with a hard case.

VI'm a pro dj and I have to say these headphones really are impressive. I have always used Technics, Sony, Pioneer and Allen & Heath headphones and right away one big difference is the construction. Every dj set of headphones is always made with plastic. These beauty's are made with nice aluminum metal. I can't tell you how many times I have seen other dj's with broken headphones from the plastic bands and connectors breaking. Then you start to see dj's with tape holding the headphones together. The beats pro are solid. Now sound wise they have great bass which I always like when I'm spinning at a loud club since hearing clear bass notes helps you beat match for mixing. Overall great buy but I don't think I like the price tag of $400. reagular high end dj headphones will cost you between $130-220, i would say an extra $100 would be ok for material costs so a pair of these beats might be better if they were priced at $300. The extra $100 is probably for the dr dre branding making them the $400 they cost.

VFirst off these headphones are amazing.. You need to use them for a couple of hours and once those speakers loosen up it produces amazing sound... I dont know why people complain about the bass.. They are not bass heavy. The bass is perfect. I expected WAY more bass from other reviews.. Vocals and instruments are clear. You can always use eq to adjust them to your pref. Great pair of headphones. Comfortable and sturdy. been using them for hours now  no problems...Just be warned! the first pair i got were actually fakes! they look almost exactly the same! But the sound its worst and they hurt your ears after use more than 1 or so... So make sure you get the real ones or you will surely be disappointed.. I have a suspicion that most of the people writing bad reviews might have fakes..Make sure your headphones had the serial number on them and the inside of the box where manuals are etc.. says Sound Matters.

Vhey guys! after reading all the reviews before me about the pros really said it all, it is seemed that all of us has issues with comfort at the first few uses of the pros, everybody is different. some says they are just fine and comfy after few hours using it, while others not. for me it is like a shoe that you have to break it in, it is really uncomfortable in long hours or few hours over your head, but the funny thing is that you will slowly get used to the weight after a few uses. nothing is perfect theres always a downside to everything, its all about personal preferences. but overall performance of the Pros really is one of the best and stylish headphones i've ever owned. My advice before buying is to try them out at Best Buy and see if its really for you. Coz i dont want you to enjoy the sound quality while your head in pain, but again you really have to break it in(my opinion). Enjoy guys and congratulations for the purchase...Mabuhay ang taga Mandaue Cebu!!!

Not really dissappointed because the headsets look so sturdy and not flimsy at all, they look like they will last forever! so the hard packaging wasn't really a necesity but still it would be a nice plus because they are so expensive...  Sound wise, they are great. The bass is Mind blowing, the mids are incredibly clear and the highs are just right. you can distinguish each instrument perfectly and the vocals are super clear. I wish i could turn the volume up more but its ok... Comfortable wise, after a while it feels heavy on your ears but u get used to it after a few days wearing them for hours :). I will update in the future about how they have been but for now 5/5!

VI got mine from Best Buy a few days ago...They have a great EQ and allow you to hear all the sound from your audio source. The only thing that bothers me is the ear-cups. The speakers press slightly on your ears while the circumaural doesn't match all ear contours. That aside, the ear-cup style allows for passive noise cancellation, meaning it blocks out a good amount sound, but not all.~-^-~Is it worth the price? Not entirely, as you're mainly paying for the brand name. However, IF you have the money, it IS worth the investment.How is the sound quality? Coming from someone who listens to a wide variety of genres, I would say it has supreme sound.How comfortable are they? They're okay. As for the headband, it could use more cushion. The ear-cups work for what they are.~-^-~-Overall Ratings-Sound: 5/5Comfort: 3/5Style: 5/5Loudness: 5/5Durability: 5/5~-^-~3.6 stars

VI feel sorry for the people that are taken by these glamour headphones. These headphones are not designed for anything but a small sampling of music and they still are not even close to comparable to some nice Beyer's or Senn's in the price range. Beats made Dre a billionaire. Beats are hot garbage produced at the lowest price point possible. Cheap cheap cheap. Even the Pro's are barely a step up. You certainly don't have the best audio engineers in the business working at Beats I will tell you that much with certainty. It's pretty insane that people buy these are 350 and actually think they are worth it. I bet they make these for about 40 bucks at most with very little engineering put into anything. Will fall apart within a year or so of heavy listening. My main idea though is WHY would you want these when the big boys in headphones make something better for cheaper? I guess these are better than their normal phones which are even worse in SQ.

p775

VMy first reaction when I bought these headphones was that they hurt my ears extremely bad if I wore them for more than 10 minutes, however the sound was of superior quality.  It has been about a year and a half now and the pain isn't as bad anymore and probably takes more like 45 minutes for them to start hurting.  However the speaker inside the headphones keeps falling out and I have to take them apart and put them back in their slot, also the cords break fast, I've gone through about 3 of them.  I am looking on amazon right now for new headphones to buy because the sound quality has somewhat gone down and I want something that has more comfort as well as better sound quality.  Overpriced by a longshot, there are way better headphones out that for half the price you just have to do a little more research.  Beats are more of a stylish name brand than an actual sound luxurious pair of headphones.

VI received these for christmas two years ago. I'm a heavy user and I requested these headphones under the belief that they would be durable and would be more cost effective in the long run.  Boy was I wrong, the cord wore out after 2mo. Getting a new brand name cords for these is incredibly hit or miss and more than I'd like to pay. Last time I saw the cord in stock it was $40 (refurb), checking regularly I've seen it in stock/listed maybe two or three times in the last two years. Last convo with customer service they had no idea when they'd be in stock again. Why can't this company keep an integral SEPARATE component in stock?Maybe others have had a better experience, but I'm done. At least with the new version of the bose headphones I used to wear I can get a replacement cord for $5.00 and in my experience even with heavy wear their cords don't wear out after 2mo.

VWell at first I was a bit skeptical about spending 400 bucks on a pair of headphones but I'm glad I did. While Beats are commonly known for too much bass that issue is long gone with these. Trust me if you have had previously purchased beats and we're unhappy like myself you won't be disappointed here. Now this isn't for everyone. This is for two types of people. The people who use these for their job such as a dj and for the people that have money to spend. Sound wise I give them a 9/10 while it's great it's not perfect. As far as noise reduction these get a 10, once above 60% volume the only thing you here is music. However when it comes to sound leakage these receives a 7 because by 75% volume anyone next to you might ask if you can turn it down. In the end I rate these a solid 8 out of 10. They are near perfect and only have a few flaws.

VI own these headphones for a year now and I still did not find any replacement product on the market.But first of all if you want to use them as studio headphone you should pass.These are made to "change" the music and I do like the way they made it sound.The bass are quite heavy but since I'm listing to a lot of hip hop and "modern" music that a good point and that's what I like.But even if you are listening to adele or Ellie Goulding you will be impressed by the sound quality.There is a HUDGE difference between these and the other beats models, I hate the sound of the "regular" beats headphones.They are pretty heavy too but I can easily use then for a 12 hours flight without any issue, you just have to be used to.

Vthe headphones are, at best, decent. they're very heavy which gets uncomfortable after a while, and after a,certain period of time I start to get dizzy almost. that may be the fit or the weight but whatever it is leaves me feeling a little naucious almost. the biggest thing that drops my rating for this headphone is really the way it functions after just a month. I use them regularly, and take good care of them. they haven't been dropped once and still, there seems to be a hissing in them even when my phone is at about 50% volume. never had this problem with my Parrot Zik headphones. or even my Beats Mixr headphones for that matter. so I've been very pleased with the Beats line up before and I'm not trying to take value away from the name, I just expected a $400 pair of headphones to last me a little more than a month.

Not saying that the beats don't have any noise isolation!At half volume, you won't hear a thing outside of these headphones unless someones screaming or something! I've also worn these on airplanes with an airline adapter that I picked up at the stores, and they literally block out most of the cabin noise.The bass is just unbelievable. I play some of my Dubstep, House, Techno, Hip-Hop, Ambient, Classical, and even Vocal songs on these headphones, and I can tell you right now, they sound fantastic.

VOk,  Let me first say that your mileage may vary.  I might have gotten a bad pair but here are my opinions on the Beats:I tried them in Best Buy before buying them.  I ordered on Amazon because they actually had the "all white" in stock.  In the store, they sounded pretty darn good.  But that's when they are hooked up to 'their' display with whatever EQ settings and songs that are optimized for the Beats.Pros:  Built like brick "S" housesCons:  Sound isn't what you'd expect to get for $400 headphonesOh they clamp!!!!  The pair in Best Buy are beat to hell and easy to adjust, stretched, etc.  Breaking these puppies in would take a while.I might try the Studios instead.  A review that I found later suggest only DJs need get the Pros.  I think they are right.A friend of mine suggests that I try "Grados?".

p831
sg5
V-The first pair I bought broke upon opening. They are extremely uncomfortable if worn for more than a few minutes.-The sound quality is really good, but not really any better than the studios. They are marketed as "Professional Headphones" but they have an overwhelming amount of bass, which should NOT be the preset for headphones intended to be used for production (mixing, mastering etc.) The bass simply seems to drown out all the other sounds. The higher frequencies are not very clear or pronounced.-Beats is obviously known for being overpriced and this is no exception. I would only recommend this product if you don't mind spending a ton of money for an attractive big name headphone and find a harder build comfortable. The reason these are so popular is obviously the name and the high bass.

VAmazing headphones. It's durable, aesthetically pleasing and comfortable during long hours of wear. I can have them on for practically a full work day. The sound quality for the average person is amazing. I've owned Bose AE2i audio headphones for 3 years and I've always thought for $200 they were overpriced and cheaply made. (It broke after one drop to the floor, but I taped it together) The sound was good but I couldn't keep the headphones on for more than a couple of hours since it hurt my ears too much. I've upgraded to Beats Pro-High Performance and am not disappointed in the least. If you don't spending the money and you want something durable with good sound as an average consumer, who loves music, then these are the headphones for you. It even comes with a mini travel sac to place your headphones in!

VBorrowed this headphones for a few weeks since this was supposed to be a much better product than the original Beats.The Beats Pro are trendy and seem to be built of a stronger material than the original Beats. Other than that, I find them over-hyped and overpriced. While the bass is pretty impressive, I can't say much about the mid and high ranges, since you can't really hear it due to the bass taking over. I guess this might be OK for some people, but why pay $399 if you can only hear half of the music.For that sound quality I would compare them to $100-$150 cans from professional brands like Audio-Technica, Denon, Ultrasone, Grado, AKG, Beyerdynamic, Sennheiser, etc (Beats by Dr. Dre are not professional, and no respectable studio uses them).

VIn my opinion everything is good(e.g. durability and sound quality) except for comfort.for me the beats pro starts to hurt my ears after 3-4hrs of use. these headphones do put a lot of pressure inwards around your ears, so unless your ears are flushed against your head, from what i can tell there's no way that you're not not going to feel the pain. another thing is that these headphones are fairly heavy from the metal construction. it makes the top band weigh down on your head, which eventually will get uncomfortable and maybe slightly painful.for $400...all i can say is just think carefully and decided if comfort is a major factor for you.

I also have Mackie SRM 450, Mackie SRM 350 and Pioneer S-DJ08 speakers for Djing and to practice so it's not like I can't hear what sounds great or bad.If you desire them, buy them.

Every day a few hours. And I took them with me, wherever I went.But THOSE headphones... they are as solid as headphones ever could be. They truly feel indestructible.The sound is great, too. I wouldn't expect anything else for 400$.Additionaly, they look stylish. Now that I wear those headphones, not only chicks, also dudes turn around to get a look at me! ;-)If you got the money, if you praise durability as much as I do- get em!

VBest DJ head phones hands down if your an actual DJ who spin at clubs and bars. Especially for $300 I got it for. Very loud and bass heavy and the folding cups with dual cord jacks on each side are nice features. I do not recommend this for average consumer using for listening to music daily on a smart phone. It's not made for that purpose. If your device does not support the quarter inch jack, you're not going get the full effect of the head phones. It's on the heavy side it's not made for casual listening. For mobile djs, it's built to last. My original Beats pro from 2011 is still working great. This non Monster version also seem to have improved sound qualify as well. Very happy with this purchase.

Not to mention the Beats Pro are incredibly uncomfortable (apparently the newer version is more "comfortable" than previous models, don't even wanna think about how uncomfortable those must have been...) only pro i can possibly think of is that they're incredibly sturdy. Nonetheless i had these returned right away and exchanged them for a pair of Sony MDR-XB950BT ($169) and was extremely happy

VThese headphones are great. The sound quality is impeccable and you can't hear any outside noise at all. The swivel feature is nice because it lets me listen to my music, but still be aware of what others around me are saying and doing. The only problems are that since they are made out of metal, they are a little heavy and thus should not be worn for extended periods of time. However, this makes them very durable. The fabric pouch it comes in isn't that good either, but it doesn't really matter. I think these are great headphones for anyone looking for good quality over-ear headphones, much better than the studios.

VEven if you have discerning ears this headphones are overpriced and you are better off getting any other brand for half-price. You will not get the boom-boom-pow that this headphones provide, but you will get a full range of frequencies. The Beats Pro are heavy and the pressure agains the ears is overdone, they become uncomfortable after about 15-20 minutes of usage depending on your level of tolerance to pain. I guess you can force-expand the head band but who wants to work that hard. They do block some of the outside sound but you can still hear dogs barking in the neighborhood.

VFirst off, let me start by saying all of the people that have said that "beats are over-priced" and "they are not worth it", they are completely wrong. These headphones are very good ad deliver the sound I intended for them to. They definetly lives up to and exceeded my expectations. I had bought refurbished beats pro. The Only ba part about my purchase was the way they came. They had hair on the ear ups and smears. But hey, I got them for a whopping $274. After sanitizing them extensively, I tried them out I see if they lived up to their expectations. HREAT HEADPHONES!!

VThese headphones are honestly the best over ear I have bought. Sadly everything must have a down side. The Con would be that if you where them for long periods of time then they cause some discomfort to your neck muscles. This would mean that like with a video game you need to take a break from wearing them periodicaly. Sound is amazing, duriblity is great I have had mine for 2+ years know and still going strong. These headphone can be for anyone, but mostlikely it will not be for everybody due to price.I hope this review was helpful.Thanks for reading.

VI debated on what level Dr Dre headphones to get for a while.  I am very happy I picked these.  I love the fit and the joint on the sides that allows the headphone to swing up and away from the ear.  If you are serious about your music and/or are a professional who is getting pad to work with music (e.g. DJ, Producer) i would recommend these.  However if you are a casual music listener I would suggest getting the step down from these.  Not a knock on these headphones at all, they are just very pricey.  But i am proud to say I feel like i got what I paid for.

VThe Beats By Dr. Dre Pros (white) are amazing and they sound great. They are built like a tank. The only complaint is that the headphones are on the heavy side and get uncomfortable after about 3-4 hours of constant use, but other wise it is tolerable when listening to awesome sound that comes out of these great headphones. This product would be great for professional DJ's or just the everyday music lovers!

VBeats Pro by Dre Review
p958
sg5
VBeats Pro is the latest headphone by Dr.Dre and i wanted to give you guys a review!Pros: Very sturdy, made of metal, great sound quality, comfortable, ear cups can spinCons: Pretty heavy, travel case (bag) is terribleThe bottom line: The Beats Pro by Dre from Monster deliver a sturdy design and top-notch sound quality for those who enjoy skull-shattering bass. If you're a casual listener and can afford them, they're a worthy investment, but if you're an audio purist then you may want to buy something else, like the Bose Quiet Comforts.

VSturdy headphones, cheap carrying bag, a little bass heavy but nothing that some adjustments can't fix when listening to ipod or whatever.  As for the studio, these aren't the best for acoustic productions but they won't disappoint too much either. They are a little on the pricey side.  Wearing for long periods at a time, these can become uncomfortably tight on me... but maybe I just have a big head.  Not the best when wearing glasses but what over-ear headphones are in that case.  I enjoy them for the most part.

If you buy headphones because you want to put more money in LeBron's pocket, then buy these. Everyone who know ANYTHING laughs at Beats.

p990
sg5
VThese headphones sounded quite nice, albeit a little overpowering on the bass side and a little muddy when it comes to rock music, but then again they are targeted for pop and hip-hop music anyways. The main problem is the leather is actually very hard and since the cups are round and very small, they crush your ears and it hurts very quickly. Also, the headphones are VERY heavy. Solid build quality, but these are just too heavy and compressing to be comfortable.

p996
sg5
VSo, was super excited to get this as a gift. But unfortunately they are a little heavy for my head. After taking them off it feels like pressure is released! Also, after the 2nd day red lubricant from where the screws are holding the ear piece leaked and stained onto the white ear cups- which is annoying if you want to keep them clean! Couldn't get the stain off. Leaks red lubricant on both ears. Returned it for original beats.Hope this review was helpful.

VThe sound quality is wonderful.  The description said that the headphones did not need batteries for a noise cancelling feature as the headphones were well padded.  True, but not quite padded enough to cancel out my sometimes noisy neighbors.  I guess I was hoping for something more along the lines of ear protection you find with headphones you use on the gun range.  Now those do cancel out more ambient noise.  I am pleased with the headphones though.

They cost a lot of money, and I hated to see his disappointment on his birthday.  Oh well, I learned my lesson.

I dropped them once on its bottom when both earcans were folded up. They dtill flip up and down but it made a dent in the aluminum. Warranty is also very crappy. If you didn't touch the box, you can return it, but you can't return it at all or get a replacement if you damage it.

VThree stars, because while these are classified as over the ear headphones, they are the opposite of that (over the ear). I own Studio Wired and Wireless, and I will say these sound different, but its not enough to buy these over the cheaper wireless over the ear studios, or on the ear if they don't give you a headache. Otherwise, they fit right into the beats family.

VBeats by Dr. Dre Headphones Are a Game Changer
p1082
sg5
VYou have seen them on the heads of pro athletes, celebrities, and urban commuters. These stylish headphones with the bright red lower case "b" on them. Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are quickly becoming the must have accessory for the audiophile. We needed to find out what makes these headphones so sought after so we gave a pair a run for their money.The look: When we liberated the Beats by Dr. Dre headphones from their box you could instantly see you are dealing with a high quality piece of equipment. The headphones are made out of lightweight aluminum, held together by what looks like steel rivets. Despite the heavy metal look of the headphones, Beats by Dr. Dre are light and very comfortable. The ultra padded ear cups fit nicely over the ear cutting out most outside noise. If you do need to monitor the room, each cup is on a swivel.The part of the design I like the best is the removable audio cable. The part on any pair of headphones most likely to go is the cord. Once the cord is gone, the headphones are gone. Beats by Dr. Dre have solved this issue with a removable audio cable, which can be plugged into the left or right earpiece.The sound: I listened to a range of music with the Beats by Dr. Dre. Every style was clear and crisp. When listening to Gov't Mule's breakout CD Dose the bass was so clear I could swear I could tell what kind of amp the bassist was playing through. I could hear the distinct punch of 10 inch speakers - could Allen Woody be playing through an Ampeg SVT? Upon doing a bit of research Allen Woody does play Ampeg don't know if he used a SVT on for this recording but these headphone are giving me the most realistic bass I have ever heard in a pair of cans.I had the same experiences listening to Hip Hop, Jazz and Rock. I was noticing nuances that I have never hear on disks I have been listening to for years. As I closed my eyes I could visualize the music, I felt as if I opened my eyes the musicians would be in the room surrounding me.I also gave the Beats by Dr. Dre a bit of a workout doing some music production. When mixing down studio projects I found the Beats by Dr. Dre to be just as true as my reference monitors. The big difference being Beats by Dr. Dre allowed me to focus on the stereo separation in my mix.Where I really had fun with these headphones was plugging them into my VOX amPlug metal practice headset guitar amp. My Gibson Les Paul sounded like it was hitting me in the back of the head. After a while I forgot I even had the headset on and felt like I was standing in front of a wall of concert amps with 12 inch speakers. Once again, I could almost see the stacks of amps if I closed my eyes.Overall: In my years of music production, performance, and listening, I have never experienced a set of headphones that change the game as drastically as Beats by Dr. Dre. These headphone make me want to revisit my entire music collection to see what else I have missed in my favorite songs.For the review we demod the Beats by Dr. Dre Pro which have a street price of around $399 and they are worth every penny. These are the last set cans you will ever have to buy.

But $450 is way too much for this headphone. I would say $200 would be right.but im not complaining because I bought it and I love the way it sounds. Its loud and built to last.

VI would have never considered to get the beats unless they were half the price, and for some reason these are 250, considered that retail is 500$, excellent quality and sound, comfort varies for people but for me they fit quiet nice. Bass is intense in these headphones, I drum with this headphones and its everything I wanted.

VBest Headphones on the Market!!!!
p1192
sg5
VCons:ExpensivePros:Worth Every Penny and Are the Best headphones on the market today!I am someone who loves to listen to music and wants to experience it the best way possible. When looking for headphones I wanted something that would do the trick. These headphones were exactly that! I wanted something that would bring my music to life while I created it. I use these all the time when I'm creating music or listening to music because when you listen to music you don't want to experience it without these. I have tried almost every other high brand of headphones on my search to find the perfect ones that were stylish for my taste. My dad owned the Bose headphones which are great but these are just as good if not better and look 3x better.Price:The price of these headphones are pretty high but you get exactly what you pay for trust me. If you get these headphones i guarantee that they will not let you down. The price of $399 is like a car payment for some if not more. These will always be around for you years in advanced and will most likely be the best on the market even in the next 5 years. There other products by beats by Dre and if you wanted to go for the lower product they work just as good but will not cover your ear fully and the base inside won't be as noise cancel affective as these are. So they are expensive but you get all the money within these headphones. if you are a music junky these will satisfy your music experience.Colors:These Headphones come in any color you want. You can even go online and customize your own to fit your personality if you choose. I personally went with the all red ones and wear them any chance i get when I'm listening to music. In stock their are 4 colors All red, White, Black, and red with black trim. I like that about these headphones then others is that they stand out from the all metallic/black color of the Bose headphones and the cheap material of the skull candy ones.Durability:I have had these headphones going on for 2 years and they haven't missed a beat. They are very durable and will only break if you intentionally try to break them. I have dropped it a number of times onto hard surfaces and they haven't cracked, chipped paint, or even lost sound inside the beats. These are made out of pure steel and aluminum so breaking these are not an option. They are easily accessible when you are putting them away just fold the ear flaps into the headphones for easy storage.Sound:The sound of these headphones are easy to sum up. They are noise canceling headphones that do the job. When you hear about noise canceling headphones you might think that they are just saying that for market use but these are indefinitely noise candling. When I bought them I put them to the test when walking through the mall or even into school with 1000's of students and I could not hear my friends yell for my name until they came up to me and tapped me onto the shoulder. I have missed phone calls and people knocking onto my apartment door because these are so great for noise cancelation. If feel like you are in your own world!Compact:You might be wondering oh they are too big! Yes they are a little big but there is not a time when you cannot wear them. If you don't mind sweating on them you could even wear them working out. Your sweat will not damage the headphones but I recommend cleaning them with a towel when finished so you don't get sweat marks. They fold easily and are easy to put into your room, dresser, or case. They are not to big and to heavy and compact for any situation. I personally put them into a case which i carry around and can easily go into a backpack with other items easily.These are great headphones and are worth every single penny. I hope this review helps for some and recommend this item to anybody wanting to break the bank on the best headphones in the world today.

VFull Disclosure: I purchased these Beats Pros (black) for the main purpose of plugging it into my guitar effects pod for some late-night sessions without waking the neighbors. That's why it gets 5 stars from me. But I can see how these headphones wouldn't be for everyone. With that said, I do find myself using these as my main headphones at home and would probably give them 4.5 stars for that.Sound: I was a bit worried from some comments about too much bass but I don't hear it. I think those people mistake what On-Ear/Around-Ear headphones are trying to do. There's gonna be more low-end because they're trying to replicate what a 2500 watt stereo system would do...but without the hassle of cops coming over. I've listened to about every genre there is without missing a sound that the artists were after. If it's Rap, you'll get that boomin bass. If it's Rock/Metal you'll get as much guitar as you could ever dream of...with that bass-line just groovin behind it. It does Country music justice. Classical music comes through nicely...if you have the volume up enough for those very subtle notes.That brings me to the only real drawback for the Sound. If you're using a phone/ipod to listen to subtle music you'll have to max out the volume to push the speakers enough. That will cause a battery drain.Build: These bad boys look/feel like they'd survive a Zombie Apocalypse. Big, sturdy, well built...but you do know you're wearing headphones. Not so heavy that it's distracting. Even the cables are heavy duty & tangle-free. Mine came with the coiled 1/4" adapter cable and the mic/volume cable. Being detachable is a real plus, along with lockable into the headphones.But I could see where certain people might not like the feel of them. They do clamp down on you so if your ears stick out and/or have a really round head it would certainly become uncomfortable. First prolonged listening I had some discomfort after an hour or so. But found that if you shift the cans back it took the pressure off the ears and I can go multiple hours without a break.

Vwhat every Beats product should be like
p1202
sg5
VI really wish this product was indicative of the Beats brand as a whole but these are a cut above the rest. Very expensive, embodies true Beats sound quality, very flashy. To start off, these are not cheap. I don't think anyone could so easily drop $400 on a pair of over ear headphones without feeling a bit uneasy and having 2nd thoughts. But being a Beats fan I just had to have these no matter the cost. Cost ties into sound quality so how good is it? Well that depends on what you're listening to. Basically, if I had never listened to a Beats product before, these are exactly how I'd think it'd sound like from the hype. As far as using these for hip-hop, pop and mainstream media, I don't think I've ever used a better pair of over ears. These headphones have just the right high end punchiness of bass, good mids-highs to give you clear high sound quality. I can tell you I was more than satisfied hearing just how much better my old music sounded with these. Does a good job differentiating instruments within a song, average to good, definitely not on the level of higher end Audio Technicas or Senns.  You can tell the drivers are powerful, which could be a downside due to it being battery-less and draws battery from the source it is plugged into, but so far hasn't been an issue or noticeable. Also, these are amazing for just listening to youtube vids radio or even movies. In short, yes these are the lone Beats product I would actually recommend to someone for the sound quality alone. Build Quality is very high quality as it should be for a pair of $400 headphones. The Lil Wayne Red Black edition are just flat-out sexy in real life as they are in the pictures. Cushioning feels good on the ears not great. I have to admit I did feel some discomfort after wearing these for a while, but it got better after adjusting the length. This is a common complaint as the inner part of the earcups are just to close to the opening so your ears are going to be sitting flush to it eventually causing discomfort. In conclusion, if you have the money to drop on these, do it. You won't be disappointed. Don't think that these are on the same level as other Beat products such as the studios or solos hd, these are on a whole other level.

VOverpriced and underperforming
p1208
sg5
VSo I am a video producer and editor, and I have used a large number of different brands and styles of headphones.  I saw these were reviewed pretty well so I took a chance, and I was extremely underwhelmed by what I got.They look cool, but I don't really care about that.  They also seem to last fairly long, as I have had them for two months now with no issues, and my daughter has been using them for the last three weeks with no issues either.  They fit okay, but as everything is metal they are a bit heavy for extended periods.  But for $400, I am not paying them to look good and last long, I am paying for premium sound.  The bass on these drowns out every other part of the sound.  Fidelity is way off.  Might be good for people who like that sort of thing, but if you want true sound and you rely on true sound, then stay away.  Stay far, far away.  You can get any number of brands, AKG, Sennheiser, Bose, that all sound much better and much more true to the reality.  Hell, you can find a hundred dollar pair of AKGs and it will sound better.

VOk I have had a LOT of diffrent headphones every bose headphones out there (qc 1,2,3,15's ect)and i like these the best I had the studios also right before these Pros and YES if you are going to use them for your phone or ipod the studios might be better for you. You will lose the mic for your phone and they dont sound AS LOUD as studios (studios are amplified and noise can.) THAT doesnt mean that they dont sound BETTER though i think the quality of sound is better in the Pros there just not as loud on your phone or ipod the quality is 2nd to none really well built will last forever flip up ear cup is a nice addition I didnt like the button on the studios that you have to hold to keep muted. I love the pros they fold easier then studos and the studios did not take a beating like these will I use them everyday and they have no sign of wear i think thge ear cups are comfortable they are tight to your head as to keep background noise out without the noise can. part so you migth want to try them out at best buy first if they have them. Also the cord is aweosme too i love how long it is it isnt too long or too short great job Dre! now get your new album out to listen with them I have had these since I could get them from best buy in oct btw

VBest Headphones I've Ever Owned
p1271
sg5
V3 years later and these are still my favorite headphones. Only show of wear/tear is in the headband (the faux-leather cover is tattered around corners) - but otherwise, these things are *indestructible* and are the best-sounding headphones I've ever owned. I'm a software developer and use these almost daily while working.They sound amazing - very nice balance across the range. Unlike other Beats products that I've tried, the sound has crips highs/mids AND deep bass. Beats often exert a dull sound because of the amped up bass, but not these! Movies and beat-heavy music really make these headphones shine, but most other audio plays really well too.Construction is amazing. I've crushed, dropped, and twisted these things while traveling daily. I even got them wet once and they came back to life (although I wouldn't recommend you try testing that again). The cord is thick and durable, and the spiral on one end has saved me many times - prevents me from pulling laptops/phones/tablets across the room when I forget to take off the headphones. The ability to fold them up also helps when shoving them into luggage/backpacks/wherever.The only negative aspect is that they are on the heavier side, and may be a bit uncomfortable for first-time users as they do exert some pressure on your ears. It took me some time to get used to them.They are on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for in this case! Highly recommended for people seeking high audio performance and strong construction/longevity.

VPaying for the name
p1301
sg5
VI would like to start out by saying that you are paying for the name. $400 for head phones?!?! Are they insane? I would like to know how much it really costs to make them and then see their profit. I know we would all be baffled at how many people fall for this trick just because they want to wear Beats. The signature 'b' must say something about a person's character. They can't even be seen with someone wearing head phones from Sony because it may ruin their reputation.Lets talk about comfort. You would think that paying $400 for Beats, they must be like heaven on your ears. Wrong again! They squeeze your head and after a couple hours, your ears may be numb!The sound is quit phenomenal until you're listening to Andrea Bocelli's, The Prayer, and the base is beating your brains out of your head. Then it is not so enjoyable.You would think that when you're paying $400 for ear phones, there will be some catch: water proof, blue tooth, or maybe even wifi.... NO. You get nothing but a cord you have to plug into your other device that is, more likely than not, at least $200-$400. So what I'm still confused about is why people still buy these?

VI like that this set of headphones don't need batteries like the Beats Studio, however my only complain is that they can be a bit heavy, and when DJ'ing they will slip off from time to time.  A must buy, especially if perfect Sound is required.

VI am a musician, mixer, remixer and producer. These headphones are garbage. I bought these as another reference to my music, not studio headphones. My own music sounds terrible on them. They were promptly returned. They are not worth more than $50. In fact, a pair of JVC headphones for less than $60 were better. Do not even consider buying these if you truly like the sound of music. They are a waste of money. Dre should be ashamed of himself. But all he cares about is you giving him his money.  So he wins.

VGreat Pro-sumer headphones....too costly for what you get!!!
p1477
sg5
VThese headphones are great. They built quality of these beats are the toughest I have ever seen, being biult using a thick aluminum frame. The leather-ish ear covers and headband do offer a degree of comfort, however they do get uncomforteable after a long period of listening. Every sounds can be heard with clarity in these headphones. The bass is very smooth, no matter how loud they are, and will not over power the other instruments, as they do with the studios. They cable is very long and doesnt tangle. And they carrying case is a big added convenience if you want to just throw these in your bag and go.As a few side notes, while these headphones are aesthetically attractive, as mentioned in the review, they do lack comfort after a while. They say you can use these for professional purposes such as DJing and producing, but I highly doubt that serious musicians use these professionally. There are options out there such as Sony, Sennheiser and Grado that will give you the same quality or more for cheaper than 400 dollars.

VThe beats pro headphone are very will built, with superior sounds. These are mainly for musician or hardcore music lovers. If your not into music as much than I suggest you to go buy some skull candy,because 400 dollar for a pair of headphone is pretty pricey.Even though it's 400 dollars, every penny you spent is worth it. If you are those person that always drops stuff accidentally then these are the one just for you, if not than you can put your money down on the studio since there quality are about the same and your pretty much paying those extra for pro on no batteries needed, long lasting, and tough built. These headphone are for those who likes to listen to hip hop, electronic music, and rock music. They're like earmuff when you put them on and they sound so amazing that you just don't want to take them off. This is a great buy if your willing to spend 400 on a pair of headphone.

VI have been using these for almost a week and now know the truth. Dr. Dre is just a marketer. He isn't serious about making a good set of headphones. For a Beats product, I almost wonder if Beats even tested them. They are HORRIBLE. Compared with my $20 Philips earbuds and $40 Koss Porta Pros, the Beats headphones are garbage. First, they weigh a ton. I can't wear them longer than 10-15 minutes because they are so tight that I always get a headache. It feels like a 10-ton vise being applied to the skull. And worse, when you lean over to read a magazine, they slide over your forehead! For the price, it's such a ripoff. The sound quality is just bad. The Koss and Phillips buds sounded well balanced and clear without the bass drowning everything out. With the Beats skullcrushers, you feel like you're in a tunnel with someone who has a cold singing with his/her lips smashed against the microphone. Also, the bass, treble and all other sounds are "off." Listen to the music with another kind of headphones and you'll notice instantly that the music doesn't sound normal on these. It also severely reduces the vocals and lowers the singer's tone of voice! Overall, the worst headphones I've ever come across.DO NOT buy these unless you can pay less than $75 for them. They are ridiculously overpriced and you need a VERY fat head to wear them because the band keeps sliding around because of the weight (you cannot adjust the band and it's covered with leather. Will probably never buy anything with "Beats" or "Dr Dre" on them again. I strongly suggest you skip these. Look at Koss, Phillips or Bose. They're light years ahead in terms of sound and a lot cheaper!

VI just got them in November 3 2010. First of all they almost blew my eardrums, when i plugged them into my ipod touch i did not notice the volume was on high and boom. So make sure your volume is on low. They sound great lots of power, and surprisingly comfortable no pressure on my head. The headset is well made and would last for a while.The bad is that it leaks sound in a major way and if I had a choice to do it again i would get something else that does not leak as much.  So if you ride the subway or on a plane be aware.

VI was able to find this pair of headphones for about $250.00. I like them so far though i have noticed that they are quite heavier than your average headphones. but i wont be complaining about that, the way i see it, it is worthy. no battery and no need to worry about breaking them because they are solid.the sound is good, the bass is difinately a plus especially if you are listening to Hip-Hop. You have to remember these headphones are meant to enhance your music experience and not make a poor quality song sound great.anyways, i gave it a 4 for design, and sound quality. with these headphones you are buying a brand name, the sound and the design mostly. however, i have heard the same quality of sound on cheaper headphones like the ones sony makes.

VProponents won't want to hear this, but tough. The Beats brand--which, make no mistake, is primarily, if almost solely about branding--has no traction in the realm of quality audio. Their best model matches the fidelity of any budget set in the $50-$80 range. In general, they sound like ass. The objective is to market a "wearable" with an obvious trademark. They cannot begin to compete with lower-priced models like the Beyerdynamics DT990 Pros, let alone the top offerings of AKG, Grado, Sennheiser or Beyer, enclosed or open-cup. They are cheap approximations made in China for $18 a pop, of average comfort and durability. Overpriced at $100, obscene at $300, and beyond the pale at $445. Kid stuff. But not for my kids.

VI just got my hands on my first pair of Beats By Dre. Until this day, I've never heard the sound quality that they have so I don't have anything to compare it to; but what I can say is, all day since I got them this afternoon I've been listening to them..with different genres of music to identify the quality. I'd say it's fantastic! They're also very durable. A little heavy but it's made from the same metal that guns have so you would expect that. I did think there was going to be more bass than what it has (for what its worth); however, there is enough for you to enjoy. I'm glad I've finally joined the "Beats Army"!

Not fair I say, but if you like your music balanced and everything in its place, this headphone is for you. For now, I just turn up the volume on everything and get my Q-tips ready just in case.

VProbably the best marketed product since the pet rock but for the money they're absolutely terrible. For $400 one would expect full range, bright BIG music. Instead you get muddled stereo sound with above average bass response. Not even full bass, just low. Mid bass is nowhere to be found. As many reviewers have already mentioned,  these are anything but "Pro." You can purchase studio quality sound from Pioneer,  Harmon Kardon, Behringer or Polk for half the price and get thrice the product. Save your money.

VLove At First Listen
p2044
sg5
VFirst of all, the mediocre to downright BAD BAD BAD reviews of these headphones amazes me!  I'm a professional radio broadcaster and have worn so many different headphones on the air in the 42 years I've been at it; from Sennheiser to AKG to KOSS to SONY to BOSE and I have to say, THESE headphones scream QUALITY and sound great; i.e. presence in sound is most important!  My all-time favorite closed cup cans are the SONY MDR-7506's.  They are supreme.  I've been trying to find another brand of headphones that closely approximates the MDR's. I was extremely disappointed in the closed-cup Sennheiser HD280's.  They were very hollow sounding; same with the Bose headphones I had; hollow and no presence.  The BEATS are amazing.  I am very pleased with not only the sound, but the super high quality craftsmanship.  Unlike MOST headphones, these are all leather and metal.  I usually buy back-up pairs of headphones I like, just in case of breakage but only one pair of these are needed.  The reviewers that put these cans down must have gotten knock-offs.  Believe me, as a user of headphones for over four decades, THESE are right up there with the best I've ever heard.  I can't say enough about the build quality either.  These are like tanks; the "Mercedes-Benz" of headphones.  You can replace the ear pads AND the cord!  As I mentioned, I've been a huge fan of the SONY MDR-7506's and highly recommend them if you don't want to spend the 400 dollars on the BEATS PRO, BUT, the SONY's cord is not replaceable, the SONY also has a very thin wire that connects the right and left cups through the headband that has always struck me as very fragile, and the SONY's also have plastic parts.  They SOUND fabulous, BUT, with the BEATS PRO, you get the GREAT sound of the SONY's PLUS the sturdy and what seems like indestructalble build with NO flimsy parts/wires that could make you need to get another pair.  I LOVE these BEAT PROS!!!!  I have no idea why these get a few horrible reviews.  Don't listen!!!  If you're an audiophile and a fan of headphones....go to these or the SONY MDR-7506's if you're on a budget.  You get what you pay for and the BEAT PROS are wonderful, sound-wise AND build-wise.  LOVE 'EM!!!!  PS: the pouch it comes with to store them and carry them around is also quality.  It's handy to have a soft case vs. a hard case.  I just cannot find ANYTHING wrong with these.  Take it from a 4 decade audio professional....THESE are a WINNER!!!  2nd PS:  many headphones need to be "burned in."  Run these at a fairly high volume for a day or two to settle the inards.  I have found that with continuous use, headphones start sounding better over time.

VEveryone has a different budget. If you can afford these professional quality headphones this purchase is a no brainier. Whether you enjoy listening to music or watching Netflix or Amazon video on your tablet the Beats Pro series headphones will improve your entertainment experience in a big way. The audio experience that these headphones provide is clearly superior to other products. I compared these to Sony, Bose, Monster etc in the store and these headphones clearly had the best sound.

VThe headphones are great. I can hear my classical music clearly and my ones with lyrics clearly too. I've had them for some weeks now and haven't encountered a problem so far the price still ridiculous for new ones though. I didn't by new ones, got used ones supposedly, but they came in the box like they were new. The only thing I wish for these is that it came with a hard case specifically for Pros. Supposedly Beats by Dr.Dre doesn't make that for some reason at least that Im aware of.

p2160
sg5
VIn general I dont write product reviews unless a product exceeds my expectations or disappoints me terribly. I owned in the past Bose, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Sony, Klipsch, Audio technica etc etc but nothing come close to these Beats Pro. I have Beats Solo HD and I was perfectly happy but I took my chance to buy these Pros. I was shocked how good the sound is. The bass is perfect and mids and lows are perfectly balanced. What these headphones shine is the "instrument separation and the sound stage" it creates. You will feel like you are in a concert or some thing. Simply unbelievable. How do they do it? The problem is there are lots of Monster haters and they try to bring the company down. I know Monster products especially cables are rediculously priced which earned their nasty reputation. I hear so many little things in my songs from these headphones which I never captured in my Bose (relatively same cost). These are little heavy but you wont get fatigued on your ears on extended use.One thing I am still concerned is their durability for the investment I made. Who pays $400 for a pair of headphones now a days! I did it thinking this is my last pair. I purchased beats studios before my solos, opened the box and they are DOA. Some small hitch hitch sound from one of the cups even no music being played. I guess its from electric circuitry.  So I decided not to buy any headphones which requires battery or charge. Not sure how long these last but knock the wood. One last thing I advise please dont judge these by listening the online music unless its streamed at high bit rate which makes a significant difference. Good luck and enjoy them!

VWonderful Bass (Review of Bose QC 25, Beats Pro., and Audio-Technica ATH-M50)
p2265
sg5
VExecutive Summary (Based on my ownership and experience with the following three headphones)===============Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones  -  Apple devices, Black - Wired=>Bose QC 25: Buy for Noise Cancelling and you are not big on Bass. Caters to the airline traveler.Beats Pro Over-Ear Headphone - Black=>Beats Pro: Buy if you like your music loud and with a kick of Bass. Caters to the folks that like Bass.Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones=>Audio-Technica (ATH-M50): Buy if you like balanced crisp sound (both in Highs, Mids and Lows), don\u2019t care about sound controls/mic on your cable, or the cable being detachable and are price sensitive. Caters to price sensitive folks that like balanced crisp sound, with few compromised features sets like not having sound control + mic. on cord and not having a detachable cord. With that said, do note if sound cord gets damaged then this will impact your TCO-total cost of ownership as you will have to repair/mod headphone unit.Key Personal Findings:===================Bose QC 25:  - Noise Cancelling technology and performance  - Comes with a nice travel case vs. cloth case on the beats  - Lighter due to materials used in its construction; with that said both headphones are fine for in regards to comfort, but this is subject to your own level of comfort tolerance.  - Comes Airline adapter for airline carriers that require you to have two jack connectors to connect to your airline seatBeats Pro:  - Sound quality will cater to the folks that like their music loud and with kicking base  - Solid aluminum frame construction  - Great ear padding aid in ambient noise reduction  - Comes with two modular wires, one (red) for typical connection to your music device the other (black) for connecting to devices that require a  inch connectorAudio-Technica (ATH-M50):  - Wonderful balanced clean-crisp sound at a great value  - Comes with a  adapter  - Coiled Cable good quality and is longest in length than other two products, but is NOT detachable like the Beats Pro and Bose QC 25; so  it means that you will have to go MacGyver status to fix this thing or get a new pair of headphones.  - No inline sound controls and micOther:  - All Three are solid head phones and I enjoy owning all three of them and I use them as following:  o When on airline travel, I take the Bose due to the noise canceling and nice travel case  o When working in the office/home, I use the Beats Pro for the deep bass accentuated sound or Audio-Technica/Bose for the crisp sound  o If you listen to the music loud, then all will block out your ambient noise just fine  o If you want to take your sound to the next level, invest in a FiiO amp (I have the E7 versionFiiO E7 USB DAC and Portable Headphone Amplifier, but newer versions/models with features catering to your needs may be a better fit for you).

VI own 4 Dr Dre head phones: a white Studio the I purchased from Amazon for $329 in February 2010 and I just gave to my daughtwer Lucia who asked for it.Having taken good care, after having always wiped them clean and stored after every gymn visit, they are 99% in good conditions!I have also bought two Tour: one for Lucia more than one year ago and one for my wife just yesterday at $180 and $150 respectively.The current  Pro I bought for $400 in February this year.I find the Pro an excellent music conveyor.I listen basically to modern, rythmic and pounding classical music, Stravinsky, lots of Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Bartok and occasioonally Led Zeppelin: all music that uses tons of bass nuances.For me it is the perfect headphone also for single piano, violin and orchestral music, particularly when percussion is greatly employed.Also composers like Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi, who employ all the orchestra's dynanics are well served.In some of the pieces I have also noticed the back of the head effect! Great!In my opinion the Pro are somewhat bulky but quite light. I am very satisfied with them as I am with the above mentionedo others.I recommend that all of the headphones mentioned in this review are treated with respect.Keep them sweat free and well stored after use and they will love you back.You cannot blame them to break if you don't take care of them first. They are only human after all!The only thing that I don't like is the inadequate storage pouch: I would have preferred a shell like the Studio and the Tour!I am not the only one to complain about it and I wish that the Monster"s people would be less monstrous and provide one: I would buy it asap!

VTheir construction is beautiful. White will get dirty eventually but new they are just gorgeous and sturdy.For the pricetag, it ain't all bad. But be warned of one or two things.Many other options out there, these are just very popular, do some research. Denon has some great headphones at comparible prices, and Audio Technica just released a Noise Cancelling pair for the same price as these which are arguably better.I found the Beats Pro to be louder than most headphones. Which might be good for some users. I tried many headphones in many combinations recently trying to figure out the best setup. I kept noticing that when the Beats were in a Y-splitter with another pair of headphones, they were always significantly louder than the other pair attached to the same splitter. Weird.My guess is that these headphones are intended to be loud while using an iPod WITHOUT a portable Headphone Amplifier.Running the signal through something like an AlgoRythm Solo DAC (and an amplifier) I noticed a good difference in the sound reproduced by the Beats, they did get marginally better at sound reproduction than just workingon their own, but still not really awesome. If you don't want to use a portable amp but want bigger sounds, these headphones are for you.Also, if this is your price-range, seriously consider the Sony Digitals. They're great but the Sony's do die over time using high volumes. Beats Pro, and the Beats ANC have not died on me yet, and it's been several years for teh ANC, about a year for the Pro's.I had an experience with the Beats Professional recently where I thought they had died, but weeks later I tried them again and they were okay ..(?). who knows.

VUnnecessary, stick to Studio's
p2280
sg5
VFace it, people are drawn to Beats because they seem them in the music videos.  Hell, that's what got my attention and ultimately my purchase.  Luckily, the Studios are actually quite good to an uneducated audiophile, but discerning listener (The Studios have more satisfying bass than my Technics RP-DH1200's {which I previously thought were quite good in that area already} and a more all-around satisfying sound than my Pioneer Monitor 10R's).So when I learned of the new Pro model, I was interested to see how they improved upon the Studios.  After all, I thought a major selling point of the original Studios is that they were ENGINEERED for professional use.  So then the Pro's are even better?Conveniently, the Apple store here in Taipei had them for demo, so I strolled in and put them on.  They were paired with an Ipod Touch, and even on full blast, they seemed disappointing compared to the Studios.  It probably has to do with the fact that these don't require the 2 AAA's to operate that the Studios do.  That also means they don't have that extra juice to drive the speakers.  I use my Studios on my way to work everyday, and they damn near bounce on my head playing off my Zune.  I really felt the bass from the Pros were lacking, at least off an mp3 player.  Perhaps they sound better with more powerful studio equipment and headphone amps.After trying these, they seem a step down from my Studios, but at 150% the cost.  I'm definitely crossing them off my Christmas wishlist :)  In my opinion, if you have the Studios, you've already got all you need.  And if you don't, get the Studios instead of these.  They're cheaper and they're the ones in the videos anyway.

VThese headphones are unbelievable.  The sound leakage is like the solos and the comfort is good.  It can cause ear fatigue too.  They sound amazing but why waste 399 on headphones playing country music.  These headphones are for DJ's and hip hop listeners.  It isn't worth the money for country music.  The construction is very strong and they fold up very easily.  There is no hard case (bad thing) so you might want to be careful with where you put these.  The cord is nice and thick and has an extention.  It does not get tangled and the cord has a lock with the headphones so the cord does not come out if you trip.  You might not want to buy this if you have a shuffle, nano, or something with a small battery.  It simply does not play with the same sound quality.  You can still hear some stuff happening around you when you are listening to music.  It does not need batteries to function.  These are definately worth the money if you listen to music and you have the money.

VTried these on expecting them to be the best headphones of all time. Not even close. Are they a decent pair of headphones? Yeah. Are they the most comfortable? No. This will definitely hurt your head without them on your head too long. Also the sound quality is okay, but not $400 worth. No way. Never. They're more balanced highs/mids/bass wise than the studios and solo hd's. But for $400? I'm much happier with my V-Moda Crossfade LP headphones which were just $100 and just overall look and sound better. Ridiculously overrated, don't let the hype fool you.

VSeriously these and bose are completely overpriced just for the brand name. Admittedly, these look good, but that is all, they sound terrible compared to real headphones and honestly there are a lot of headphones that sound far better as well as look better, while both beats and bose are rather terrible at least bose has one merit, the fact that in terms of noise cancellation bose has the best noise cancellation system, but the sound quality is not that high. Instead of going for these and overproduced bose headphones you should look into audiotechnica, sennheiser,beyerdynamics, fostex, grado, v-moda, etc. Not only do these companies make far better sounding headphones, but a lot of them look better than beats and are made of much higher quality material. If your really willing to spend over 400 dollars on headphones why in the world would you go for these over something like the sennheiser hd 650 that sounds better unamped than beats ever would.

VMany people will slag on the Beats series of headphones, and with good reason. The PRO model actually serves a really amazing use for music producers. No, they do not have a flat response, but for the price you'll be hard-pressed to find a better pair of cans to reveal a detailed image of problematic issues with your mix. They give a good representation of the sub frequencies, but not to such a degree that they mask the detail above 50 Hz.These are not headphones for listening to music with. You will exhaust your ears almost immediately if you use them for extended periods of time. Still, these things are great as a sort of "nearfield" monitor check for reference. As anyone who produces music knows, you need to test out your mixes on a variety of different systems to make sure everything is sitting right. It's the same reason the Yamaha NS10s are so ubiquitous in studios. In general, they're not the best for mixing (and that statement can get hyperbolic if we're talking about certain genres of music), but the rationale there is "if it sounds good on these things, it'll sound good on anything."These are amazing headphones for checking a mix for problems. They are terrible for listening to music... but that's not the point. I know, you'll feel like a complete loser when you wrap these things on your head, but then you'll hear things you didn't notice in your mix.Not recommended at all for the average listener looking for a good set of phones to enjoy music with.

VOMG these headphones are freakin awesome!!!!  If you have these plugged into your computer, make sure the settings are as high as possible for the sound quality. Get the most out of your investment! You will hear soooo many little nuances and details in whatever you are listening to that you have probably never noticed before, or you will hear with a clarity that will blow you away. The bass is present; not overpowering. You won't feel your headphones shake when a bass drops, which is great. Honestly, who likes that? Why would you want your head to have a vibrator attached to it? Anyway...these things do require a little breaking in. The quality of build is such that it can be a little tight to wear for a couple days, but after it conforms, you can wear it for hours. These are a bit heavy, but when you pay $300+ for headphones, would you want heavy metal (no pun intended) or cheap plastic? The pads are breathable so your ears won't sweat too much if worn for a long time, while eliminating outside noise pretty well.And ummm, not to brag, but I got these for only $300 at BestBuy, since it was the last one they had in stock. Bwahahaha! Anyway, the point here is that if you can wait, try to find one for around that price. At the time of this review, with the list price at 449.95, Amazon has it for a steal at the bargain price of 379.95. BUT...I have seen Amazon list these for $300 about a month or two ago, and the white version is even cheaper. So if you can wait, you'll be glad you did.

VBeats by Dre...is 90% label and good looks, I'll be honest, and bass, lotta lotta bass; but since the week the first Beats Pros came out 5 years ago, I've been using them obsessively, and I am yet to hear fade. If there's anything to be known about these headphones before buying them it's that the metal on the cable will chip away, the headband leather with fade and be borne through, they will be dropped off your desk, the second floor balcony, the 15th floor window of your ex-wife's apartment, they will go through hell and back, before they break. Seriously, I've been in marriages that withstood time worse than these headphones, they are the rocks upon the sands of time, through which only the sand can diminish them.To be a little less dramatic, let me put it this way...I'm a careful person, but I travel A LOT, so bad things happen to my things - I've gone through 4 IPod Touches, 1 BlackBerry, 3 Androids, 3 Laptops, all in the time that I've owned these headphones, the gold plating on male end of the audio cable is scratched so badly to the point that it looks somewhat like a Van Gogh painting wrapped around a cylinder, but the fidelity hasn't changed a bit.If you're Eastern European like me, then let me help you understand a little bit more easily, if you took the rugged soul of a Moskvich or Zil, the quality of a 1.8 litre Peugeot 205, and the body of 1966 Fiat 124 Spider (rawr), need I say anything more? The faults are in the details of course..

VReviewing these as 360$ headphones. I have owned many types of headphones, these are for sure the best I have tried. The clarity is not there for me, I have tried many headphones and these are not much clearer than what I've tried. I listen to Hip Hop, the bass is not extremely heavy like some people point out. The details in these beats are so amazing, I hear things I have never heard before it makes my collection sound almost completely new.The construction is amazing, very expensive feeling and quality materials. The comfort lacks although, for studio or DJ headphones I don't see these as headphones you'd enjoy wearing after 4 hours. I have an average sized head and I have each of the straps notched down about 3 or 4 times. They rest over my ears and after about 2 hours the components in the ears will make my ear slightly sore.I use them at home, with my computer, with a SteelSeries AMP I picked up with my gaming headphones(SteelSeries Siberia Elite Prism) Which these are much better for music.Compared to the old Solos, my new Tours, my old Urbeats, and my old Studios, these destroy them and are worth the upgrade.If I could do it again I would purchase these headphones, I enjoy them. Just expensive, only worth it if you're really about your muusic and look past the hate the brand receives as a whole.

VWhen one pays for a pair of Beats headphones, they pay for the name. Beats lack in manufacturing quality - internally, and externally. The sound quality is "okay" at best. Sure, Beats have a sleek look... But is the look really worth the cost of lower quality? One could pay a fraction of the price for a pair of Sony, Sennheiser, or Audio-Technicas, and expect far greater quality.

VI bought these for a Christmas gift from onecall.com thru Amazon as an open box special for about $100 less than the advertised price on Amazon.  I was reluctant to spend this kind of money on headphones but my daughter was dead set on these and no others would have been acceptable.When I ordered them I was told they would arrive before Christmas, but on the tracking it said December 27th, which would have been a problem.  I contacted the seller and they assured me the headphones would arrive on time.The arrival:They did make it a couple days ahead of time so I was pleasantly surprised about that.  The second thing that caught my eye is that they were shrink wrapped in the original packaging even though they were advertised as open box.  The box was packaged inside another box so the actual product box was like brand new with no shipping blemishes.Conclusion:I was nervous about the seller but in the end they exceeded my expectations and I will very definitely be buying from them again in the future.  I have purchased thousands of dollars in products from Amazon and have not once been disappointed.

VSome of the worst headphones on the market
p2499
sg5
VThese are one of the worst sounding and fitting headphones on the market. I have lost all respect for Dr Dre ever since he came out with Beats. Now, he is trying to distance himself from the Monster brand because he realized that most people think Monster is over-priced, which it is. But, that does not help the fact that these headphones still are not good headphones.Yes the design and styling of them is really nice and they look cool. But that's where the positives end.The sound out of them is very muddy and not too clear. Some people think they need to sound this way because the bass is so strong. Not true, there are other headphones with just as good if not better bass but that also sound great in the mids and highs. Check out theDenon AH-D600 Music ManiacTM Over-Ear Headphones, Blackas an example. They are way better both in terms of sound quality and comfort. There are others too.Further, the Beats are not comfortable to wear at all. After about 20 minutes, they start hurting your ears.Frankly, every time I see someone with Beats, I think to myself that there is a sucker born every minute. I know it sounds harsh but these headphones are really that bad!

p2533
sg5
VThe sound quality is amazing. You can her every individual instrument by itself, not compressed together, the bass isn't too loud or too quiet, the high mids and lows are perfect. I never even knew that half of the sounds I heard were even in the song. They are also extremely comfortable, the leather feels great on my ears and the headband is amazingly soft. They are perfect for dis because you can rotate each ear cuff by themselves. You can easily record tracks with these. They are also very durable, but I never tried dropping them and I don't plan on it. My only complaint is after one or two hours the earcuffs start to squeeze your head a little and it hurts a little, but I haven't worn headphones for a few years since the ones I had before these were horrible. With all of these advantages though how can I complain. Notice I did t complain about the price because they are worth $400 in my opinion. So if you have $400 just lying around with nothing to do with it and want an excellent pair of headphones, buy these.

VTried these out on several occasions, I am not an owner. However I found my Sennheisers to deliver a much more balanced and rich sound at less then half the price. I didn't wear the Beats long enough to determine comfort but they did seem a bit on the stiffer side though well padded.Beats seem like a overrated branding popularized by heavy marketing yet delivering sub par sound when compared to equally priced headphones like Audio Technica's (which I love), Denon, Senn's and others.There's a good Youtube review I found that seems to agree with this: /watch?v=et_PWifUd1w&feature;=relatedIf you're looking for sound, this ain't it, if you wanna look like a toll...

VI am a moderately obese former pro drummer with a profound hearing loss in one ear and a few extra bucks. After having tried every pair of headphones/earbuds/in-ear monitors to try to counter the emotionally devastating effects of no longer being able to hear music in true stereo, I finally decided to break down and give these a try.At first, I didn't like them. They're big, heavy, and the white ones I had to get (they were out of black) were just a tad ostentatious.But they work, and do so beautifully. Arguably, the finest set of headphones I have ever experienced.And in the end, their weight and whatever guilt I may feel about wearing a very expensive set of headphones in public almost appeals to my latent narcissism.So sue me.

VFirst off let it be said i am white .While I'm not gonna buy a pair of these overpriced beats pro over ear headphones what I am going to do is tell my experience  with them at best buys demo where I tried them out .The demo music ranged from pop to mick jagger to rap and in my opinion every type of music for the demo sounded awesome with great separation of highs kids and lows . The bass was tight in the demo and did not over power the other sounds in the music but it (the bass) did sound awesome and my face lit up with an ear too ear smile when it hit .If I was gonna buy some beats these would be the beats I'd buy as they made every other headphone demo at the best buy store sound awful by comparison .

VI got these refurbished for about half the price. That's about how much I would pay for them. They sound great, but you can get much better audio quality for 400 dollars. I only paid 190 and I'm happy with the purchase so far.The headphones can be very uncomfortable if you don't position them correctly. They clamp down on your head like a vicegrip, and this can be painful for your ears. The wire that came with them is ridiculously short. Overall I would not recommend these unless you can get a steep discount.Edit, I figured out you can extend the headband, and if you extend it all the way, it's much easier on your ears. Unless you have a really fat head, in which case you are probably out of luck.

These sound like you have the singer with you in your house. I some times look back behind me thinking someone else is in the room with me when they are playing. And they dont leak obviously at max volume they do but I dont think you would want to put these at the max because you will not be able to hear no more.no joke. Only problem is the price 400 dollars in pretty expensive for headphones. If you dont want to spend that much go after the mixrs that are a little uncomfortable but sound amazing as well

VPretty sure these are fake. Both cords broke within 2 months. The L connectors both snapped apart at the joint. It looked as if they had been just glued together and not actually manufactured. The headphones themselves. The Beats "b" logo that is on the L connectors also both fell off. VERY apparent that they had been fastened on by glue. The leather is very subpar. The cushion on the headband is very lacking as compared to my friends. The bass is pretty muddy and s***. I have a $6 pair of Rosewills that are in about the same sound market. Got these refurbs on "sale" for around $200. The packaging was the only thing that made me think that these might be real.

VI have lusted over a pair of these headphones for a very long time and my best friend just bought me a pair for my birthday/Christmas and I am in love with them. The sounds are crystal clear, even with older music that do not have a high quality recording aspect. The only thing I don't like is that after a while, it does get uncomfortable on my ears. I think that if it had more cushion on the ear pieces, it would be a perfect 5 star. As far as listening quality I give it a 5 star but comfort would be 3. In any case, I am loving these headphones. I have researched and tried out hundreds of headphones and always kept coming back to the Dr. Dre ones. Awesome!

VMy Beats Pro arrived today and i love it! Build quality is top! Sound quality is excellent major upgrade over the Studio specially in sound leak and these are extremely comfortable its like wearing a couch on your ears! They are little heavy but I'm OK with it the only down side about these Headphones is the fact that you don't get a protective case to carry them around with you in the box they give you a beautiful soft white leather bag which is very nice but offers no protection for your investment, Nothing in life is perfect but if you want the best Headphones money can buy and you can afford them then search no more!

VThese Beats by Dre Pros are simply the best headphones that I have ever put on. They are very comfortable, with huge overstuffed pads that gently cushion your ears while you listen to your music. The headphones completely cover your ears, so there is almost no music leakage no matter how loud your music is.The build quality is also very high. These headphones are almost entirely made out of metal, with only the parts that touch your head having padding. Overall, these headphones are amazing and I recommend these to music lovers, dj's. or just casual yet rich music listeners.

Vwell first of all they arrived FAST!!!!secondly the sound quality is magnificent and the instrument clarity the best i've heard.on to the only bad point i can give to the beats pro: it's too costly, and i explain:they are worth 400 dollars, you pay 250 for the sound and durability and the rest 150 dollarsare for the beats logo.over all if you can spend some more cash on buying these you won't regret it, plus you'll be walkingdown the street with swag!

VI can't fully understand why people would even give these a bad rating and or review. I and I'm sure a bunch of others think they're fantastic headphones with great bass and sound quality. Don't complain about the pricing if you aren't willing to except what you pay for.. Enough said I truly recommend these to the great audiophiles out there that can listen to music forever. With these... You'll never want to stop. Take a strangers word for it.

VIts getting annoying to hear, YOU CAN BUY  some headphone at half the price and the same sound! We know this. But  beats pro's or whatever headphone u buy are on your head. Just like you want nice hair and to look good, you want the headphones you wear to make you look stylish.I honestly look at someone with cheap headphones  with less respect. Its like the clothes you wear. If you are wearing a undershirt i am not going to take you seriously. If it is a nike t shirt, with the swoosh i will talk to you.When you see someone at the airport with a Nike backpack and a pair of Kobe's, do you tell them i could of went to Sam's club and payless and bought you a back up and shoes for 90 percent of the price?And the headphones sound great. You seriously can't find a better pair. The price is just for the style. Just like you go to the store and Polo cost more than chaps.

VThese headphones are very stylish with pretty good sound quality. These are not the best sounds quality headphones but they are definitely the most stylish! The daisy link feature was really cool and so was the locks on both end of the cables. I recommend this headphone to DJs because you're able to swivel with these headphones so you can listen to the song playing with one ear and cue your next song up at the same time.

VSound is ok.  Can be very loud and lots of bass.  However, the design is very poor.  I'm an average-sized person: 5'11, 160 lbs.  I think I have an averaged sized head.  I can't use these for more than 30 minutes before my ears start to hurt.  The cups go ON your ears, instead of around them.  Since it's metal, and does not have a lot of give, it pushes against your ears and head pretty hard.Such a waste.

p2793
sg5
VLet me start off by saying I am not audiophile I am a special needs teacher, lives in Boston, so my music listening consist of walking to the subway riding the subway about a 25-30 min ride. then I walk to the school, might listen to them during lunch, or after class, and then listening to them when I am going back home. I did a review on the Beats Studios which I won at a school raffle. I got the Pros from my girlfriend bought them for me at Best Buy.The Sound: There is a big difference between Pros and the Studios, for the Pros they sound better then the Studios, the bass is deeper, more richer and clearer, they sound amazing. I love the way the Eagle, of Monster and Men, Rap, techno so much different type of music all of the music sounds amazing. Again I am not an audiophile, but trust me they sound amazing much better then the Studios They don't have all the annoying quirks that the studio have, so no staticaic, no batteries, and they don't leak like the Studios do.The look and Comfort: For looks they look amazing built to last tough, aluminium  you can drop these and they won't break the ear cushions are nice soft and well modeled to fit your ears. they draw looks I always received  looks and compliments on how nice they are, honestly they look professional. The cord is amazing one of the best Beat cords their is its strong durable and neat also has this locking plug that u can do to make sure it secure to the headphones.they also can fold the ears cup which is pretty neat guess that for djs i usually use it for travel or just to put my beats away.as for comfort that another story, they are built tough and amazing, but the problem with that is that they are heavy, so like Two-Three hours of wear they will hurt your head, my girlfriend and I traveled to Texas for a friends wedding, after about 4 hours in the flight my head was killing me I was wishing I bought my Studios instead. The Studios are much more comfortable than these. I took a flight to Mexico last summer with my girlfriend and bought the studios with me(didn't have the Pros at the time) I pretty much wore them the whole flight, slept with them on the plane and had no pain at all. The Pros start hurting after two to three hours of use.The Package and Pricethe packaging is amazing has that feel like opening an new iphone, everything pack well and perfect. Now for the contents itself the headphone are nicely wrap the cord is wrapped up nicely everything about the packaging is just right. I had a complaint about the case its a leather bag, for spending 400 dollars its should come with a hard case like the studios not a leather bag. my other complaint is that the cord is great no complaints there, but for spending 400 dollars it should come with a remote mic cord I would like to receive phone calls which I can on my Studios it wouldn't hurt to include the wire. Now for the price my girlfriend got these for me she paid 400 plus tax, me personally I would never pay that much just like the studios which I would recommend for around 150-200. I feel the same for the Pros I would pay around 200-300 if you can find them at that price purchase them they're worth it.In the end I like the Pros I like the sound, build and looks. For me i am kind of torn between the studio and the pros. I like the sound, looks the build of the pros, but for the studio I like the comfort, the lightweightness and the sound is not bad it pretty close to the Pros.I think it depend on the price and how much money u have if u have 300 to spend go for the studios and if you have 400 to spend and care more about better sound go for the pros

VThese beat headphones are the best on the market they exceeded my expectations.  They sound great with any mp3 player, but when I used them with my galaxy 10.0 tablet they sound like a normal set of headphones, and I assume that's because of the music format galaxy tablets has to offer. In other words the galaxy tab wasn't set up as a mp3 player.  I would recommend these to anyone that can afford them.

Comfort is okay takes some time to break in I recommend putting it on the box to stretch it out whenever not in use. Other than that it's a really good set of headphones and for $325 it's a pretty reasonable price now!

VI cant believe people are stupid enough to pay $400 on a pair of headphones because the have the beats logo on it. Goes to show how easily our culture falls for marketing. The sound of these headphones is on par with headphones that are less than $100 bucks! Not to mention no respectable DJ would ever use beats. EVERThink about it. They are made by Monster Cable who likes to make pretty cables and charge ten times what they are really worth. They would charge $150 bucks for an HDMI cable and you can get one of the same if not better quality on amazon for $15 bucks.Now take your $400 bucks. put $200 in your pocket. Then purchaseBeyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 80 ohmswhich blows these beats out of the water in every way possible.

VThey work fantastic.fyi there are 2 ports on either side in which you can connect your headphones, for personal preference I always connect to the right side. Just for the sake of it I tried to connect it to the left side and the left side doesn't work well, i.e one of the channels does not play.So, I looked at the policy and I see that I have a years warranty and when I see on the Amazon returns policy it says: Yes one year but only 1 month for me to return it.They still work perfectly when connected to the right side but not otherwise, I would love to have them work perfectly.My advice is to check connecting to both sides immediately else you will end up like me where you can't daisy chain them.$#@$#@!$!REVIEW UPDATEAmazon did send me another one that works fine.

VMy son saved his money and bought the Beats Pro for a trip he was going on.  The headphones arrived and sound wonderful.  However, the cord doesn't stay in the right jack, because it doesn't "lock" like it is supposed to.  The supplier has been contacted multiple times.  The first time, they said they would send a new cord.  I immediately contacted them and explained that it is not the cord, but that the headphone jack on the right ear "turns" when you try to lock the cord in place, keeping it from locking.  So the cord falls out.  They have not responded to any of my communications since I explained the problem.  So my son is stuck with very expensive headphones that he can't use!Shame on Amstech!!!

Vvery uncomfortable
p3039
sg5
VI have had many headphones since i travel a lot and these by far are the most uncomfortable ones I have ever owned.  I guess I fell for the hype. I spent a nice penny on these and expect a lot more for my money.  The sound is great and it makes listening to music much more enjoyable and they are very stylish but if you wear these for longer then a 20 min period you will start getting a headache and feel like your head is being crushed.  There is no way to adjust them to make them bigger and I dont even have a large head.  They are very heavy and very tight and make my head and ears hurt a lot and eventually I just have to take them off.  If my plane trips were only 30 min I guess they would be ok but most arent so I guess these dont work for me.  Im not the type to return things so i guess ill just have to chalk it up as a loss.  I guess i should have tried them first before buying them. (this review is for the pro version) so maybe ill try the cheaper beats, maybe they might be more comfortable.

p3132
sg5
VI will never buy from this person and will never buy from amazon.  We bought these headphones and when we opened them up for my son's birthday they had a short in them.  I contacted this seller and he stated that we could send them back to him and them they would give us our money back.  When we did them he claimed he never received them.  Provided us with several different names and addresses.  Nothing made any sense.  In the end we do not have the headphones and we never got our money back.  If I was you I would NOT buy from them.  Shady as can be.  I have never had a problem with shipping something through the post office and all he could keep stating is send me a tracking number.  He also stated that he had several different names too.  This is why people do not buy online.  What a shame.

p3190
sg5
VThese headphones are great! Are they expensive? Sure! Are they worth it? If you have the money then yes! Christmas 2010 my mom got me the Solo HD set and I was mad. I did not want her spending 200 bucks on headphones when I had some that were perfectly good. However, I fell in love and literally wore them out. So in June for my birthday I asked for another pair and to my surprise she got me the Beats Pro. They're amazing. I tell her the Dr Dre Beats were one of the best gifts I've ever received.The sound is great, they're not heavy, they bring so much sound and life to what you're listening to. Don't listen to the reviews that hate on it just for hating on it. If you want to go buy some off-brand that's fine. I love my beats and wouldn't change them for anything. Even a good set of Bose will run you several hundred so if you're going to pay that then get a good, sturdy pair of headphones that are worth the money. Every sound is clear and beautiful.

VGood headphones but the quality is really annoying :(
p3235
sg5
VThe sound quality of these are second to none! they are the sexiest things to ever lay on you ears. definately the best sound quality in th whole beats range. although if you dont appreciate and treasure real sound quality there is no point of getting pros. you get good seperation in sound with lovely bass but also with a good balance of everything. I have the iBeats (in ear headphones) which are the cheapest beats you can get and they sond almost as good as these only if you use the airlock tips and shove em right in. i have tried all the beats and these are definately at the top (1st pro, 2nd ibeats, 3rd tour, 4th solo hd, 5th studio)These are very comfortable and give u a nice fit all the time but you may need to take them off every hour to lets your ear breath some cool air. the fll off your head if you move it too much but monster have still done a great job in the comfort department.although beats by dre a really designed to look cool it has kinda lost its rep. beats USED to be cool, now they are just for tools who think they're the best (me). walking down george street (sydney) heaps of asian FOBs walkaround with them and it just kills the brand (again me).all up these are a good buy if you have the money. they will last and deliver you superb sound!Edit 29.01.12:Okay i was pretty excited when i ever had the chance to listen to these, i had them replaced once because the headband became loose enough to keep falling off my head. The customer service was amazing and i had a new pair in 15 days and i live in sydney :).Just last night i discovered another problem (it had just developed and it wasnt like this when new), when plugged in the right hand port the right hand side is slightly louder, however it is normal when plugged in the left (which i prefer not to use because im right handed), the difference is very small but when you are paying attention to the music it becomes REALLY ANNOYING! i figure that i wont send it back to monster because i dont want to be that annoying!the build quality is good but only around the hinges and ear cups, th headband is complete crap and has always failed in some way, the "leathery" material on the headband is way too soft, overtime and normal use at home; start to peel and flake which is really unattractive.Just let that be a note to the people considering these, just consider these because they are so damn frustrating! im not saying not to buy them because i may be just unlucky

VNOT FOR DJs !!! Modified Review after 6month use!
p3241
sg5
VMODIFIED REVIEW AFTER 6 MONTH OF USE (read original one below!)Despite my first impression after unboxing + first listen in a quite environment, I have to modify my first review!I bought them for DJ use only, and their lack of noise canceling are an absolute no go to be used for DJs!Their sound is still quite impressive (don't get me wrong though), but in a loud environment you would have to press the phones onto your ears in order to pre-hear the next track ;-(The folding mechanism might be "cool", but other than folding the headphones together after a Gig and securing it in the bag I do not use it (did not see a DJ yet switching only one part forward during a Gig...)Still five stars are for comfort, quality and sound minus 2 stars due to lack of noise cancelation!See old review blow:------------------------------------Hi there,had the Monster (Dr. Dree (where did he graduate in anyways ;-)) in red already (Solo HD).Slogan started like this "Not only amazing headphones, a portion of the profits from the Beats Solo HD (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition headphones will go straight to the Global Fund to fight AIDS in Africa. "So, do something good for your ears and for the world ;-)Honestly, they (the red HD) sounded a little to "bassy" (sorry for my great English;-)) and somehow they seemed not to separate the mids and bass accurately (after hearing to speakers of all different brands to this date .... BUT, this impression changed after working with these headphones for quite a while (composing / making music).So far so good, still talking about the "small brother" of the reviewed BeatsPro...but after a while, all other headphones seamed to sound weak!!!To much highs, no bass fundament, just like cheap headphones!I am talking about M-Audio and Pioneer (DJ 500).The latter I bought for DJing purpose and I sold them instantly through a web based auction plattform (not ebay), after I tested them only once!!!No comfort at all, to hard at the ears, sound was lowdown.THEN I ordered the BeatsPro in white from amazon.com ==> I was stunned (again).Great packaging, all material very valuable, comfortable to wear from the first milisecond (even though they have some weight!), AND THE SOUND... the best I ever heard (even better than the red ones!).Price - Value = 5 Stars, you dont only get one of the best headphones on the market, you get a real "experience" of value delivered (same like with Apple Mac!) and NO, I dont work for this company, I am just very satisfied!!!DONT BUY OTHER HEADPHONES!!!

VAll.,I bought this product thinking that I would save $200 dollars compared to buying a new pair from Bestbuy or Frys.  I wish that I would have spent the additional $200 dollars now after receiving this fake Beats Pro Over-Ear from this China retailer!The packing and product look like the real thing...until you test the sound.  First thing I notice is a constant rattling/busted speaker noise in the left speaker...and the sound is not as crisp as the REAL beats Pro Dr Dra by Monster.  I went back to Bestbuy to compare twice and the sound doesn't come even close.  However, I will admit that they look and feel like the real thing.  I wouldn't have mind if the product had a few cosmetic issues...as long as they sound great; wishful thinking!I don't believe that these are the REAL re-manufacture beats pro over ear headphones just well built fakes with ok sound quality.  The cost should be $50 dollars versus $200 dollars based on the quality.Don't be fooled by this China online retailer selling fakes product as real remanufactured products...nor the one year warranty statement.I won't west my time trying to send them all  the way back to China and incurring the shipping cost or the 4 weeks wait...with the hope that I will get my money back.Buyers beware of this product!!!

VDr. Dre Beats..Really? Friggin amazing & down right sick!

VI consider myself a mid level audiophile. I own some sennheizers 580's which when they first came out were about the same price range, though they are open cans, meaning you can hear everything going on outside and everyone can hear you loosing your hearing by how loud they are. These puppies here are closed and thus the tightness that everyone is complaining about. But I got use to them after two weeks. The sound is amazing and the base is amazing. The highs are clear, the mids are great and the lows....HELLO!! From Miles Davis, Bob Marley, Bach, George Winston, Sade, Sting, U2 to Ludacris and LL cool jay. The sounds and quality thus far are just as good or better to my Senns. I was going to also by a portable amp from headroom like I did with my Senns, but my buddy brought out his mini ipod touch and plugged these in and they push!! So I would end up probably making my ears bleed with the amp. So all in all, for the price I gpt them for from amazon warehouse, it was awesome and they still smelled brand new and with everything the new pair would come with accept nearly $80 dollars cheaper. Great cans.

VListened at the Apple Store, phew those things really suck!If you think that the Beats have a good sound quality, you haven't - ever - listened to a real audiophile headphone, or you have some serious earing problems. They're "good" only when compared against very poor quality HPs.Every audiophile in the world will laugh at you when you tell them HOW MUCH you paid for those heavy frying pans, even Dr.Dre DOESN'T really use Beats in his studio, because they're pointless for professional work, with their uneven frequency responce and loose bass section. Just ask professionals.Famous people is GETTING PAYED to wear them, you instead PAY FOR IT. If "style" is the only thing that matters to you, like the guy that I've seen walking in the streets listening at his Beats while bringing them around the neck (!), feel free to pay 400$ for this expensive necklace to look like a clown. Natural selection, baby.

VMagic Headphones but..
p3293
sg5
VI had these when they were first released in 2011 and I got to say they were amazing.However, they do begin to hurt my ears after a while. But that wasn't a big deal for me..The big deal for me was truthfully the fact that I blew $400 on headphones. Now hold on. Lets get something straight.When I bought these headphones, I knew what I was doing. Beats by Dre was a biiig deal at the time.So I bought em, wore em everywhere and woww.. my life quickly changed from a pair of freakin headphones.No joke. When you wear em to school its like you're a celebrity.So after some time had passed, I began to see clearly how these were only headphones..and the magic won't last forever. So I decided to return them and buy an xbox. And thats what I did.Bottomline, these headphones are overrated but it's like a chick magnet and it will bring you magic like Harry's Wand from Harry Potter.But for $400? I'd just buy em and return em if I were you lol

VI gave it 5 stars because I loved it from the second I opened the box. I had Solos, and Studios; gave my bro my Solos and bought Studios. My Studios stopped working because of damaged internal parts of some sort after my friend decided to punch them.Don't matter now because I got these and Pros are pretty much Solo + Studio in one. Solos has extreme bass but the quality wasn't as great as the Studios who had less intense bass but much better quality. Pros have it all, spectacular bass, amazing sound quality, and sound doesn't leak like Studios (I hated that).I'd say if you love music as much as I do, forget Solo's and Studio's exist and skip right to Pros, best thing I've ever bought!

VComfort: 1 StarThis is the deal breaker...as others have said these headphones really are not comfortable. The circular pads sort of squeeze your ears into the headphone, leaving them sore after a short period of time. The headband is very tight as well. I've been bending the headband to try to make them fit less tightly, but the circular pads still make your ears sore no matter what. It's really a shame they are so uncomfortable...*Sound Quality are amazing but the problem as i said the comfort , u can't used it more than 1 hour your ears will get pain so hard thats not mean that my ears are big no no my ears are so small but the problem from the headphone i prefer the Bose one (Y)

VComplete joke sound quality for the price. Studio recording headphones? These?They are completely incapable of rendering the basic details that much cheaper monitoring headphones are able to do. Headphones 25% of these junk.They look tacky as well and something juvenile immature idiots would wear.For $400, look around at Sennheiser, Grados, AKG, Shure & BeyerDynamics.Forget these dog shit.

VWe ordered my Beats by Dr. Dre Pro in the US amazon shop. It took only 3 days to Austria!! Perfect ((:I love my Beats Pro <3, they sound better than the Studio Beats from my boyfriend but he says that the higher notes sound better on his Studio Beats.Also: I use them with my iPhone 4 and i have NO problems with it!! They work perfectly and i didn't hear any connecting-sounds at all until now (:I am absolutely content with them!! ((:So here I am again, I purchased them in the end of november and now I changed my opinion completely.After using them with my iPhone 4, which I mostly carried in my jeans pocket, the cable is broken and I had to fix it with superglue to use it furthermore.I know, Pro Beats aren't made for listening music on the road but I expected something better for that price.Next thing I have to claim is that the left ear-phone got extremely quiet meanwhile. It's really irritating and when I use them on a low volume I nearly hear nothing on the left side. I'm really disappointed as I bought them because of all the great reviews. I'm not even able to send them in because I got themsigned by some Hardstyle DJ's and I don't want to risk to lose the autographs..Last point I want to mention is that I get some weird itching in my ears when using them. I never had a similar problem with using any other headphones (AKG, Sennheiser, Skullcandy), only the Pro Beats cause this problem.. I wasn't at the doc by now but I'm thinking of going there to solve this problem if there is any solution.To summarize, at first I was really happy and satisfied with my Beats Pro but meanwhile I definitely don't recommend buying them.

VI recently got a pair of these headphones in-store. Absolutely abysmal sounds quality. For $400+ you think I'd receive a product that wasn't separating at the ear, or would have actual quality sound. No, instead I received a NIB product that had a tear in the ear piece and was separating, and a sound comparable to a $15 pair of ear buds. How can you call yourself a music based company if you can't even deliver a quality product that isn't an overhyped $15 pair of headphones. I will never buy beats again.

VThese are IMO awesome headphones & i've had a few. They're expensive but if you're serious about your music, which I am, then they are worth the price. Best thing about them to me was they do not require batteries. The Beat Studios which is what I had previously do & I kept having to get new batt's because i'm a forgetful person & kept leaving the headphones on after I was done. Don't have that issue anymore. If your a serious music person & can afford them, grab a pair...

Why would you sale these 400 dollar headphones if they are not going to give us the warranty that we deserve. Blown speaker should be replaced that's my opinion. I sent mines in the mail and got them back with my same headphones, a new monster cable, and a new bag lol. How prothetic is that

Looks like a good price for this product although $300 for head phones sounds outlandish but that is what our Marine gunny wanted for his birthday who just returned from Afghanistan after fighting for our country. These guys give all kinds of excuses but are simply con artists. I can't figure out why Amazon would ever approve such an incompetent company.

VThese are essentially 150 dollar headphones marked up cuz Dr. Dre has his name on them. If you listen to hip hop or EDM exclusively then go ahead. But don't mistake overwhelming bass and loudness for good sound. For the same price I strongly recommend Sennhesier HD 600s. They are far superior. Stop lining Dre's pockets at your expense!
