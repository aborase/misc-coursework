VYou get what you pay for....these are basic $45-60 headphones, the bass is full but I found the treble levelsto be lacking. If you really like to hear the high treble in your music, this may not be your best bet. I almostprefer a good pair of Apple earbuds to be preferable.

They have cool design and also a pause button on the wire if you got your phone in your pocket and the wire also has a microphone for that same reason. I would take these over beats because of the price and quality.

p86
sg5
VI recently came across these at a big box retail store for only $25, which is a STEAL as these normally sell for around $50 on Amazon. I couldn\u2019t pass up on these and I had an opportunity to thoroughly test them. Here are my impressions:PROS:The build is fairly sturdy with a rubberized coating on the headband which does cling to my head. There really is no cushioning on the headband but it's not an issue for me; I prefer the flexibility and lightness more. The ear cups are rather large and bulbous as opposed to a more flat design of Beats headphones for example. The ear cups are somewhat shiny and reflective, but not much of a big deal for me especially for $25. There is a Skullcandy logo on each side above the ear cup and is a very minimalistic design overall which I prefer. I would have preferred a more matte like finish though but not a deal breaker for me. The cord is nice and thick as well and detachable which comes in handy.The comfort is pretty good for over ear headphones. The ear cups don\u2019t have as much cushion as I\u2019m use to, but I actually prefer this as it lets your ears breath a little more as these ear cups do heat up and make you sweat some after an extended listening period. And less cushion in the ear cups don\u2019t really affect comfort level for me. Also, I wear glasses and since these are an over ear design, they will put pressure around the legs of the glasses. This happens after 1-2 hours of continuous use just like every other over ear model I\u2019ve tried. I alleviate this by either just lifting the \u201clegs\u201d of the glasses above the ear cushion or just taking them off for a break.The sound quality of these over ear headphones is where they really shine. I\u2019m no audiophile, but I do recognize good sounding headphones for the money. These definitely are more biased towards the lows(bass) and I compare the sound to the Beats line of headphones. I\u2019ve listened to several models of Beats headphones and these Skullcandy\u2019s are similar to me for a lot less money! I do like Beats headphones for their style, build quality, and booming bass, but I just feel they\u2019re too overpriced; everyone seems to have them just because celebrities/athletes endorse them and are not really a good value overall in my opinion.Back to the sound of the Skullcandy's. These definitely lean more to the lows, but the mids and highs are good enough for me. I\u2019ve listened to a variety of music from hip-hop, R&B;, electronic, pop, jazz, classical and movie soundtracks and the more I listen, the better the sound gets for me. This may be just that the headphones are going through a \u201cburn-in\u201d and that I\u2019m getting use to them more though. The bass is booming to say the least, not tight or very refined, but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be for this non-audiophile headphone. It\u2019s on par to Beats headphones for me. If you listen to primarily electronic, hip-hop or anything that has a lot of bass, these would fit the bill. Also, I tested these at the gym and they work well for lifting weights and some cardio like walking/jogging on treadmills, ellipticals, and rowing machines. These do block out much of the ambient gym noise which is nice to be able to just focus on your workout. If you do any intense training though, then I\u2019m sure sport ear buds are more appropriate and not headphones like these.CONS:I was actually surprised that these headphones came with a detachable cable, but no audio controls like play/pause or mic. It is convenient to just pause/play or skip forward your music. I believe Amazon does sell a model that comes with a cable with media controls. I had a spare cable from another set of headphones and I plugged them in, and the media controls do work, so not a big deal for me and definitely not a deal breaker.The ear cups are rather large so depending on your head size it can look ridiculously big. For me, since I have a large head, these headphones seem better suited, however I do have to adjust them to the largest size to just fit. Also, depending on your neck size, if you hang them around your neck, these are quite large and will restrict your head movement especially looking down. I have a somewhat thicker neck and felt that my head movement was restricted while wearing these around the neck, especially while looking down.These headphones don\u2019t fold flat or fold up to a more compact size, so not really ideal for travel. They come with a simple drawstring bag that doesn\u2019t offer really any protection. These can be thrown into a backpack but it will take up more room than just about every other headphone I\u2019ve used. But I do think they would work well on a plane as these do block out a lot of the exterior noise.In conclusion, the cons are more nitpicks to me and these are overall great headphones around the $50 price range, especially those who are considering pricier Beats. At $25, it\u2019s an absolute STEAL and highly recommended!

VWe purchased these for our teenage son.  Within a week or so, one of the speakers stopped working so we returned it via Skullcandy's replacement service, received a purchase credit, and re-purchased the exact same model.  Several months after receiving the replacement, the set is showing wear and tear.  The cord ends are splitting and has a "click" sound if the cord is jiggled.  It is clear these are not made to last, especially for a teenage boy who may toss them in a backpack or under the bed.  For the price of these headphones I would have expected them to hold up a bit better.  But - kudos to Skullcandy's replacement service which was relatively easy to use.

And a nice big carry case for your headphones and cords.I love these and the price. I would definitely recommended these to some one else. Don't waste $200 on beats, when you can spend $50 that are just as good.

I originally wanted the Beats headphones like most kids but couldn't afford them so a guy at a local target store showed me these and I listened to them and was blown away how good they sound for $59.99! If they offered a little more bass they would be as good as beats headphones for a fraction of the price.Pros:They look great!Quality feelVery durableAmazing soundGreat price!Cons:NONE!Conclusion:BUY THESE HEADPHONES! They are great for the money. Skullcandy is a great company with a good warranty and great products. You will love these headphones. If you are shopping for a bass head and have a little more to spend checkout the Skullcandy Crushers.

VI bought from Skullcandy direct and it was shipped 5 days after I received an Email that it had been sent. Regardless of shipping these are not quality headphones. They are very light and plastic feeling, didn't fit around my ears correctly. The sound is like you are a foot away from speakers, or in other words the sound doesn't feel present it feels far away. I do not recommend these headphones for the $30 from direct let alone the $60+ on Amazon.

VHeadphones came quickly, new in box, undamaged. The problem is what I was afraid of while ordering...the description said "black/black" but the transaction allowed me to choose a color. So I did. I still got black/black. It's not a deal-breaker and it's too close to Christmas to horse around with returns...I just wish I hadn't been expecting gray/lime instead.

VNice quality and comfort
p336
sg5
VI purchased the grey/cyan/magenta Hesh 2 headphones with the detachable cord. This is exactly what I got. The sound quality is great, nice stereo, and the bass is defined but not overbearing. They're very comfortable on the ears, but the top of the band can start to make my head hurt after a few hours. I have found that on the smallest size (they are adjustable), they are still a bit loose. I doubt they'd fall off easily though. The detachable cord is an almost rope like material, and considerably long. Overall, a good buy for $45 since they're usually $60- and be sure if you're buying on Amazon to watch the prices for a while, as I noticed that from day to day certain colors/styles are cheaper than others. The day after I bought this color, they went back up to $53. Glad I bought them when I did.

p342
sg5
VI bought these for work when I worked in a loud area. But now that I have an office, these got thrown in my gym bag. At the gym they cancel out most of the sound so I can have a workout in peace, but I wish they were a bit less bulky. sometimes they might bang on a piece of equipment. But they are great when Im doing cardio! Great brand! I have had these for over a year now! I do wish I could find a pair that was cordness though so I can stop pushing the cord down my shirt.

VI picked these up about two years ago and have found them decent but not the best headphones I've ever had. I had some smaller skullcandy headphones in the past and loved those, they sat well on my head and the sound was still great. I find these a bit big and bulky. After more than an hour of wearing them I find that they press into the sides of my head and often I have to take them off because it hurts to wear them for too long. I usually only use them if I'm watching or listening to something with very low volume. They do have great sound and I have no complaints about that.

For them to only stay intact for 2 1/2 months is not good quality.  He's totally bummed he spent over $45 of his own money to buy something that fell apart so quickly.

VThird pair of Skullcandy headphones I own. Used for monitoring during band jam sessions. Only issue is that, wish it included a 3.5 mm headphone jack/cord that was just TRS, not TRRS. The microphone ring does not allow proper connection when used with my JamHub extension cords. Had to purchase a different cord to use in that situation. Finding a small enough jack that fit in the narrow connection port was a challenge.

p485

VWe were so excited to buy this for my daughter for her birthday, and she used it lightly for less than 2 months.  All the use was sitting down on a couch, not moving around.  7 weeks after we bought it, the right ear started crackling and the left ear stopped working.  We couldn't return it through Amazon because it was outside the 30 day return window.  When I looked up Skullcandy's warranty, I found that you have to ship the product to them on your own dime, and then if it's defective, they'll give you a coupon good for more Skullcandy product for the amount you paid.  Poor policy and poor customer service.  I don't want to buy this again, but if I want to get my money back, I may have to.

p513
sg5
VPassable headphones. I've used over the headphones before such as Sony, Panasonic, Bose. I've purchased these because of the cheap price and I figured I could carry them everywhere for rough use. However, the sound quality isn't as great as you'd expect for such bulky headphones. For the price, it was average at best. I liked that it had a detachable cord from one side only, definitely makes it tangle free when you're moving around with them. But, I wish skull candy made them a bit more sound proof...I've noticed that the sound leaks quite a bit and even at the lowest possible volume, it was very easy to hear the sound from the outside.Overall, I'd say these headphones are worth it for the price if you're short on time and you need to grab headphones immediately from the shelves. You won't be too disappointed especially at the price point, but you may think twice in the long run. Hope this helped!

VI bought myself a pair of these to use when DJing on a local radio station and when editing audio files for air play. They are not the best headphones I've ever used, but they are very good -- and you can't beat them in the $40-$70 price range, in my opinion. I liked them so well that I bought pairs for two of my interns--college students. They also like them a lot. They are not "noise-cancelling" headphones, but their tight over-ear design cuts out a lot of room (or airplane) noise.If I were mastering audio for a CD, I think I'd want something in the $200-$500 price range.  But for ordinary listening or working in radio, Hesh 2 headphones are just fine. Great deal for the price. Recommended.

Vi should have heeded the ratings i saw. i've only had the headphones for 3 months and i can already hear the left speaker rattling inside the headset. i read the low reviews but didn't want to believe that these head phones would fall apart so quickly, since a previous set i owned lasted me for over 2 yrs before i lost them. this both sad and disappointing. i'm sorry i didn't believe the reviews. PBS screwed me out of (roughly) 40 dollars.

VThese are SERIOUSLY noise canceling.  I know some people have said they don't work as well as the Bose, etc., and I'm sure that's true, but I've never used high end headphones so can't compare.  But I will say my daughter had me try them out listening to her music while she talked to me, and I thought she was only pretending to talk.  I couldn't hear anything! Everyone corroborated her speaking in a normal voice while I had them on. I was impressed!

So far they have been comfortable enough for 1-2 hours at a time.  I've been impressed enough that I've put some Skullcandy Crushers on my short list of future purchases.

I would give them five stars but sometimes the top band hurts my head and I have to shift them every so often.  They are comfortable otherwise.  I'm not a huge headphone geek so I don't know how they compare to skull candy or anything like that but they work wonderfully for my job. I bought them because of the good reviews, and many of them say they are just as good as the more expensive ones.  I've been using them for six months now and am very happy with them!

VI like that the cord is detachable so it can be stored separately instead of wrapping around the headphones in a messy tangle.  The cord can also be used as an AUX cable.Skullcandy will always be my company for headphone purchases.  Perhaps the quality isn't as good as something like Bose, but the sound is good enough for most purposes, and the price is significantly cheaper.The warranty is amazing as well.  Send in headphones that have broken when it's not your fault, and they'll give you a gift card for the full price so you can buy a new pair.  Even if you break the headphones on purpose, sending them in will still get you a gift card for half of the price.  Can't beat that.

VThese headphones are pretty good at cutting off outside noise and make decent sound, but the cord they come with gets kinked. About a week into owning it the wires started poking out of the cloth covering in places where kinks got really bad and have to be tucked back in. Also, the ear coverings are quite large and make it look like you're wearing over-sized earmuffs if you've got a tiny head (like I do)

VThese Headphones are great. They are comfortable and they can be worn for long periods of time. but I have a thin face and these leave some gaps between my face and the cups for sound to get in and out of. The sound quality if your looking for base isn't high in the slightest but if you want crisp highs and an amazing middle range these are great. They are also very sturdy and have a long life span I've had mine for 2 years and no problem. Worth 40-50$ but I wouldn't pay more. I still love these things and am very happy with my purchase.

VI use these practically everyday for more than a year now and they're still going strong, the removable cable is a plus as I have had a couple of cables go bad on me resulting in sound coming from only one side.Good sound quality, if you have android you should look up Viper4Android (http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2191223) it's an equalizer with many options and makes these sound much better as if they were 2 to 3x the cost.

VI am no audiophile, but these sound great. We bought them for my son when his sister ruined his original pair of Hesh. He in turn left the new pair, these, mixed up with his dirty laundry and they were run through the washing machine. We heard them clunking around in the dryer. Pulled them out, plugged them in, and THEY STILL WORKED!

VI have 2 pairs of these one white and one black.  For the price these things can't be beat especially by Beats.  Good bass and I can hear everything clearly.  They are pretty durable too.  I've dropped mine lots of times and besides getting scratched up they didn't fall apart or explode like the pair of Beats I wasted 200 bucks on did.  They are awesome in the winter because they act like ear muffs and keep your listening devices nice and warm, summer on the other hand kills me as you will be dripping sweaty and just feeling unpleasant.  They are big but that doesn't really bother me at all.  All in all these things are worth every penny and if you like different types of music they are a good buy because everything that comes out of these sounds really good.

VI was so devastated when I lost my last pair that I had to buy another one. Although not necessarily touted as noise cancelling headphones, they drown out the extra cacophony at work. They become slightly uncomfortable on the head after long use, but then again, I wear them for 7 1/2 hours a day. Rich base, and crisp, clear sound. Love that the wire disconnects from the headphones - you can buy another one when it goes out. Brilliant!

VThese are really great headphones for the price. $45 free shipping with prime.Man that is a STEAL. I went to Target and they have the Hesh 2.0 as $60 still.Anyways, the only problem with these is that there is no mic included. So if you want a mic these headphones aren't for you. Yes the listing says there is a mic, but there isn't. I don't care since I wouldn't have used it, but it still sucks that it can mislead others.All in all, the headphones have great sound quality and block out sound pretty nicely and are pretty comfortable. Mine didn't have any defects when I got it or anything, and even if it did - it would most likely be the cord....which is replaceable! :)Having a replaceable cord ALSO makes these headphones great since thats the first thing that always goes bad and you can find similar stiles of the cords on here for around $6.tldr;Pros:ComfortableNice Sound QualityPretty to look at (at least for me they are)Not heavyReplaceable cordCons:No micPS ~ The cord is a braided cord.

VI have always been a fan of Skullcandy headphones but I usually just bought earbuds because they were cheaper and seemed more convenient than carrying around giant headphones. It is now that I realized that I was very wrong. I love these hesh's. They have lasted me longer than most buds I have had, and sound quality is very nice. I can hear everything and have now become more picky about the music I listen to on places like YouTube where quality varies a lot. They have been super comfortable, I mean wear them for hours every day and they do not bug me in the least. Overall a great purchase and worth your money.

p1255

VI got these to replace my Ifrogz Dj Style Headphones. They just weren't staying on my head so I figured why not try out the skullcandy line because I've heard a lot of good things about them. Now I've been listening with the Hesh 2's for about a whole day now and they feel secure on my head. They do go around my whole ear but maybe I have small ears? The only difference between these and my Ifrogz was the bass. I mean I don't consider myself an audiophile but I do like to listen to my music on a decent pair of headphones and these fit the bill. Are there better quality headphones out there? I'm sure there are. Everyone seems to be raving about the audiotechnia models but the fact is I don't find it super important to spend 300 dollars on a pair of headphones. These are super durable I have no worries about breaking them and neither should you as long as you don't throw them on the ground and start stepping on them. For normal use I don't see these being a problem. The bass on these isn't bad but if you listen to a lot of rap or hip hop and are a bass head these aren't the headphones for you. For the other people that don't put bass as a priority these headphones do a good quality job of staying on your head and supplying you with crisp clear sound with balanced highs, mids, and bass. Personally I didn't like having my whole head shake from my Ifrogz bass. I listen to a lot of metal and these do a good job however, I would have wanted a tiny bit more put into the mids, the snare sound from the kit gets lost a little bit in the mix. It's still there but I personally love listening to the percussion especially when I'm listening to someone like Between the Buried and Me or the Faceless. Other than that they came on time and the packaging was fine. If you personally don't mind having super bass and looking for quality headphones that are durable and comfortable in this price range the Skullcandy Hesh 2's are a great option. I only gave them four stars because of the lack of mids. I would have given them a 4.5 if I could have.

VI purchased these for my daughter for her birthday.  I wanted to get her a nice entry-level set that would still perform well and yet stand up to the rigors it would inevitably experience being on the head of a newly official teenager.  Being an earbuds type of person, I was a bit lost in the sea of options.  After reading probably thousands of reviews, I opted for these and hoped for the best.  Out of the box (well, rather still in the box), I noted that they look quite nice.  Like nice enough that I would find ways to steal them when she isn't using them.  She opened them and handed them over.  They have a nice weight to them and I really like the flexibility of the band.  She pulled up her Spotify and began listening, and the look on her face told me that I had done well.  She put them on my ears, and I was satisfied.  The sound is very nice for the price point, with a depth and richness that I was not expecting.  The sound dampening must be working, as she complains less about her brother's antagonistic ways since having them on her little head.  The boy child is now asking for a pair, and I look to the future with joy at the possibility of having a reasonably silent house in spite of an 11 and 13 year-old.

VI'll start by saying that they DID look good and were a very comfortable fit. The set started out fulfilling expectations only to have right side stop working completely and left side less than adequate performance less than 3 weeks after receiving them.  Also, cord was much shorter than I expected.  Will be returning to seller for refund.

VThese headphones are absolutely amazing. I do not mean they don't have flaws, I mean they are worth what you're paying and more. I am not an audiophile, but I like music and I want it to sound good. I have broken and owned many headphones so I know how I like mine. These headphones give you great bass, crisp sound, and design. They hit all the highs of my "dubstep" music, but do not distort it. These headphones, if anything, give you a more distinct sound and make the track sound better. They do have amazing bass, but for the softer tracks they are just as good with quiet piano and guitar. Finally, I'm a teenager and will be wearing these CONSTANTLY so comfort is big. I put these on and adjusted them and they feel great. They aren't super heavy and cup your ear fairly. My mom (who does not mind bad quality) put these on and her first words were "Those are really comfortable." I'd say the only downfall of these are that they are very rounded and give you the double-bun look on your head and they aren't as good as some, but, especially for the price, they are great, great, great headphones.

VI cant believe people are seriously giving these headphones good reviews. I bought these on clearance yesterday at radio shack for 18 dollars and theyre not even worth that. The build is great but the sound is so tiny, it sounds like the music is coming from another room. I wouldnt even buy these for 5 dollars unless you just needed any headphones to carry to school or whatever without worrying about them getting damaged or lost. My iphone's speakers has better sound than this. Of course this is only for rock and alternative, when i put on some rap, the music quality kicked up 10 notches for some reason. Also unlike decent headphones, EVERYONE around you can hear the music youre listening to almost as well as you can hear it yourself, so expect stares when youre wearing these.

VSpeaking as a casual reviewer, not an audiophile.
p1482
sg5
VI'm not an audiophile by any means (I just buy headphones to occasionally listen to music from my MP3 player), so keep in mind that I'm writing this as a casual reviewer.As far as cancelling out the sound of outside noise is concerned, these will get the job done if you're the type of person that likes to crank the volume of your MP3 player up pretty high. If you're the type of person that likes to keep your music at any volume level below that, however, these won't block out any outside noise whatsoever. If someone's having a conversation ten feet away from you and the volume isn't cranked up really high, you'll hear every word of it.For sound quality, the sound seems to be decent in most cases. Out of an MP3 player with more than 1,000 songs on it, only a small handful seemed to have something like a "quality drop", but reworking the settings on my MP3 player seemed to help resolve the issue for the most part. If the device that you intend to use these headphones with allows you to change your music settings in a similar fashion, these will probably be fine.The cord... the cord is the only major complaint that I have. It's alright for home use, but the design of it makes it pretty clear that it's highly susceptible to damage and that can make carrying it around in public kind of pain. I ordered a jacketed cord from another company to use as a substitute for the cord that these came with and I highly suggest that anyone interested in buying these considers looking for a different cord as well. If you want to order a cord at the same time that you order these, keep in mind that you'll need a 3.5mm male-to-male cord and make sure the area around the connector on each end is very, very narrow.I got these headphones at a retailer other than Amazon for about $70. These are a pretty decent purchase if (like me) you don't want to spend more than $75 on a pair of headphones, but don't bother with them if you consider yourself an audiophile and/or can afford something better. These are more for casual listening and/or people working with a budget than anything else.

I would recommend the August EP640 (Which I Have) or 650

VBought these because my son had skullcandy's from about 3 or 4 years ago that I was borrowing more often than he liked. I knew I wanted a pair just like them. Unfortunately, these aren't as nice in terms of sound and fit. The ear phone is round compared to my son's that is oblong..(like the shape of an ear) So it doesn't hug your ear or fit as well hence, the sound suffers but I like the sleeker style, less bulk with cord and for the money it serves my purpose (walking) well.

VHighly Disappointed and Upset...
p1577
sg5
VHonestly, I'm super disappointed in this set from this seller. First off, the package came in a dented, half-destroyed USPS box that had gunk all over one of its corners, so that was a pretty disgusting thing to see. But that could have been the mail carrier's fault for tossing the box around in the truck. However, the seller simply shoved the item into a tight-fitting USPS flat rate box with no packing materials between the Skullcandy packaging around the headphones and the actual shipping box. So these babies probably endured all of that tossing and crushing. If I could post a photo to accompany this review, I would, because I have photos of how the box looked when I received these today and I was really angry. Could the seller NOT have written "electronics, handle with care" on the shipping box? It would've taken a few seconds.Anyway, back to the product. The headphones, while almost $55 all in (with shipping included), feel shoddily made. They were advertised as noise-canceling Hesh 2 headphones, but they are more like "too-big, noise-leaking headphones." They don't fit my head or ears as well as the Hesh 2s I tried on two days ago in Best Buy and the sound quality is worse than the ones I had on at the Best Buy store, too! Suffice to say, I will be returning these for a refund. I'm really upset, the style and color were really cute and I thought I was getting a quality product. Instead I got a banged-up set of headphones whose leather ear cushion pieces are coming apart from the plastic piece that holds them in place, and a cord with a mic that was wired backward so I can't use the microphone (I have to plug in the headphones backward to hear any sound at all, so the mic now sits at the bottom of the headset cord instead of by my mouth/face). Highly disappointed with this purchase.

VLet me start by saying that I hated music. There's a musical piece here and there I liked as long as I didn't listen to it more than once in a blue moon. More frequently than that and I would end up hating it too. I tried to keep a silent life; playing games on mute and avoiding music with no visual accompaniment by which to ignore it. These headphones were a gift, so I thought I'd do the honorable thing and appreciate the gesture.And WOW. I had never heard music like this before. I could hear every depth, every note, every after note (like the vibration echo of a piano key) with fullness, clarity. The range was nothing like I'd ever heard before. It was complete, but every part clear and separate.  No shallow tenor, no muffled bass. During my first listen to a musical piece (the ending theme to Fearless, to be exact), I was flooded with abstract emotion I can only describe as my very soul harmonizing to the music: pleasantly delighted by each musical emphasis; riding the cascading rise and fall of the musical high notes and low notes; essentially being drawn into and becoming part of the music itself while reality became a distant and faded existence.I know now what it means by "music has power," and I love it. I love music! These headphones aren't even the top of the line, but their amazing quality has invigorated an apathetic part of me that was caused by a lifetime of cheap speakers producing crappy sound. They have shown me a world I never knew in music, and I learned something about myself. I don't hate music, I hate crap. I'm a snobby audiophile!Note: all speakers are somewhat limited by the output capabilities of the device they are plugged into. If you want the best music these head phones have to offer, go into your sound setup and adjust your equalizer to produce the best sound possible based on the majority kind of music you listen to (the best equalizer settings for an opera are different from the best settings for instrumental).

VI've been. A loyal skullcandy consumer for over ten years.  The sound quality is the best for the money.  I had a pair of the ear headphones that lasted for 7 years.  I bought these and received them 2 days later through Amazon prime. I was very excited and quickly became very angry.  Straight out of the box they didn't work properly. The sound cut out with even the slightest bit of stress on the connector. Returned them immediately, went to the local best buy and purchased a replacement.

VI thought that the overall EQ of these headphones was very weak.  I primarily listen to metal, but like a good, upfront sound with nice highs and deep bass.  Bought these initially and was very disappointed.  The sound, at pretty much every volume was weak, seemed distant and distorted.  I can say my iPhone 6 headphones that came with the phone are 10x better than these.  I ended up returning them and buying the Crushers instead.  Build quality looks nice on these but I don't like the audio quality at all. I also found them to be a little small around my ears, they didn't fully surround my entire ear like many other models do.

p1725

Vskullcandy has been a go to brand for me for almost 10 years now mainly with their in ear models like the ink'd and the jib's. but i decided to buy some of their over ear models as the in ear models don't last that long before you need to buy a replacement. the hesh 2 where one of those models as they were on sale at the local store near my house for the same price as they are on amazon. the sound quality is more emphasized towards the lows than with the mids and highs. bought them so i don't have to carry around or lose my more expensive sennheiser momentum over ear headphones when i travel or go to work. overall am more impressed with these headphones than the past models of skullcandy headphones i have bought in the past. the removable cord is a non proprietary cable and will be much cheaper to replace than the ones for the sennheiser momentum's. just wish they were of a foldable design it does come with a carrying bag that is the color of the headphones

I listen to everything from Death metal to hiphop. Bass is good, not overpowerin but still hits.Highs n mids are good and clear. Blocks out noise pretty good to. The DBs have padding.The mic wire WAS INCLUDED. For $40 this is the way to go.If you want mega bass try the Crushers.

VLet's be clear I have beats ,klipsch ,tdk beats and now Skull Candy. With thunderous bass and crisp clean highs for a sub 50 set of headphones you cannot beat these, I am not a audiophile nor will I bore you with facts figures or decibels or wow you with the virtues of spending ridiculous amounts of money for style and to be the cool kid . What I will do is give you street sense,Beats are good but pricey and known to be a wee buggy with minor glitches that make you questions your good sense (check out the reviews specially the in ear models),Klipsch are awesome but feel cheap and lack at the punch. Skull candy out of the box just worked and worked well they are a wee heavy but the interchangeable cord and a good player more than negate the weight (android I use power amp ) Apple well just the stock but with a few tweaks(player with an eq) to tame the bass or crank it up  these headphones well out pace the Beats and all aforementioned. Here is the test Poison Every Rose has its Thorn sounds amazing from beginning inhale to the strum it's like your in the studio,Tom Petty is equally impressive and the longer these sit over my large ears the more comfortable they are. Buy the over priced over marketed if you want or save a few and invest in the Hesh04-19-2015Working the Vampire shift has provided me with ample time to test these Headsets in different conditions here is a update 36hrs laterThese Headsets are super comfortable - my shift is 12 hours long and for the majority of the time these headsets rested over my ears comfortablyUsed for Netflix and Music the Hesh rocks handling both vocal,movie and music exceptionally wellInvest in a secondary cable the Aux cable that came with my unit was short but there is not limit to the customization of the cable with color matching to control talk (I personally opted for the control talk with mic )Oh almost forgot while the Hesh are not noise isolation they do a darn good job of blocking out excess noise and creating a immersive environment

Honestly you are better off spending half the price for some of their earbuds and you will get a better sound quality than these.

VSkullcandy Rawks!!!!!
p1899
sg5
Vi Always liked Skullcandy since seeing it on Campus in UConn, I wish I could actually afford moreMy only complaint is that they're not quite hearing aid compatible and slightly bulky, which means my BTE hearing aids kind of "whistle" when they make contact, the "pillow" cushioning was comfortable though.The colours were perfect, no faded color anywhere, the "Copper"was shiny, the Skull emblem was Epic Win.Because I'm Profoundly Deaf, which means it has to be @ a specific volume and my hearing aids amplify sound in a certain setting, so basically a person can hear what I'm listening to clear across the room.I enjoy the sharp clarity,plenty songs (and Streamed Movies) sound perfect when the connection isn't buffering, I've even been able to doze off w/o worrying whether they'd break, they're sturdy enough(Which isn't to say you can abuse them, but they're)I wasn't exactly pleased with the packagings condition when it arrived, the saving grace was that there was no scratch nor anything damaging to the product per se, I still find the bag it came with rather cool.It also arrived promptly which was just as pleasant.

p1928

VSound quality is great.  However, the ear cups are too round.  I know that sounds nitpicky, but I have big-ish ears, and after listening for an hour or so, the tops of my hears start to hurt from the pressure of the ear cups pressing on them.  If it wasn't for this, they'd be nearly perfect.Quality is great otherwise.  Great sound quality (I'm no audiophile, though).  Blocks outside noise pretty well.  Cord seems durable as I've accidentally ran over it with my office chair a few times and it still works perfectly.But those damned ear cups.

VAwesome Headphone Set!
p1940
sg5
VTo be fair, I bought this headphone set way before I knew that I was somehow choosing sides between Beats and everyone else. So my opinion is pre-line-drawn-in-the-sand. I really like this headset and it is the best one I have ever owned. I like the subtle tone and the detachable audio cable which will extend its lifespan over time. It was also more comfortable than my other head sets. The rubber pads are detachable which is useful for keeping them clean as I wear this to the gym a lot. If SC ever makes a version of the Hesh with a mic, I am definitely grabbing one! Also, now that everyone is obsessing over Beats (for no reason, btw) the SC brand is now pretty unique and makes my cranium stand out (more so than usual, I guess :P)If you are looking for a headset and haven't already made up your mind (which, by reading this you probably haven't) consider grabbing this one. It may not be a Bose, but it's still pretty good. And since it isn't all trendy, you won't look goofy wearing it. Trends are lame. This headset is awesome!

VI like the Hesh 2 Over Ear Headphones because they are very comfortable and are constructed well. With these headphones it is very easy for me to have them on for 2 hours and not even notice it. The detachable cable comes in handy when transporting the headset, no cord to tangle. The carrying bag that came with the headset also makes it easy to transport. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone I play my music on and the sound is just great. While I haven't been able to use the in-line switch that comes with the headphone it works great with the phone also. I have used the Hesh 2 to playback stereo sound while streaming shows it works great and doesn't put an undue burden on the phone battery.

VVery high quality headphones for the price
p1987
sg5
VI was looking for a good pair of headphones that were inexpensive, comfortable and noise suppressing. I bought these at best buy for $60. They are very good quality for the price. The detachable cable is probably the best feature of these headphones because if you ruin the cable, you don't have to spend a bunch of money on a whole new pair of headphones. They're great for listening to music, watching movies, playing video games, etc. The sound quality is very good. the only notable downside is that since the headband has no cushion, the top of your head may start to hurt after about half an hour with them on. The cushions on the ear cups are very comfortable while still being noise suppressing. It's not completely silent with them on, but it muffles the sound around you pretty well. These headphones suited all of my needs and I'm glad I bought them.

p2004
sg5
VSound is terrific. For the price, it is probably the best choice for rock/pop music listening. Much better than the far most expensive brand Beats. The only reason I did not give it a 5 stars is the electrical noise that can be heard at the slightest movement of the cable (noise typical of bad contact). This happens due to the oxidation of the 3.5mm stereo connector's metallic surface. To fix this, I had to "polish" it using a polish paste.  When the connector surface became bright and smooth, the noise disappeared.

VThese showed up super fast (thanks Amazon!) and I was pretty excited. Took them out of the packaging and they seemed fine.

Tried using the in-line control and it didn't work right, STILL thought it was me. Got to work, plugged them in to my computer and the sound quality was TERRIBLE. Then I messed around with the in-line again. Turns out, the sound quality was off because the in-line control wasn't working right and the only time the sound quality improved was when I had my finger holding down the in-line control. Uhm, nope. These are going right back. Bummer cuz they are sleek and comfortable, but I'd rather pay a third of the price for ear buds that I know will work than go through having to order these again.

VStill the Best, Skullcandy Hesh 2.0
p2145
sg5
VI absolutely adore my new headphones. I have always been a fan of the Skullcandy brand. All my headphones/ earbuds have been this brand since I was in Middleschool and now being in college, I still just love love love them. My order came in three days earlier than the estimated delivery time and I received gifts with my headphones. My favorite was the Nature Valley coconut almond protein bar. My new best friend and a snack? What joy. I had both my friend and mother try out the Skullcandy head phones. My friend said "It sounds just like a concert, but better." And my mom just shook her butt a lot in the kitchen while cooking dinner and rockin out.I don't believe in buying the hottest trend. Just because it is not the most expensive and most common, doesn't make it top tits. My sister has Beats by Dre and my new loves, Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 Headphones, are just as amazing, if not more.

p2169
sg5
Vcant wear ear buds wanted good sound quality and comfort for listening while waiting in airports, at the beach etc. These are quite comfy, however, they sound strange. I have played with the EQ on my Iphone etc but they still sound odd. No where near as good as my Sonys but these are more comfy. It seems the bass is muddy and not clear, reproduces some low tones well but not others, and the vocals etc are odd sounding, like there is no presence to them. I do like the detachable cord and the price, just wish the sound was better.

VMy kids are hard on headphones.  They usually blow out the speakers within months after receiving them or the quality is not what one would expect.  These however are the best they've used so far. Maybe I'm frugal but I'm not cheap.  For the price that I paid, I am quite pleased with the way they have held up and so are the kids.  The sound quality is good and there is no problem with lack of volume.  My son will sometimes where them off his ears, playing the music loud so we can listen in on what he's listening to.  He loves Jazz music and wants to get our opinion. My daughter is one of those kids who provides comments on videos and games, so she needs a good mike.  The quality is excellent.  Both are avid gamers and both love the headsets.  I think that says a lot when a 6th grader and 8th grader all pleased with the product.  By the way, they've had these a couple of months and no sign of problems.

VBought these for my SO (my color choice was the gray/lime) and they are truly fantastic. Easily comparable to a pair of high end (think Beats and the like) 2x or even 3x the price. Excellent noise cancelling. Crisp, clear bass. Super comfortable and well designed. They also get quite loud without sounding "blare-y". Such a great value for the money. Would absolutely recommend.

Couldn't figure out why the background singers sounded louder than the main singer.  Thought something was wrong until my husband adjusted it back for me.

p2317

VLike the sound of the headphones. For the price I didn't expect them to be the best. I'm using them for my e-drums and needed a slightly longer cord but I'll just buy an extension I guess. The "click" button to advance tracks doesn't appear to work on the cord using it with either my old 2nd gen ipod or the new 5th gen I just bought. So, I'm keeping a star Skull Candy. But, they did come with a granola bar!  :-)UPDATE! After the clicker NOT working on my ipods, as mentioned, I tried it on my wife's iphone and it DID work. Out of curiosity, I then tried the clicker again on my ipods and it then worked! Maybe the clicker was stuck but, as for now, it works. Will update again if it decides to not work again.

p2401

VThere are important 3 categories to discuss here. Sound, Comfort & Quality, Look.Sound: The sound quality of the Hesh 2 is pretty amazing. As far as I have seen no other brands in a similar price range can quite compare. The stereo sound is clear and crisp and rich, and depending on the power output of your music device, it generally handles full volume without damaging your ears on making you wrinkle your face up. The bass is great! In certain songs and volumes you can literally feel the bass. Not as much as say in a pair of Skull Crushers (twice the price), but it is enough. If you are looking at reviews to find out if these are worth buying the answer is yes, and they are worth the price.Comfort & Quality: I have purchased 3 Hesh 2 pairs to date (some of them gifts) and of all of the ones I have tried this particular edition is by far the most comfortable. The cushion seems to be of higher quality than the other types, and the overall product just feels more sturdy. Some reviews mention that the Hesh 2's greatest downfall is that the head-strap hurts your head - take note - this is only the case in of editions that do NOT have a cushion. The cushion one's are like pillows around your head. It is also worth mentioning that the cord is detachable (useful) and really good quality. The round cord also prevents it from getting tangled at all.Look: Here is the catch. The product does not look exactly like it does in the provided image. The image provided shows a deep maroon colour with a mat finish giving it an overall smooth look. But in reality it isn't mat at all, and the colour is more of a maroony-pinky-red gloss (sorry, strange but accurate description - I'll attach an image). But do not stress it is still completely amazing. I only bought these headphones because I thought the colour and mat was appealing, but I am actually really surprised how smooth they still look.Overall I am impressed with this particular edition, maybe its better because it's a special edition The order was received two days earlier than it was expected so over all I couldn't be happier.. I am sure nobody will ever see this nicely typed up review, but if you do I really hope my feedback was helpful.- Tristan Daley

p2436
sg5
VThe headphones themselves only fit my head on the farthest extension, and aren't very comfortable to wear around my neck. Granted, if Skullcandy would have manufactured my neck/head, these would be perfect. Sound quality is excellent for the price-- deep but not overwhelming bass with nice mid and treble too. Overall very pleased and currently working on shrinking my neck for a more solid review, haha.

VBest Headphones for $60 Or Less
p2484
sg5
VThese headphones feel great. I can wear these for more than 4 hours on my head and they do not hurt. These headphones sound great with bass booster. Using  bass boosters will not ruin the sound. These headphones are easy to adjust and stay on your head as long as you are not running. The cord is detachable. The headphones are flexible so they are tough. I had had these for about 7 months and they still are great. No wear and tear just a bit dirty but shouldn't be hard to clean. Cord is not tangle free but not a deal breaker.

V1 tip for comfort buy some kind of fabric  and attach it to the headband, because it happens to be made of a sort of plastic. I just used the carry bag and taped it on.

VThe Very Best Bang For the Buck
p2524
sg5
VThese are the very best bang for the buck. They are more comfortable than my Bose! The sound is not quite as good as the Bose, when you switch back and forth a few times, but when I first put them on, I though they were as good sound wise as the Bose. Way better base than the Dr. Dre phones. The mids and highs are very crisp yet warm and don't hurt my ears. The base isn't as loud as some other phones, but the base is very deep and amazingly clear. Unlike all other headphones I have ever used (beside Bose) my ears don't touch the speaker covers. The band pressure is perfect. Not to tight, yet not loose. The previous generation was a little to tight. The cups are very soft and supportive, with real leather, and fit any skull perfectly. The fit is so superb that they are comparable to noise canceling units. These are way better than Dr. Dre, and a good chose price wise, looks wise, and performance wise. My one and only complaint, the cups don't swivel, so I can't have them on one ear at a time.

p2600
sg5
VI bought these for Christmas. They arrived in the official box, yet it was kind of raggedy, for new headphones. Opened them to find a soft touch finish that feels great. The ear cups aren't that comfortable to be honest. They start to hurt after about 20 minutes of usage. They look great, and the material feels good to touch. The sound quality is nothing spectacular. Everything sounds a bit mono, as if the left and right speaker are that you would only get a semi-stereo effect. They are stereo headphones though, but it just sounds a little muffled. Bass response is good, but isn't as punchy as I would like, but it is a definite improvement over my pair of Skullcandy Skullcrushers. I like the detachable cord as well. Overall, this was a good purchase and I don't feel like I wasted my money, but they aren't worth as high as $65, they're more worth $45-$50.--UPDATE Nov.15, 2015--They're subpar. They work alright and the earlier mentioned problem with the mono sound is still here. The wire is annoying now. I have to position it correctly for it to sound good. Less then impressed now.

VI got a pair of these for Christmas 2013 (i had to get the replaced in the summer, because of the cable or the headphones, i can't remember.). I'm a bit dissapointed. the cushions seem comfortable at first, but soon leave my head hurting because they push down on my head. The cables that come with the headphones tend to wear out quickly. With my phones EQ options, there really isn't any sound difference.  Unless the volume is almost all the way up, the headphones aren't good at blocking sound, even in a quiet classroom.However, vocals are clear and the music quality is fairly good, especially for music such as metal, rock, screamo, post-hardcore, etc.Apart from the bulkiness, headaches and the fact that even at the lowest volume, they have a habit of vibrating in my ears, if you want them for listening somewhere with little sound, like a bedroom, then they're great. albeit, loud.

p2779
sg5
VAfter searching for weeks for the ideal headphones, I selected these based on the many positive reviews. I must agree that the sound quality was awesome and they were quite comfortable. Unfortunately, the sound went out completely in one of the earpieces and I was unsuccessful with my request for a refund/replacement. The sellers have referred me to the manufacturers (Skullcandy), but no luck so far. This happened after having the headphones for about three months. I may as well have purchased a $10 or $20 headphone. At least when it stopped working, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. My son bought a cheap pair of earbuds from the local drugstore for $5 and they're still working perfectly 8 months later. He told me I should have saved my money.....

I only wish the wire was longer.  Have not had the set very long, maybe a couple of months - time will tell if they remain as good a year or two from now.  I am a 61 yr. old female and have had many years experience with audio/stereo devices.  The Skullcandy S6HSDZ-161 Hesh 2.0 rocks!  Got my money's worth and then some. Comfortable and fit well.  This set really EXCEEDED my expectations.  I don't usually buy something like this before trying it first but am glad I did.

VFor the price, you can't beat these headphones.  Bought for my kid, but I'd be fine using them myself.  Sound isn't quite as good as my $200 TDK, but I am guessing some of that can be compensated for with the player's equalizer.  Build seems durable, fit is definitely comfortable, and I love the idea of the removable/replaceable cord (my kid's previous 2 pair both needed to be thrown out because the wire went bad, with these you can just buy a new wire).

VI think Skullcandy did a great job with these headphones.  The design is unique and attractive.  One of the things that caught my eye on these was the detachable (replaceable) cord.  Should your cord get crimped on most headphones, you've just bought yourself a new set.  With these, if you lose or damage this cord, you can get another for a couple of bucks.  These are well constructed and do not appear cheap in anyway.  Sound quality is excellent.  I have played: rock, country, alternative and talk radio through these.  The bass is superb without being overpowering.  Talk radio came through clearly and I could make out every word, which is a problem with many bass boosting headphones.They can be a bit uncomfortable when wearing glasses with the extra pressure but I believe this is an issue with many over the ear headphones so I don't fault them for that.  I would like to see the next edition come out with oblong ear holes for someone like me with large ears.

VI was really expecting a lot from these headphones, but they are purely underwhelming. Nothing stands out and they're just bland. I decided to use these for a week, thinking I would somehow ease into them, but that just didn't happen. These are a durable and sturdy set of headphones which is great, but they make your ears/ side of your head hurt after a while, which sucks. They are also huge! I wasn't aware of this until I took them out of the packaging but these are a pair of bulbous headphones! Reading a lot of reviews, I see people saying that they are great "for the price," but if you want headphones that are actually great and not just ok, you are going to have to be willing to spend some more. On a positive note, the detachable cord is really handy! Also the colour, which isn't properly seen here is a nice metallic burgundy. I guess the colour and the cord are what made this three stars for me instead of two.

VBoth of my sons wanted headphones for Christmas. Son # 1 ordered these ones because he wanted the skullcandy name. Son #2 ordered some phillips bluetooth headphones. These are very nice headphones that sound great, I would have given 5 stars if I did not have son#2's phillips bluetooth (the red and black ones) to compare them to. The phillips are more comfortable, better sounding, smaller, bluetooth (no wire) and less expensive than these. Like I said, these are really great and they have no problems. But I like the phillips ones better.

VThis has been our saving grace!  We have tried every headphone from Beats to Bose with our 11 year old Autistic son that has severe sensory processing disorder also. He hated every pair of headphones and ear buds we bought him. These? He doesn't take them off. It is like a miracle. This could quite possibly be one of the greatest days of my life! THANK YOU SKULLCANDY! You have saved our sanity! 100% awesome!Brandi Dabbs

I can't understand why over-the-ear phones do not block out ambient noise, but these don't. They sounded OK if you turn up the volume. Will keep them as backup but will not take them on planes

VI just received these today, I've been wanting a really good pair of headphones that deliver great sound quality without having to break the bank.This pair is hands down one of the best I have ever owned...ever.  Each level of sound, sounds great.  Highs, mids, lows and bass.If you're on the fence with this pair, it's definitely worth every penny.The pair also is built really well, feels like it would take a lot for it to break.  I've been wearing it for about an hour, and don't have any real discomfort on my ears or head.  In the past I've worn headphones to make your ears ache like crazy having to always reposition them always in order to keep them feeling somewhat comfortable.Get these headphones they are awesome, you won't be disappointmentes

VLove the color. Quality of sound doesn't seem any more than any other headset. Very short cord. I had to by an extension to use it. The heavy material used on the ear covers are very hot to wear-makes my ears sweat. When all my equipment is shut off I can still here a faint "radio" type static noise and voices and music. I'm not sure why and it doesn't really matter. I would probably buy a less expensive model than this one but I like it ok.

VIt is a great set of headphones! Although it gets a little warm with extended use, its still fairly comfortable and easily adjustable. Main downside to its design is that it looks rather bulky, but other than that its good. A good amount of flexibility yet still stable.Sound quality is good. Its not the absolute best, but considering the price its still really good! And the detachable cord is awesome because I know if something ever happens to the chord I can just switch it out with another one.I'm going on 6 months of use as of now and I haven't had any problems with it whatsoever. Overall I'm happy with it. Its a great all-around headset for listening to music, playing games, and general youtube browsing/movie watching.

He really likes how soft and comfy they are. He also commented how something he was listening to sounded like it was behind him. I'll translate that into "they sound good compared to the old ones"

VAs a former owner of similar skullcandy headphones that broke after a few years of use, I bought these from BB for $25 and thought I was getting a great deal. I was sadly mistaken.I have a large head and typically need the headphones to be fully extended to either fit or be somewhat comfortable. These headphones do not fit very well. They slide off under minimal movement. I like to wear these when I do activities and chores around the house, but failed miserably.As far as sound goes, if all you are looking for is quality low bass and below average highs, this is for you. If you are looking for something that has a bit more range, look elsewhere. If you can find a better deal on these and are into EDM, Rap/HH and anything that doesn't require mids to highs.....Go for it.Honestly, I just bought a pair of Sony MDRZX100 at walgreens for $10 (with upgraded wire & jack plug) and haven't picked up the SC since.My advise, keep researching.

VFan-friggin-tastic headphones!
p3307
sg5
VGot these based on numerous recommendations from people online and at a couple local stores. I was looking for something that fit over the ear, was comfortable over long periods of wear, was purple, durable, had great sound quality, and was noise-canceling enough that I could wear them while on my riding mower but not have to blast out my eardrums just to hear them.I already owned a pair of SkullCandy earbuds and loved the sound quality, so these sounded ideal. I must say, I am NOT disappointed! These fit the bill perfectly. They are very sharp looking and super comfortable.The only "negative" thing I can think of, that some might consider a positive, is that I find them difficult to adjust for my head without taking them off first and adjusting each side separately. You've really gotta pull down hard to adjust them. However.....this could also be a positive as they won't become loose causing you to have to tighten them every so often like you do with other headphones. I also wish the cord was a bit longer.Now, if they could make a bluetooth version of these in the same price range, I'd be in heaven!

VI bought the Hesh 2 to upgrade from my skullcandy earbuds. I was disappointed in these headphones because the bass was not as good as the bass sound produced by my $12 earbuds. I thought it would be better, clearer, sharper. But no. The sound quality is good for the Hesh 2, but even with a boostet, the vilume and bass is weak. I still have them because I was so confident they would be perfect for me that I destroyed the packaging, otherwise I would have returned them.

VI Own these bought them for a much higher price but still think they are worth it.  They are quite big and if I need to DO anything or move around with them they are hot but the cancel sound really well (almost too well I have to take them off when I'm with my 5yo.) but it's Nice to block out other sounds and the quality sound is good.

VThe Hesh 2 is probably the best headphones for under $75 regarding the sound quality, build quality and comfort. Out of the box they look quite small, but they easily fit over your ears.Pros:Huge driversAmazing sound qualityRemovable line inBuilt to lastComfortablePassive noise cancelationCons:Headphones do not play nicely with glasses (they squeeze them)Makes you look like a CybermanDoes require a bit more power to run them because the drivers are quite largeOverall, I can't find a honest reason to gripe about them because there simply is nothing to gripe about.

p3568

VThe short review:These headphones have the looks, there is a certain rugged feel to them especially the cord (think blue-jean coated wire). Electronic music sounds great! hi's and low's dynamically work to provide amazing sound... however that is it. I listen to all ( and I do mean ALL)  kinds of music and I did not find the sharpness and definition when listening to classical, rock or gregorian chants (love em). They are also uncomfortable if worn for more than a couple of hours.The detailed review:Comfor/stylecolors and presentation are very modern and I think they were clearly making this part of your "outift". overall these headphones just scream personality and individuality. unfortunately, they do hurt your ears if worn for too long. Not hurt like others are saying from how tight they fit (because I think they're not tight at all) but because the earcups fold your ears into an awkward position as if someone is bending your upper ear back.In my opinion this is the worst part of the headphones. So I have to play around with the positioning just to get a break, but it will soon start to hurt in this new position. A word of warning: these can go really loud (unsafely loud) so I suggest you keep the volume down.Soundthe most premium range on these is a distinct "punchy" bass that makes kickdrums and any low percussion instrument sound really cool (although not natural). A double bass drum metal riff really stands out bombastically!. this however works to a disadvantage because this "punchy" characteristic makes classical, jazz, and any other melodic bass sound acceptable if not muffled. Without getting too technical, the mids and highs are well defined and balanced. I can't help but think that these were tuned more towards the electronic music crowd as the responsive for this genre is absolutely outstanding. making calls on the mic and sound quality is great with none of that static plagues most units.Bonus!Noise cancelling is passive the closest I can get to describing it is by imagining a pillow wrapped around your head. Not going to do miracles but it's a nice feature. Amazing earmuffs in the winter!

p3574
sg5
V(To begin with I am an audiophile) I've had these for about four months. I bought them full price at target. And, their okay. Not too shaby.Bulid.Made of plasic  but the grey/lime green is also covered in a soft rubberized layer that makes the headphones feel nice in the hand.The headband is very thin and soft, and while on the head you receive no hot spots.The earpads are every soft. But warning if you have ears that the length are of more than 2 1/4 inches, you're ear will not actually fit inside the earcup.SoundVery clean, but still muffled. After four months it seems that the drivers are officially been run in after almost everyday heavy use age.Lows. Decent. They pack a punch when the song wants them too.MIDs they're okay.. You could describe them as muffled. But overall, they're good.Highs could have been better. Not enough fullness in this area.Overall not a bad pair of cans for only $60, especially when they come with a lifetime warranty. If I had too, I'd probably end up buying them again.

VLove them! Great sound
p3750
sg5
VLove them! Great sound, the cord is detachable which is perfect. Love the color though it's lighter than the one in the pic its brighter (more red than blue) the flash changes the color. Comfortable and good base great surround sound. Has a mic so if you're plugged in to your phone you can just answer by clicking the button instead of taking them off.(Sweet...) One draw back to the manufacturing of the product however. They're a bit flimsy, when adjusting them the part in the middle(hinge) is thin and will snap with hardly any pressure so handle with care. I've had them for about 6 months and they're still in great shape. Of course I hardly use them. I will be purchasing from them in the future.

VI just got these headphones, they're straight out of the box and I rather like them. They're comfortable, the cord seems durable, and the sound is good.I would like to point out, however, that these (The Gray/Cyan/Black) headphones DO NOT have the mic that is advertised. They are just headphones.At least, I can't find any mic. I'm assuming it's supposed to be in the cable with the one-button control, which there is none. There is no listing for a mic on the box, either.

VWorth the birthday money
p3862
sg5
VWhen my friend let me try out his, I instantly wanted a pair of my own. I waited for about a month for my birthday to get the money for it, and bought it right away. The sound is great, the bass is nice and solid, and I love the fact that the cord is detachable so I don't have to get a new pair when I break the cord.The only negative thing I have to say is that if you wear glasses, they do start to hurt after a while. Without my glasses, they hurt my ears after 2 or 3 hours of constant wear. I just kept my old in-ear headphones when that starts to happen.I'm not a technical person so I can't tell you all the little details, but in short they're awesome.

Definitely a must-have for college students, or taking on a plane or anywhere else that you want to listen to your music and not other people. The sound is crisp and clear, and the bass is pretty decent, too. I haven't had any problems with them yet, and they seem to be quite durable.

VOverpriced, Terrible Sound Quality, Very Bad Design. Read My Review Before Buying This Product!
p4008
sg5
VI rarely review, usually only when I'm passionate about steering someone away from something that is a ripoff.And that is exactly the case with the Skullcandy Hesh 2.0. This product is overpriced garbage.DO NOT BUY!Now here's why:Right off the bat, the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like old school AM radio, *with a blanket covering it*. I was shocked at how bad the sound quality was, right out of the box. It's possible the product was defective, but I highly suspect that that is the quality that you get. I've bought many cheap headphones, but this one took the award for Worst Sound Quality, and it was a bit more higher priced than what I'm used to. As someone else described in a review perfectly, the sound quality is muffled and sounds distant.Now some other important criticisms.First, the cord is too short. Guys, 3foott/1meter cords are never, ever going to be long enough. Expect to be chained to whatever your input is. It's just not long enough.Even more importantly, the ear coverings themselves are too small and circular. I guess if you have baby ears, this will cover your ears perfectly. Look carefully at that picture. Yes, they look as small as they do in the picture! I have fairly small ears, and these would not comfortable cover the tops or bottoms of my ears. They should be oblong. They aren't. The speaker compartments themselves do not swivel, so they did not mold well at all to the shape of my head (a handsome head, I must say, with some scars, but no bulgings). These things would not fit flush. I doubt if the cheap plastic these things are made of are going to handle the stress of the headphones on my head for long periods of time without giving in eventually to the pressure of not fitting well.It's ludicrous that these things sell for over $40. I was honestly stunned that something designed so badly was selling for more than much better cheaper headphones. Thus, my rare review.And why the price difference for variation in colors? $65 for a plain BLACK pair? Someone should be arrested for this nonsense. If you pay $65 for a pair of these piles of steaming dung, you should be taken to the factory in China where they manufacture these abominations and made to work there yourself. Shiny packages, empty promises on the box, and a cool name. That's what you're paying for, kids.Fact: For some $10-20 less, you can get a Sennheiser HD201 that has oblong, large speaker coverings, that are swiveled to mold to your head, has a 9 foot cord, and most importantly, has FAR superior sound quality.I would love for those who gave this such high ratings to buy a Sennheiser HD201 and compare the two! Just because something has a lot of good reviews doesn't mean it's good quality! The many five star reviews for this product are solid proof of that!

Sound quality is great and the best part is that the cable is removable/replaceable. This is my most common problem with headphones, they always get shorts. No more. If this set gets a short, just replace the cable and you are good to go. Great buy.

VI purchases these headphones for use at the gym because my earbuds are beginning to short out. These were ALOT bigger than i thought they would be. They came a good 2 1/2" off of my head. The look and quality of the item was pretty great but the sound quality was not what i was expecting. My ear buds that i bought in 2011 sound about 10x better than these. These are cheap so for the price its not a bad deal, but just not what i want to get me going in the gym.

VPoor quality, poor build, will not fiction with most phones despite garuntee. I've never got more than a couple months of life out of their ear buds. Always fail at the jack. My opinion is the molding around the jack and the gauge of the conductors in the cable are too small. Easily break when your device is in your pocket. Last pair I will ever waste my money. My suggest is to by Sony.

VI am getting the Bose QC15 for Christmas for the utmost in music appreciation,but I tried these for now to hold me over while I take some online courses.  I have my desk set up in the living room and my partner watches tv while I work.  These headphones are impressive in their capacity to quiet outside noise just by placing them on your ears.  They are also impressive in sound quality.  I was pleasantly suprised even at full volume.  They also surprised me with a relatively good bass response.  For the money, I absolutely love these headphones!

VMy 11 year old son was set that he wanted beats headphones. After doing some research we determined to give these a try and after trying them side by side with his friends beats I can say that these were as good if not better than his friends $300 headphones. There is a clearer and more balanced sound when listening to the same song. I also liked the lifetime warranty as we know how a 11 year old will wear them hard. I highly recommend parents consider. These headphones for people who want high quality but a reasonable price.

VGreat for some video games and movies, absolute garbage for other sound devices.
p4244
sg5
VThe worst pair of headphones I have ever owned, period. Some earbuds I found from the 80's that my dad had worked better. Allow me to lay it out for you:Pros:* Some video games sound GREAT on it (Skyrim)* Netflix movies sounded OK on themCons:* Anything that wasn't Netflix or a very modern video game sounded like garbage, was almost inaudible or was missing parts of the music. I tried multiple headphones and speakers before I wrote this to be sure. I tried certain independent games, MIDI music, some other old school games and software with music and it was awful. I dare not even try it on other devices.I promptly returned these and got another brand. The quality was unacceptable. But I suppose for the price if ALL you are doing is listening to Netflix and/or playing really modern video games (post 2010) then these may be acceptable to you. But I recommend avoiding these.

VThese headphones sound great! They fit nice and snug, but not too tight.Design:Cool, hip look. Plus I prefer the over the ear headphones (YMMV). These headphones are mostly plastic but still feel solid.Sound:I couldn't justify spending an outrageous amount of money for being able to use one headphone. I tested these again Sol Republic's and Soul's by Ludicrous and I honestly thought they were just as good if not better in the bass department. I've read that the mids and highs weren't very good and that's not how I saw it. If you like bass, then you're in for a treat.Price:Do I need to say anything? Seriously can't go wrong.Overall:I give these babies a 10.

VWow! just got these headphones, and i love them already. wanted a pair of nice headphones for when i am playing my electric drums. the quality is great, and it has nice bass too. maybe it could be just a tiny bit more stronger on the high end, but still, im not complaining because you get such a good deal. way better than these "Koss" headphones i bought before it, which sucked.

VGood-looking cans, but that's about it
p4426
sg5
VI bought these headphones on the strength of the reviews on Amazon (despite trying and hating the Hesh 1s back in 2010 or 2011), and I feel very misled by the large number of five-star reviews. After wearing these cans for a couple hours, there is simply no way they're five-star (or even four-star) headphones, even based on value. If I were assigning a star value strictly based on the descriptions, I would give these cans one star because I hate them. However, I don't think they're a one-star product. They are definitely not more than two stars, though. I genuinely want to like these headphones, as they do look really cool, but I simply can't.Pros:Great aesthetic--no matter which color you choose, these are good-looking cans.Detachable cord is great.Feels solidly built.Cons:Ridiculously uncomfortable on the ears (expanded on more below).Muddy mid-range.Lackluster bass.Now, it's weird saying this, but I feel compelled to further discuss the discomfort caused wearing these cans. The ear pads are about the same size as the average on-ear headphones. And what happens, is your ears naturally want to have the cans rest on--rather than over--them. As an adult male with average-sized ears, my ears feel crowded. And forget about wearing glasses with the headphones on. Any frames thicker than wire will not accommodate your headphones, and you'll sacrifice further comfort AND audio quality, as the headphones naturally lose audio fidelity when they aren't sealed over your ears.Stay away from these headphones. You can find better options in the same price range.

VThey look like nice headphones, have not used them yet as they were bought as a gift for my son for his upcoming birthday.  The box did not say hesh 2 on it so I am a bit Leary that they are the correct ones and they look slightly different than the picture.  The picture shows a gold button/decal on the head strap that is not there and the picture looked like it had a perforated leather headband with black underneath and the ones we got have a solid purple strap.  Minor issues assuming they are in fact the high quality hesh 2 headphones I was expecting.  Just a bit disappointed it is not more clear.  My older son has the black pair and his box clearly said hesh 2.  We will see!

VI bought these headphones a year ago from Best buy. I had never bought around-ear headphones before, but I took my chances on buying these with my lack of knowledge, and it was a great choice. They have great sound quality, they're comfortable, and the detachable cord is a big plus for if you want to swap it out for a longer one. Not that the cord it comes with isn't long enough. The headphones cancel noise very well, and much better than my ear buds can. I'm not sure about whether or not the headphones bleed sound, as I haven't gotten anyone's opinion on that. Honestly, I have no complaints about these headphones. They're fantastic!

VMy first experience with Skullcandy was when I picked up a cheap pair of their original Ink'd earbuds for maybe 5 bucks right after they started appearing in local stores. I was blown away by the quality, and heartbroken when the wire failed about 2 months later.Fastforward to August 2012. After shopping for almost a month, I finally decide to get a pair of Skullcandy Hesh 2 to replace an old pair of professional-quality cans my father gave me. And the Hesh 2 are perfect- so much clearer, so much prettier, so comfortable and complete with a detachable cord for easy replacement.Over the least two years of wear and tear, even the cord took a licking and kept on ticking- something that stunned me considering my experiences with their earbuds. They never lost their fidelity, they never became a hassle, and even when I dropped them on concrete, the worst they suffered was a minor cosmetic "injury". I can more than deal with scratches to my cans, especially when they're so little.If that doesn't clarify the point enough for you, I have ordered another pair because these are more than worthy of the pittance they're asking. And now that I know there's a lifetime warranty, I feel even safer throwing more money their way.If you're looking for something with throbbing bass, this isn't quite that. If you're looking for something to work out or go biking with, this isn't quite that. Hell, if you're looking to DJ or do some sick audio recording, this probably isn't even that. But if you want to sit down, chill for a minute, and just get consumed by your music or movie or game, these are the perfect headphones for you.

VDecent and Stylish Headphones
p4536

VDecent and very stylish headphones. I love the color combination and the style of these headphones. I'm also very impressed that the wires are covered with a shoe-lace like type of material. The headphones are also pretty comfortable with decent sound quality. Overall I am pleased with my purchase. Some negative things I've found was that the sound doesn't go up as high as I want to. This could be because I only use these headphones for my computer at work, and my work computer sucks. Also the shoe-lace like material covering the wire was ripped a little when I received these headphones. Don't know how this happened; maybe because I ordered these from the middle east and the combination of heat and long distance shippment? Or it could be the manufacture's fault.

VUNWEARABLE!!!!  DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES!
p4548
sg5
VDo NOT buy these headphones!  My Sony XB500's snapped at the plastic headband/ear pivot.  So I decided to visit the local Best Buy for a new pair of headphones.  The newer Sony models did not have the nice, poofy ear muffs that I was looking for (online gaming, extended-wear FPS, Skyrim, Hulu, etc.).  Best Buy seemed to be pushing these Hesh headphones as a good chunk of the shelf was devoted to them.  I assumed they must be worth the money if BB has such a prominent display.How I wish that I would have tried on the demo set at the store!  I failed to test them at the store due to the "icky" factor of wearing a set of headphones that had been worn by who knows how many thousands of people before me.  What a mistake!These headphones are absolutely unwearable.  The apparently "poofy" ear muffs are too small, too tight, and pinch instead of comfort your ears.  The plastic headband gives WAY too much tension to the muffs.  Instead of feeling comfortably plush like my Sony's, these garbage headphones make you feel like you stuck your head in a vice!  Instead of plush, the earmuffs feel like latex doctor's gloves.To top it off, the sound coming out of these is terrible, absolutely terrible.  For 60 bucks plus tax I expected at least reasonably decent HiFi.  The AM radio in my 1966 Ford Bronco sounds better than these do.  If you are an audiophile and enjoy a full range of frequencies then AVOID THESE HEADPHONES!  I went from crystal clear Sony sound to muffled, washed out, faded garble with these "Skull candies."Lastly, they package these headphones in a kryptonite-infused plastic/cardboard box.  I had to cut and tear the headphones out of the box.  Perhaps this is why Best Buy wants to stock such a large inventory of them.  They certainly won't be five-fingered by shoplifters, that's for sure.  The box is nearly indestructible.  In fact, the box is 5x more sturdy than the headphones.  What does that mean for you?  It means you will NOT be able to return these abominations to the store.  The box must be ripped and shredded to open it.  These headphones are a one-way purchase.Honestly, I wish that I had shredded my $60 into confetti for the 4th of July or that I had used it to clean my backside.  At least I could have said that I did that once in my life.  No, instead I gave away my hard-earned money to this unscrupulous company.  Shame on you Hesh for manufacturing such a poor quality product.  And double-shame on you BB for pushing such a lousy piece of dung onto the public at such an inflated price.  I hope that karma catches up with both of these companies in the near future.BTW, I went to Lowe's and purchased some super glue + plastic epoxy.  I super-glued the Sony pieces back together like a jigsaw puzzle.  This allowed be to epoxy all around the broken pieces and put my Sony XB500's back into play!!!  Man, I wish I had just done that from the start.  My 5-year-old super-glued and epoxied Sony's sound 28x better and feel 57x better than these "candies."Avoid these headphones at all costs.  You have been warned.

VThese are great. I used to have sony headphones that i got for 20$ in target these are worth the extra cash. The only reason i didnt give them five stars was because my ears would over heat the ear paddings  (you know because we are warm blooded mammals ) after 4-6 hours of continues playing so now i decide pause my studying for a small well deserve break. Problem most likely wont happen if u onky listen to music for less than 3-4 hours. Also if by sheer coincidence a skull candy desinger reads this u should invest in liquid cooling cushions that dont make any noise while they cool the ear cushion. Make sure i get fair componsation for my idea.I think thats everything. Oh if its worth anything to the reader i have had these for close to a year an they are still working fine and i use them quite a lot as u may conclude by reading the previous paragraph.

VThese headphones are great. I have had them for about a year and a half. They have survived tons of abuse from me carrying them in a backpack all day just about every day to me throwing them around. Head phones don't usually last me very long so I decided to not get something over the top this time, but these have outlasted my Beats and Sony's that I used to own. They also have similar sound quality so its a win win.

VSkullcandy headphones
p4671
sg5
VReceived these headphones a couple of day ago am happy with the purchase. I bought a refurbished one and it looks as good as a brand new pair. The only difference I can tell is the box that was sold in. I looked as though the packaging for the headphones had been sitting around for a couple of years This  in no way deters from the headphones, For the price point they are more than adequate. The only I wish they had was a way to control the volume. I use my on my ASUS tablet which greatly improves the sound that was previously non-existent. I also like the idea that the cable can be removed from the headphones, just a nice little feature..

VGreat headphones, but lack of directions.
p4693
sg5
VThese headphone are of great quality but, they need better directions. I plugged the cord so the MIC1 operation would be at the top. This caused the headphones to sound distant and distorted.* I looked a the directions that come with the headphones and, I found that they were no help. I then tried to use a sound troubleshooting program and that did absolutely nothing. As a last effort I flipped the cord around so that the MIC1 operator button would be at the bottom of the cord. This made the headphone work perfectly.My final conclusion is that the headphone are great and are stylish but, the directions could be a little more user friendly.* By distorted I mean it took out all melody vocals, added (slight) reverberation to harmony everything, and removed melody back tracks. All of the sound that I could hear sounded far away.

VI really like these, I have a really big head, and they're actually super comfortable!  Plus, they look cool, and the particular pair I bought has a fabric coating on the headband, which seems to help my hair to not get tangled (which has been a problem with other materials)I listen to these with pandora radio on my phone, and I listen to other things on my pc as well, and I find that instrumental music, ost video game soundtracks, classical, spanish guitar, flamenco, vocal, indiepop and electronica sound fantastic & clean, whereas some of the pop/rock songs with a million things going on at once start sounding a little... muddy, I guess is the word. But, for my purposes, I use these while writing articles and things, so the type of music I listen to with them sounds perfect.  They do block out other noise to a certain extent, not completely, but enough so that I can just vaguely know what's going on around me without being distracted by it.So all in all, the sound quality is decent, and for what they are, I love them!Of course its not quite on par with something from Bose, but you know what? Having two little kids in the house, I wouldn't even consider spending nearly $400 on a pair of headphones.  These however, were only $60, and I think worth every penny!

I'm listening to a song with the bass boosted right now and the bass is bumpin for sure on these they're noise canceling u cant hear anything coming from the outside and the outside can't hear youThe only negative is that they cant fold inwards so they're not super portable but whateverAlso it's sexy as hell in the black/black

VI ordered these headphones off of Amazon a while ago and was very satisfied, I'm upgrading to the Skullcandy Mix Masters but that's because of the drastic decrease in its price.I'll give a general overview of these headphones.- The sound quality is great, nothing spectacular like audiotechnicas or bose, but for the price this has a very satisfying sound quality- The bass is obviously nothing too great, but it's there, and for what it is it's surprisingly good.- The leather material for the earcups are fairly comfortable, but I can guarantee that if you keep them on for a long period of time you're going to take them off to rub out your ear for a few seconds- The build is a cheap plastic but is still fairly durable. I've put these in the back of my backpack for a few months now(It doesn't come with a carrying case, FYI) and it hasn't made a crack, scratch or dent to it.- The headband is comfortable depending on which one you bought. I purchased the atheltic blue model back when it was 50 dollars and the headband is very comfortable.Overall, these are a very average pair of headphones for the average consumer, and well worth the price paid.

VI got this as my secondary headphones like 6 months ago. It has a decent sound quality for the price range, even though I'm not a big fan (due to the kind of music I listen) I think it's worth to mention that the bass tones have a punch that are perfect to listen music with heavy bass usage. The only reason I'm giving this headphones 3 stars is because for me they are very uncomfortable, I cant wear them more than 1 hour without having a slight pain in the upper part of my ears, my brother tested them and he also found them a bit uncomfortable.

VI looked around for over the ear headphones for a long time. I was looking for Bose mainly because of their outstanding quality for so many years. As people probably know, Bose also gets a pretty high price for their products, and for good reason. When I saw these in the store the other day, I decided to go online and read some reviews. Everybody seemed to like them, and they were cheaper ($47.99 at my time of purchase) so I decided to give it a shot. And I have to say, these are some amazing sounding headphones. They have a bit a bass, but not overwhelming. Voices ring out clearly and the music quality sounds fantastic. I did notice that some of the high notes from cymbals don't register out as clear as everything else, but I'm ok with that. If you're looking for a cheaper set of headphones that are great quality, give these a shot. They've convinced me enough to give Skullcandy products more of a chance. I never considered them before because I assumed that if the price was cheap, the quality was cheap. And I was proven wrong with these.

VI just had received the product today, and to be completely honest I was extremely excited about it. Note that you do get what you pay for. The price of this product ranged about 26 to 35 dollars in total including shipping costs. Now back to the point, as soon as I removed the product from the packaging I could tell the product was not all that cleaned. Whoever mailed it off could have at least sanitized it. Next I noticed that the product didn't have a cord with it, but I'm not sure if I remember there being any warning of no cord. Then, I proceeded on by testing the product out once i had found a spare cord. I was extremely disappointed once I found out that only one over the ear piece of the entire headset worked. This is because the same thing happened to the previous earphones I had before, and I was hoping the ones I received in the mail would be a great substitute, but I was wrong....they weren't...needless to say- I want my money back!

The sound quality is great sounds the same as the day i got it. i bought these used from a friend they had had them for a year when i bought them from him. skull candy is the only head phones i buy.Updatei bought these from my friend over a year ago now and he used the other day and told me that they still sound just as good as the day he bought them. so that would make these head phones nearly two and a half years old and  still sound great.update 2i have had these head phones for about two to two and a half years ago used from a friend. like i said ealier he had had them for a year. they still sound amazing and i use these nearly every day. so these head phones are just about 4 to 5 years old and still sound new.

VMy previous over-the-ear headphones had bit the dust -- they were coming off when I sneezed and were being held together by tape so it was clearly time to upgrade.  I saw these, liked the design and hoped they would work for my needs -- transcription work mainly, not so much music.  When I first plugged them in I couldn't hear any voices, just music.  Ack!  Gave the customer service line a call and the woman was super friendly and helpful and was able to help me resolve my issue in a few minutes.  Simple issue of not having plugged the jack/connector into the headset all the way.  It was a silly little thing but I love that she didn't make me feel like a complete tool!  As for the product itself, the center connector bar is a bit heavy on the top of my head and the padding around the ear really creates a seal but the sound is great for what I am doing and I love that they aren't just plain black or silver.  Thanks to some amazing customer service I am definitely a fan of Skullcandy and should the need arise I will definitely look for their products in the future.

VThese headphones work great, but sometimes the detachable cable looses contact and you have to turn it in the socket to get it too work.  The first set I bought from the Amazon warehouse was missing the cable.  I returned for a complete set with no issues.Good sound, NOT a $100 headphone but worth the extra cost over cheap headsets.

VI was looking for a pair of headphones that not only sounded great but looked great. If that's what you're hoping for then you've found them!The quality is fantastic on these with bass that's not too heavy and clear vocals. I even used these on my PlayStation 4 and it sounds almost as varied and clear as my sound bar. The cord is detachable (always a plus) that comes with a built in mic and controls that work fairly well, however the mic does sound a bit hollow but nothing I didn't expect from a tiny cord mic.The build is very solid and looks fantastic. The cooshy faux leather on the ears and headband is a lighter shade of brown than what is shown on the pictures, but it still looks and feels great on the ears and head. They're easily adjustable and don't look gigantic on your head like the Crushers do.Just a note, these are over the ear headphones. At first glance I believed these to be on ear (which I prefer) but after trying them out I'm satisfied as they aren't super bulky looking and don't make you stick out like a sore thumb like Beats.Overall they're completely worth the price and I'm very satisfied with the Hesh 2!

VI chose these headphones bcuz first off, Skullcandy has never let me down. Then bcuz of the unique and awesome design. Last but not least,  I knew that the quality of these headphones were gonna be great. And I was right. The plus for me is that it has a mic so that I can talk on the phone whenever I want. I would've paid more simply for the style and quality of sound. There's nothing I don't like about them. And yes, I would recommend them to my friends/family.

VI received a heavily damaged product. From the material of I saw, I am glad I got a full refund. It was cheap plastic and while one ear cup did work, the quality was not at all what you would expect for a price like this. Get something else, preferably not a over-hyped company like Skullcandy or Beats by Dre. The only thing I like about their headphones are the design. Nothing else.

VSTOPS WORKING!!!!
p5022

VI've never written a review before, but this is just driving me crazy! This is my second pair of Skullcandy Headphones.  I work in an office where there's a lot of chatter and these headphones did a great job cutting out the noise and were super comfortable on my head.  My first set of headphones, the right ear speaker stopped working. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought this pair (I had a different model, but I thought I would spend the money and get a more expensive set) and after 4 months THE RIGHT EAR SPEAKER STOPPED WORKING AGAIN.  I WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER SKULLCANDY PRODUCT.  It's ridiculous to spend this kind of money and have them last for what, 4 months?!?!  Don't bother with this purchase - might as well save up and get a nice pair of Bose speakers.  I know I wish I had.

VFor the price Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 sound pretty good. The bass is present but it is not overwhelming like most Skullcandy products, and for the price the mids and highs are okay too. However, these are by far the most uncomfortable headphones I have had the misfortune of wearing! If you plan on listening to music for a period longer than 45 minutes please look elsewhere. As a point of comparison I've owned or listened to  V-Moda Crossfades LP 2s, Bose ae2, Bose Quiet Comfort, Sol Republic tracks HD, and Sony MDR10, and various Beats by Dr. headphones and in terms of comfort these pale in comparison. Again for the price the sound is pretty decent, there are better options but the fit and comfort for me becomes unbearable after about 45 minutes.

They are way more durable tho, and I like the fact that they cover your ears. The removable aux cableis nice too. And tthese work pretty good if you need a mic for teamspeak. Just get a splitter for your computer that goes to mic and headphones. Def not worth more than 50 bucks. They just need moar bass. If they added an inline amp like they skullcrushers that would be tits.

VSkullcandy Hesh 2.0 Black/Black
p5222
sg5
VThis is my second set of the Hesh 2.0 after the white ones I bought finally burned out (almost two years of daily duty). I see complaints of a lot failure by Skullcandy products, but I personally have never had an issue with them. I take care of my headsets and they last me forever.Enough about the company - these headphones are great. I will  be honest and say that there are better headsets out there, but for 45 bucks shipped, these are comfortable and sound excellent. The cable disconnects so it can be replaced with a cable with a mic (I personally use a Beats mixer cable). These are solid headphones that work well when traveling (passive noise isolation is adequate for most trips). Overall, these are an excellent purchase and I would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money for a great set of cans. Oh, and they have a lifetime warranty, where at the bare minimum, you get 50% back, whether they burned out or you ran them over with a polar bear.

VI use these at work. With that said, it is very important to me to be able to block out and focus on my work. These Hesh2's are incredible. I did a fair amount of research before buying. I really didnt care what they looked like bc i'm sitting at my computer working, but honestly, I think they're prety fun looking. The sound quality is far better than I had anticipated. Crystal clear, bright high ends, nice full fill in the mids and a big, deep bass feel at the bottom end. I barely use the volume at all. Most of the time it's set at about 15 - 20 % of volume. But it's incredible when I crank it to. Love these silly looking things. Well worth it.

p5246
sg5
VI've had these headphones for over a year and a half I believe, but they seem to be holding up strong. My school tends to get pretty loud during study sessions and they really help to cancel out noise. Can't really hear anything when I have them on. They're good for listening. I can hear certain sounds in songs that I hadn't noticed before with ear headphones. The bass isn't great, but it's not the worst. Kind of average I guess. The skull design is pretty sweet on the outside. Skullcandy is pretty famous when it comes to cords breaking, or bending, which causes the sound in one ear to go away completely. I haven't had this happen yet and I hope I don't in the future. The mic is clear from what I've heard and so far so good.

p5252
sg5
VI bought these headphones as I like headphones that completely cover your ears and I like a long cord. These headphones have a detachable cord so I thought that was great as I could change lengths.The sound quality is fine, nothing special but decent enough for me.The problem I had was that the cord that accompanied the headphones started to cut out maybe the third or fourth time I used them. I purchased a higher quality replacement cord but the plug doesn't fit into the jack as the plastic on the headphone surrounding the jack is  too bulbous for the jack housing to fit. I have had this problem with every 1/8" cable I have tried except the low quality one that came with the headphones.The other problem I have is the ear surrounds are too small and tight. If I wear the headphones for all of 15 minutes, my earlobes hurt. I can't even imagine how uncomfortable this would be for some one with their ears pierced or plugged.Overall I was not happy, I really use them due to the discomfort. I definitely would not purchase again. The $30 Sony headphones I had a few years ago were at least twice as good.

VThe sound from these headphones are pretty good for the average listener.  The styling and comfort are very nice and for the price you're getting a good value.  That said, there's definitely a few issues, and I definitely wouldn't pay full price for these.Songs with deep bass produce a slight rattle/buzz, probably due to the build quality of the way the drivers are installed.  It's kinda like a white noise.  You can hear it consistently when doing a soundcheck on the audiocheck website.  My cheap Koss UR-40s outperform these headphones across all the tests and they were only $23.  The other issue with these, is they are very power hungry.  You'll know what I mean right away if you compare the sound out of your computer versus your iphone.  When I commute to work on the subway, I have to have the volume all the way up to drown out the subway noise.  In a quiet space they're fine though.Overall I would still recommend these, since you get the removable cord and good styling and comfort.  I replaced the cord with a Beats controltalk cord so I can accept calls on it too.  If you can get them on sale, and you really like the styling I would say go for it, otherwise, there's better options.

p5317
sg5
VMy 12 year old daughter received the Grey/gridlock headphones as a gift for christmas. She uses them with her IPOD and her tablet. She does not complain about anything with them. You ask...would she even know what to complain about? Somewhat...She is a musician, whom plays piano and percussion. She listens to music on a daily basis. (some techno, dance/pop, dubstep, and opera). She was critical of how music had sounded with her earbuds.I do not allow her to take them to school or to a friend's house, so they have been kept in great condition. She really likes them, and recieves compliments on their look when we go places. Several of her friends have Dre Beats, but have not "made fun" of her for not. (well, at least that I am aware of)As a parent, I am happy because she is happy ;)

VThat's right folks!  You can make your own Skullcandy headphones from your very own home!  All you need to start jamming are:  2 empty aluminum soup cans, a roll of duct tape, a couple of cotton balls and your fingers.  Simply put 3-4 cotton balls in each soup can and tape them to your ears.  That should simulate the legendary comfort that skullcandy is known to provide.  Once you feel like they're not going anywhere, commence flicking the aluminum cans!  You'll be amazed at how similar the sound is between the two!

VI was hoping for a little better feel with these headphones. These hurt my ears after about twenty minutes of wearing them. I can readjust and them and keep wearing them, but not without a bit of pain in my right ear. They just too small. I guess I need to bite the bullet and fork out some more cash to get into some really nice head phones. I was hoping these would do it, but they don't.The sound is good, nice bass levels, nice high. It just doesn't fit my ears.If you're a kid (8-16) with a normal sized kid head for that age, then these will probably be a very nice for you. If you're a young adult or older, then you might want to try these on and sit in them for a while (15-20 min) at a store.

VI bought these for my 15 year old son. They look great, sound great, and are comfortable. The only thing he has mentioned that is negative is that the cord comes out a little too easily, but likes that it does come out and you can use it for an AUX cable.

VVolume:These Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 Headphones sound good until you want to turn up the volume. You can forget pushing to much power, At the higher levels, they just distort. I'm not saying that you will be listening to your music at 100% volume all the time. However, there are those songs and solo's that you just can enjoy to the fullest due to the lack of volume.Comfort:The ear cups are not bad at all, unless you wear glasses. They're actually pretty comfortable. But the rubber head band that rests on the top of your head can feel like it's leaving an indent after just an hour of listening. Hesh 2's + Gravity don't play nice.

p5475

VMy main focus in buying headphones was comfort.  Secondary was the sound reproduction.  I'm not an anal audiophile type.  I appreciate good sound, I'm just not obsessed with it.  I was initially targeting noise cancelling headphones, but I just didn't want to spend that kind of money.  I ended up purchasing these and have had them for about 6 months now.  They fit pretty comfortably around my ears and my ears are probably larger than the average persons.  In my opinion they're a little on the tight side.  I use them mostly at work and I have to adjust my reading glasses slightly up off my ear otherwise they would start hurting after about 2 hours or so of continuous listening.  Without glasses I haven't noticed any issues with comfort.  The sound is good enough for my tastes.  They don't seem to be big on bass, but neither am I.  I would say they're pretty well balanced.  I've used them on a few airplane flights and I still get a lot of engine noise coming through.  Although, they are better than the earbuds I used to use.

So, I am really happy with the purchase.

VGood headphones - bad cord
p5563
sg5
VI got these headphones back in September for my birthday, so about 4 months ago. For the first four months, they worked great--good sound quality, good price, and they looked pretty good. I wore them everywhere, but I never dropped them or threw them or otherwise damaged them. I'm not perfect, but I tried my best to take care of them.But about a week ago, the sound in the right headphone stopped working completely. The button on the cord, the one that lets you pause/play a song or skip to the next, doesn't work at all anymore. The only way I can get the right headphone to play music on the cord is to hold it a certain way, so walking around town with these on is pretty impossible.I can't find a replacement cord for sale anyway, either, and if I want to buy them in the same color I have to use Amazon instead of the official site. I'm really disappointed; I've loved these headphones, but unless I want to listen with one headphone that doesn't make any sound/crackles all the time, I'm going to have to shell out 70 bucks for a new pair.Overall, I'm very pleased with them, but the cord is really unfortunate. I may buy a new one if I can afford it, but I wish they had lasted at least a year, or even just six months, before I had to get a new pair.

VI am very picky about buying headphones. I always prefer over the head, because with too much use, earbuds never last me long enough. However, over the head headphones generally last me only six months or so before I've ruined them--particularly the chord. I want my headphones to have controls, particularly pausing and playing, and I want them to be very comfortable.I've encountered many headphones that have these aspects, but none are as wonderful as these. As soon as I put them over my ears, I could hardly believe how comfortable and light they were in comparison to others I've purchased. And when I took them off and had them around my neck, it was without a doubt THE most comfortable headphones I ever had. Generally, they gave me neck pain, but not these.The sound is lovely, and the colors are lovely, but the comfort is absolutely stellar. And, to top it all off, it was incredibly easy to take them out of the box--when was the last time it was easy to take out headphones from their box?

VDefinitely Worth Considering
p5586
sg5
VThese headphones come shipped in original packing, which adds some authenticity to the product. I don't know about you, but I really like the fact that I get to open the box as if I just bought them; it feels like they haven't been used. The headphones come with an auxiliary cable that can be hooked to your headphones and desired music system/apparatus. Its pretty convenient because that cable can be used for other purposes as well, like plugging your ipod into a car.Anyway, if you have sensitive ears, or hate how much pressure other headphones put on your ears, then these would really work for you. The mesh is large enough to surround the ear, rather than sitting on the ear itself. The mesh is very comfortable and encloses the ear enough as to quiet the noise surrounding you. As always, Skullcandy never fails to bulk up the bass in their headphones. In addition, the clarity of the bass and treble is exquisite, especially for the price; there are no rough, scruffy sounds.I think if you want a quality pair of headphones for a comparatively low price, these Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 headphones are definitely a good way to go, especially for a first pair!

VI recently purchased and received my gray/lime headphones and I thoroughly enjoy them. The first song I played was the theme song from Skyrim, Dovahkiin I think that is what it's called. Anyway, I chose that song because I felt it had a great range of low and high pitches as well as tempo. Besides the fact that it's one of my favorite songs, these headphones did not disappoint.I may add that I used to have Skullcandy Aviators and those were spectacular. Sadly, they were lost. I tried not to compare the Aviators to the Hesh series but I couldn't help myself. The Hesh isn't as pleasing to the ears as compared to the Aviators but for the price, I'm happy with the Hesh.What I think is a fantastic feature is the removable cable. I'm sure everyone has had the pleasure of twisting and turning old headphone cables that have a loose connection. That usually ends up with purchasing a new pair even if the speakers are just fine. With these removable cables, if the wire goes bad, just get a new one! Such a simple and great feature!Oh and I should mention how it fits comfy on my ears for a decent period of time. Studying, flights, or just hanging around will be comfortable with these.

VThese headphones exceeded my expectations! They're stylish and most importantly, they function perfectly. The fact I can detach the headphones from the actual cord is amazing. If the cord breaks, I don't have to buy new headphones. The cord has a mic and can act as a AUX cable. The headphones so amazing and clear. I chose the Green Lurker Toxic version of these headphones because they looked so unique. On top of the headband, the material is felt so I can get dirty quick so I use the travel bag often when I'm done using them. This the first time I've used a Skullcandy product and I'm 100% extremly satisfied.

VAs you know Skull Candies headphones blow out in about half a year or less very easily... Mostly because they use cheap wire that's not worth anything. So I would make sure you have an extra AUX Cord with you when you buy them if you don't get a warranty. The sound of these headphones are amazingly great though. For 60 - 70 Dollars!!! I think they are amazing for my own liking. Bass is great and the headphones can handle heavy and high pitched sounds. These are not your high end "woop de doo" Headphones. But they well get you every were you need to go :) I would recommend these any day though. I got my friend too buy one and he's happy with them too. My cord broke so I had to buy a new AUX cable tho and they work as new as ever now :) Good luck with your headphones if you are getting them!

VSkullcandy headphones, for classical music? Absolutely!
p5714
sg5
VMuch has already been said about the Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 and their ability to powerfully reproduce rock and electronic music, and they do indeed excel in these genres. Some have said they aren't suitable for playing back acoustic music, particularly classical. Classical music fans, with their "bass neutral" and "open back" and "500-dollar" cans, tend to scoff at Skullcandy listeners, telling them to "pull up your pants, get a haircut, put down the damn smartphone and read a Hardy Boys book, and while you're at it, get off my lawn!"This lifelong classical music fan and lover of good sound wholeheartedly disagrees.Skullcandy has a deserved reputation for being a bass-heavy brand, but in my opinion this does not come at the expense of clear mids and highs. Playing selections from J.S. Bach's "Magnificat" (EMI, DVD-audio 48KHz/24bit) reveals this to be so. This music is about as far from hip-hop and dubstep as you're likely to find, and it sounds both realistic and exciting through the Hesh 2.0 headphones. Harpsi-chord, strings, male and female singers are all clear and accurate. The pipe organ reaches deep, deep down and is appropriately powerful in a way that hoiti-toiti bass-shy headphones just aren't going to match. The Hesh 2 is a closed-back design, and so on-paper shouldn't be able to convey the sense of acoustic space in this cathedral recording. I'm here to tell you, the sense of space is very present through the Hesh 2.0, and the sound stage extends fully left-to-right and everywhere in-between. All that is needed is a hard wooden chair and the scent of incense to complete the illusion of being there, in the church with the performers.Other acoustic genres, such as jazz, also benefit from the Hesh 2's powerful yet clear sound. The opening bars of Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue" (WMA Lossless rip from a CD) can sound muddy and muffled on lesser-quality headphones. On the Hesh 2, each pluck of the upright bass is well-defined and punchy, and the clear midrange reveals every nuance of the trumpet, saxes, drums and piano with lifelike clarity.I highly recommend the Hesh 2.0 if you watch a lot of TV and movies on portable devices or anywhere else. Through these headphones, the pilot episode of the sci-fi series Farscape sounds as if there was a subwoofer in the room, and the fighter ships zipping by seem to fly around my head, almost as vividly from front-to-back as left-to-right. They may not be capable of true multichannel surround, but the Hesh 2s do a great job of imitating it.For anyone looking to upgrade from the Hesh 1.0 to these, you will lose the fluffy headband, but you will gain larger, fluffier earpads. The Hesh 1 squeezed my head a bit too tight, especially when wearing glasses. The Hesh 2s are so comfortable I have fallen asleep several times while listening to them, and they don't squeeze my glasses. You will lose the Hesh 1s groovy fabric-covered cable, but will gain a detachable, and therefore replaceable and upgradable cable. The Hesh 2s also have more controlled bass and greater midrange clarity, which is a good thing but will make streams and files below 96Kbps sound a little crunchy at high volume. The Hesh 2 is also of better build quality, with the stress point in the rubber headband instead of the plastic at the sides like the Hesh 1. My Hesh 1s, while still a great-sounding headphone, are now cracked at the sides and difficult to wear. This does not seem like it will be a problem with the Hesh 2.And yes, the Hesh 2 kicks ass with techno, hip-hop, and hard rock music. This is no reason to write them off as a choice if your tastes run more toward Mozart and Schubert than Metallica and Skrillex.If you have a spare $300 to spend on some new cans, I'd advise getting the Hesh 2.0, perhaps a portable headphone amplifier just because you can, and spend the remaining $150 on music and movies.

VI waited for this?!
p5720
sg5
VI must have gotten a bad product, because these headphones are a joke. There was so much hype going into these that I literally took them off my head to make sure they were still Skullcandys. I ensured that the cable was in correct, all the way in, and I even reserved judgement allowing time for "burn-in" assuming that might be an issue. Still, after several, several hours of listening, the sound has not improved. And, I'll tell you another thing, these are so far from comfortable that I couldn't stand more than 5 min before I had to readjust due to discomfort. At 6'3", 220lbs, I'm not entirely your average size but I don't think my head is that much different than everyone else. I've just come to realize that the Black/Brown/Copper Hesh 2 headphones have a terrible padding design. I will be returning these headphones, or if possible, I may just exchange for a different pair to see if that helps. So far, I am completely unimpressed with these headphones.

VI own a pair and my entire family does as well. For the price you cannot go wrong. Skullcandy Hesh 2.0 headphones are comfortable and the sound is crisp. In my opinion if you can pick up a set of headphones for $40 - $50 which sound like $200.00 headphones its a no brainer. Pick em up they are very nice.

VBought these for my teenage son and godson, and both loved them. I only didn't give it a 5 stars because I am not thrilled with the design, as I was expecting them to have a more grown up look, but they don't seem to mind much. The sound is excellent, and I was glad to hear them all the way up without fearing my son will become deaf, it goes high enough to enjoy the music. Beware, however, that the noise canceling will make them deaf to you.

VI replaced a pair of Sony headphones that boasted blocking out background noise, but to do that you had to flip a switch on the side and also required a AAA battery. They also folded for 'convenience' but were virtually impossible to put on one-handed or got tangled in itself. AND the hinge at the top would dig right into my scalp and leave marks.So for me, I was looking for a pair that were 'over-the-ear' for sound blocking, so it is pressing on your head, not your ear. Also needed to have cushion at the top and did NOT fold. These fit the bill, had high reviews for sound so of course that was a bonus, and in my opinion great sounding bass. The detachable cord did not have any bearing on my purchase but after using them, I actually appreciate the fact it is detachable. Other reviewers made good points like being able to replace the cable it was ever damaged. So much easier than a new set of headphones.I use these everyday and sometimes for several hours at a time and never have an issue with discomfort or background noise. No need to have the sound up very high either because of how well it blocks out that sound.

After listening to Beats and then to these I think these sound better, they have more bass and are very clear, fit comfortably. Good price. Nice sturdy product. removable cord keeps you from getting a short in them. I was impressed, I would recommend these to anyone.

Good sound quality with decent bass. Im happy with my purchase of them

p5875

VSo, I got these for Christmas, And I was really excited cuz I had been looking at beats for a long time. I found these and I really liked them. And I liked the good price of 60 dollars. One day I had them on and they were on the floor of the car, and I didn't know what happened to them when I tried them out. The same day a few hours before they were working but when I tried them on they had a very echo-y sound to the songs. The singer was very quiet and I was very upset because they were working perfectly awhile ago. I think it was my fault they didn't work but they weren't working. I recommend these headphones but if you want to upgrade I would say to go to the crusher. Take good care of them also. Thank you for reading!
