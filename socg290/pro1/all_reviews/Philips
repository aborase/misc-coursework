VI owned a pair of these for about 4 yrs and used them on a daily basis; really put them through the ringer and finally they started to break.  I am now buying my second pair.  They fit well, and because I had the black colored ones they were invisible with my brown hair - which is helpful when trying to ignore people who are talking to you and you don't really care about what they are saying. The sound quality was good. Even when I was working out and sweating they felt like they were not even there.

VI bought these because I like the over the ear hook design and the price is very reasonable.  They sound good but can get a little uncomfortable.  The speaker part that you put in your ear doesn't have any padding and the  hard plastic gets a little irritating.  They do stay put if you take a moment to put them on as indicated on the packaging; speaker in ear first and then wrap the hook around.  If you try to put it on any other way it falls off if you move around.

p20
sg5
VJust bought these yesterday at Walmart for $10 as my current headphones were cutting out at the right ear. The previous ones were big, the bass was better, but it was so quiet. These on the other hand, deliver really loud sounds - which is what I been looking for.I'm not a great reviewer but here's what you can expect.Comfort - these things do hurt after a little while, which is expected. They do not fall out even if you are shaking your head violently (of course, who would do such a thing...) and they stay snug no matter what. Only downfall is the fact you have take them off to relieve pain.Sound - I've never seen such earphones get so loud. My laptop needs only 1 volume bar and even then, its loud yet perfect to listen to music with. I'm a fan of loud music, so bare with. On my PC, however, they soften up and it requires me to put them a little higher up in volume. One thing: do not expect much bass. The bass is lower than my previous headphone, but it was designed for bass boost anyways. This is a perfect, temporary replacement until I get my gamecom 367 headset (I have desktop mic which I use for online gaming and headphones to listen).Misc - I'm a pretty tall person, or average height (6'3''), the cord seems a little too short but maybe just enough for me to work out with. However, I feel as if I may yank the cord if I start jogging again. This is just speculation based on what I noticed from yesterday and today.All in all - good for the price.Do not expect superior bass quality.Do expect loud but great sound quality.Cord may be too short for some people.

VI have also tried several different headphones, and none of them would stay in my ears while running.  They also didn't have the best sound (probably because they were falling out all the time).  These headphones stay in while I run (even when the cord gets accidentally yanked), they are super comfortable, and the sound is really excellent for such a cheap pair of headphones.  I'm hearing things that I didn't hear with my other headphones.  The earpiece is really soft and flexible, so it isn't uncomfortable.  The earbuds are shaped to stay in and don't have the foam on them.  Everyone's ears are different, but these work best for my husband as well, so I'm getting him some.

VThese headphones fit me pretty well but they do still wiggle out of my ears during workouts.  The good thing about this over-ear design is that the weight of the lower end of the clip will tend to hold them in place even if they do loosen up a bit.  Generally what happens is they get a little loose but they never, ever, fall completely off.So my quest for the perfect headphones continues but these work pretty well in the meantime.

VI like to take my iPod shuffle running and bike riding, and am on a never ending quest to find the perfect headphones that will stay put no matter what I'm doing.  Up until this point the winner has been Philips' ear hook headphones that were predecessors to these.  They were pretty durable, stayed put well, and the sound was decent.  I tried numerous other styles like the Sony MDR-EX81 (yuck), MDR-J10 (uber-yuck), and a number of others.  These surpass all others, and they are CHEAP (as in, inexpensive)!!  They have a nice springiness to them that holds the aural piece nicely inside your ear without leading to any pressure points or discomfort, they block more outside noise than many other designs (see gripe below) so more of the music comes through unmolested, the cord is a good length for on-body music device use (maybe a little long), and did I mention they are super cheap?My only gripe so far is that they really do need those thin foam coverings that most ear bud headphones use nowadays.  My iPods come with ear bud headphones (which I also like, but not for sports) and they ship with a few extra packs of the foam pieces.  I put some of those over these headphones and voila, the best headphones to date.  Without the foam, the fit is a little less comfortable and they don't nest in your ear canal quite as effectively and let more ambient noise through.  Also, since the rubber over-the-ear piece is basically nonadjustable, folks with size-challenged or -enhanced ears may not end up with the ear piece falling in the right spot.  This may be a bell curve sized product.Everyone's ears are different, but if iPod headphones fit you pretty well in general but want something that will hook over your ears to stay put (and you don't have elephant ears), give these a shot.  It's only a $10 experiment.  I need to subtract one star for the lack of the foam coverings...

VUncomfortable with a sticky-out plug
p87
sg5
VSo there are 500+ reviews here and it's likely no one will read this, but I actually have strong, and I think useful opinions to share. I can't say a lot about sound quality. A lot of people seem to want to speak authoritatively on that topic. Frankly, all the earphones pretty much sound the same to me. But among earphones (as opposed to headphones--i.e. with little things that stick into the ear canal), with over the top ear supports, which is the kind I like to buy, I recommend these Sony MDR-J10 instead. First, I think they (the Sonys) are substantially more comfortable than the Philips because the part that sticks into the ear is rounded. This is a really big difference that may seem trivial, but if you try both of them, I think you'll really notice. I find it's a really big difference in comfort.Second, I like the bendy-over plugs (i.e. the ones that make a 90 degree turn and sit flush against the device) better than the sticky-out plugs. If you use an ipod with a case, you might need the sticky-out type; but otherwise I find that the sticky out plugs tend to get knocked around since they have a rigid piece of metal sticking out over a centimeter from the headphone port, and that can damage the device you're using them with. This really sucks--your $300 cellphone or mp3 player or whatever getting broken by a $5 pair of earphones.The one problem I've had with the Sonys is that they tend to wear out over time from my sweating on them when I run more so than I think the Phillips do. It's not a huge difference. I'm a heavy sweater, and both brands will wear out for me after 6 months or so--which means I usually lose them before I break them--but I think I've noticed the problem more with the Sonys.

VIf you're looking for a great value on a good-sounding set of earbuds, go for it. Or if you walk for exercise, these will be good for you. However as a runner I found this model to be frustrating as they do not stay in place. Also, if you do any strength training where you're lying prone or on your stomach, they will fall out. Trying to find the right earbuds to wear when running has been a years-long effort for me and this model has not satisfied my need. But you will get a very good sound for a great price if that's all you care about.

VGreat Earphones despite the price!
p99
sg5
V$10 for this pair of earphones is an absolute steal.  Initially, I was only looking at alternatives from the usual suspects, Sony and Seinheisser.Style:  simple, inobtrusive - definitely not as flashy as the sonys and seinheisers.Sound:  with the caveat that i'm no audiophile - these sound great and are very loud (i.e. i don't have to crank up my mp3 player like i had to do with other earphones).  Those who appreciate more bass may find these earphones lacking.  i'm more of a pop/hardrock guy and the earphones handle these songs well.Fit - it might take a little while to get a hang of putting on those earclips but once that's settled, it's well fitting and comfortable.  I also wear glasses and they will work well together (you'll have to put on your glasses _after_ putting on the earphones).  The cord is of average length - I do like the fact that the V-shaped wire design of the wire extending to the earphones are short and compact (no dangling wires).For your reference,  I was looking for a pair of earphones that were not earbuds. I purchased a pair of Sony MDR-Q22LP for my sister and tried them out (great sounding earphones, more bass, stylish and comfortable). I decided against them b/c they were kinda bulky and the over-ear design, while comfortable, leaked sound (not into making myself a public niusance).  Sennheiser does have the Sennheiser OMX50 which looks to have good reviews - would have purchased this if not for finding the philips for $20 less.

VBest running headphones
p104
sg5
VAs an avid runner, I constantly went through several headphones a month before finding these.  I would spend $30 on a pair of headphones that claimed it was made for running, but I would spend half my running time just fixing the headphones because the sound would go in and out of an earphone, or I would have to keep putting them back in my ear because they'd fall out.  In the end, I found these, and I have never looked back.They stay in my ears the entire time and are relatively comfortable in light of there being no padding, but that doesn't bother me.  The sound on these are great too.  I'm usually in the gym with a couple of other people running on machines so it tends to get pretty loud in there, but I can't hear a thing with these in.  I had my last pair for about 3 years, and the sound in one of the ears recently gave way.  I quickly went out to get a new pair after trying a few other brands that I had lying around the house (all with no positive responses).This is by far the best pair of headphones a runner could ask for.  The cord has plenty of slack so you're not pulling on anything as you move.  Because the design doesn't have the hard backing to loop around your head, I'm able to keep them loosely in my bag, and still not have anything bulky in there taking up too much room.

VI bought these at Target because I was having problems finding earbuds that will stay in my ears, so figured ones with clips would help.  These were even worse.  I have small ears, so the "hooks" were too large to fit around my ear.  They kept sliding down, and falling off my ears after just a couple minutes.  Plus the "flexible" hook made them difficult to get on in the first place.  I found them extrememly uncomfortable (during the short time they stayed on), and there is no way I want to stop and put the earbuds back on every couple minutes. Waste of money.

The ear hooks are but the bud part that goes in your ear is hard. After a few hours of wearing them at work my ears started to hurt and became sore. No matter what position I tried to get the bud in, nothing helped. I ended up using the foam covers from the apple ear-buds that I was replacing to soften up the buds. That has seemed to help so far. The price and sound quality are great though. So you decide.

VPhilips Earhook Headphones--Great Sound Quality
p137
sg5
VI recently bought a pair of Philips earhook headphones for use on my PC for transcription. They are actually designed for MP3/IPod/IPhone, but I thought I would give them a try.  The wrap-around ear hooks are comfortable, and give better stability.  I am not constantly catching the cord on objects, or when I am reaching for something, etc., and yanking the headphones off of my head.  The cord that comes with the headphones is long enough to extend from the PC to my chair, but not so long as they dangle down and become a nuisance.  Also, and most importantly, the air vents on the ear bud piece produce an amazing sound quality and clarity.  There is little to no "muffling" or that "talking-inside-a-drum" sound.  This is crucial in my profession, when trying to understand what multiple speakers are actually saying.  The guesswork is minimal, and I feel confident in the transcribed documents I am submitting.  Worth every penny, Philips!

For a pair of cheap, comfortable and good-quality headphones, I recommend the Sony MDR-J10 which Amazon has in various colors. That earphone is great for the gym, made with flexible rubber wire coating (not plastic and easily torn), is durable, is long enough for most use and sounds good.I don't write many reviews but putting this Philips earphones on again drove to me to write a poor review for it.

So, they deflect sounds coming in (such as the local high-rise construction torrents), while providing me with great range, even for full-powah psytrance (blisargon demogorgon).  They are comfortable, stay in place when i'm running, and have a price tag that can't be beat.

VI've gone through several pairs of earphones/earbuds in an attempt to find something that is comfortable for long-term listening.  The in-ear buds that came with my iPod start hurting if I listen longer than an hour at a stretch.  So I was excited to read so many positive reviews here declaring the Phillips earhooks to be the most comfortable set they had ever tried, and I was even more excited by the extremely attractive price.So I ordered them, tore open the package with eager hands, only to discover, somewhat to my dismay, that the hooks just don't stay on my ears well at all.  I don't *think* I have some grossly deformed skull,but I could be wrong about that as the Phillips earhooks won't stay on unless I'm holding them against my head, which of course defeats the purpose of having a mobile sound system. I have to say that description of these earphones as "flexible" is quite misleading; the earhooks are made of fairly rigid plastic and can't be molded to shape one's individual ear/skull shape... a design feature I sure wish the company's engineers would change.This is particularly disapointing because the sound quality is indeed quite nice, especially given the price.  So I would not want to deter others from buying these. Just don't assume they will work for you.As for me, I ended up surrendering my hopes of finding an inexpensive set of earphones for my iPod and purchased a pair of in-ear phones from Bose instead. Terrific sound quality and great comfort.  Wish I had bought them first.

VThese are wonderful for the price. Are they the best, that's not for me to decide since the best is an opinion. I have purchased these in the past for $10-15 from walmart and bestbuy. I sweat a lot and primarily used them for the gym and cycling. The first pair I bought lasted about 6,000 miles cycling and roughly 180 trips to the gym in 2 years. I would call that a durable product.These fit on your ear, not in them so the sound isn't overwhelming unless you force it. I still had no problem blocking out the gym noise or the wind whistling through my cycling helmet. My favorite part about these are the ear hooks. They are flexible and do a great job staying put. I have had other designs in the past that had to be adjusted every few seconds and these don't. The best thing I can say about them is they are reliable. This being my third pair in about 8 years, they never fell off and took an absolute beating from sweat and the elements. I'm sure they were never tested or meant to be worn in the conditions I put them through. I'm no audiophile and I'm not going to talk about sound quality, I just know my music sounded good to me and for the price anyone complaining is just bored.

VI was looking for a replacement for my Sony over the ear headphones as the cable wears over a short period of time.I picked up a pair of these earbuds and these philips over the ear head phones in white. They cost $10, so I said what the hey.One of my worse headphone purchases ever. I respect Philips industrial design group, but I think they focused more on the visual design than the sound quality of the headphones.The fit of the hook is pretty good, but the design really falls apart at the earbud. They are too huge to place within the outside ear canal. I've experienced that most earbuds and the sony over the ear headphones cover the ear opening to reproduce a very bassy sound, which I think is a bit too much. Since these headphones do not come with rubber ear pieces, there the ear canal is not covered and no bass is produced.I used these headphones on my ipod nano. The sound of the headphones when pressed up against the ear is very tinny, hollow - as if you were hearing the sound in a tunnel. If you care about sound quality, you won't find it here. If you like over the ear buds for working out (like I do), since the bud does not cover the ear, you will hear a any distraction.The Sony headphones I'm seeking to replace are the Sony MDR-EX81LP, which are miles better than this set. But still not perfect. Also note, that a downside to earbuds with rubber inserts doesn't allow the ear to breathe, so you must remove them occasionally.UPDATE: I've been using these at work and they ARE sufficient. But taking the train and the sound of downtown traffic made these unusable. Again, the fit doesn't block out external noise.

VI ordered these headphones to replace my old Sony clip-on headphones that I'd picked up for about 10$ at Wal-Mart.I made a bad choice.The headphones are ineffective for me because they are just outright uncomfortable. I haven't had this problem with other headphones of this type before, however, the seam where the plastic is put together is rough and irritates my ears.On another note, I purchased these headphones with the explicit intent of running with them. I would not consider them for casual use at all- their design flaws and poor audio quality rule them out. I own a pair of V-Moda Vibes which I enjoy extremely but cannot run with as they fall out of my ears. All I was looking for was a set of clip earphones that I wouldn't mind throwing around in my gym bag - unfortunately, these won't be good for anything.Trust me, spend your money on something else. Chances are good that you'll be much more satisfied with your purchase.

p225
sg5
VI go to the gym and like to listen to music while I work out. I used to have a pair of Sony headphones with swivel arms that went behind your ears to hold them on. They were pretty expensive and eventually they broke. I was looking for something to replace them with. I figured I'd buy a pair of these cheap ones to hold me over until I had time to get some good ones. But, these little headphones aren't bad at all! The solid one-piece rubbery plastic ear loops are a much better design than the Sony ones that broke. (Those had a bunch of swivels and moveable joints which eventually fell apart). The headphones are comfortable to wear and they don't fall off no matter how much I move around. The sound is pretty good. It's not comparable to a $200 set of headphones. But, for $7 it's decent. I figure if they get destroyed or break it's no big deal. Highly recommended.

p231
sg5
VThe enthusiastic reviews of others raised my hopes too high.  Yes, they stay in my ears even while running.  And yes, they were darn cheap.  But do not expect better than adequate sonics.  The mid-range is over emphasized to the point of distraction.  That makes them great for listening to my talk radio podcasts, but only decent for music.  And no one has mentioned the terrible wind noise created by the open-air port design.  Even my snail-paced jogging creates a distracting whoosh that obscures the merely adequate fidelity -- it does make me feel like I'm running 60 MPH, though ;-)Sonically, these are comparable to the stock Apple ear buds.  They far exceed the Apple ear buds for comfort while exercising.  And given the price, I'm satisfied, but not delighted.

VI consider myself an "audiophile" and mostly listen to acoustic music on my iPhone 3G. I own both Bose Over-Ear headphones and the Sony equivalent of these headphones (MDR-J10). These headphones deliver superb, balanced, crystal clear sound that surpasses the Bose headphones and Sony, particularly in the treble range. Bass is more than adequate for such a small pair of earhook headphones. They're as comfortable as the Sony, very lightweight and stay secure in place (assuming you have normal-sized ears). They're no match for Shure Isolating in-ear earphones, but then again, at $10, what do you expect? Outstanding sound quality for the price. BUY THEM - you won't be disappointed!

I recently got a new iPhone 6 and the Apple ear buds that came with it looked pretty promising.  No luck.  They were impossible to keep in my ears.  I primarily use these Philips "headphones" at the gym (I am proud to say that I am 81) where i bicycle a lot and use a number of weight machines.  No problems whatsoever.  I wear glasses and they are completely comfortable and functional with my glasses.  I primarily use them for listening to books from Audible.com.  Absolutely perfect for that purpose.

VI got these earbuds with earhook so I could listen to my MP3 player while I was walking vigorously. Maybe my ears aren't shaped right, but plain old earbuds are always plopping out and it's annoying to have to keep poking them further into my ear canal, hoping they'll lodge there somehow and stay put.The only thing I would improve on these would be a bendible/flexible style on the earhook portion, so I could tighten to curvature more closely to my ear shape. They felt loose when I put them on, but the sound is very good for the price. They did not slip off, but the earbud slips sometimes. It's easier to adjust, though.

Low Bass is particularly hard for small earphones to reproduce well and these sound great.However depending on the exact size of your head/ears these may not work for you.

VThis would be a great product except for 2 things. I bought these to wear at the gym and as others have noticed they shock the inside of my ears!  I thought it was due to sweat but it happens at the very beginning of my workout too before sweating has commenced. I noticed it particularly on the treadmill but it also happens on the bike.  The second thing that I could have lived with if it weren't for the shocks is the size of the ear loops.  They are quite big but they worked ok for me so I would have been ok with it just a little annoyed.  Other than those 2 things the sound is great and everything else was good but there is just no using these headphones for me.  Anyone have suggestions for a similar style and price range that works well in the gym?

VOn the upside, these headphones are cheap, fit the ears well and stay put, and don't have any foam or fabric to get gross if you use them for working out.  The sound is OK, not setting the world on fire but acceptable for the price.The main problem is the cord.  It is constantly getting kinked and tangled.  I think it may have to do with the type of wire used.  I have probably 6 pairs of headphones and this is the only pair that does this so I am sure it is not a usage problem.Because of this cord issue, I would recommend against purchasing these headphones.

VPhilips Earhook  Headphones, Model SHS3200(/28?), Extra Bass.Philips keeps changing their model numbers and their listings on Amazon, but stores like CVS only have the older model numbers in stock, so it is sometimes impossible to match up an Amazon review with a model number that I actually have in my possession. Even the ones I buy from Amazon have conflicting numbers. I do not know how much actual difference there is between the old number earphones and the new number earphones, as the headphones seem to look the same. The SHS5200 on-ear and SHS4840 earhook headphones are examples. Amazon only lists the newer models, the SHS5200/28 and SHS4840/28, not the original SHS5200 or SHS4840. The top of the box for the SHS390 on-ear neckphones says "SHS390", while the box scanning label says "SHS390/27". To make matters even more confusing, the top of the box that the SHS3200 headphones came in, says "SHS3200", while the scanning label on the box says "SHS3200/28". The ear hook headphones themselves do not even have model numbers printed on them. What the hell is going on here? Is there anyone at Philips keeping track of the information being printed on the headphones and packaging? Philips needs to hire some better employees. How can I figure out which model numbers are correct? I definitely have to send an email to Philips to try to make some sense out of all of this. What a confusing mess they created.Anyway, this SHS3200(/28?) model is not bad. Without the neckband of the on-ear SHS5200 to deal with, there is less of a comfort issue. The SHS3200(/28?) headphones are a bit on the bright side, so long term higher volume listening may become painful, but the bass is present even when using a flat setting on your sound source. These earhook headphones are glorified earbuds, as they still go into your ears, just not as far, and they hook over the tops of your ears to keep them in place.  Pushing them further into your ear canals will improve the clarity of the sound, but at the cost of comfort (pain) in the ear canals, and also a splitting headache behind your ears. My overall impression? The sound rates four stars for being a little too bright on the top end, the quality of construction only rates four stars, brought down by the 1/16" thick cords going to the earphones (they are very flimsy and may not last long), the design rates three stars due to the sound quality and flimsy cords, and the comfort rates five stars, provided you don't insert them very far. Overall, we get a total of 16 stars out of a possible 20, or 80% (B-), and a rating of four stars. Are the SHS3200(/28?) headphones worth buying? Yes, and at the price of $15, they are good headphones at a very cheap price.

VI have been going to gym regularly for the past 5 years.  I take working out pretty seriously and I sweat a lot.  I tried many kinds, makes and brands of headphones and no headphones lasted more than 6 months due to sweat even when I spent $25 a piece.  The major problem with the other brands I used so far is, the sweat goes into the headphones and they stop working after 3 to 6 months, some brands even after 2 months.  9 months ago, I bought these Philips SHS3200 headphones for $8 right here on amazon and they are still working fine.  I am a small person and my body parts including my ears are small.  After reading some of the reviews here, I was hesitant before purchasing whether these headphones would be big for my ears.  I gave these headphones a shot because I was unhappy with various headphones I used until then and these are only $8.  I have no trouble using these headphones for two to three hours at a time.  If I use it more than three hours at a time, I feel a very little pain in my ears.  I would still buy these headphones again and I give these headphones 5 stars.  The way these headphones are designed they don't fall off the ears when you are working out.  The sound quality I would not say is the best but is pretty good too.For runners and people who work out a lot, definitely try these headphones; these headphones hold up well to sweat.  Also, due to sweat and rough use, you don't want to spend a lot on headphones for your work outs.  For people who have small ears, you can also try these headphones, don't get discouraged by other people's reviews.  One advice to people that have small ears, don't push the headphones all the way into your ears until they hurt your ears; and don't use a hammer to beat these headphones into your small ears; just relax, take it easy and hang these headphones around your ears.  For the price of $7 or $8, you can't complain about these headphones.And no, I don't work for Philips.  I am a runner and gym maniac myself and I am just a satisfied customer.

VI've gone through a ton of these 'earhook' buds over the last 5 years. To give you a rundown:At least 4 pairs of Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black)One pair of Sennheiser OMX60 Ergonomic Earbuds with Basswind System Sound (No longer for sale on Amazon)and most recently Sony MDR-AS20J Active Style Headphones with Soft Loop Hangers - BlackSince I've got wonky ears, regular buds dont work for me at the gym or on my bike. I need something that holds on for dear life, but still has some decent bass. The original Sony MDR-J10's suited my needs because of how cheap they were and it was my first experience with the 'earhook' style. Unfortunately, they were very tinny with barely any bass. Given how cheap they were, and how frequently one of the ears just stopped working, I went through all for 4 pairs in a matter of 2 years.The Sennheisers were my experiment with buying more expensive buds in the hopes that they'd sound much better. Sadly, while they did produce decent bass, they were woefully quiet, even with the built in volume adjustment. Also, the area where the cable turns into the jack was super weak and became exposed and frayed within a few months of office use.The Sony MDR-AS20Js actually sounded pretty good, but the weird full ear loop design made them really uncomfortable. The wires on these seemed just as fragile as the original MDR-J10's as an ear started cutting out soon after I started using them at the gym.I finally tried a pair of the Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones SHS3200/28 (Black) (Replaces SHS3200/37). Not only do these have great rage of sound, but they're the most comfortable buds I've ever worn. Now, understand that I have odd shaped ears apparently, and not everybody will love the way these feel. The bass is amazing without drowning out the high end. The volume is amazing, almost too loud at times. I'm using these with my Mac Pro and my iPod Shuffle 2nd generation. Just received my 2nd pair so I can leave one at the office and use the other at the gym instead of bringing them back and forth. Hopefully they last a bit longer than the 6 month average I'm working on. I'll update if either pair dies. So far, so good.

VI have to say, these earphones really impressed me considering the price. Usually, with earphones this inexpensive, you wouldn't expect much, but these prove other wise. Starting off with the build quality and durability, It exceeds expectations. The rubber ear hooks are definitely made with quality as well as the casing of the earbuds themselves. The design of these earphones makes it really difficult for them to come off your ear once put on. So you can do a whole variety of things with your earphones without the worry of them coming off. Also, the cords are nice and durable. Ive had mine for a little over a year now and they still work just like new with minimal wear on them, so there are no worries when it comes to casual yanks and tugs. You can tell that these weren't just thrown together like any other pair for this price but rather has thought put into it. Now on to the sound quality of these earphones. Truly, you will be amazed by how much sound these things can produce. The bass is nice and balanced and doesn't overpower the music you are listening to. The treble was quite surprising when i heard it. everything was so crisp on highs, lows and mids. Even on the max volume, nothing became distorted or choppy. Last but not least would be the comfortableness of these earphones. It is not the best, but is decent. After about an hour and a half of listening to music i began to feel my ears hurting and just had to take them out. Other than that, these earphones are awesome. Overall, these earphones are great and exceeds expectations considering their price. I'd definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for good sounding earbuds with a good looking price.Feel free to leave a comment if you have a question or just want to share your thoughts.

VTo me, looking for a quality pair of headphones is like looking through a box of buttons for the exact color. I am picky at times with my purchases of headphones and I have dissatisfied many, many *cough Maxell cough* times. I tried a pair of Maxell headbuds, but judging by my review you'd know that didn't go as planned. So on my way to Target. I was shocked, they had a bigger headphones selection than Best Buy and Circuit City combined. So many to choose from, so little time. I looked at mostly earbud models and clip headphones (the one that have a clip behind the ear). That still left a lot so I minimized my search from eliminating those with white cords and brands I'm not so sure about, even then I ended up with some choice. They had my trusty MDRE828LP earbuds by Sony, but for some reason Sony must've jacked up the price because they were thirteen bucks and I know Walmart has them for half that price. Left were Sony clip earbuds, two kinds of Philips clip speakers that were priced differently, and these. Sorry, I had to bulge, or in other words by two sets. One of those sets did end up to be these, the Philips SHS3200 clip earbuds, and I must say, I'm a bit dissappointed. Great sound quality, they were only ten bucks, but do not fit my ears. They don't have a ton of extra bells to them, but they do what they say.The sound of these are great. When plugged into my iPod I did get a good sound to them. They have a really nice bass sound, that is consistent at higher volumes, but like all headphones I did get some distortion at higher volumes if the bass booster was on. The mids are a bit more coarse at higher volumes, but they do sound very balanced to me. It seems the closer the actual speaker was to my ear, the more satisfing the mids were. They also have a nice, clear treble, that makes them perfect for audiobooks and speech. But overall, these have a nice, balanced sound with a bit of a punch in the bass.For comfort, I wore these for some time and found them to be uncomfortable. They do take some time to get used to so don't expect to flip them on and have a great fit or expect them to feel comfortable in the first week of use, but even then these were way too uncomfortable. The bud was too big for my ear, and kept drilling into my ear. They probably will fit larger ears but do not fit my (i'd say kinda small to average) ears. After wearing them for only 30 minutes I did eventually start to feel pressure on my ears. The earhook is flexible and comfortable but I think Philips spend too much on the flexible hook than the actual earbuds. I got a bit tripped up on the Amazon listing; they have a metal thing in the hook and when it said flexible hook I thought that you can move the hook. Remeber these are only ten bucks so they don't do much more than the packaging lists.These have an L-shaped cord so these won't die from plug issues and the cord is a long, four feet so you won't feel like you're on a leash while using your MP3 player or other device. Also know these come in both white and black. For other plus points, the cord is wrapped heavily so there's a good chance these will last longer than most other headphones. My Sony MDRE828LP earbuds still work but the cord is coming apart due to normal wear-and-tear of my headphones, so these will likely last longer. Also since they are earbuds they aren't too bulky so they're much better for portable use than the bulky over-the-head style. Another good point is that these have a year warranty, while Sony's lasts only three months.Overall, solid earbuds that don't fit. They have a well balanced sound with great bass, are strudy, and are priced low, but are useless to me since they refuse to fit. Somewhat upsetting because I found nothing wrong with them other than the comfort issue at all. But I've decided that nothing matters if I can't wear them, so they're going back for return, but if you have bigger ears you may want to try these. 3 stars.

VI have been using these for a couple of months since breaking a much more expensive pair.  They are used primarily for running and working out, 4 times per week or so.  I am not an audiophile, just need to hear the music and my RunKeeper prompts.1) The sound quality is good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the bass response, although it can become a bit muddled on some songs... not a big deal.  Sound quality still far exceeds the Apple earbuds or my previous bluetooth set.2) The fit is good.  The earhook is a little large and takes some getting used to, but these stay in place very well.  They do not go in your ear canal.  The stability is provided by the earhook.3) These dudes are tough.  I sweat A LOT and they perform - even on my longer runs of 8-9 miles.  Recently I lost them, which really bummed me out, but I found them in the dryer in my shorts pocket.  After going through the washer and dryer I was sure they were toast.  Unbelievably, I plugged them in, and they sounded just as good as before.I'm thinking of buying a couple of extra spares for when these eventually conk out.  Great purchase.Edit to update:  WOW! Here I am 8 months later, still using these headphones 4 times per week, and they are still going!!  They even went through the washer and dryer AGAIN (I know --- be more careful with your stuff...) and they still sound like new.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. These headphones are ** by far ** the best I have ever owned for the money.  Simply awesome.  Took me through an entire marathon training season, still going.  Love, love, love.

VThese are actually a decent set of headphones for the price. I had a set I bought before my second deployment overseas back when we shipped in Jan 2007.  Just last week (1/16/2012) I went for a jog and the right side wire finally gave way and the right headphone is useless as the wire broke inside the insulation.  My ONLY complaint about these is that when wearing a motorcycle helmet it makes it difficult to put the helmet on and very difficult to take off the helmet with the addition of wearing the headphones(Even painful at times). It's probably also the reason why my right side headphone's wire failed because of the more excessive pulling on the wires from pulling my helmet up while mistakenly grasping the wires from time to time. After longer periods of time while riding, the bud part of the headphones caused the inside of my ear (Service before the canal) to become tender. Which caused more pain when taking off the helmet.  If you're looking for headphones that are comfortable for a motorcycle ride (short or far distance) I would steer clear of these and find something better. And when you do let me know because I haven't found any headphones or ear buds that are practical for comfortable rides while listing to music.  For the price you can't go wrong. Cause these baby's will last years and they can handle a little roughness every now and again as I explained before.(And I've stepped on them by mistake once as well.) For jogging you won't regret buying these.

VGood "disposable" headphones
p354
sg5
VI wear headphones nearly all of my waking hours (and sometimes even when I'm sleeping), and for the last few years I've mainly been using these. They're quite comfortable. I hardly even notice I'm wearing them most of the time. They generally don't irritate the skin on my ears, even though I wear them all the time.I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality seems OK. I generally don't notice any real deficiency.They are not at all durable, though. I've probably gone through 8 pairs of these in 3 years. Over time, the glue in the mesh above the speakers wears out and then the black ring and mesh want to fall out and get lost, and without those the headphones are a lot less comfortable. Also, it's common for one of the headphones to die after several months, possibly due to a bad connection in the wires near the jack. If none of the above two issues ends up breaking one of these headphones, after a year or so the volume will start to die down. But they're so cheap that I just keep buying them anyway.One annoying thing is that I think the 3.5mm jack is either not shaped quite right out-of-the-box, or it gets bent/deformed more easily than other jacks; as a result, it will often start to randomly trigger the headset features of phones and tablets.They are not very comfortable when lying on your side in bed, though I guess most people don't do that with headphones on...

VRecent Quality Drop -- DO NOT BUY
p360
sg5
VThese have been my headphones of choice for the last 5 or so years, but unfortunately that run has come to an abrupt end.  The replacement cycle was typically ~six months, which I think is fair for a pair of cheaper headphones used for working out and such.However, a recent pair broke after about one month.  Frustrated, I tried a few other brands of earbuds (the in-ear headphones are uncomfortable for me).  After a few so-so months in those, I thought I'd give the Philips headphones another try.  This was a big mistake.  The earpiece fell apart SIX HOURS after opening the package, and after only some light use on a car ride.  This is completely unacceptable, and clearly shows a decrease in the product quality in my opinion.To clarify what I mean by 'breaking', the issue with these headphones is that the speakers themselves are cheaply glued into the earbud, so the whole earpiece tends to fall apart.  You can line the circular cover back up and make it fit again, but once it starts to fall apart, it becomes too frequent to be worth the mid-workout hassle.  I would post a picture of the damage, but the new Amazon review form does not allow me to do so. -- [EDIT:  In the editing mode, I was allowed to add the photo so you should see it now.]Summary:  Earphones will fall apart very easily.  I know these are cheaper headphones, but your money is better spent elsewhere.  Avoid avoid avoid.

VI just bought my second & third set of these headphones/earphones to replace the original set I bought 2 years ago in a retail store (and for which I paid 40% more). The only reason they needed replacement was because of my constant abuse. Absolutely love these phones (Why else would I have bought them again?). The behind-the-ear "hooks" keep these in place no matter what I'm doing, including running, but are easy to take off quickly. I find them very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time (biking, walking, yard work, etc.). I also like to "open" feature of these as they sit just at the ear canal opening without the stuffy feeling that earbuds can often give.I don't use earphones to listen to sonically perfect music (after all, I'm listening to either MP3 recordings or radio), I have a home stereo for that. Nevertheless, I do want good sound with decent highs and substantial bass without being "boomy"; these earphones perform perfectly in that respect. They also provide clear sound while still allowing you to be aware of other sounds happening around you. For general use, these are the best, most comfortable and most cost-effective earphones available (IMHO).

VThe Good:It's light weight, and the sound quality is decent given the price. Also, the volume coming out of these speakers is loud. I couldn't turn up my mp3 player more than halfway with these ear buds. It's that loud. My other ear buds I have to turn up the volume way up to hear it properly.The Bad:Unless you have large ears these will not stay in if you are going physical activity. I bought these to use at the gym. They do not stay in when I am jogging on the treadmill or when doing certain weight lifting exercises (ie. flat bench press and decline bench press).Conclusion:These ear buds are a hit or miss in regards to if they will fit your ears, because they can't be adjusted. Some people have the type of ears that made for ear buds;however, I am not one of them. Which is why I bought these; thinking that the ear hook will make a big difference. The ear hook made no difference, because either it is the right fit for your ears or not. The quality is good, and it stays in my ear if I am walking or doing light activity, but I bought it for jogging and weight lifting, and it fails for those activities.

VBest value for workout headphones I've had
p407
sg5
VSummary:  If you prefer the over-the-ear hook-style headphones, these are worth a try.I've used Nike headphones exclusively for as long as I've had an i-pod for workouts (note - Philips was the manufacturer for Nike).  The Nikes are typically overpriced, have poor sound, do not fit all that well (although they'd always fit better than any other type I'd tried) and only last about a year before one of the speakers gives out and I am forced to buy a new set.  Having used these headphones for a while now, I can say :1.  That they are the best fitting headphones I've owned. The ear hooks are a bit more rigid and hold them in place a bit better than others I've used.  Also, the ear buds fit into my ear a bit better.2.  The sound is much cleaner and stereo effects much more noticeable.  I can actually hear the more subtle parts of songs even when on a treadmill.3.  I don't know if these will hold up as well as my previous headphones, but they were sold to me at a price which I can accept paying on a yearly basis if it comes to it.

VI have trouble keeping traditional ear buds comfortably in my ears and noise-isolating ear buds make me feel like an ear infection is coming on due to sealing the ear canal. I had some good luck with a pair of my wife's Sony ear hook ear buds and thought I would give Philips a chance. As expected the audio quality from these ear buds is quite good, as is typical of Philips products, much better than the equivalently priced Sony model. The fitment, however, is imperfect. The buds are arranged the way traditional ear buds are, to the ear hook holds them loosely outside the ear rather than any significant portion of the speaker bud fitting in the ear. This causes them to feel loose and require some fiddling. This looseness can also be a problem if you wear glasses. Despite the problems, however, they are still a worthy product (for me, at least) as they're a good compromise point: better sound at the cost of only some discomfort.

VThese headphones are great. They're comfortable, don't fall off during workouts, don't short out due to sweating, don't hurt your ears after long workouts, have better quality sound and more bass than many others that have cost me a whole lot more. The rubber rings around the buds don't fall off and they last and last and last, especially if you don't step on them. So far, nothing else I have tried matches these especially considering the kind of workouts that I do (i.e. yoga, hot yoga, pilates (all of which have you upside down a lot), regular gym workouts, walking, etc. Unheard of price for the quality and especially since they don't hurt or fall apart easily.  For what I need, they're the best. I'm a happy customer. I keep two or three sets hanging around so I don't have to do without.

p437

VI purchased these to use with my Zune.  The ear buds that came with the Zune absolutely stunk and fell out all the time.  They were especially bad in cold weather because the wiring would get stiff.  I replaced those ear buds with these ones.  I hoped that because they hooked over the ear, they would be less prone to falling out.  Happily, I have been pleased with the results.  Once in, these ear buds do not readily fall out.  I can even wear them with my sunglasses with no problems.  The wiring does not stiffen up in the cold and remains flexible.  The sound quality of these ear buds is so-so, but I can't complain for the price.  I mostly use these to listen to books on tape.  When listening to music, I have larger, over-the-ear headphones so I can get the full sound quality I desire.  If you want an inexpensive set of ear buds that won't fall out and give you descent sound, these fit the bill.

VI was looking for a cheap pair of headphones that hook on the ear.  I was worried about buying this given the mixed feedback and cheap price.  Gotta say I love it.  It sounds good, and the hooks are flexible enough to not get crushed and broken in my pockets.  It doesn't seem to perfectly fit my ears, but it's design keeps it firmly in place.  Even shaking my head vigorously doesn't make them fall.  I've had them almost a month and there doesn't seem to be any sign of damage or fatigue.My only problem is I wish the individual headphone cord lengths were longer (so the divide in the cord closer to the jack), but that's purely a matter of personal preference.I love these headphones and will probably buy them again.Edit: After about 3-4 months, one of the ear pieces broke.  Keep in mind I'm pretty rough on them, they were damaged while in my pocket.

p453
sg5
VI bought these in the hopes of using them at the gym. I already own the Sony MDR-J10. They work OK and the sound is OK, but the 'over the ear' function is pointless bc it hovers over the top of my ear. So I still find myself pushing them back in all the time -- they're basically just earbuds.Same problem with these. I thought the 'flexibe earhook' would help, but no. The earhook is a little smaller, but it still just hovers. Also, while on the others they actual speaker part at least fits in my ear, on these headphones that part barely fits in my ear. i have to really jam it in here, and if i bounce around too much it falls out easily. Actually, i am currently just sitting here typing and one has already basically fallen out. Guess I can't return them, either since the box must be totally damaged to try them out (didn't buy from Amazon...and paid more too)...so maybe these will just be a spare pair of desk headphones.I will say that the sound on these is FAR superior to the sonys. I have a pair of Philips surround sound earbuds for work that are great too. I am a girl but I don't think my ears are that small...it just seems that all of the earhook headphones are geared towards a larger ear to hook onto.

VThe sound quality of these buds is actually very good. Great bass quality and great high range sounds as well. The fit however is not. The hooks are much too large for my ears(which are somewhat on the small side I suppose) and end up providing no support at all. The bud itself is too large to go in my ear canal without massive amounts of pain being caused. Which forces me to have them sit awkwardly pointing at my ear rather than sitting inside. The hooks then end up pointing outwards and makes it look like I am wearing some odd form of hearing aid.In short if you have small ears and/or a small ear canal(I would say that if normal ear buds fit tightly and snugly in your ears that your ears are around the same size as mine), then these buds will definitely be too large for you

p463

VI bought these headphones out of desperation while in Denmark when my previous Sonys failed. (I will preface this by saying I paid a lot more than the $6.99 listed here, so my expectations were somewhat higher.)They were secure around my ears, but the actual speakers fit poorly into my ears, so there wasn't much seal. When using them on a noisy rowing machine, I had to crank the volume up to about 80% on my iPod to keep the song audible. That said, for city bicycling, where it was definitely not good to be blocking out all other sounds, they were quite practical.The cord was an ongoing nuisance. Every pair of headphones I've had has had some tangling, of course, but this has a very thing cord that seems to kink quite easily. Even after untangling, it gives the feeling that it almost wants to spring back to its tangled mess.Ultimately, though, the main reason for the 1-star is that after about seven weeks, the things failed. The plug no longer fits in securely, so I need to massage it to be just right in the 3.5mm socket to keep my music from sounding like a distant echo. Spend a bit more on Amazon and get something better.

VI've had 3 pairs of these headphones.  They don't last very long, but I love the behind the ear design (I have small ears and they stay on when I run). I've had a pair where one ear bud cease functioning; another pair the end of the cord disconnected and there were wires showing. However, the most recent problem I've had with them and why I will NEVER buy them again is that when I plug them into speakers at work or put on my coat or do anything that might create static electricity with them connected is that they send shocks in my ears. If I am at work and move my wheeled chair at all it shocks me. This also happened with the previous pairs every once in a while, but I thought it was just a random occurence. However, its most definitely a product flaw across the board.

VOk, I have a love/hate relationship with these. I use these mostly for running (as they stay put; better than more expensive Apple ones) and working out. But after some time, the rubber covering that goes over the earbud falls off and it then hurts to have the metal earbud bare in one's ear canal.  Grrrrrrr.I go through a few of these a year; as the ear coverings don't seem to stay on long (but I must say that the headphones themselves work fine; so it's a shame to have to throw away because of the lack of a rubber covering!). Other than that issue, these work great.I think I might have to do a work-around and hotglue down the rubber pieces prior to wearing them for the first time. I have to buy another pair as we speak/write.  :)

VI bought these because I wanted a cheap pair of headphones to wear when I'm at the gym and immediately after trying them on, I regret doing so.Sound is mediocre but that's not the reason for the 1 star rating; I didn't expect anything out of these headphones other than them fitting into my ear and being able to hear my music out of them. The problem is that these are painful to my ears and even when I manage to get them in, they only loosely stay in and fall out with little trouble. I'm not saying these are slightly uncomfortable, I'm saying these are really painful. I couldn't keep these in my ears for any longer than a few minutes before taking them out.I'm returning them and going with something else.

VFor the price, they are ok. But:1. The left side always gets uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. 2. I have had to turn the cord to a certain position in the headphone jack of my phone in order to get good sound; it's very touchy about its position in the socket. 3. It can be difficult to get the inner ear pieces to stay simultaneously with the outer ear pieces in place.I got these because I do not like the new Apple headphones design for the inner ear buds, and I wanted something that would stay on/in my ear while I work out. These headphones do the trick, they are just taking some adjusting to. I still prefer them to Apple headphones, although I wish they had the volume control buttons and microphone.

p496
sg5
VThe sound quality for these headphones is pretty darn good considering the price.  Not the heavy base or crystal clear tones, but still very decent for the price.The problem is the fit.  Neither the earhooks nor speakers are adjustable at all.  The buds are a hard plastic covered by a paper-thin layer of rubber.  The earhooks, while pliable rubber, are not hinged for optimal fit.The buds are also very large.  I have smaller ears and I can not wear these headphones for more than two hours before they become painful.  This tight fit is the only reason these headphones stay on as the hooks don't even touch my ears!I use these at work, so I'm not using them constantly, but I am currently looking for a new pair.

VThough these have great sound, and seem well-made, they do not sit comfortably in the ear.  They are not shaped in a way that allows them to be in your ear without irritating one area or another - after a day or so of use, I actually was bleeding in one spot where the hard edge of the "speaker" rubbed against a curved part of my ear.  The other ear has areas that are swollen - and I cannot put them back on!  There is no way that these could be used comfortably for longer than an hour or so I would think.  I do not have "small" ears and there is nothing unusual about how my ears are shaped - these just don't fit properly without hurting.  What a shame, because the sound is quite good -

VI just got these last week and I wear them at my desk. As many have mentioned, after wearing these for more than 20-30 minutes your earlobe starts to hurt.But my main issue with these is that they have shocked me twice so far on my ear. I started to notice that they were producing static noise and I was not sure why. After a couple of days I thought I felt a shock on my ear but it was so light that I ignored it. But the next day as I was putting 1 in my ear and I felt a shock on my ear that was significantly stronger than the last.Needless to say I won't be using my brand new Pillips headphones for fear of getting a strong jolt of electricity.

VI'm tall and chubby and I sweat always so when I run earbuds fall out and it's a battle to get consistant music while keeping a good pace.  These things fit comfortably over by big ears, I'm not sure how universal the size but they fit great.  Earbuds sort of push in on the entrance to your ear hole and that can get sore if you have to keep pushing them in.  These sit outside of your ear hole and let just the the smallest perfect amount of street noise in so you can hear bikes and people and whatever.  Seriously the best $10 you can spend if you listen to music while doing something active.  Protip: drape the cable behind you on its way to your armband.

VI have been wearing only Earhooks for the past six years because they're so comfortable and they don't fall out. My primary use of earphones are listening to my iPod when I'm lying in bed (and can't blast it because my dorm roommate would freak out) and these stay on whether I toss and turn and sleep on my side (a lot of other earphones I tried can't take all this movement). My only warning is that these don't last forever. I've had several pairs and after about 2 years or so, one side of the earphones will stop working and you have to get a new one. But they're so comfortable, they flex and bend with you, that I can't go to any other earphones now.

VI had a old pair of these. They lasted me from 2007 until 2 weeks ago. Almost 9 years of use. My advice to users, just make sure you are careful. They'll last damn near forever. I was impressed by the lifespan of these earbuds. Most professional top of the line earbuds, headphones, and even gaming headphones dont even last close to 9 years. The sound is good, audiophiles will disagree but thats to be expected. As long as youre careful these will last you forever. The use these went through astounds me that they kept up so well. Many snowy blizzards, many heavy rains and downpours, and more. For me these lasted me longer than just about anything.

But the headphones cannot hang on my ears.  i'm very disappointed.  I hope that either the company produces different sizes of the earhook or the description should include the actual size of the earhook of the current product.My conclusion is that this type of products should not be ordered online without knowing the exact size information of the earhook.

VI've owned several pair of headphones, and actually have found these to be better than any others. I've had other types, and better brands, but still find these the best for working out at the gym. Although I've experienced no difficulty fitting them over my average size ears, I've found others to be even much more envolved. I also find that inexpensive ear phones, have to be replaced every few months (no matter what brand), because they break from "vibration/noise" fatigue, after so many hours of use. If not that the thin wires used eventually break from being wound after usage. At this price they are an unbeatable item.

I bought these headphones mostly to use at the gym while running.  My other headphones would slip out from bouncing up and down and sweating.  These headphones work great, and I sometimes use them instead of the headphones that came with my mp3 player for everyday use.

VI wanted a pair of headphones for the gym that do not fit into the ear (like buds) but hang just outside.  These were great in that regard.  They're loud enough and have decent sound (for what they are.)  The ear pieces can be a little hard/uncomfortable, but since they aren't in the ear canal, that wasn't a big deal,  The issue I have is that they don't last.  First the little rubber cover rings will pop-off and get lost.  Then one of the speakers detached from the case.  This happened after about two months use.  I don't think these can handle use in sweaty conditions.  Disappointed in the longevity.

So if this solves your earbud-madness problem, buy it.Why only four stars? Because they're a pain if you wear glasses. What's the solution to that problem? Flexible arms, maybe? I'm not the engineer.

VI use these all day. I bought them to replace another pair I had that kept catching my earrings. The ear hook was a complete loop and so it made wearing the earrings a problem. I like that these don't catch since it is an open hook that goes over top of the ear. However, the speakers are big and the hook is not adjustable. They don't fit in my ear very well and you cannot adjust the hook to hug your ear. I anticipate shopping around again for a better pair of headphones. If these fit your ears, I think they would work just fine. Since these wouldn't stay in my ears, they ended up in the trash.

Even at a reasonable volume the music is already pouring out of those holes and around you will complain that you're music is a loud and you have awful taste.Don't buy this.

I have a small frame (so not large ears) and because these sit on top of my ears...they fit better than the sony ones that are loops that are supposed to encompass my ears.  I'll keep you posted on how long they last...I am a bit worried based on previous reviews, but for this workout...they beat out 3 other sets of headphones hands down.

The actual buds where the music comes out sticks out and gives me a weird feeling inside my head since the music is distorted and not inside of my ear. You can hear everything with these.

The only improvement that I expected was the presence of an earhook (I was getting tired of my earbuds falling out at work).  I was pleasantly surprised that these actually sounded good (I am not an audiophile, but I can recognize audio fidelity).  The low/mid range sound reproduction is very healthy, which is surprising for earbuds, especially $6 earbuds.  The construction is certainly acceptable and doesn't look excessively "cheap" at all, although the cord could be a little longer.

Also, though I don't usually go there, they can go to way high volume.The only quibble is that they aren't white so they don't match the iPod and the cord is a little longer than it needs to be considering I attach my iPod to the bottome of my shirt.

I feel like the earloop is pushing them against the ear canal and causing too much pressure. If you twist the earloop you can sort of shape it better to your ear. They don't bother me much anymore.

I don't notice it so much when I'm not sweaty, so it has to do with the moisture for sure.  But in any case, it's going to deter me from buying this style in the future.

I have tinnitus and these headphones are comfortable,lightweight,with excellent sound quality.Unable to tolerate anything tight on my head or ears due to health issues.I've tried other earbuds which fall out of my ears,headband type headphones with soft padding but don't compare with these.Will write an update/Thank you for reading my review.OWLWore the earhooks during the night and they stayed in and were reasonably comfortable.Side lying not to much.

VI purchased these headphones because I was sick of my earbuds falling out while I run, and unfortunately, they do the same. It may very well be the size/shape of my ear, but they do not fit quite right. The sound quality is fine and I continue to use them for my work outs. But when I put the ear bud portion in my ear, the hook part is too high on my ear to actually hook it in place. I like to think I have normal sized ears, so unless you know you have large ears, I might consider a different option.

Some days no problems, other days every minute or two I have to reach for my phone and tweak the headphones until they get to that sweet spot where they start to work again.

VOn my 4th or 5th set.  I use headphones a lot and sweat a lot. These hold up as good as any and don't fall off/out when running. The cord's always tangled and the rubber ring on the bud comes off pretty easily.  They can survive a trip through the washer but do tend to short out from excessive sweat.  This tends to active voice controls on my phone which is annoying.  Much more comfortable than the Sony MDR-J10.  Stays in better than any buds.  Price is right.

I would recommend these especially for anyone who struggles to find earphones for non-traditional ears.

I keep wanting the speakers closer to my ears for better sound, but they don't push in.  Sony makes similar ones that are much nicer because they are rounded and go a little bit more into your ear, which makes for better sound.

VI really like these headphones and usually buy them in lots of 2 or more.  The sound is good and they are comfortable to wear.  The only real down side is that they tangle easily, which is just annoying, and the ear pieces rust over time, which takes a long time to happen.  Recommend them to all.

p1031
sg5
VSo I ordered these because... Well, I didn't really need them but you can never have enough earbuds lying around as anyone's who's ever spent more than a few seconds looking for a pair knows. The price was also crazy and I was more than a little curious what kind of quality I would even be looking at in this price bracket.Let's start with the build. Very lightweight (which I guess is what you want with "sport" earbuds) but the real thing I like here is the ear hooks because literally no "normal" earbuds stay in my ears. The actual buds are solid but the cord is akin to something you'd find on those free airline earbuds. Again- not much of a complaint for the price point.Comfort- the standard disc shape buds are of course a love it or hate it style, but like I mentioned earlier the ear hooks seal the deal for me in making these comfy.Audio- I'm not a "hardcore audiophile" but I've owned at one point or another almost every major headphone brand's best midrange headphones as well as a variety of high end amp and dac solutions for listening to music. That's really all I do in my free time is discover music, so believe me when I say I care about good audio. And I didn't expect that from $6 earbuds, but wow. These are surprisingly flat tonally which is surprising and hard to find in the "bass generation" of marketing. That isn't to say they're "tinny" - these things put forth incredibly clear and rich audio across an astonishing soundstage (again, considering what we are working with here.) I don't listen to music very loudly but at a normal volume, drums and bass sounded very tight and wound in and vocals and guitars sparkled through. Orchestral strings shine brightly as well with an airy, clear punch. These aren't going to replace custom molded IEMs or anything, but they shouldn't in all honesty. At $~6 a pair you could practically consider these "disposable" by comparison to nearly everything else. If you live a lifestyle that finds you in positions where nice earbuds could get lost or damaged (or even stolen) these are one of my all time favorite "value product" discoveries.In conclusion, buy these things. If for no other reason, to be stunned at what $6 can do.

VHoly moly, I have finally found it: cheap headphones that sound decent and\u2014most importantly to me\u2014don't fall outta my ears! Wow. I have them on right now. And I totally love them.My ears are...  I don't know. Alien ears. Toddler ears. Not normal adult human ears, apparently. Because I have never ever EVER found a set of earbuds/headphones that didn't simply drop out of my ears\u2014or hurt. In-ear buds hurt me. Even the smallest size inserts are painful. I've also tried the over-ear form factor a few times without success. The speaker was always aimed in a way that I could not hear the sound easily.This has been my experience: brief bouts of hopeful experimentation with looooong stretches of disappointment and resignation. Every once in awhile I get sad and try a new set of headphones just to see if they aren't entirely horrible on me. These Philips headphones were a gamble I figured would disappoint like all the rest. (Do I sound bitter? Dang right I am.) I was afraid to be too hopeful at this price point. I am so delighted to tell you, however, that my very low expectations have been happily blown to bits. TO BITS. These Philips "earhook" style phones are soooo comfy. And I can waggle my head all around without them falling out! Heck, they don't even move. Huzzah!Because the speaker is aimed well for my tiny ear canals, I can hear the music really well. Even the bass parts sound pretty dang good. Certainly amazingly well for this price.The only niggle is that I wish there was a volume control on the cord. I'm still very happy with them, though. If you are similarly afflicted with weirdo ears, I'd encourage you to give these a try. Good luck!

VFor the last 10 years, I've been a religious user of the Sony MDR-J10 headphones (http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00007EDM8/ref=mp_s_a_1_34?qid=1447217281&sr;=8-34\u03c0=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&keywords;=sony+headphones&dpPl;=1&dpID;=51BM3sWZ9fL&ref;=plSrch) for workouts. They come in tons of colors and sold for $10/$15. They'd usually last 6-18 months, so the low price point coupled with solid sound quality and comfort made them winners.Then their price spiked to $30/$40, so I figured I'd try this Phillips version for $6. Six bucks. That's a latte.Well, I should have gone with the latte. After reading the reviews, I had high hopes that these would be my new favorite. Wow, was I wrong! I could barely convince myself to use them throughout my entire workout. So, I didn't.Comfort:These headphones hurt. In short, they're a weird shape that neither fits in the ear nor positions well above it. When in, they hurt. When above, they fall out.Do they stay in?I run ~50 miles/month in sets of 24 min 5Ks. This information is important because it reveals the pace of my runs - not slow, but certainly not a dead sprint. These headphones barely stayed in for my first minutes, so I tucked them into my hat, and they still had to be adjusted every few minutes.Sound quality:So, let's say you're buying these guys for stationary stuff - desk work, hanging out, casual use. Even then, I say DO NOT BUY if you care about sound quality. Admittedly, as a DJ, sound quality matters to me more than most, but for $6, my expectations were anchored. Still, the sound quality is mediocre to sub par for the Phillips brand. I expected at least a little bit better.Summary:In short, these headphones only make sense for those on an extremely tight budget who do not care about comfort, sound quality, nor fit. Even their cord is a rigid, cheap plastic. If it weren't such a hassle for such an inconsequential amount, I'd return these bad boys. Instead, I'll give them away to someone I don't particularly like.

VAwesome sounding headphones for real ears!
p1049
sg5
VFirst, let me just say in case you don't want to read the entire review:These are great sounding headphones that don't block out the outside world and will actually very comfortably stay in your ears. Simple, but hard to find!Now for more details...I picked these up at WM for $10 on a lark not expecting much. Boy was I surprised! (I will be buying more here on Amazon)I'm an "audiophile" so I'm very picky about sound quality and the fit & finish of a headphone. I own many higher end headphones and these have easily become my favorite ones that I wear most and for the following reasons:- They surprisingly sound great! Easily comparing to much much more expensive ones. No they're not high-end, but they have a full, rich and satisfying quality of sound about them, rich deep bass (not cheap booming), tame mids (not boxy) and sparkling but not brash highs.- They, (get this!) actually stay IN your ears and once they're on you easily don't even notice them. No sweaty ears like full size cans. And unlike most in-ear or earbud styles these stay in your ears without you constantly fiddling with them. Period. You put them on, enjoy your music and get on with life.- They block *some* noise; but just enough to so that you can hear the music clearly, but still open enough to easily hear your surroundings. These are NOT "in-ear" headphones and will not isolate you from the real world if that's your thang.- Last, they are very lightweight and minimalist. Just the minimum components needed to provide a great listening experience and comfortable fit. No loud colors, no flashy look at me logos. Just plain elegant styling.Buy these, as many others have already said, you will NOT regret it. Seriously. Thank you Philips!

VDo not buy these. Bought these to use with my new tablet to watch movies on an international flight. Didn't really test them out before the flight and literally popped them out of the packaging the night I was packing. Ear clips were comfortable enough, ear buds weren't and wouldn't seat properly to seal the ear canal resulting in a lot of ambient noise getting to the ear muddying the sound coming from he ear buds, which aren't that loud even with the volume maxed out on my tablet. Tried it with my phone and had the same experience. Drives do an ok job reproducing dialogue frequencies however the extra bass they advertised on the packaging is a joke. It sounds like an ant scratching on a piece of paper in your ear. In the end these were so bad after getting tired of having to press the ear buds into my ears. I gave up and opted to use one of the disposable ear buds from the plane which did a much better job. End of story stay far away from these. Read on for my pass experience with philips clip on headphones.Firstly I am not a heavy headphone user. My main uses which are occasional tend to be limited to on flights and if listening to notes in the library. The only reason I bought these were because of my pass experiences with philips ear clip headphones namely the SHS3701/27 which lasted me almost 5 years and I finally threw out due to the decaying foam padding. Then next the SHS4700/28 which I absolutely love but my wife commandeered from me for her own use when we got married. Both of these headphones were awesome and was disappointed to find that they had been discontinued. I have always bought philips headphones since I believe they use to offer one of the best sound sound quality to price ratios for my use. Hopefully they'll bring back one of the discontinued models namely the SHS4700/28.

p1059

VI bought these headphones to use at the gym. I wanted ones that sat on the ear but didn't go all the way in like an earbud (I still like to hear outside noises, like people talking to me), and I wanted earhooks because otherwise my earphones have a tendency to fall off. These headphones fit both of those criteria, and they were also fairly inexpensive. They are fairly impressive for how little they cost--the sound quality is excellent, at least for the gym, and much better than other cheap headphones I've used (and they lasted a bit longer, though see below).My only issue is longevity: I'm sure these will be fine for light or occasional use. (I have put them in my office now and plan to use them maybe a few times a week when I need to listen to something and not disturb my co-workers.) However, they did not hold up very well at the gym, lasting only a few months, if that. The speaker grille is held on to the earbud by a rubber-like ring/band around the outside of the earphone, and eventually the grille seems to slip through. At first, slipping the ring back over the grille (and plastic part on the back of the earphone) will work to hold them back together, but eventually enough of either the grill, the band, or the plastic back will break that this stops working--that is, if the earphone doesn't completely detach itself from the ear hook first.I'm deducting one star for the quality problems, but you have to keep in mind that I still think this isn't bad for the price. Headphones at the gym rarely last longer than a few months for me, and buying more expensive headphones only delays how long it takes for them to inevitably break (I think Apple's stock iPod headphones lasted the longest for me at over a year, but that was close to a decade ago and they might be different now). They may hold up better in lower-stress environments like my office, but only time will tell. I'll update this review if much changes.

p1065
sg5
VI've bought several of these Philips earhook headphones over the past ~6 years from my local Bullseye store simply because they were fairly cheap compared to some of the other headphones I see on the shelves that are really expensive and in my opinion, unnecessary.  Some of the other earphones I've tried like the Beats tour and Sony MDREX10LP have these gigantic rubber ear buds that I have to twist and shove into my ear and hope they stay on while I go running.  Even with the different sets of ear buds they provide, the feeling of jamming rubber balls into my ear never worked out for me.  I like these Philips earhook headphones in particular because putting them on is quick and easy.  I can throw on these headphones while riding my bike no problem, I can take them off while running to wipe off the sweat and put them back on in a snap.  I can leave the hook hanging on my ear and not press the earbud in so I can still watch Netflix while listening for the doorbell because I'm expecting a package from amazon.The sound quality really isn't bad at all, in fact, I think it's pretty good considering these headphones are less than $10.  Aside from the Philips, Beats and Sony in-ear headphones, I also have a Sennheiser HD-280 and AKG 240 semi open headphones that I use when working at our local radio station.  Even then, I still tend to use these Philips earhook headphones most frequently in my free time because they're simple to put on and use, they're easy to transport (vs. over-the-ear headphones) and they're cheap so if I lose them for whatever reason, I can just buy another one for less than $10.I listen to music with these, watch movies, youtube videos, occasionally I'll indulge in some nerdy strategy game for an entire weekend with these headphones on, and I've never had a complaint about the sound quality for any of these purposes.My only complaints are that if your head gets really sweaty while exercising, sometimes one of the ear buds might get kinda saturated and then the sound from that earbud will be weird until you dry it out.  And this only happened with the ones that I used for running after a long period of use.  Also, the back of your ears might get a little sore after you've worn these for several hours straight.

p1070

VI gave these a 4 star rating mainly because of price. It would be impossible to find a "good" pair of headphones for less than $10, so you have to know what you're getting into when you buy these. They don't sound awesome, they aren't super good quality, you wouldn't use these as your main headphones. My review is going to sound negative, but just know that I am evaluating the actual quality of the item and comparing it to the inexpensive price.The sound is sub-par. They sound a little "tinny" and hardly have any bass response. They're okay for working out, that's about it. While I'm running or lifting weights I don't need to focus on the detail of the music I'm listening to, it's just nice to have something to listen to other than the boring gym music. Even still, I was unimpressed with the sound quality, but I guess that's what you get for the low price.The ear hooks are awesome. They sit on my ears perfectly and hold the headphones in place. I didn't ever feel like they were going to fall off, or slip out of my ears. I run pretty fast, do pull ups, weights, etc. They stay in my ears securely through everything. I bought these purely for working out so they won't fall out of my ears and they do that perfectly.The shape of the actual earbud is weird though. It might be the shape of my ear canal too, but towards the end of my hour long workouts they start to hurt my ears. Again, this might be a personal thing, but the earbud shape bothers my ears after long use.Overall I gave these a 4 star because they do exactly what I bought them to do, and the price makes them almost disposable. I couldn't ask much more than that. Whenever I have to buy another pair, I probably wouldn't buy these again just because they hurt my ears a little... but again... can't beat the price!

VI bought these headphones to use while at the gym working out. My regular earbuds would always fall out after a few minutes, and anytime the cord was touched or hit my body I'd hear it over the music, which got pretty annoying. I decided that any earbud type headphone wouldn't work for the gym even if it did have clips or some attachment system.The Philips headphones are pretty low end in terms of sound quality - but then again, what do you expect for less than $10? They definitely get loud enough and the mids and trebles are decent, though I do wish there was more power in the low end. Maybe its just a function of the actual speakers resting on the ear canal instead of creating a solid, airtight fit with the ear like earbuds do. If you press these ones in your ear with your finger you'll get a lot more bass, but no way to keep them there (and it'd be uncomfortable). So if you're looking for deep bass, I wouldn't recommend these. But for most people who just want some decent music, or who are listening to news/podcasts, I think the sound quality is totally fine.The construction of the actual headphone and hooks is pretty good and seems relatively durable. The cord is a good length, it reaches my shorts pocket with an extra 6 or 12 inches to spare, which is great if you're moving around. It might be a bit too much extra cord if you have an arm-attached music player, but then again you may be able to wrap up the extra cord. The cord itself isn't the greatest - it feels somewhat thin/cheap and it has retained the kinks that were there from the folded up packaging when I received the item. But no real complaints as the cord quality doesn't affect the overall usage, its just a bit different than the cord on my higher end (i.e. $30) Sony earbuds.Overall I'm pretty happy with the headphones. They have decent sound and don't transfer noise through the cord, they stay in my ear with no issues, and they were very inexpensive. I definitely recommend them if you want something to use at the gym or while working out. If you are an audiophile or have unlimited funds, then I'm sure there are better products out there and these Philips aren't for you. But then again, you probably wouldn't be even reading this review : )

VFirst of all, these earbuds were less than $8 so it would be hard to complain as long as they arrived in working condition. I've only had them for a few days, but I'm very happy. The earhooks are very comfortable for me and keep the speakers well positioned during my typical usage of walking the dog, driving the car, working in the garage, and moving around the house. I was a bit concerned as I wear glasses, but it's no problem at all, and the hooks totally solve the annoying problem of hookless buds falling out. That was the main motivation for my purchase.They replaced the buds included with my Sandisk Clip, which sound pretty good with no equalization - not surprising as those should be well 'matched' to the player. The Philips buds sounded tinny at first, but after adjusting the Sandisk's internal EQ they sound a bit better than the OEM buds. Bass is richer, highs are sharper, mids are comparable. It was interesting to place my fingers over the bass ports in the Philips buds and observe the effect. Doing so kills the bass, so those are definitely functional, and are a unique feature among the various alternatives I considered. Lots of people complain about lack of bass with these and other comparable units, but I find that as long as ambient noise is low bass is very good. I'll need a set of noise-isolating buds for loud ambient conditions, especially since my hearing has taken enough abuse over the years and I'm not willing to really crank up the volume. My range is about 1/3 to 1/2 volume on the Sandisk.I listen to a little bit of everything - rock, pop, bluegrass, classical, etc, and I use shuffle play so I never know what's coming up next. I never feel a need to adjust the EQ for different genres, just volume due to variations in recording levels. All my music files are 192k Windows Media .wma type, which are the highest quality compressed files WM will do.Highly recommended.

V2.75 Stars...Some Drawbacks, but not horrible cheap headphones
p1088

VWith todays great technology, it is now possible to get decent sound from headphones without having to break the bank, but with so many good headphones on the market for 15 Bucks or less, you might want to stay away from these Philips Headphones, and just pay the extra 5bucks on some Sony's or Panasonics, which blow these out of the water. The Philips Major drawbacks in the sound in the high end range. They are really harsh and bright, and even though distortion is not a huge issue, the brightness of the high's will wind up hurting your eardrums. Can this be adjusted? Sure, a bit, Fiddle with you EQ, turn the midrange almost all the way down, and the maybe go -1 and +3 on your high end setting..and of course crank up the bass (which is the most impressive feature of these headphones, once you get rid of the harsh mid and high)..But..you are going to lose some SQ once you do this. Your music will seem to have holes in the mids, and of course in some of the high range..Mind you, I have tried these on my High End Creative MP3, and low end Sansa, and the harshness of high & mid is still an issue...Bottom line..OK, these are 10bucks and under..not bad price range, but if you can shell out an extra couple bucks for Panasonic (my favorite) and Sonys, its worth it..are those super high end..NO, but as I am sure most of you are buying these for running or working out, and no matter what brand you use, once you start sweating, clip over ear headphones will shift a bit (wont fall out of your ears) but shift enough that you lose a bit of sound, so paying top dollar for headphones that are going go get beat the hell up from your workouts and get wet, doesnt make much sense, plus if you are in the gym, you are going to try to drown out the gym noise & music anyway, so getting super high end headphones would be a waste, since  you wont get the full effect of them anyway....hope this helps some of you to make a choice, my advice, stay away unless you want these for a second set to carry in your gym bag or bike bag, whatever, in case you break a set when working out..

VGreat for running while wearing hat + glasses!
p1093
sg5
VI run 1:15 almost every day with these, plus the walk from the end of my running route (which adds another :15). I wear eyeglasses and a hat with a drawstring under the chin.These earphones have so far outlasted at least four pairs of shoes over about a year and a half.They have not been coddled. I run rain or shine. I "store" it by winding the cord and the Shuffle around my hand and shoving it into my pocket, along with a cell phone and Kleenex. Next morning, when I start my run, I just hold the earpieces and let the Shuffle drop through my shirt to flake out the cord. I "clean" it by scraping the gunge off it when I happen to notice it, and maybe wiping it on my running shirt.Pros:- They work fine with my glasses.- They stay in place no matter how sweaty I get or how much dodging I have to do.- They let me hear cars and bikes and other things around me.- They are cool and comfortable in the summer.- I can hang them on my shirt collar when I'm finished listening to music but still out and about.- Ruggedness has been first-rate.Cons:- I'd agree that the cord is more tangly than the earphones that came with my iPods, but a large part of that may be the earpiece hangers themselves, in which case that may be a characteristic endemic to the class rather than a problem specific to this model.- Likewise, I've found that it generally takes two hands to put them on: one hand to place the earphone and the other to track back along the hanger to flip it over the ear. Sometimes I can put them on one-handed, but if I'm on the move it's faster and easier to use two hands.I am frankly surprised that they've lasted this long. I have three other fairly inexpensive hanger-type earphones sitting in their packages, because at the price I really didn't think any of them would last more than a few months.I'd recommend them.

VThe ideal headphone for masochists!
p1098
sg5
VAs I was packing for a fairly long trip recently, I realized that I had left my favorite headphones in my apartment several hours away. So I grudgingly headed to Wal-Mart, my first mistake, and sought out a pair of Sony MDR-J10 headphones, a model that I've owned probably a dozen pairs of in the last five years. This sounds bad for the Sony's but the reason they wear out so fast is that I use them when running, working outside, etc. In other words, not the kind of circumstances that are going to have me breaking out my Bose or Grado cans. I love those damned headphones. For bargain-basement buds, they have THE best quality and comfort I have ever experienced. But like all products that I love, Wal-Mart decided to stop selling them.Instead, hanging on the rack were these little monsters. They looked pretty similar to the Sony's, so I figured I would give them a go. Trying them on briefly before I left the house, I noticed they felt a little too snug, but thought nothing of it.Later that day, I plugged them into my iPod and sat back to enjoy the music.After about 5 minutes with these phones on, my ears felt like they were bleeding. I tried relentlessly to shift them around in my ears to find a comfortable position, but to no avail. Now I'm a big, 6'4" guy and would guess that my ears are roughly proportional to my frame... that is to say, larger than average. Which leaves me wondering: who are these designed for? Masochists? Giants? Elephants?Eventually I decided to peel off the rubber ring around the bud in an attempt to reduce the diameter of the piece in the only way possible, though this provided little relief. Eventually I gave up and located an ultra-generic pair of earbuds in a Flying J Truck Stop. Yes, that's what I was reduced to. Electronics shopping in a place where I'm accustomed to seeing large, unwashed men do coke lines off the sink in the bathroom. Curiously, I quite like that set of headphones.AVOID THESE WHATEVER YOU DO.

VThese clip earbuds are the best you would ever get for AT LEAST $100 more. I got these for Christmas 2010, but never really used them until around Sept. 2011 due to all my headphones breaking (mysteriously around the same time, I might add...). I don't think I'll be able to form sentences now, so here:- with one in, at about 50% on an iProduct the other one is loud (meaning sound(and even vocals) easily distinguishable for 5 feet from the one not in your ear)- when both are in place, not a even the slightest sound is leaked through, not until 75% at least- 50% volume on this is the equivalent to about 105% on most earbuds I've used- absolutely, do not EVER, turn it up all the way!!! When I say EVER, I mean you WILL GO DEAF! No joke!- if it's loud in one place, turn down the headphones before you take them out- too many times I've left them on 75% when it's loud, then lost hearing for a few seconds when I turn them on in quiet- these earbuds also have one of the longest cords I've seen with earbuds or headphones! Easily 4', prob 5'.- I will often forget these are even in my ear at all. I sometimes get yelled at by my teachers even though it's not playing because I forget they're there- the thing is, on my DC Trip I lost the little rubber gummy ring on my left earbud. I cannot tell the difference between the two AT ALL- theyre also quite durable. I've sometimes been taking them out and dropped them and steeped on them. Nothing- I'm not gonna say I would have payed $100-$175 before using them, because that would seem ridiculous. But they're definitely worth that priceTO SUM IT UP:BUY THE EARBUDS!!!!! Don't waste a couple hundred bucks on the same quality!

VPerfect Running Headphones
p1132
sg5
VI'm on my third pair in five years, and I plan to keep buying these as long as Philips makes them. The combination of price, comfort, and sound makes these the best running/workout headphones I've ever found.I wear them almost exclusively while running or cycling, so inevitably they begin to fail after a year or two as the cord becomes damaged from bouncing and swinging around (which is why I've had 3 pairs in 5 years). But this is expected, and will happen with any headphones. The advantage these have is that they're so cheap that I don't care when they break. At this price, 1-2 years of heavy use is more than fair.The sound quality is fine. Don't expect premium sound, but music and podcasts come through loud and clear, with none of the tinniness you get from many cheap headphones. As long as you don't expect booming bass or audiophile sound, you'll probably be satisfied.For me, the key feature of these headphones is the fit. The hooks are comfortable and keep the headphones perfectly in place, no matter how fast I'm moving and how much I'm bouncing around. I've tried several different headphones with similar designs, and the fit ranged from decent to terrible (Skull Candy, I'm looking at you). But for me, none came close to fitting as well as these Philips.I also appreciate that these are not an in-ear design, so you can still hear approaching cars and other things you might not want to miss while running.In short, these are cheap, comfortable headphones that provide decent sound. I'd choose something nicer for just sitting around and listening to music, but for running, I wouldn't consider anything else.

p1138
sg5
VI have left a review for these before but I feel the need to do so again. I do not remember the first year I bought these but I want to say 2006. I have not found a better sport earphone since. The most expensive I have bought were Bose and everything in-between. Maybe Bose were all-around better sound quality(maybe) but these get way louder and have way more bass. Now, I am no child but I need loud music when I am working out and out of motivation. I am military and have used these in every climate imaginable  and have used them in thousands of workouts. I would say possibly closer to 5 or 10,000. I have only had sweat drown out the sound a couple times. I buy probably 2 pairs per year due to lost/breaking/stolen etc. I promise that if I found a pair that sounded much better than these for under, let's say, 300.00 I would buy them in a heartbeat. I never have found better. I feel like people say things like,"these sound great for the price" because?.....they think they are supposed to? They sound great! Period! You reviewers are so darn weird. OK, we get it! They do not fit in smaller ears! OK, the rubber comes off some times and you can lose it. Got it! They cost 10.00! I glued mine anyway. I am not saying you will love these like I have. What I am saying is I have found this product to be so great over the years that I feel obligated to say this. A high quality item and a crazy low price. I would pay over 100.00 for these. You reviewers make me question reviews in general because I wonder if they were a hundred bucks if you would say something like, " worth every penny! Sound quality second to none!!!" Sheesh, for the price they are a crazy steal.

VThe only earbuds I can comfortably wear
p1150
sg5
VI have a problem with earbuds. I can't wear them. My ears simply aren't designed for them. I've tried the standard ones that come with the iPod, and they fall out. I've tried the $50 in-ear Apple earbuds, and no matter how carefully I position them in there, they eventually fall out. I found a pair of these Philips headphones at Target one day, and the over-the-ear design seemed like a pretty good solution. I took the $10 gamble, and I was really surprised by how well they worked for me. I can run on the treadmill with these, and they stay put. On top of that, they're very light and comfortable. I wear these at work almost all day with no discomfort whatsoever. In terms of sound quality, these are obviously far from audiophile quality, but they perform well enough for me in medium-noise environments such as the office or the gym.My only complaint is that these aren't the most durable headphones on the market, as I just bought my third pair. In my experience, after about a year of use, one of the channels will inevitably give out. But honestly, for $10, a year of use isn't too bad if you ask me. I recently had to replace my old pair, and I couldn't find these at my trusty ol' Target. In a pinch, I just bought another over-the-ear set by Magnavox for the same price, and they were awful. They didn't fit my ears at all, they were uncomfortable, and the sound quality was noticeably worse than my old pair. I was relieved to see that Amazon stocks these, and I'm happy to have 'em back. Judging by the mixed reviews, I suppose your mileage may vary, as everyone's ears are a little different. However, these are the only earbuds that work for me.

p1156
sg5
VI listen to music and books on my iphone all the time.  At the gym, running, in the car, outside doing yard work, rocking the baby to sleep, even going to sleep at night when I don't want to disturb my wife.  I've owned numerous sets of these phillips earhook headphones over the years and love them.  I just bought three more.I'm sure these are not the most high end audio experience, but that's just not what I'm after.  I use the heck out of these headphones, and I know that sooner or later I'm going to break them or they're going to get just too dirty or whatever.  Fine.  For eight or nine dollars, these guys are exactly what I need.  I've used more expensive products from Skull Candy and Sony, but I didn't see anything different to warrant being twice as expensive and I didn't like the fit as well.I REALLY like the over the ear piece.  Its very unobtrusive and keeps the buds in place great.  Keeps everything out of my way no matter what I am doing.  I've never liked ear buds without the hook to hold in place, just find them very uncomfortable.  These are especially great at the gym or running when you really don't want your headphone suddenly slipping out.My only small criticism of these is that sooner or later the rubber ring around the speaker will come off.  It just will.  As long as you've noticed the tiny piece has come off, you can just slip it back on.  I will say that the last two pairs I owned held the rubber ring in place for quite a while, so I can't complain.I'm an adult male, don't have especially big ears.  My wife wears these too and likes them.UPDATEI just had to update this review.  I've been testing another brand of very high end, over the ear, similar ear buds lately.  I'm sure the price of those is about five teams what these cost.  I'm just completely blown away that given the choice I would still purchase THIS set of headphones.

VThis is my 4th or 5th pair of these headphones in about as many years.  Yes, I've run through them (and several competitors), but I keep coming back to these Phillips ones for a few reasons.First, they are cheap!  I use my headphones in all weather outside, when working out, and sitting in the office.  I'm not nice to them either; they get stuffed in my bag with whatever else I cram in there, stored in small pockets, left in hot/cold cars, etc.  I'm lucky to have regular headphones last more than 8 months, and these last me 6-8 typically.  Inevitably, one of the rubber protectors around the earphone screen will fall off, then the screen falls off shortly after.  I'll wait another few weeks and then replace them, but I don't care because at $10-15, they are trivial to replace.Second, they are comfortable.  I've tried hard plastic over-the-ears (looking at you, Sony), ear buds, and other rubber over-the-ears, but these are the best for all-around use.  I can wear them for hours in the office without discomfort, but they stay in place easily when jogging.Third, pretty decent sound.  I'm not an audiophile, but I have done informal tests between these and my $300 Bose Noise Cancelers in quiet rooms.  Obviously the Bose are better, but these preserve all the elements of the sounds I care about.  I can rock out, listen to spoken-word podcasts, and relax to mellow mood music without noticing any missing sounds.If you're looking for everyday headphones for work and play, you could pay ten times more, but you won't get ten times the utility.  Will buy again.

VWell have you bought a pair yet? If not then why not? They are cheap. I bought these at my local walmart on a whim when I wanted some headphones for laptop/iPod/school computers. I saw they had hooks and said to myself, "They are $10 bucks if I don't like them I can always return them." I like them better than buds of any kind with no hooks and possibly more than conventional over-ear/head headphones as far as fit. They WILL get uncomfortable after a while of wearing them. The diameter of the speaker is good for fit but it will be uncomfortable when it is securely inside your ear canal after a period of time. If you don't take thirty seconds to situate them properly they are bound to fall off; however they will stay put if you do take the miniscule time to adjust them to your ear. Anecdotal Evidence of quality:  I took a nasty spill while riding a skateboard with these in my front most pouch of my backpack which afterwards is tattered severely, all things considered, and these took some abuse too. The cord in several places looks like something chewed on them or possibly like I took sandpaper to them. There is even some copper braid (1mm<=) exposed from the 'sanding'. They sound the same as when I bought them .  These would get five stars if they didn't have any cons, but they do and no matter how small they are that means even for $10 you don't get a perfect score. Four stars equates to a rating of 'I like it' that fits my sentiments exactly because five means 'I love it' and I don't love them (nor any inanimate objects ;P) To sum up for the  price they are fantastic.

VAll the rage now is earbuds that are "inner ear" with rubber plugs and noise isolating. Yes, thats fine at home. But what about when you are out somewhere? Out in the world, you need a little sourrounding background noise so you dont get run over by a Prius. Also, probably more importantly, lots of people still don't like the inner ear earbuds because they dont like shoving things inside their head. And, the few "speaker type" earphones that remain are of increasingly less quality. Enter, the Philips Flexible Earhook. Yes, the earhook is quite flexible. Should fit most size ears unless you play for the NBA or are otherwise a mutant. In other words, they stay where you put them. They dont fall off. And they are simply speakers that sit in your ears, not your inner ear. Thats what some people like. Also, the wires run from the front (near the speaker), notthe back of the earhook, so wires are just as easy to manage as a normal earbud. But the real reason these are winners? THE SOUND. You will not, and I have looked, find a speaker type compact earphone anywhere else in this price range that will not only match, but EXCEED the sound quality of an inner-ear earbud. Simple, sturdy, thoughtfully designed, able to hear ambient noise out in the world, black in color so I dont actually look like one of "those people" who walk around in their own little earbud world, and THE SOUND. Oh, and did I mention THE SOUND? Look to your right on the screen, and see the little yellow box that says "Add to Cart"? Click it. Now. Twice.

VI had some Skull Candy's of a similar style that I got caught on a fence and destroyed while doing yard work. I decided to buy a new pair, but Amazon did not sell the ones I wrecked. So I reached on these given they were a decent price and they had the over-the-ear hooks I like to use while running and doing yard work (I'm much more careful now...)The sound is good, not great. I can hear my music, have decent base response, and volume is never too loud or too quiet.  Actually, the seem to rest just outside the ear a tad which makes them pretty good for running as you can hear outside noise (like cars and others on the bike trails) without it being too interfering with your music. I have been caught in the rain and I sweat when running and the earbuds seem to hold up really well to moisture.They are a tad stiff, unlike the skull candy pair I had before. They can get a little uncomfortable after a long time.  Sounds nit-picky, but when you have been running for an hour, sometimes that becomes important.  If they had a little more comfort, I would have given them five stars. They also have very little room to adjust them, which means they will pretty much only sit in one spot and cannot mold well to your ear shape (probably why they cause slight discomfort after prolonged use).I really cannot complain.  They have lasted for a few months and many miles.  I also have not lost them to a bad yard-work accident like the last pair.  I'd buy them again, if I could not fund the Skull Candy pair I had before.

VI got these headphones before about 3 years ago and decided to buy them again to replace my old ones. They are my favorite! Small enough to fit in the cradle of the ear but with the loops around the outside of the ears, it keeps the little speakers from falling out(the reason why I hate those tiny speaker inserts that just sit in the cradle of your ears). They're flexible enough that they don't "cage" your ears and yet firm enough that they keep the speakers in place.Caution: do not take them apart! That's what happened to me and why I had to buy a replacement after 3 years. I clean my ears regularly but still, the speakers developed a small collection of ear wax under the plastic ring and under the edge of the layered mechanics of the speakers. Being slightly OCD and wishing to clean them, I lifted the layers of the speakers on the right side to get the small layer of gunk from between the mechanics. When I lifted it too much, it came off. The speaker wires were still connected so, I thought it would be okay. No go. Once I placed it back in its cradle and put the plastic ring back over it, the sound was completely lost from that side of the speakers. They didn't need to be cleaned as the gunk was simply unsightly and not affecting the mechanism any since they worked fine. I was just being stupid and overly finicky. Lesson learned. So long as you don't take it apart, this product works very well and probably would have continued to serve me for a couple more years at the very least!

VI notice that almost all the 1-star reviews for the Philips earhook headphones note that they are not for people with small ears. So, if you have small ears, now you know.I tried out many different headphones before I found these. For me, they are near perfect, and therefore they are the only ones I use. I have probably gone through eight pairs of them since I first discovered them about a decade ago.On the other hand, my son tried them once and didn't like them. I gave him a pair of similar-looking Sony's that I had bought when the store was out of the Philips model. I didn't like the Sony's; he loved them. He didn't like the Philips; they are the ONLY headphones I like.So, why just 4 stars? Well, you may have noticed that I said I've gone through nearly a pair every year. That is because these headphones will INEVITABLY break, sooner rather than later. The irritating thing is that you know it is just some tiny (and overly fragile) wire somewhere inside it that has broken. If I could tear them apart and solder the little wire, the rest of the set is still perfect... But no, the whole thing has to be tossed, and I'm off to order a new set. (Or rather, two sets -- I buy two at a time, because I know they'll break.) Planned obsolescence? At less than $10 a set, I can only suppose that's the answer. But, other than wearing out far sooner than they should, these are great -- for me, that is, and I suppose for anyone whose ears are the same size as mine.

VI managed to get these for $4. Packaging was damaged, but the headphones were fine. Instructions included.These get a 5 star max for many reasons. Great sound. They stay on, during a rigorous workout, including runninng, weights,cardio, cycling, etc for an hour at least. They don't stay dirty either.I wear these at work listening to my iPod, before the store opens. I left them in my work pants (cargo pocket) and did laundry tonight. They went through the washer and dryer (dryer for 45 minutes). Clothes were completely dry. I remembered I left them in the pocket. There is NO damage to them and they work GREAT. No diminshed sound quality. My fault for not checking all my pockets, but they stood to the test. Sometimes getting a product for much cheaper can yeild great results.08/13/2013For a cheap pair of over-the-ear headphones these work. My last pair finally wore out after over a year of hard use. Rain, workouts, being sat on, and stepped on. Why am I ordering another pair? For running and working out, they stay on because they GRIP better. This will be the fourth pair I've had and I've paid less than $7 for each. I bought my first pair back in 2008. Will I ever buy a $300 pair? No. A pair for $10 that lasts around a year to 1 1/2 years? I do not plan on washing and drying another pair to see if it they will stand up to them again. It could've been luck or they are that good. I don't know.

VI wanted a pair of earbuds with the behind-the-ear hook on them because for some reason every set of earbuds I've ever tried always flops out of my ears after a few minutes on their own, or immediately if the cord gets tugged at all. Maybe because my ears are always a little oily on the inside and kind of shallow? I'm not sure why it happened, but I thought buying these would fix it.Sadly, this was not the case. I was expecting the earhook to be at least a little flexible, but it's almost like a really stiff rubber or plastic -- it doesn't bend at all. Also, the hook is too long or tall, because if I set the earbud part in my ears, the hook sits way above the shell of my ear and almost is big enough to slide out over it, and furthermore, the buds themselves are very big and oddly-angled so that they practically stabbed me in the ear. At least the Apple earbuds I have don't stab me! I don't have tiny ears, either -- they're about 2.5" from the tip of the lobe to the tallest part of the pinna.I can't comment on the sound quality or the durability, since I didn't even use them once -- they were too painful.I think I would need a set of earbuds that have very flexible, almost custom-moldable hooks, I think, for them to feel secure. I would not recommend to many people that you buy such a personal, fit-centric piece of electronics over the internet unless you have worn them before and know that they work for you!

VI've had two pairs of these headphones and both have been fairly sturdy and very useful. They will hang around most people's ears just fine and stay in fairly well after a few weeks of use. One of the main reasons I got these is for running and biking. Biking and similar sports they work fine for, but don't get these for running because they will fall out. They don't, however, fall out of your ears during simple, around the house, use. If you lay down on the couch or on your bed they stay in, as opposed to standard earbuds.The sound quality is fairly good, as earbuds go. They're by no outrageous stretch anywhere near audiophile level, of course, but they aren't marketed as so. The only thing two things I have to complain about here is that the drivers will get clogged with earwax after about a year or so, which for most people won't be a problem because I  had used them ALOT; and that the lows are not very well defined.As for the build of these, they are very sturdy. Rubberized plastics for the majority of the 'phones. The wires are fairly sturdy and it took me about 2 years to need a re-wiring job on my first pair. If you are wondering, no, these are NOT good for re-wiring. The wires are horribly small and frail, and unless you want to break in to the drivers and solder them on directly, it's better to just buy a new pair.Over all these are some pretty good earbuds.Sound: 4/5Build: 5/5Price/Value: 5/5

VI used to buy these as my preferred headphones, often in a pinch they were available at Walgreens, so I was happy to have a familiar everyday headphone pair.  That was maybe 5 or 6 years ago...  I was needing new headphones and could not decide on several pairs, so I bought these thinking I would at least have an old favorite while I tested the market options... ugh...They used to be a lot better.  The ear band is not made of the same material and I find it stiff and uncomfortable in comparison.  The wire is much thinner and not covered in the same material.  I think maybe this is to prevent the weird "rub" sounds, I don't know, but the cord is unacceptably thin.I thought that the ear band used to have a slight ability to rotate to adjust to different ears, and these do not seem to do that anymore.  Maybe I am mistaken, but I thought these used to do that.I know I should not expect amazing things for 10 dollars these days, but these are just going in my drawer with my other backup headphones and I am back looking for a new favorite.I will not be looking at these again, which is really a bummer to me, after using them for many years.  At least I have kids who always seem to break theirs, so it isn't a total waste.If you are not very active, the thin wires may not be an issue, but I feel that one snag would kill these.

VEarphones for Running and Exercise
p1297
sg5
VI just ordered my second pair. After three years, one of the channels went out and I'm okay with that considering the abuse they took.If you do not need for running, just for weight training, higher quality sounding earbuds may be a better solution. I am not about to buy two sets of earphones for exercising - one pair for running and another for the gym. But if you are, these could meet your running needs.The sound quality is pretty darn good especially at this price point. I have tried earphones costing up to $40 that don't sound as good. But if that is a high priority, look elsewhere. This is important to me, but needed to be balanced with other features.I never have to readjust them while running or any type of exercise. They are very comfortable with a flexible soft rubber ear hook. Your ears won't get tired or bothered inside or out even after an hour or more. They don't look stupid. You know which ones I am referring to. The cord length is long enough to have mp3 player in my pant pocket. This may be a disadvantage especially if you are one of those iPod on the arm types - too much cord. Another reviewer mentioned the cord getting tangled. Unless you hang them on a hook, don't they all?I don't think these are even classified as sport headphones being sweat proof and all, but as I mentioned they lasted three years.

VI bought these because they were the cheapest ear hooks on Amazon at the time. I buy several pair at a time when I do buy them because I am not gentile on them at all. The majority of the time I listen to audiobooks which do not require a lot of dynamic range in the sound quality. Usually, I buy the cheap plastic sony ear hooks but these were cheaper at the time and since I was just going for cheap I bought these as they were 8 and the sony were 10 at the time. Anyway, point being, these cheap little ear hooks have fantastic sound for such little and in expensive things but let me go on.1. The ear hooks are rubber and comfortable enough to fit around my giant gigantic man ears but small enough to fit around my wife's quite dainty tiny ears without me even feeling them even on long use. (also, the cheapie sony ear hooks wont fit her ears because they are just too big, they fall off when she runs.)2. Quite incredible sound. I mean don't get me wrong they aren't my studio headphones but they sound better then every other low cost ear hooks on the market and I can say that with full confidence. Also, I have found myself actually listening to music instead of my audiobooks because it just sounds so good.3. In summary, these are quite honestly the best and I mean the best low cost ear hooks you can buy.

p1315
sg5
VI've owned a pair of standard Apple earbuds that were durable and traveled well but terribly uncomfortable, and a pair of cheap Sony hook-over-the-ear padded earphones that were very easy to wear but too bulky to tuck in a pocket and shredded by heavy use all too fast. Having earphones that combined the worst aspects of both was a 'convenience' I could've done without.If you have oddly-sized ears or an ear canal that doesn't do well with standard earbuds, you're SOL. These HURT if you wear them too long. I also couldn't make any sudden movements while wearing these because the earbud part would pop out, leaving them dangling uselessly over my ear. Even if I was holding quite still, the distance between top of the ear and the canal wasn't quite right, so they'd sort of gently wiggle free after a while anyway. In addition, the damn things hurt. The pair I got from my grandmother (same brand/shape/size) had tiny little rubber covers that helped the ache of having hard plastic shoved against soft cartilage, at least a little, but the rubber tended to catch on things and pop off into dark corners.When they were in my ears, though, the sound seemed fine, and they played well with a couple different brands of phone and computer. They were just too much of a headache to bother with for long, in more ways than one.

VI ordered these almost exactly a year ago and they are completely dead as of today. I use them 3-4x/week for running. The cord is typically partially wound up in the stap on my armband and my kids think that whole combo is fun to drag around the house. All in all, it's probably a miracle they held up as long as they have at this price.The last few weeks, sometimes I'd start my running app and get no sound. I thought the app was being crazy but the second time I'd start it, they'd work. But nope, today I realized it was the headphones. Boo!I've used the left side almost exclusively (for safety) and tucked the right one under my bra strap so it's not flying around everywhere. I had intermittent issues with the rubber rings popping off (and one has completely disappeared) but I think I can probably blame my kids for that too.I found these to be incredibly comfortable. I always wear a bandanna head-band style so I've never relied on the ear clips alone to keep them in place. Even so, I can tell you that now that I'm back to using the standard Apple ear-buds for the moment, those clips make a huge difference in keeping your sound where you want them.I'm not some huge audiophile so I can't say much about the sound quality. They're good enough for what I need during running.

VI Like These Headphones
p1338
sg5
VI like these headphones better than any other pair that I have ever owned. In fact, I would like to say that I love these headphones, but I think the word, "love" might be a bit much. I would like to say, however, that I have owned multiple pair of headphones including the type that hang on the ear but all but this pair were awkward and inflexible.Usually the headphones that I bought in the past would work pretty good for a few weeks, then one side would fail and I would be left with hearing stereo sound in only one ear. This was not good. I would, again, order a new pair with similar results. Furthermore, most of the headphones that I purchased did not have good sound. These headphones, on the other hand, have surprisingly good stereo sound; clear and crisp sound.Plus, I have owned these headphones several months now and both sides still work and the sound is as high quality as ever. I appreciate other aspects as well. First, they fit comfortably in my ears and are not bulky like the previous pair that I have had to put away. Finally, and to me this is important, the hook part of the headphones are flexible, they are so that if you move suddenly they won't hurt your ears. These are by far the best pair that I have bought for a decent price and I am very happy with them.

VI'm not the biggest fan of in-ear head phones because they tend to start to hurt my ears after wearing them for a length of time or if I keep putting and pulling them out my ear. It could be becaue of my small ears I duno.. So why did I get these then? Well for one it's the price (I didn't see spending more than this on a pair of headphones that I'm only wearing for 2 hours max each day) and because of the ear hook feature so that once it starts to hurt I just keep it hooked onto my ear and just let the music play...Pros:-I needed a pair f headphones that I could use on my way to classes.-If I just want to listen to music in one ear i just hook the other ear piece onto my shirt so that's it's not dangling all over the place while I'm walking.-If I'm listening to music in one ear and that ear starts to hurt I can just switch ears.-good quality sound- pretty much surround sound. I don't listen to loud music so I haven't tested out the FULL volume feature.Cons:-If I'm listening to music and I put my phone into my winter coat something happens where static goes up to the ear pieces and starts to crackle in my ears which freaks me out and I have to pull it out.-the comfort- it was expected anyway because all in-ear headphones hurt my ears.

VProvide a shocking boost to wake you right up!

VThese headphones have lasted quite a while. Once in a while they'll fall apart, but they're very easy to slip right back into place, however, I've always noticed that they'll shock me. Without fail, if I am plugged into something that is supposed to be grounded, such as a computer, or a treadmill with headphone jacks, these will shock me. This is absolutely awful when you're running on the treadmill and gives you a big enough jump to scare you so much that you almost fall off of a treadmill. It's loud and painful when it happens. It never happens with things that aren't plugged in though. My iPod works just fine with these. The sound isn't bad at all, especially not at this price. They fit on my ears nicely as well. Unfortunately the shock is enough to bump the score way down for me. I realize that these aren't for exercising, so that was going to just knock it down to three stars, but I was just sitting here listening to music on Youtube through my computer's headphone jack, and I got that shock! So, we've learned two lessons here:1. Don't use these for a computer/treadmill/anything plugged into an outlet, unless you want a boost that'll shake you right up in the morning.2. Don't sweat on these; it doesn't say that they are sweat-resistant for a reason. Don't expect them to be!

VI'm a funkjazz, old school hip hop, r&b;, old school r&b; lover! I first bought these head phones only because the had earhooks made together with the ear plugs. You know simple grip grab'n go design. I also had stepped up my mp3 from a philips to a sansa. WoW these little babies rock! I'm on my 2nd pair in two years. They are one of the best pair of headphones i've ever owned. Cant believe they are so inexpensive! The only thing is that i wish they were little more durable! I mean they could use some cement glue to make sure the speakers dont come out of the mount. But in all honesty i tuck them in my shirt pocket along with my 4gig mp3 in the morning when i walk to my 18wheeler. So i might be a little ruffer than most on them. When i'm driving in my rig i can listen to my music play list of funkjazz 60 songs straight! They are comfortable and the speakers catch all of the notes in the songs. I'm listening to MAGIC MIKE's GETTING OFF as i'm writing this piece. Funky...funky...funky! Any old school cats who know that MAGIC MIKE's bass notes are not for the faint of heart. I can go from BONEY JAMES to MICHEL FRANKS to NORMAN BROWN to TUPAC to TROUBLE FUNK to THE ROOTS to THE SPINNERS to SMOKEY ROBINSON to MARVIN GAY to GOSPEL and these headphones never let me down!

VBeen using these for years and years, comfortable and secure fit for work or exercise, especially for larger ears.Best sound I've found for any pair under $10. Not noise cancelling, since they sit outside the ear and not in, but they're still more than loud enough, and you wouldn't want them to be anyway if you're listening while at work or jogging along the road. This outside the ear fit is also more comfortable in my opinion, and certainly requires much less cleaning.The one drawback to these headphones is their durability, or lack there of. Granted I am quite hard on mine, storing them in my pocket while I carry heavy boxes against my leg, and subjecting them far too often to music above the approved decibel level. Their average life span for me is only about 4 months before one ear would crackle or short out.This was once no problem at all, since they were only $4.80 on Amazon for the longest time, and I could just order a few pairs at a time and have one ready to take over. However the price appears to have inflated to $9 the last couple pairs I've bought, which is the reason I've brought it down to 4 stars.These are still great earphones, you just have to pay a bit more for beating them up than you once did.

Vfor 13 years ive used only one pair of head phones for my music and they suited me well.  the sony mdr-e828.  my last pair finally bit the dust.  and so i decided it was time to get a new set unfortunately they no longer sell the model i like  so after trying a few other sony models and being disappointing in the quality  (either tinny or muffled)  and felt like they would break if you looked at them wrong.  after being disappointing by quality in stead of buying another and guessing if it was good.  (im very picky with sound)  i went out and bought 12 sets of different branded ear buds to compare myself. cause its so much easier to chose by actually  comparing them then reading reviews on the net lol.after trying many diffrent types: ifrog, gumy, skull candy maxwell sony, philips, this one is my favorite  it has clear mids, sharp highs, and very good bass considering its not an isloating earbud. (they often lack bass)  ive heard there not comfortable to were for awile but i had no issue  i guess it depends on the ear size. but if you are looking for quality sound at a cheap price these are for you.like i said im very picky so trust me on this one :P  btw if you are looking for heavy bass isolating earbuds try out skull candy inked.

VI've used these extensively for a couple of years now. I had a physically demanding job that required a lot of movement and they never once came out. For me, they're completely comfortable. I don't have tiny ears like some of the reviewers who for some reason, gave a low star rating. It's not as though Philips designed your ear canal...just the headphones and that is after all, what we're reviewing right? Moving on -The best thing about these is the bass response. It's got a strong and solid presence without being overpowering at all. I took it for granted after buying other, more expensive earbuds that completely lack the bottom end that these have. I always come back to the SHS3200's. I would say the higher frequencies could be a little more forward. Other than that, the overall balance and sound quality is amazing.Surprisingly, very durable. I've caught wires while working (before I smartened up and ran the wires under my shirt)and had them yanked out a few times. Wadded them up in my pocket like $10 headphones should be, I've never experienced any crackling on the part of the ear buds. Maybe not on par with audiophile gear but who expects that? Assuming you have a normal human ear size, you'll be surprised at the punch they pack.

p1413
sg5
VBy no means am I a sound connoisseur, so these seem pretty good to me. They are comfortable. They stay securely in place. They don't seem to drain the battery like some cheap ones I've used before, and they allow enough background noise to come in around them so I'm not cut-off from the world around me.Before you use them for the first time, I strongly recommend you push the little black rubbery ear gaskets that are around the mesh screen back, put a very tiny line of super glue all around the edge, and push them back into place. And for pity sake - let the glue dry well before you use them. Left on their own, the gaskets will fall off, and believe me - without them, the headphones are VERY uncomfortable. Check them often and re-glue as needed.Unlike many other cheap headphones, so far the wires inside the cord have never broken - both sides continue to work...right up until I inevitably lose one of the stupid rubber gaskets....and sometimes the mesh screen. Don't ask. I am a hard tester. If your product can survive me, your product can make it anywhere.Unless you're 8-feet tall, the cords are plenty long enough to keep your mp3 player in your pants pocket without jerking on the cord while jogging -or whatever.

VI've been using these headphones while working out and running for the past 3 years. They wear out after about 6-9 months depending on how much use they get and how much sweat and abuse they have to endure. They only come in one size and that one size happens to fit my ears perfectly. They are clearly marked L and R and they clip on easily and securely. Apparently the one size didn't work out well for my wife who couldn't get one of them to stay on her ear. Her ears have a different shape than mine and for whatever reason the plastic earhook wasn't flexible enough to work for her.I have no complaints about the sound quality, but if you're in a gym or running on a street you shouldn't be worried about achieving optimum sound quality - save that for the Bose comfort headphones. My only complaint is that after a little while the cord tends to get all twisted/tangled and annoying to deal with. I always tuck it under my shirt and through my sleeve to my armband IPod case, but the part of the cord that sticks out from neck can be annoying.Overall if you're looking for something functional and secure for running and working out you can't do better than these headphones for less than $10.

VI bought these several months ago because the standard iPhone earbuds were just to small to stay put in my ear while working out at the gym. They would always find a way to work themselves loose and out of my ear. These headphones from philips did a great job of staying put. I never had them pop out on me. The earhook and large earbud stays right where you put them. They are not the most comfortable earbuds though. They have no padding but are made of a softer texture of rubber. After working out with them on 5 days a week for a month or two, the rubber hardened up and became uncomfortable. Probably from all the sweat they were exposed to. Eventually after 3 or 4 months of near every day usage at the gym the earbuds rubber seal actually dissolved to the point where rust colored metal was leaking out of the sides. I threw them away at this point.All in all, they fit a lot better than the iPhone earbuds and more importantly they stayed in place when doing vigorous running. The sound was only so-so quality wise, but the loudness was good. I was able to drown out the other machines and sounds at the gym. They put up with quite a beating. For the price they are at, they are a good value for basic gym headphones.

VI, like most of you, have tried the super cheap and the expensive and all of them have their drawbacks. And then there is anatomy. What fits my ears might not fit yours. And then there is sound. We want them to sound good, but really, how good can we expect a $7 earbud to sound compared with a $100 set of or Sennheiser  headphones? And then we sweat. Yes, when we sweat the earbuds tend to fall out. Imagine that. Why can't someone design a $7 earbud that sounds like Bose enclosed headphones, fits all ear sizes comfortably and will stay firmly in place during a hurricane, a parachute jump, or while running a marathon? They must not be trying. But. Until someone designs that perfect earbud, i have found these to work just fine. They are more than adequate, in a world where adequacy approaches can be elusive. I own several pair, and have purchased several as gifts and the recipients have all told me how well they work, compared with others they have tried. So, hats off to Phillips. These are for the gym, on the treadmill, for podcast and Pandora perusal. They are not reference phones for the recording studio. These are killer buds for seven bucks. You get what you pay for, and here, you get a lot for seven bucks.

I prefer black over white. Especially with my BLACK ipod i don't know who decided to put white headphones with a black ipod classic ugh...i think the sound is louderear hooks are comfortable and stay on. However they are a little bit exaggeratedlooks harder to break. by it's plug there's plastic instead of the rubber that rips from the original ipod headphonesIpod headphones (that comes with Ipod)they are easier to wear, it takes an extra moment or two to wear the philips headphonesboth of them hurt your ears a little after using them for some time. I am using the philips headphones right now my ears hurt a little i wore them for a couple hours...oh and the best part is that they are cheaper XD for real you would be a fool to pay more for headphones when you could get this quality at such a good bargain (yes im advertising so what)

VI've ordered this product probably about four or five times in the past couple of years. They can and are able to last for years if you're careful. The first one I ordered only one side broke after months and months of heavy use (I listen to music a lot!). Since only hearing one side is awful, I ordered them again. That broke after a year and a half. Now I am using the one I ordered a month or two ago and they're still going strong. The other two I ordered was for my brothers because they saw mine and noticed I had them for a while, while the ones they get at the store cost more and don't last as long. This product is also nice because they stay secured on your ears because of the hook design. It's comfortable enough for earphones, no complaints there. Not the best sound quality but it's clear enough and packs enough bass for me (keep in mind, these are not headphones and they are a great price for what you get.) So, if you're looking for high quality earphones to use in the studio or you're really trying to hear all the highs and lows of every song, this pair isn't for you. But, if you're normal an just want a good pair of earphones that'll last you awhile and still have good quality sound, order up!

VI bought these headphones about 4 months ago and the first few times I used them they were great.  Admittedly they did hurt my ears on my first run, but I put soft foam covers on them from another set of headphones (these don;t come with them) the next time and they were fine.  So I continued using them for the next few months and then started having a problem with the sound getting scratchy and cutting in and out.  I had a case on my phone, so I took that off, and that seemed to help for a while.  Not long after that the sound cut out completely on the right side, i made sure there were no kinks any where, and there weren't, so this was irritating, but I let it go hoping that the next time I used them they would be ok; they weren't.  On my next run, I got about half way through and the sound cut completely out on both sides.  It was really scratchy for half the run and was cutting in and out, and finally they cut completely out.  I'm sorry but headphones should not die that fast.  In my opinion these are terrible and I would not recommend them to anyone.  Just today I'm buying the Panasonic RP-HS33-G In-Ear Water-Resistant Sport-Clip Earbud Headphones, so hopefully these will be better quality!

VThese headphones sound very clear, seem to have reasonably efficient drivers and give a relaxed listening experience. Comfort will no doubt differ from user to user, but, I've found these to be perfectly comfortable for 30-60 minute walks and runs.They do not seem to fit properly when first fitted, but once you realise that each speaker just sits against the outside of your ear canal rather than being inserted inside the ear as with regular ear-buds, you quickly get over that.The cord is long enough to use whilst my phone is in my front trouser pocket, but I think it could be a little longer to be really versatile. This won't be a problem for many people though).The only way I've been able to induce fitting discomfort was wearing these headphones underneath protective ear protectors when mowing the lawns. The over ear hooks were pushed into my ears by the hearing protectors and that was a tad uncomfortable. That is not a design fault however as these are not designed to have another headset sitting over them. I was happy to put up with the minor discomfort to enjoy music while mowing the lawns anyway.Great product and excellent value for money.

VI'll present this as a comparison with the Sony MDR-J10 phones: Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Black).  I own both; the two designs are superficially similar, but somewhat different in use.The main advantage of the Sony phones is that they are simply easier to put on.  You slide them over the top of your ears, and they fall into place naturally.  These Philips phones take just a little more effort.  I find I have to wrap them around from behind, pop the speaker part into the ear canal, then rotate them back slightly (clockwise for the left ear, counterclockwise for the right) to get them securely in place.  And then they really are secure; no amount of head movement will dislodge them.After that, the advantage is all Philips.  The plastic used is softer and more comfortable than Sony's, and the sound rivals that of more expensive old-fashioned studio "can" headphones -- without messing up your hair.  So although I often use the Sony pair with an MP3 player when I'm out and on the go, the Philips headphones are the preferred choice at my work desk, delivering background tunes for hours on end in a pleasant and non-fatiguing way.

VI had been having issues with ear buds that kept popping out while I was jogging.  I decided to get this pair with the hopes that the ear-hook design would help keep these in place.  They do in fact do the job very well, and don't slip out as easily as the factory-included Mac headphones I previously used.  The sound is very good, and the fit is very comfortable.  A small gripe is that, sometimes they can get in the way of sunglasses if you are planning on wearing them while running.  It's not too bad, but they can sometimes cause them to get a little dislodged.  And if you have to re-adjust them onto your ear, it is pretty much a two-handed task.  Thus, it could slow down your pace for a second or two.  Again, not a big deal at all, but just something to be aware of.  At this price ($7.30 at time of purchase), it's a great value from Amazon, especially since they are usually around $10 or more at any retail store.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste time and money on headphones from the dollar store.  They may be cheaper, but the sound quality and durability will not be worthwhile.  Spend a little more here, and get a high quality item.  Highly recommend purchase!

VI am so glad to see these earhook earphones are still on the market. I bought my first pair a few years ago. I use them while jogging. They held up well through perspiration of the hot Florida summers and through the rain. I realized they were finally dying when I got sound only from one ear.  I never had any problems with them coming off. I also didn't pay much attention to how I put them on (ie: I guess I was rough with them) but I also want to say I found these to be the most comfortable of the over the ear phones I've gotten. I used them for an hour almost daily, and I thought the inner buds were probably about the easiest I had used for inside the ear. Especially if you have any Temporomandibular Joint issues, like bruxing, or general TMJ dysfunction. Nothing short of a well-padded bud will make life great for those of us with this problem, but I thought these came about closest. I also think, too, the comfort depends on how big or small your ear is and if you're jogging or walking. I am small framed, so my ears are small. I guess, though, the fit might be uncomfortable on others, as I saw one reviewer say. These were a great value for the price.

p1483
sg5
VI got this set of headphones so that I can listen to music on my smart phone. I've been running for quite a while and I've tried a variety of different headphones looking for the right kind.iPOD style headphones don't work because they fall out, regular ones are too bulky, and the ones that go behind your head won't ever be useful for listening to music anywhere but at the gym.So, I looked at these. I read the complaints and wasn't sure about them - especially the "fit" that so many complained about. But I'm sure glad I got them!They are such a great price for what they are. They fit just fine - just as these kinds of headphones are supposed to. I'm thinking the complaints are on the style (from people not used to this kind) - and shouldn't be attributed to this pair.When I go running, they stay put even if I accidentally yank on the cord while going for my water bottle. The sound is great and I even like the quality/texture of the ear piece.I highly recommend these. Don't worry about the "sizing" - there's a reason there is no size. They will work perfect if you use them correctly and these are what you are looking for.

VDurable and good sounding headphones at a sub-$10 price tag
p1495
sg5
VI've been using a pair of Panasonic SHS3200 earhook headphones for the past several years, primarily during workouts at the gym or while running.  These headphones aren't advertised as being suitable for 'sports', but they've held up to sweat and vibration well.  They are comfortable with no pressure on the ears after several hours of continuous use, and the quality of sound these headphones produce is better (and louder) than a pair of new Sony Sports earhook headphones I recently purchased.  After several years of use, the rubber cradling one of the earbuds has given out causing the earbud speaker to come detached from the earhook.  I think these headphone have exceeded their life expectancy, so I'm not taking away any stars for this.  My only complaint on these headphones would be that the cord is very thin and tangles easily, and the rubber earhooks are too flexible, so you don't get a snug fit, although the headphones have never slipped off during use. My kids are constantly losing or breaking their headphones, so based on my own experience with these headphones, I believe they represent a good choice of replacement headphone.

VI was entirely excited about getting a pair of headphones that would be cheap and perfect for working out and these seemed to fit the bill, but I ran into a couple of vital deal breakers upon my first attempt to workout with these:1. They do not stay behind your ears no matter what. Even when I kept my head perfectly still they would still somehow fall out of my ear and take the entire behind the ear apparatus with them. This may be due to the shape of my ears or my desire to have the headphones actually stay stationary within one place on my ear. Either way, the design did not work for me.2. While running on a treadmill and attempting to re-insert the earpiece that had fallen out of my ear (see #1) I was electrocuted by the headphones. I'm not exactly sure how or why this happened, but I am glad that it didn't cause me some serious bodily injury.  The headphones do not seem to have any loose wires or visual defects and they may still function properly, but I'm not about to put them back into my ears.

p1505

V....somehow I seem to go through 3 or 4 pairs of headphones each year.  I work out and run a lot and I either get a short in one ear or lose them or something.  Out of all the pairs I've owned, these are by far the best.  When i put them on, they immediately felt 100 times more comfortable because of the soft molded plastic rather than the hard plastic that you see a lot of headphones made out of.  The sound is very good too, I thought.  Very full sound and clear as well.  Also on most headphones the two cords (one from each earhook)usually become one at some point and then plug into your ipod or other device.  I never noticed until now, but the point at which the two cords become one determines how many man-hours you spend untangling the freakin' earhooks and cords.  The longer it takes for the two to become one, the longer you spend trying to untangle them.  This set of headphones, the two cords become one maybe 5 or 6 inches down which is perfect.  Very little tangling.  For the quality, price and comfort I don't think these can be beat.  I'll be buying them from now on, unless someone shows me something better.  Good luck.

p1511
sg5
VI'm back, buying a second set, since I use these more often than any of my good quality cupped head-phones. I ride bike as my main mode of transportation and I listen primarily to instructional or meditative audio. I do have a large head and ears, so I can only have sympathy for those who find these too large for comfort and/or fit. As for the fact that they don't have padding, I was prepared for that before I received mine. I really don't like regular ear-buds, because they are not comfortable in my ears and it's also an unstable fit. I do use them occasionally, though, so I had to make sure that I could always replace the foam covers. I found this quantity deal on Amazon.com, 400/$10. You can buy for less, but the per unit cost goes up so much, and it's an item that just needs to be replaced quite often, that I think this quantity pack is the way to go. You'll have enough so that you'll wind up being a hero to all your friends, when you replace their foam for them. I like these ear-hooks and mine are quite comfy with my foam covers.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025KXUS2/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1

VI'm finally buying a different pair of headphones. I had this type of headphone for a while until the rubber came off the ear part and the metal fell off. I really liked these earhooks so I bought it again and now there is the pair I have right now. These were just bad. When listening to songs, movies, tv shows, the talking and singing won't come in. Only the background music or background track can be heard. I have to bend and pinch the cord at the plug in order to hear what is being said or sung. Sometimes pinching won't work and I'll have to wiggle the cord back and forth and then re-pinch the cord above the plug.Since school started back I realized how much I need working headphones since I'm walking to class, jogging, chilling in library/ Starbucks, etc. The pair I had before the ones I have now were great and lasted for 2 years with great care, but the ones now didn't last a week before one ear stopped working, and then only the music would play for both ears, and sometimes only very faintly. I'll just try out a different brand because I feel like this will happen again if I purchase this one.

VI bought a white pair of these at Walmart about two and a half years ago for $10. They are my absolute favorites. The bass is excellent, the mids and highs are crisp, the fit is superb for myself in particular. I'm absolutely buying a second pair from Amazon in the near future as they are now impossible to find in retail stores. If you're looking for good quality, look no further than Philips. The sound quality is AMAZING. The bass from these little 15mm drivers kicks like a 50mm from higher end studio-style headphones.They refuse to quit, I replaced the plug on mine because my cable froze while I was outside on my way to school one New York winter morning and the cable and wires just snapped off; so I sacrificed a pair from the dollar store. They seriously take a beating. I have a homemade powered MP3 speaker that puts out about 1.5 watts rms at 16 Ohms through the headphone jack (about 100 times more than the output rating on these headphones) and they handle it no problem.Simply put, I can't say enough good things about these headphones... seriously, buy them; you won't regret it.

VGood product, it is for big ears.
p1534
sg5
VI noticed several reviews regarding "big ears".  Allow me to clarify: the actual speaker bud that goes into your ear canal is larger than most ear buds.  The clips also seem to have an extended size to them.  I used these today for the first time and they fit amazingly well, but I did notice that they filled my entire ear and put pressure on the inside of the ear, which is what I wanted: larger earbuds.  I initially started looking for these type of clip over the ear headphones because regular earphones tend to fall out of my ear, these would probably stay in even without the hooks.  If you are a small person with small ears, these will probably be uncomfortable for you.The sound quality startled me - I had to turn my device lower than its normal volume because these were producing such powerful sound.  Clearly, they aren't as powerful as some big huge earmuff phones, but they were an upgrade from my previous workout headphones and (in my opinion) have sound quality at least as good as the iPod headphones that come with device.  But the volume is just amazing, everything comes in loud and clear.

VI bought these to use them for long periods of time; to watch movies and to listen to music for hours.The sound quality is exceptionaly great for it's price. The bass is not bad at all, surprisingly.They're also really comfortable for your ears, and they don't fall out easily during heavy movement, like excercise.The problem with them is they get really irritating after an hours use. They start to hurt your ears. It's annoying for me because i wanted to watch long movies with them, but if you just want to enjoy music for not such long periods of time, then this product is suitable for you. The price is also very reasonable. Overall, i'm happy with this purchase and I will continue to use them for music... just not for very long periods of time.Pros:Very durableSuitable for most ear sizes (probably not for really small ears though)Great sound qualityComfortable for your ears for a whileSymmetrical wiring ( that's a personal preference)Reasonable priceCons:Hurts your ears after about 45-60 minutes of use.

p1546

VWhat I hate about these is they tangle by simply looking at them. I still believe their ear-hanging design is an offshoot of some military project aimed to create self-knotting string, because these knot like MAD and CONSTANTLY.Nonetheless, I just bought a second pair, and I'm giving them five stars because:1) For $10 they sound pretty darn good--much better than the similarly-priced Panasonic ones, which have no bass2) I've beaten the snot out of these and they are still going. I'm talking many, many workouts, saturated them in sweat, even been through a bit of rain, but after a drying out they've always continued to work.After a few years my original pair started to split and have bits come up. I epoxied them back--and the earphones are still going.These are not perfect earphones. But for $10 I think they are a sound purchase. I will agree with some of the negative reviewers who say fit is not perfect, and after using for a couple of hours the ears may start to hurt a bit due to the strange angle, but these are excellent for working out.

VI received Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones; I waited a week to test and see how they feel and work.1. These headphones work well, but don't cancel sound since they sit snug at the entrance of your ear canal and they hook over your ear to keep the ear-buds on;  Well, this is a one size fits all hooks and don't adjust to ear sizes, this will make you fidget constantly or hold them for an hour or so when watching a movie, etc.2. They are a hard piece ear-bud that sits at the entrance to your ear canal and is very uncomfortable after a while making the Targus hurt. I only gave them a 3 star for OK. I hope Philips redesign these to make them comfortable for up to 10 hours of wear.3.  The quality is excellent (not cheap) and the sound is crisp.I have a swelling in my left ear canal, so, the ear-bud wont sit snug in my ear canal(keeps falling out).I wish the earhooks were comfortable to wear for watching movies, gaming, listening to audio books, or learning a language so you wont disturb anyone.I will have to search for comfortable headphones.

VThis is the second set of these earphones that I have purchased.  After three years of service. wiring junction at the connector plug end of the cord developed a fault.  Probably due to the fact that I wind the cord tight around my iPod for storage.  Will remember to leave some slack so as not to strain that connection with this pair.  Regardless, at this price, three  years of life is great.  These earphones fit me perfectly.  The earbud itself fits in my ear, and the soft rubber ear hooks fit nicely around my ears.  These earphones really stay in your ear, even during the most active activities such as running and burpees.  The sound quality is more than adequate for a set of earphones at this price.  In fact, because they rest and stay in my ear in just the right position, the sound quality is very satisfactory and consistent.  No need to keep adjusting the earbuds into my ears.For those of you who are looking for a good set of earphones for exercising or any other physical activity, I highly recommend you give these a try.  At $6 per pair you can't go wrong!

VThese are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more.The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long.

VThese are awesome!  I bought them specifically to plug into the GPS on my motorcycle so that I could hear the instructions while riding.  Prior to purchasing these, I bought a pair of earbuds that were twice the price of these Phillips which have rubber around the earbuds so that they sit in your ear canal and block out all ambient noise.  Those were awful, and not to mention unsafe while on the motorcycle because I could not hear anything around me.The look and style of these Phillips Earhook Headphones seemed to be more what I was looking for as they sit on the outside of your ear canal so I can still hear ambient noise.  The price had me a bit worried about quality, but once I received, I was pleasantly surprised. They seem to be very well made, and they sound great - actually better than the pair that I spent twice as much for.  As for comfort, I have absolutely no complaints there either.  They fit perfectly on my ears and don't bother me at all while wearing them for extended periods on time.  I would not hesitate to buy them again!

p1603
sg5
VThis is my 3rd set of these headphones. They are the only headphone design that fits my needs (see "pros"). I am no audiophile, so I can't speak to their sound quality, but I will say that I use these to listen to audio books, and the voices sound rich, not tinny.Pros:- Ear hooks work well. They stay on, even in my sleep all night (on my back - the speaker bit in your ear is uncomfortable when lying on your side, but they stay on!).- The speakers don't go all the way INTO your ear, which means you can still hear some of what is going on around you.- The wires don't transmit the sound made by their of rubbing on clothes into your ears.Cons:- The little soft plastic rings around the speakers fall off easily (usually with only a few weeks of use). The rings conceal some sharp metal edges, so they are VERY necessary. I had to throw away my last two sets because I lost one of the rings. I fixed the problem on my latest set by putting some "super glue" under each ring with a toothpick.

I'm still mystified!  They're not nearly as good!I've tried matching the spec's listed on the box -- no dice.  (Do I not know what I'm looking for?)  Others that seem to have the same frequency/decibel range, or whatever, blah-blah-blah, seem to fall WAY SHORT of getting all the sound out of the disc & into your ears.IN SUM: These things work just like, I don't know, they don't LACK "access" to all the soundwaves coming out of your player.  (Everything else seems, somehow ... "muted," you know?)  I have no idea how Philips did it, but, it feels more like: how hard is it to SCREW UP?  (i.e., "What are they doing RIGHT?")It shouldn't be a big deal -- but it is.BUY THESE!  Hear what your music sounds like.(I can't give a better recommendation than that!)

Vi use to buy these at target for $15, so when i saw that they were only $6 here, i immediately jumped on it!i don't think i have BIG ears, but they seem to fit fine. they at least stay in my ear when i'm running, which is the main reason why i get the "earhook" headphones. and it doesn't leave any bruises or marks (at least i don't think it does).the sound quality is decent. i mainly use them when i workout/run, so sound quality isn't THAT important to me when doing those activities. if i were in the studio making beats or watching a movie, then yea, i'd want much better sound quality, but for what i use these headphones for, they're fine.the only problem is that i've had so many pairs of these because they one side always seems to go out after 3-4 months of use. just out of nowhere, there's no sound coming out of, say the LEFT earpiece. not sure why that happens, but until it does, they sound and fit just fine.BOTTOM LINE: great if you are going to use it for working out or running since they're cheap and they stay in your ear.

The sound was not that great, the hi's and mid's were pretty decentbut there was no bass at all!! Still I wanted to give them a shot so i wore them at the gym the next day.My gym has a wireless receiver that you can plug headphones into to hear the TVs that they have. So Iplugged them in, and as soon as i started running they started static shocking me!! I moved to the next treadmillto see if it was just that receiver that was doing that, but no, they continued shocking my ears.After that I was over them. But they did fit my sister's ears and she seemed to like the sound so at least they didn't go to waste.In Summary: no bass, they static shocked me, uncomfortable, would not fit.

VGood Enough Sound But Bad For Small Ears
p1638
sg5
VFirst time I put these on I knew I was NOT gonna be happy.  I could never get them to fit snug over my small ears.  I went to the gym with them anyway hoping that they would be okay.  On the treadmill, they fall out because of the constant up/down movement when jogging.  Then after I starte to sweat a little, they REALLY would NOT stay on.  I think most of my time on the treadmill was spent trying to get these things to stay rather than focusing on my workout.  On to the stationary bike...  I think I finally go these headphones to barely hang on and they seemed okay on the bike.  Of course, there's not much head movement on a bike either.  I must say, though, that the sound quality was good - not great, but good.  Also, the cord is a little short.  I'm 5'2" tall so the short length works for me but for taller people it might just be an issue.  All in all, I'd say if you're looking to go cheap then buy these headphones. But if you need something to run, walk or jog in then perhaps get a different pair.

VI workout here and there, and I really cannot stand when I'm finally getting into the rhythm of running or even intense walking and my hands just rip my ear buds out of my ears. Not only is is painful and alarming, but it also disrupts the flow of a nice workout. I hate having yet another excuse not to run, so I finally decided to commit to getting better headphones for a better workout. WOW, I just got these in the mail (can I just say how fast I got these after ordering them is a dream? I think it took two, maybe three, days max...2 days faster than estimated!). I tested the sound and the quality is excellent, the volume levels are perfect (I used my old headphones at the same volume as I used these and it was so quiet) and the comfort is perfect as well. Maybe I have big ears (which I sort of do) but they fit my ears just right and it is the right size for my canal. The bass is also wonderful. I know I haven't had them for a period of time but right now everything is exactly what I wanted.

VWhen I first tried to put these in the way they appear they should fit, the earhooks were considerably taller than my ears so the headphones fell out with no prodding.  Perhaps my ears are really small, I'm not sure.  But by rotating them forward so that what seems to be the top of the ear hook now points forward, they fit very securely, and I'm pretty happy with them.  They look a little silly like that, but I'm not really that vain.If you press them all the way in, the hardness of the earpieces tend to cause a little soreness after maybe 15 minutes.  But I've found if I pull them a little bit loose and rely on the earhook to hold them in place more, there is less discomfort.If you're willing to pay more, consider something with a nice pair that have moldable earhooks.  If you want a deal, these are pretty decent, and by rotating them forward, appear to have an element of adjustability for different sized ears, though I'm not 100% sure that was intentional.

VI've been using a single pair of these for over 2 years now.  I run about 900 miles/year and use headphones roughly 50% of the time.  Normal earbuds will not stay put in my ears when running, so I needed this earhook style.  In general, I find these reasonably comfortable and with decent sound quality.  I do not crank the volume when running both to preserve my hearing and to stay aware of traffic, etc.  Most important for my purposes, they stay put and they continue to function despite heavy sweat, rain, snow, etc.My one quibble is that the wire near the plug must come loose every now and then because I will lose sound in one ear.  Usually just wiggling the wire at the plug does the trick and fixes the issue.Pros:  Stays put, very durable, less than $9.Cons:  Wire might be coming loose near the plug.  For the price, though, I can't complain too much.When these go to headphone heaven, I will definitely buy an identical replacement pair.

I'm currently using these for my Roku 2 2013 model and the Philips earphones are slightly better then the purple pare that come with the device, also the hooks prevent them from falling out unlike Roku's included pare that constantly loosen and pop out of ears.

VStay in place on my ears when exercising
p1691
sg5
VI've used my pair of these headphones for 6 years now, for working out, because other headphone styles didn't stay comfortably in my ears or on my head for various reasons.  These don't fall out of my ears easily, or make my head uncomfortable in any way.I wear eyeglasses, and the hooks are soft enough to not conflict with the glasses ear pieces.I thread the cord through the back of my exercise bra and down to my iPod clipped on my shorts/pants, and this keeps the cord from swaying around and pulling at the headphones.  I am 5'5" and the cord has plenty of length for me.The rubbery covering around the actual earbuds are removable, so I am able to clean them regularly with rubbing alcohol.I am not terribly picky about the sound quality in my workout headphones.  I feel there is good sound and all volume levels, it doesn't become tinny or scratchy or dull.  That's good enough for me when I'm exercising!

VThis feels like an "over-the-ear" kind of earphone, where the speakers don't exactly snug inside your ears, so it's hard to tell whether the earphone is securely positioned for my ears. But, that's what i sacrifice in exchange for those "earbuds" just "slipping out" of my ears!!The sound quality, specifically the bass, is superior. Because unlike other earbuds, (i used Skull Candy stuffs) this one has these holes that let the air out. (Similar to how my 200W RMS subwoofer does when producing intense bass)I bought this for cell phone, and that is because this earphone doesn't have those noise-isolating feature, which is great when you want to hear the person on the phone and your surrounding people and environment at the same time.However, one downside is that it can be troublesome to wrap this earphone. There is no pouch or case for this, and wrapping this by itself can make the cable tangle.

p1714
sg5
VI use this pair of earphones about 40% of the time due to it's design that securely fits to my ears, but needs a little tweaking.  The first time I put this to my ears, it hurts after a while and the sound is at the higher frequency; the lower frequency (the bass) is almost missing.  I removed it from my ears, and left it running at a higher volume for most of the day to "break-it-in".  The next thing I did was to tilt the speaker a little at an angle facing upward to lessen the pressures to the opening of my ear-drum,...it worked that way.  Therefore, for those buyers who found these earphones NOT acceptable, do a little tweaking and break it in at first, and you might like these less expensive earphones enjoyable to listen to your favorite music.  And yes...the ear-hook, I found out, can be twisted and stay there at that position without dipping it to boiling water.  Just twist it a little farther than where you want it to stay put.

VThese Hold Up To Excercise
p1720
sg5
VWhile the build quality of these ear phones isn't the best (what do you expect for $6?), they feature excellent sound and hold up well to vigorous exercise. I'm a serious runner, and regularly run at high speed. I sweat a lot, too. So most headphones can't keep up with me. Either the sound is too weak or the buds won't stay in my ears. Believe me, I've tried dozens of sets. But in the last year or two, I've settled on this cheap pair. Nothing seems to get them out of my ear, and the sound is way beyond what you'd expect at this price point. It's loud and clear even when I'm running 8 MPH on a noisy treadmill in a noisy gym.The downside is, they tend to break after six months. And the cord often gets tangled (though this new pair seems better in that respect than the last set I got). For $6, I don't mind if they only last half a year. I even bought two of them this time just so I'd have an extra one when the first one breaks.

VI have never had any luck with the in-ear earbuds, such as the ones that come packaged with any iPhone.  Those earbuds do not "lock" into my ear well enough for me to use them for running or active sports.These earbuds, in my opinion, are perfect for running or just everyday use.  I am on my third pair - only because I wore out the cable by wrapping it up over and over.  I use them ALL THE TIME.  Running, at work, on the commute, whenever.  The price is great, and the ear hook is flexible so it contours to most ear shapes.  The one drawback to these is that the rubber case that molds around the actual speaker can become pliable enough to come off easily in your bag or pocket, and they are not comfortable without that little piece in place.PROSComfortableStay put while runningLow-pricedCONSRubber border on speaker can sometimes come loose, but it easy to pop back on

VI got this headphones specifically for the gym. The in-ear headphones would always get ruined, because I workout for long periods at a time causing me to get sweaty, like any proper workout would, and when the sweat gets into my ears the sweat would then get into the headphones causing them to die. Kind of like water to electronics, it wasn't working out. So I stated looking for a comfortable over the ear headphones that would stay on right while I workout and not go in and plug up my ear so my sweat wouldn't ruin them.Luckily I found these Philips headphones. They are comfortable to wear (sometimes I forget they're on), the cord has a very good length (I keep my phone on the machine while I run), and it is very loud (I can't hear the music on the gym speakers or the people next to me when on full blast). These are pretty durable and at this price I can afford to keep replacing them when they wear out or get lost/stolen.

VI've had a pair of these for a couple years, until finally wearing out. However, they would have lasted longer if I didn't accidentally throw them in the wash in a pair of my pants.These things are INCREDIBLY comfortable. I remember before buying my first pair, I was in school one day when an old friend of mine randomly puts her left "earhook" into my left ear, and I was like, "Wow!". So I then went onto getting my first pair.The only thing to perfect these would be in-line volume control.UPDATE: It's been a few years since I've had these earhook headphones. I just received these pair in the mail a couple days ago. They LOOK exactly like the ones I was used to, however, my ears don't remember them, unfortunately. I thought after the first 15 minutes or so, they would become comfortable again, but I guess my ears have somehow changed, and these earphones don't exactly feel nice after awhile.

VOne of the best purchases I've ever made. I've tried numerous types of earbuds for running and these have been the most durable, reliable, and effective ones yet. They weren't always the most comfortable but I think my ears have finally gotten accustomed to them so there's not much discomfort. These things have been through runs in the rain and tons of sweat - probably about 700 miles so far - and still work as good as the day I bought them (sometimes one side may stop working if it's just totally soaked but it becomes operational again once it dries up a bit, usually before the end of my run). They never fall out unless I accidentally hit them with a towel or something. Finally, you can run much more safely because they're not the in-ear kind, thus allowing you to hear your music while still hearing things like cars coming up from behind, dogs, or other people.For the price, they're the best money can buy.

VI really like this product. In the past, I've had trouble finding running earphones that offer decent sound and that will stay in my ears while I'm running, and I also didn't want to pay a lot of money for high-end brands like Sennheiser.These are perfect for my needs. The hooks on these fit my head and ear shape perfectly, and once they're secured I never have to worry about them. The sound is not exactly concert-hall quality, but it's perfectly decent, and certainly good enough for exercise-related listening. The base levels are much better than my previous earphones.I have added small foam pads (GADGETBRATTM 24 Pack Foam Earbud Earpad Ear Bud Pad Replacement Sponge Covers for Ipod Iphone Itouch Ipad Headsets) to the earbud parts. This both increases the comfort, and also helps soak up the sweat that comes with physical activity.A good product at a good price.

VI Get That With No Pain There Is No Gain, but OUCH!
p1778
sg5
VI've started running, specifically so I can get into road ready condition by the end of this spring. So every night I'm on the treadmill laboring away. I got the right shoes & clothes as you need to be comfortable and flexible. I love my little ipod but I needed headphones to run in. My others were just not staying in with all the jarring. I ordered these. Ok, before I get lynched for not giving you a complete review here it is - they look and sound great for the price. My complaints are simple: they wear poorly (unless you have monstrously large ears with the hooks) & the buds themselves scrape the interior of my ear. Yeah, I said it, s-c-r-a-p-e. With each bounce and stride they pinch, poke, and scrape along the inside curvature of my ear to the point where I can barely stand it. So if pain is your motivator for a work out these will do. I will shop around and see if I can find ones not so painful.

VI bought a pair of these because I thought that the hook would help keep them in place. I hate them. They won't stay in my ears. The hook won't stay around my ear. I have to keep fiddling with them to try to get them to stay rather than fall out, but they fall out anyway and my ears get sore and hurt from having to repeatedly put them back in. I can't stand them. I really wish that I had bought something else. The last time that I used them, I actually had to take the rubber piece off of the speakers just to get them to stay in my ears long enough for me to finish what I was doing and doing that hurt because then the metal underneath was exposed and digging into my skin. But I was tired of fooling with them and my ears were already so sore from having to keep putting them back in that it didn't matter anymore anyway. I've even tried to bend the hook so it would fit better and even that didn't work.

VI bought these to use at the gym while running because my old ones were driving me crazy! Having to worry about keeping your headphones distracts from a perfectly good workout. Unfortunately, I have only used them a few times because they don\u2019t work well.Pros: They were the number one best seller and were pretty cheap. Plus the sound quality isn\u2019t terrible.Cons: They don\u2019t stay in your ears! That\u2019s the whole purpose of the crazy ear piece. The earpiece is not flexible or sturdy so if you have smaller ears, forget about adjusting them to stay on. Plus they don\u2019t lay very close to your head because the earpiece is extended away from the earhooks.Honestly I would have returned these if I didn\u2019t destroy the packaging opening them. I recommend something less gender neutral if you\u2019re a lady. I luckily got better ones for Christmas. Try yurbuds that are available at Academy Sports, etc.

VI've purchased these headphones many times.  They are comfortable (I like the ear-hook design), sound pretty good and are cheap.  The cheap part is important because, like most small, portable headphones, they don't last.  My kids (all teenagers) go through these things like babies through disposable diapers.  Okay, maybe not that fast but these headphones get stuffed in backpacks, lockers, drawers and between cushions.  In other words, they get abused.  I usually have a couple of them in reserve for when my kids inevitably say, "Dad, I need a new pair of headphones!".  They generally last 3 to 6 months with the way they treat them...  I personally prefer the Sony MDR-J10.  About the same price and quality but I find them more comfortable to wear.  My 3 kids all prefer the Philips saying the bass is much better.  I recommend both but don't expect either to last too long if you're a heavy user.

They are the same but for some reason the parts that you put inside your ears hurt. They kind of rub of on the inside of my ear and jus hurt. I use them when I am on the computer for movies, videos etc. I love the sound, the length of cable, and the part you put behind your ear keeps them well in place. It is just the ear buds  that maybe should be made of something softer or have at least soft rubber around them, or maybe they should be a little smaller. I paid 7 dollars so I am keeping them, but still shopping for something a little more comfortable. I didn't feel the discomfort with the first pair I bought a few years ago, so not sure what changed. They were very durable too and I suspect the new pair will last a long time as well.

Only problem is when I turn my head they seem to pop out of my ear and gets tangled up somewhere. So I saw these and figured I'd try them, the result I love these. They don't go in your ear like an ear bud.... Well they do but not all the way. They instead hook on your ears and sit comfortably in the right spot. These sound great considering the cost, they stay in place and overall are amazing for the price.

VI've owned multiple pairs of these-- generally when I'm shopping for a new phone, or a laptop, or anything I plan to listen to in public I pick up a pair. There's two reasons for that.1.) They stay in place, comfortably, no matter what I'm doing. I can spend the better part of a day wearing them without any fatigue or nagging pain in my ears, which is a lot more than I can say for some headphones and most earbuds.2.) They are, frankly, damn nearly disposable. I've gone through a lot of these things because they are just not that durable.The first thing to go, more often than not, is the black rubber padding around the speaker-- once that's gone, they're basically unwearable (unless you've got a thing for scraping your ear with metal). Thankfully, since they're extremely cheap, it's not that big a loss to chuck out a pair and pick up a new set.

VI understand these are inexpensive headphones and not to expect perfection, but the headphones I had BEFORE these were an even cheaper, relatively unknown brand found in the back of a drug store BUT they were comfortable, had great sound, and even had a retractable cord. Sadly, after a lot of use, the phones went out in one ear, and I was forced to get new ones.Now I was going to go the inexpensive route again because it worked for me last time. But this time I went with a brand that I trusted: Philips.First of all, it took me a minute to actually get these headphones placed correctly on my ears, and after 5 minutes of wearing them, I took them off and actually had pain from where the buds dug into my ears. And the sound quality was NOT worth it. Very tinny to the point that it made my music sound like it was whining at me telling me to get a refund. So, I did.

VI have a pair of these that I bought about 3-4 years ago that finally is wearing out.  I use them pretty much every other day for jogging or hiking.  They have been through the washing machine accidentally and have gotten super gross from ear wax and I just wash them with soap and water in the sink.  No problem.  They sound great and don't have issues with the cord making a racket when running.  They stay on for the most part. I can hear things when they are in because they have a little hole that allows other sound in. I have tried others to get something that was better only to find they were awful.  So I just bought a new pair.Update: New ones received.  Very fast.  Sound really great.  The cord is different than my old set.  The old set had a cord that was a single round cord.  The new ones have two parallel cords like a lamp cord.  But no biggie, works great.

VI can't help but wonder if these women complaining about them being 'too big' are using them correctly? I've used mine (listening to podcasts) for several YEARS (I have three pairs; to use with my five Sansa Clips) -- and my ears are pretty normal sized for a woman.  I use these for several hours a day, almost every day. They're comfortable, they're loud enough (even in a car with open windows) and I only switch them out for noise-cancelling ear cups when using loud machinery.p.s. I have extremely sensitive hearing and only listen to talking -- they're superb!(And cheap!)p.p.s  On one pair, the rubber 'band' holding the speaker in the hook disappeared, and I used the black foam covering from another kind to hold the speaker in the hook -- it works, not great but it works. About to buy another set to replace that one,even though it works perfectly.

VGreat value! This set of earphones lasted me three years before I had to buy a replacement. For roughly $8.00, it was a great investment. Other earphones out there on the market sell for much more with poorer sound quality and durability. This particular brand of earphones has lasted me 3 years of use in the gym. That's three years of sweat, four times a week for two hours at a time. It's definitely worth the $8.00 I paid for them. The loops on the earpieces are the best I've ever worn. I've tried other brands and they haven't been as comfortable or as durable. These Philips earphones provide a high quality of sound with plenty of bass. They come with a one year manufacturer's warranty as well. I've been able to use them while running, lifting weights, and even jumping rope. I have enjoyed these Philips earphones so much that I recently bought two pairs.

p1865
sg5
VI bought these headphones based on price and the glowing reviews.I don't need to go into great depth as others have already done that. I am an average sized male (5'9", average head size, ear size, etc).Here is my assessment as succinctly as possible:Pros:1. Cheap2. Soft and flexibleCons:1. Cheap, cables are very thin, not sure how long they will last2. Quiet, compared with other headphones I own, these are easily 1/2 as loud at the same volume setting3. The actual speaker/driver does not stay in my ear hole4. The earhooks have come off from over my ears while doing nothing more than mowing the lawn5. After an extended period of use, the earhooks become somewhat uncomfortableOverall, I would not buy these or recommend them to anyone except for maybe a backup set.

VGreat Headphones
p1871

VI bought my first pair of these several years ago, when my kids talked me into getting an MP3 player for my own use.  My kids liked the fancy looking phones, the ones that cost lots of money. That was until after about 4 years mine were still working, and they had gone through at least 4 sets each of various other headphones.  They kept borrowing mine until they could replace theirs.  Now everyone has a set of these Phillips.  They are rugged, comfortable and very affordable.  I am still on my first pair, the kids on their second sets. If I had to point out one weakness it would be the cord, where it meets the plug, this seems to always be the point at which they fail. But a little bit of black silicon spread around the base of the plug and onto the cord keep them from bending at that point, seems to make them last a bit longer . Overall Great phones.

VUnless you're into running with $300 Beats 'phones, these are they way to go. Inexpensive, simple, and they sound great. I've  had mine for a year or so; they have accompanied me for hundreds of miles of running and cycling. An added benefit is that, unlike noise-isolation or, god forbid, noise-cancelling headphones, these can either drown out the outside world (not advisable, in my mind), or, with the volume down, provide enough beat to help you forget the pain while maintaining acceptable auditory awareness of one's surroundings. That way, staying in a groove doesn't get you run over by a bus.As for the sound, for the heck of it I pulled out the Y adapter and compared these to some Klipsch S4i Sport noise-isolating in-hear phones I Wooted a couple of weeks ago, primarily for use in travel. The difference in sound quality is trivial.

VThese are my favorite earphones. I owned a pair almost six years ago, and when I lost them I was devastated. I went through every other earphone available, from those Apple earpods to all kinds of Bose and LG bluetooth and over-ear Beats, and I still found myself desperating wanting these bad boys. I finally bought them, and I'll never look back. Sound quality is not perfect, but average and above-average ears will hardly notice. There's some noise escape if you play them loud, but your music taste is probably awesome anyway so I'm sure people won't mind hearing your rad tunes. One suggestion I have for storing them is to take the back part of the rubber and fold it/tuck it on the other side of the actual earbud. This will keep the rubber wraparound sturdy and clinging nice and snug, especially if you use them to work out/run/play sports in.

VI've gone through several different types of these over-the-ear headphones and have yet to find a pair that feel good while on.  I prefer a regular ear bud for regular listening; but really need a type that hooks over my ears for running and during strenuous exercise.  These stay in place pretty well, although they aren't terribly comfortable after extended wear. The ear hooks and ear buds are a more solid plastic with no padding or silicone for comfort.The clarity of sound is really pretty decent for the price although the bass is a bit minimal.  They don't seem to be volume restrictive at all.The only real issue that I have with these headphones is that they don't seem to last long.  This is my second pair of this brand, and in both cases, the sound began to diminish in one ear bud after several months of use.

VI've owned a pair of these along with my Philips GoSpark player for years, and they've been the absolute best combination for sound quality of any mobile equipment I've tried ever. Be sure to set the player to "Full Sound" (wide spectrum with enhanced bass), and these buds handle it superbly; rings around any other phone/player I've tried including Sony. Also the over earloop keeps them on perfectly as you walk around. You don't need to press them into your ear to hear well, but it will increase your bass. Doesn't give ear aches some do. Mine, after years of use, still work fine (the player control is going) and I'm only getting a second pair if these because I was looking at phones on Amazon in passing and decided to do a search. I've had iPhones, etc. etc. This has provided a far superior sound experience. Don't pay more.

p1906
sg5
VI've never been a big fan of earbuds, but I thought I'd give these a try because of the "hooks" behind the ears (maybe I just have funny-shaped ears, because I can never seem to get earbuds to fit properly).  Anyway, get ready to crank your EQ, because the sound is rather tinny and it needs more bass.  The ear hooks I mentioned are flexible, but they "spring back" and don't stay put if you try to "form fit" them.  I was hoping they'd be made out of some heavier twist-tie or pipe cleaner type material so you could clamp them around the back of your ears.  They do pop out on me, but not as badly as another set of buds I've tried.  Others may have better success, and you can't go wrong with a low price like this.  I like the choice of colors and it's not a bad deal overall.  I plan to continue using them.

VI bought my first pair of these at least 2 years ago. They have been great. I use them for running and to wear during yard work. I let one of my kids borrow the first pair and they were returned in pieces. I bought another pair and they have been great, but I stretched the cord too far recently and have caused a short. I just ordered my third pair.They fit me well. You need to get them set into your ears -- the first time might take a little more time to get used to, but one you get the hang of it, they won't move and they shouldn't hurt (not me, at least).As for a few reviews about blocking out noise, it is true that these won't do that.  Use these for situations where you need to hear around you -- like outdoor exercise.  I use noise-canceling headphones if I need to block out other sound.  Use these for exercise.

VThese are about the best ear buds you can find for the money (under $10). So many ear buds in this price range sound tinty and cheap. I spent 18 years in radio broadcasting and I am a huge fan of headphone listening. However if I am out for a walk or going to the gym I have to use ear buds on my MP3 player.  The tone on these are quite good and the nuances of the music can be heard clearly without distraction. The ear hooks are soft and comfortable and hold the buds safely place for the duration of your listening pleasure.Certainly these are not a pair of BOSE or Sennheisers but if you are looking for a pair of ear buds for pocket change with a decent sound quality these are highly recommended as far as I am concerned.I bought the black pair but they come in several colors for all tastes and personalities.

VSound quality is better than ipod ear buds, or any other headphones that are included in a music player. They don't fit my ears 'just right' but that's the risk of buying things online; however, they are still comfortable. Would have given them 4 stars, but after 2 months of use I get a slight electrical shock on my ear every so often. It's not really painful, just like when you touch your car when there is lots of static electricity on it.So basically, here is a product which functions adequately and is priced reasonably. The poor rating is because they kind of broke after 2 months of use. Not going to request a return because you get what you pay for. I should have just spent the few extra dollars and gotten something better to begin with. This is a lesson I keep learning, I wonder if it will ever stick.

VThe summer of 2007 I purchased these for a motorcycle trip.  200 miles down the road I pulled one out of my ear to talk to my buddy and forgot to put it back in.  The ear piece caught on the frame of the bike and pulled off when I got off the bike.  I walked into a Walmart and exchanged them without a receipt (thank you Walmart in Iowa).  Since August 2007 I have used the same pair of these, through rain and crappy weather.  They have lasted over 60,000 miles.  Just 60 days ago I was in a wreck.  I was ejected from my bike at 45 mph and these earbuds were in my ears.  Not only do they still work perfectly, my iPod still works.  As far as the sound, I have tried JVC and Sony and some others and none match the sound and certainly not the price.  I highly recommend these.  $9.99 at Walmart.  Probably $11.99 by now

VI like these Philips headphones due to their high quality sound.I use them with my trusted Sansa clip 4G.  The flexible band that goes around the back of your ear also works very well.  What could be better:  the circular comfort pads around the headphones get loose and just by putting them back on they stretch ever so slightly that eventually they fall and get lost.They actual headphone (sound) units separate with time.  I fix this by super-gluing them with two dabs of this glue.  This seems to last forever.For the price and performance, this is a very good product.  I have bought several at a time and milk them to the end, then get the next one.  My current stash is a year or better old, so I don't know if the current ones are as good or if they have been improved.

VI've gone through a dozen or so sport style headphones from various manuafcturers.  None of them last long.  All seem to be cheaply constructed.Maybe it's me too - I am pretty rough on headphones.  Use them daily to run a few miles - I sweat profusely - and I'm not afraid to wear them in the rain. (This is why I'm giving them 3 stars instead of the 1 or 2 they deserve.)These failed after 2-1/2 months.  Seem to have loosened at the connection to the RCA jack.They are (were) very comfortable.  I like this style headphone rather than the intrusive inserting earbud style that amplifies every footfall into a pounding bass drum.  The flexible earhook is soft and somewhat pliable. Also had good sound quality - well, good enough for running outdoors or working out in a gym.

VI use these to listen to books or NPR and the sound quality is good. I have no idea if the sound is good enough for music. They stay on, don't go inside my ears like those annoying buds, and last about 2-4 months before one or the other side stops working. I usually listen in only one ear at a time, so just switch until both sides quit. The little rubber rings that encircle the speaker get pulled off sometimes when I take them out of my pocket, and although they go back on, it usually signs the begining of the end for that side - it stops working soon after. They are cheap enough to toss and start with another set and I usually buy 3-4 sets at a time to have backups ready. They are not adjustable like the ones Phillips doesn't make anymore, so only buy one set to start to make sure they fit your ears.

No extra vibrato noises or screeches. The only debacle  you may come across with these is  that they get uncomfortable in your ear from time to time but there's a simple solution ! Take them out, rub your ears, put them back in and you're good for another two-four hours (haha).

I never really thought about it before, but the other types of headphones will fall off during these vigorous routines. I got them for his birthday and he absolutely loves them. They stay secure to his head and they haven't fallen off yet.I see some complaints here about sound. Of course they aren't the greatest sounding headphones in the history of the world, you'll need to pay a lot more for that. They sound fine and perform their designed function very well

VI've been using these earphones for the last 10 years, and they break about once a year on average. This is statistically better than any other ones I've ever used! I treat my earphones roughly, cramming them into my tight jeans pockets at least 5 times a day in between classes. After a year has passed, one stops working and then the other because the wires are turned into pretzels. I used to buy them in RiteAid for $10 but they're cheaper on amazon. There are no longer lasting earphones out there!The sound quality is great due to the built-in mini sub. They look great around the ear, not bulky or anything, and they never fall out like the in-ear and iphone ones do because they're hooked around your ear. And I'm hooked on them. And dora the explorer is hooked on Phonics. We're all addicts.

VBased on the favorable reviews for these earbuds, and the inexpensive price, I thought I'd give them a try. I'm a runner so needed an earbud that would stay put while running and the reviews were favorable in this regard. Well, I have hard to fit ears apparently. I do have fairly small ears, so the over the ear part isn't a good fit for me. I have to really fiddle around with them for about the first mile that I'm running before they stay in place very well. Maybe it's as my ears warm up, it helps them stay more secure, not sure. The sound quality is good though and once they do stay in place, I have no issues with them and they are comfortable. I think they would work well for anyone with "normal" size ears. I'll just have to keep searching for an earbud that works for my tiny ears though.

sg5
VI've had a couple of pretty bad running earphones (ranging from $5-$20) so this one is as good as I've had so far. The flexible rubber parts still need adjusting during my 3-4 mile run but it stays on most of the time. One really awesome thing about these earphones is that they are tough! I shove them into my bag, accidentally sit on them all the time, and they are almost kind of waterproof? I accidentally dropped an earphone into my water glass and left for an hour. When I came back, I freaked out a little, dried it off, and tried it right away. Amazingly it still worked...good jobs Phillips....The quality of the sound isn't bad but it's not for those people who need to feel the concert in their heads. Overall I like them for normal and running use and I would buy another pair for sure.

VThe Earpiece is Too Big!!!!!
p2020
sg5
VLet me start off with the good. - The sound quality is pretty good, for me at least. - The cord length is perfect, so it doesn't get caught up in my pocket, or get caught on things as I'm walking. - The jack which goes into the player is "Strait" rather then that annoying L-shape, which feed the cable off to the  side, rather then strait out of the pocket.I would love to keep using these, if it weren't for the fact that the earpieces themselves are TOO BIG. Too big to the point where they were causing my ear to become very sore. Stubborn me thought my ear just needed to get used to them. Then my ear became so irritated it started to bleed, and I cannot use them anymore. So just keep in mind that if you have really big ears, then you are set. Just be careful.

VNice pair of BUDGET headphones
p2026
sg5
VReviewing these as what they are intended to be, budget earphones. You will get what you pay for and then some. I bought these several months back as a cheapo pair of phones for my ipod. Sound quality on them was great and for my bigger head the loops worked out perfectly. If you have more money to spend on headphones though I would definitely opt for some higher quality, longer lasting buds.  I got a lot of good use out of this pair, but after 6 mos. of being wrapped up and pulled in and out of jacket pockets and field packs the wires frayed and no longer work.  For the $10 I paid for this pair though, they have far outperformed many of the other cheap $10 phones I have used in the past.  Definitely a good choice as long as you understand that you are purchasing cheap budget earphones.

VGreat for exercising!
p2031
sg5
VThese little buds are great in terms of sound quality, durability, comfort, and price.  I use headsets/earbuds primarily when I exercise, and I've gone through a number of brands in or near this price range.  Most broke after a relatively short period -- either the bud broke or one of the wires pulled out or the jack-end fell apart.  These, on the other hand, have stood the test of time (and my exercise regime).  They are rugged, stay in place, stand up to the occasional accidental yank, and deliver very good sound quality (if I use them on a TV-equipped cardio machine, I invariably have to lower the volume first, because the setting that the previous user had is too loud; to me, that means these are more sensitive than many other earbuds on the market).  I recommend them highly!

VThe good:- They're comfortable- They're super cheapThe bad:- They broke after owning for just 2 weeks, used about 8-10 timesAfter reading other reviews I decided to give these a try for running, since I was having trouble keeping my regular earbuds in. I was pleased with the comfort-level, and for the very little cost I thought they sounded pretty darn good. Imagine my disappointment when they broke during my run this weekend, just gave a sad little fizzle and died, no amount of wire jiggling or plugging/unplugging could bring them back to life. I'm not an overly sweaty person so I don't think that was the issues, I just think they're cheap. Also, I kept them stored in a separate pouch, so not like they were getting abused in my gym bag.

VSurprisingly Durable
p2048
sg5
VI bought my first pair of these from Walmart about three years ago when I wanted a cheap pair of earbuds that I could wear while working out, and I was surprised by their comfort and sound quality. Even more surprising was that a sub-$10 pair of earbuds lasted longer than the headphones/headsets I was using with my desktop, even after being yanked off my ears and wrapped around my iPod countless times. So when my first pair broke in October of 2013, I bought a new pair from Amazon, and they feel and sound just like the ones I used to have. The length of the cord is perfect for keeping your device in your pocket, the earbuds themselves are very light and comfortable over long periods of time, and I'd say they're one of the best choices in terms of affordable earbuds.

VGreat sound but uncomfortable
p2054
sg5
VFirst, I have zero complaints about the sound quality of these. It is very impressive and actually better than my previous pair of roughly twice-as-expensive earbuds.However, the construction of these really does make them obnoxiously uncomfortable to the point of being painful for extended periods of listening. Generally, they seem to be fine for about 30-45 minutes which works for me because I tend to only use them for the gym or running. I couldn't use them for long periods like studying though because they start to hurt too much.The problem, which is hard to tell from the image, is that the speakers do not actually sit in your earholes like some designs of earbuds -- they're too wide. Instead they sit outside and get very uncomfortable.

VAll I gotta say is Wow!!! This headphones are amazing. I've washed and dried these twice accidently. The first time I washed them, the were in my basketball shorts, and I was like these are done and out of curiosity I plug them into my phone and they worked perfectly still. Soo I was very amazed and told myself I would write a review and never did. I just had got done washing my clothes today and same scenario. Started looking for my headphones to go to them gym and couldn't find them, so then I had decided to look in my shorts that I had just washed and dried again. And they still work. So I made sure to write a review about these. As far as the quality of the product. Excellent quality, great treble and good bass. Well worth it. You won't regret these bad boys.

p2066
sg5
VWhen I first got this I was pretty happy. I liked the style since it stays in my ear at the gym more so then ear buds.  I use them to go to the gym and at work sometimes.  However, After about a week of use at the gym the sound started cutting in and out.  The quality is Terrible, there is a loose connection already near where it plugs into my ipod.  I can still use them at work sometimes if I jiggle the connection so that the sound works, but not at the gym where it gets moved around a lot.I'm very disappointed and have yet to find a high quality/durable ear phone that can withstand simply being in my pocket at the gym with my ipod.. DO NOT get this if you are using it at the gym or to run.. If you use it at work with a laptop or something it should be fine

VSaw these on sale on a lightning deal and decided to buy a second pair, and felt compelled to write a positive review. The pair I currently own is a little over 2 years old. I use them for general music listening when out and about, as well as when going to the gym. I am pretty rough on my headphones and these have help up remarkably well. Before these I used the Sony equivalent model and I went through 3 pairs in less than a year before I switched to these. Sound is good, and they don't get too distorted when at really high volumes. When wearing them they stay on very securely(even when jogging) and are quite comfortable, you almost feel like they aren't even there. If you want a good general purpose headphone that is well priced, then I'd take a look at these.

Vi love these headphones. i typically only use them when i run.  they stay on my ears very well and are very comfortable. this is my 5th purchase of these headphones (1st via amazon) over the past 7 or so years and are very much worth the price.these headphones also have good sound response, even with the wind blowing through them while i run. the cord is a good length and pretty durable. i've lost a few pair along the way due to moving or simply losing them. i've replaced 2 pair over time because the cord developed a short in it and sound was no longer going to one ear.when these pair wear out our they get lost, i'm sure i will purchase another pair just like them. they're perfect for what i need them and at $10.00 are a great price.

p2089
sg5
VThis is my second pair. The sound is great for fitness and workout with just enough bass. The rubber ear wraps are firm enough and stay in place during the most active movements.  They fit my adult head and not sure if you can squeeze to make them hold tighter for smaller ears. My point is this is why I got them. I ordered other headphones with the flexible ear wire and they were more expensive but too flimsy and take 2 hands to fold over my ear.  Clean them regularly with an old dry toothbrush/damp cloth and the rubber rings around the speaker slide off to clean. The rings are very fragile so clean with care. My advice is order one pair and if you like - order another backup. I paid alot more for my first set at Target. This Amazon price is a winner!!

VI purchased a set of these headphones at a local store a couple years ago and they served me well until I broke one of the wires while running, so I ordered three pair from Amazon a few weeks ago, and I have to say it's great to have them back again. Before I broke the first pair, they lasted a couple of years of hard use running, cycling and cross-country skiing. I have used other earhook headphones but they were not as comfortable and didn't sound as good as the Philips brand. The bass tube on these must make the difference as other headphones sound cheap and tinny in comparison. And the rubber ear hooks fit my ears perfectly, and are so easy to take on and off. My order from Amazon came quickly and in good condition. Great to have these back again.

p2101
sg5
VThese are great for workouts and dirt cheap. They are comfortable and stay in place well. Sound quality is not the best but they are clear sounding. When I am running if I am thinking I need a tad bit more bass or treble from these headphones, I am probably not really working out and just coasting. For audiophiles look elsewhere for sound quality. These are made for workouts and do a good job. The only minor gripe is if they were adjustable a bit with the earhook and if the cord came out from behind the ear rather than the headphone itself. I had one pair broke after a few years of heavy use as the sound only came out of one ear, but no biggie because they are cheap. However, philips makes a few other models that have that so probably will try those.

VI purchased these headphones a couple of years ago, for use when I workout at the gym. They went through a lot, and then finally one ear piece broke. I went back to Target, where I purchased the original pair, but they no longer carried them. I settled for another brand and was very dissatisfied, because of the hard plastic piece that went in my ear, no to mention they cost more.I really wanted the another pair of the Philips Flexible Earhook Headphones, because of the soft flexible rubber that goes into and around the ear. They stay on when exercising. The sound quality is excellent. After doing some searching, I found them on Amazon, so I bought two (2), so now I have a backup pair. I'm sure I'll get a good number of years out of them.

VI used these to sleep in, (I need music to help me sleep and full speakers aren't good in my apartment with family sleeping next room over). They work okay, the only problem is the little black whatever you want to call it around the speaker part of the headset easily falls off. I've had about two pairs of these and like the first night they've fallen off. They last a while without the black strip around the bud, but then after a few months wear started showing on them and they'd fall apart. I guess they're okay for the price and they're better than just standard ear buds which constantly fall out at night. Sony discontinued my favorite clip on headphones and these are okay for what I use them for. I'll probably buy another pair one of these days.

VI purchased these headphones a few weeks ago. I use them with my MuVo mp3 player. The sound is very good, but nothing special. It is decent sound for outdoor actions. I wear them while on the bus, while biking or walking. The sound can be pretty strong, so that's a good thing about them.The bad thing is that the plugs are a little bit big for my ears, so after an hour they hurt a little bit, but i guess that has to do with different size of ears on people. The earhooks are a little bit big for my ears too (I guess I have quite small ears). I assume that they would fit better in men than women.I recommend these, but I suggest that someone has to try them on first, just to check the size.That's why I give a 4/5 star.

p2147
sg5
VI'm an average sized male, 5'10", 168lbs, with normal sized ears to match.  However, the ear buds that sit inside your ear just don't seem to fit very well.  They seem a little large and cause the little cartilage bits that hold them in to hurt.  It's not really the diameter of the ear bud, but the thickness that just seems to press on the inside of your ear too much.  At times I also experience a bit of a whistling noise, and I can only assume that its from the little bass tube hole things.With that said, with enough adjustment, you can get them in an ok position that won't cause you as much pain as the workout you're about to put yourself through, but it would be nice if you could find a halfway decent pair of cheap headphones somewhere.

It feels better that another brand that was purchased at the same time, with more flexible ear supports.  There are no issues with keeping them on the ear during moderate walking, or bending over.  If your require something superior, you might spend $100 to buy a noise canceling headset.  If you are like me, you will love these headphones.  Thanks Philips!

The hooks are flexible (but not adjustable), and fit snug around my ear. I can imagine these won't fit for every ear type. If you have small ears, I would likely not recommend these.Overall, these were a great deal. And they're one of those Amazon gems where you pay less than $10 and you get a much better product than you expected.

The fit is not as good, but it's not horrible, and the bass is a lot better. Overall, they're a very good set of headphones for 10 bucks. If they break, it won't kill you to buy another pair.Update (8/8/07): These earphones are no good. They didn't fit my ears at all and they are broken already. I guess they can't handle moisture very well. I will not be buying another pair.

These stay on my ears with no problem even as I fidget on a plane or move around during a workout.Sometimes they do start to hurt after a few hours of wear, but I have pretty sensitive ears and there is no padding on the bud.I use these pretty much daily for extended periods of time and they are still working fine. I carry them around in my bag that I don't treat particularly delicately. I do periodically get the hooks caught on other items in my bag which can be momentarily annoying.Overall a good inexpensive option for those that hate normal earbuds.

It is not comfortable to use these headphones without that rubber ring, and that is why I came back for a third time.I pleased with the product vs. the reasonable price.

VI had a pair of Nike earbuds with the over the ear thing to keep them on for running that I really liked, but those broke.  I had these as a backup pair.  For me, they're just okay.  They stay on fine, if I'm not wearing a hat.  If my hat is on, I'm having to mess with these every few minutes that I'm running.  The sound is fine.  I didn't want a pair of earbuds that cancelled out too much noise, as I run outside, and figured that might be kind of dangerous.  I sweat a lot, and these still stay in.  They're pretty comfortable, but that's if they're not slipping out of my ears with a hat on.  I'd say for the money, the sound and fit are just okay.  I have yet to find the "perfect" pair of headphones for running/gym.

VI am "plugged in" anywhere from 6 to 12 hours a day so I get a lot of use out of headphones.  I have been buying these for years. I used to be able to buy them locally but now the only place I can get them is on Amazon.  I usually get about three months use out of a pair before I lose the sound in one earpiece but that is to be expected with headphones priced as low as these.  I don't understand people complaining about the ear hooks not fitting.  I am a small person with small features and have never had an issue with the hooks being too big for my ears.  I don't know what I will do if Philips ever quits making these because I can not keep other headphones without ear hooks from falling out of my ears.

VI had a $150 pair of Beats active headphones and they did everything the beats did for only $10 from Walmart. I give then 4 stars because I tend to bend the cord were it plus in at, but other than that these should be 5 stars for the price. The music is crisp and the bass is warm.I purchase them to have something light I could listen to music with while being active, but I made the mistake while having them plugged in my phone and answered the phone and the person said they could hear me loud and clear, so I began purchasing them as cell phone headphones to talk with and now I've been purchasing them since (5yrs). I gave my wife the Beats active headphones and I stayed using these. (Best bang for buck)

VI had a pair of Philips SBC HS500 headphones for almost SEVEN YEARS! They were without a doubt the best pair of headphones I will EVER own. After almost 7 years the only complaint was 1) the left ear piece started to buzz and 2) THEY DON'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE! I bought and returned 4 pair of headphones at local retail stores with no luck. I saw all of the good reviews on this particular pair and decided I'd give it a shot, they're great! No complaints! Since I have a HUGE head and wear glasses these headphones are PERFECTO! I will only trust Philips when it comes to headphones! If you buy these you might want to find some little foam covers for the earbuds since they don't come with any! 10/10 THANX PHILIPS

p2232
sg5
VI bought these mostly for running and secondarily for working in the yard. The fit seemed OK after I realized that I had to put the earbud part in first, then pull the hook over my ear. However, while wearing them on a run the first time, I realized that my ears were hurting after about 30 minutes. I assumed I must have done something wrong, but the next day the same thing happened while I was mowing the lawn. I tested them a few more times--mostly because I didn't have a substitute--with the same result. No adjustment would fix it.Also, it is very easy to knock these loose. Just brushing my hand against my ear seemed to be enough. For me, these headphones ended up being pretty much useless.

p2237
sg5
VThese are probably the most painful earbuds I've ever used.  The oval shape of the actual "bud" part does not stay in your ear very good...therefore resulting in poor bass and you can hear everything around you.  The only good part about these headphones is that they hook around your ear so they'll never fall off. The treble is good sounding...very clear sounding, but like I said, they don't actually stay in your ear...they just hover over the outside which means you'll get zero bass sound and everybody around you will know what you're listening to.  These headphones have been on the market for a couple of years now in which there are definitely better buds out there to buy.  I do not recommend these.

VI would give these ear buds with hooks 4.5 stars.  I have never been able to find a pair of headphones that stayed securely in my ears while exercising.  After reading positive reviews about the Philips Earhook Headphones, I decided to give them a try.  After several rounds of exercising, including outdoor running/jogging, I was very satisfied with the result.  The ear hooks stayed securely on my ears, and the sound quality is fine.  My only negative would be the hard surface of the earbud portion, would should have been made of softer material or come with coverings.  It doesn't bother me enough to change, and it's probably not so hard to find add-on little earpiece covers to improve the feel.

VI've bought these headphones twice in 8 months. My first pair stopped working after a few months. The left earphone did not produce any sound anymore. I lost the second pair. I used the headphones with my iPod to play basketball and lift weights. While playing basketball, the headphones would stay on no matter what, which is why I bought a second pair. Even when my ipod would fly out of my pocket, the headphones would stay attached to my ears. I liked them a lot in that sense. I don't know too much about how a great pair of headphones sound, but these got the job done. I use them for sports, so I'm not expecting awesome acoustics. Overall, this is a good pair of headphones to buy for the price.

VSo I wear headphones often throughout my day and I have to say that these are extremely uncomfortable. I normally wear sport hook over the ear ones but I guess I figured that they would work as well as my Sony ones. I have "normal ears" and the actual ear bud piece hooks into your inner cartilage and for me I can take about an hour then I have to leave them off. I actually have a little bruise in my ear. The sound was good but then because of the pain I can only hook them over my ear but the sound is now distant. You get what you pay for (hence the 2 stars) but I have to say that the design of these headphones is not worth it. I actually went an bought a new pair after about a week.

VFor $9, these get the job done very nicely.Initially, the sound produced by the headphones seemed low, and I had to turn the volume up on my computer and/or applications.  But after a few hours, the sensitivity of the headphone speakers improved and I turned my volume settings back down to where they were normally set.  They also seem to have decent lower frequency sound compared to the other cheap earphones I use.  When you cover up the outer hole in the earphone you will noticeably lose low frequency response.I had some spare black foam covers that I was able to use to cover the ear speakers.  Not necessary, but a nice added touch.  I'll probably purchase another set or two for backup.

p2265
sg5
VI'm buying my third pair of these headphones today.  My last pair lasted over one year.I agree that the size and fit may not work for everyone, but that's the case with any headphones.  Everything depends on the shape of your outer ear.  These are the ONLY headphones I've found in the past three years that work for me while running, lifting and just riding the train.  Nothing else stays on or in my ear.I use them five days a week during workouts and I've never had a problem with the quality of the product.  The cord is long so I just thread it underneath my shirt.  They are easy to clean with an alcohol wipe after a run.  As long as Philips makes them I won't buy anything else.

VThis is the 2nd pair of these that I have purchased. The first ones accidentally got caught in a hinge, and the wire got cut, so not their fault at all. I am an avid runner, and the normal IPOD earbuds just don't stay in place once I start sweating, I have used other over the ear styles, but they did not fit well...these are maybe not the most cool looking, but they stay put and have made it through many miles of running...Only thing I would change is have them have a shorter cord, but that is just because of my application of wearing an iPod armband, and the short distance actually needed. In regards to sound quality, they are just fine, and realistically, at $10...they suit the purpose!

VI originally bought these headphones for running, however I never realized how much I'd want to use headphones outside of exercising! They are suitable for running and working out just because the design feels so weightless on your ear, and you don't worry they will fall out. However, I have two downsides one minor and one major. The major downfall I have is that they are a pain to get on. They take me about 45 seconds to put on and I feel like the design should be suitable for people with larger than average ears too. The minor downfall is that there isn't a Mic on it, and so when I'm making calls there's no function to suffice for that. For the price, Its a good product would recommend

VI listen to education tapes and music all the time while walking, biking, cooking and puttering around; and have tried many different kinds of headphones. These are the best I have found. The only limitation is that it takes a minute to put them on. I am life long wearing of glasses, and these headphones I can put on with my glasses already on; and then I simple hook them under the temples above my ear; I find this comfortable for hours. These headphones stay in my ears and on my head better than anything else I have used. I have also put them through the wash twice, and it doesn't seem to phase them at all. A rugged product that stays put. This is the way things should be made!

Now as for SHS3200/37 and SHS3200/28 there is no difference just the package it comes in, i called Philips they said the headphones are the same and the SHS3200/37 and SHS3200/28 just means where their sold, so injoy either one it don't matter /37 or /28.

VI bought these years ago on a trip when my wife had forgotten her iPod earbuds. I recently found them in a drawer since she doesn't wear them, and says they hurt her (small) ears. That's the only drawback I've found: these have a very particular shape that will simply not be comfortable for some listeners. However for me, the guy with a house full of very expensive headphones, these are incredible. They produce uncolored, accurate sound with far less distortion than so many others I've tried. This is a big plus if you listen to any records made in the last 10 years, with mixes getting hotter and louder all the time.You simply cannot spend a better $9.00 on a set of headphones!

VI had been searching for earphones that would stay on while running but that were not a "noise cancelling" earbud/in-the-ear design.  I first purchased the Sony MDR-J10 H.Ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design (Green) - but these fit awkwardly and did not sit comfortably on my ear.  I have normal sized (female) ears and usually wear glasses and a visor when I run; the Sony ear hooks did not rest where they were supposed to and protruded above my ear when the earphone piece was positioned properly.  The Phillips however fit just fine and have given me absolutely no trouble, even with glasses and visor.  Sound is very good.  I find the cord a bit too long but it's manageable.

VAt $6 these are probably the best buy out there for ear-buds that are stable and won't jostle during a run.  I bought them in a pinch to replace my Sennheiser PMX80 Sport Headphones which broke after a single year of use (one side no longer works).  They have a 2 year warranty so I'll be trying to get them fixed.  Anyway...The sound quality of the Phillips is equal to the Senns (pretty poor) but finding buds that stay in your ears as good as these is hard to come by.The wiring is a little too thin for my liking.Just like the Senns, these are quite painful to wear the first couple of uses; but once your ears adjust you'll forget that they ever hurt when you first wore them.

VI use these while running, which is almost on a daily basis. I never have to adjust them or worry about them falling out. Granted, though, my ears are kind of big. I've had the same pair for about a six months now and have had no issues. Obviously the sound quality could be much better but when all you want is something to stop falling out of your ears when you go for runs, thats not so much a priority as comfort and fit. I'm not positive if these are actually sweat and water proof, but like I said, I've had no issues. Great product for the price. Only thing I do wish it had was a mic, because I run with my phone and it'd be nice to answer the calls with minimal interruption.

I use these for running and I have run literally thousands of miles with these, hundreds of those in the rain. They still work great. No, they aren't noise canceling or mind-blowing sound quality, but they are fantastic for the money and for what they do. They stay on during vigorous exercise, they can handle being in the rain, they are comfortable (for my female ears at least) and they sound pretty good. I am only buying new ones because they are getting a little grungy from so much time in my ears :).

VI originally purchased these headphones because I couldn't justify spending a lot of money on any headphones and unfortunately you do get what you pay for in this instance. I purchased a pair in May of 2012 and by September one of the two headphones had ceased working. I then purchased a second pair of the same headphones in September of 2012 and now just 4 months later the same issue has occurred.If you're looking for a cheap alternative these might work for you but it's only a short term solution. I'd say it is worth it to spend $30-40 on a decent set upfront instead of going through the hassle and disappointment of replacing your headphones every 3-4 months.

I can honestly say that these are the most comfortable, best sounding earphones on the market (for my ears).  I have bought every earphone out there it seems (from Sony to Panasonic).  These are PERFECT!!  I don't know how they did it, but they succeed admirably.Nevertheless, one must be cognizant of the contour and configuration of their own ear.  If you have a moderate to large ear (concha) canal with an average tragus, then these are earphones for you.  Bar none!!

I gave them a good solid month, and tried every possible way I could think of to make them stay comfortably on my ears, but it's just never going to happen. The whole experience made me so sad that I'm put off ear buds forever. Only full-size super comfy headphones for this girl's ears from here on out. If my ears are not happy, I'm not happy.

VI'll have to start off with saying that my ears absolutely do not fit any style of earbuds out there, I put earbuds in and even sitting still they will fall out within 10 minutes.  Not wanting to wear a full set of headphones while running (I think it'd look just a tad goofy), I went looking around and found some of these earhook headphones, something that would stay on while I go for my long runs.  I did my research on product reviews and decided to buy these bad boys.  After about 10 runs with these, they definitely do stay on your ears and produce ample/quality sound.  I hope these last for a while, because if they do I'll definitely be around to buy another pair.

VThese headphones certainly won't give you phenomenal, out-of-this-world sound quality, but for the price they are perfect to take to the gym. They stay in place well while performing any kind of exercise including lifting free weights, core exercises, or on treadmills, exercise bikes, elliptical machines, and the like. They cord is plenty long enough when my iPhone is in my waist pocket, but not so long as to be dangerous or get tangled.After about a year of heavy use, the outer ring of one of the earbuds came off, making it uncomfortable to wear. I didn't see where it went so I couldn't try to replace it. At this price though, it's cheaper to replace.

VI have a nice pair of Philips headphones that I only use at home because they are bulky - so I use these Philips earhooks when I'm at work or getting around.  For the money, they have pretty good sound and bass, you can't really ask for more for the price.  They are pretty snug and won't fall out as you work, or exercise.  After a long while they can get uncomfortable, but that's just most earphones that go behind the ear.The cable feels kind of cheap, and it should be a little longer.  If you walk and listen to your music player at the same time, it might be hard to put the player in your pocket and listen with these headphones just because of the cable length.

I've used these in the rain, on runs, and generally did not take good care of them, so I am not blaming anyone but me for their short lifespan. That said, these are the most comfortable and best sounding headphones I've ever owned. I'm sure better headphones exist for more money, but having tried many headphones over the years and being cheap as I am, these are great.

VI have to run all the time being in the military so for me it's about fit and functionality.  I have tried many headphones that wrap around the ears and these are by far the best!  After reading other reviews, perhaps it may designed for people with "larger" ears but it more than that for me.  Other headphones that I have tried fit over the ear fine with that doesn't prevent the bud from falling out and hanging outside the canal.  Not only do they stay hooked on the ear comfortably but the buds stay put the whole time running, even while sweating.  The sound quality is awesome too.  They are no noise-canceling headphones but for the price, you just cant beat it.

VI have to say that I have tried other brands of clip on earphones and they just didn't stay in my ear or the quality of them wasn't the best. I have used the Phillips Flexible Earhooks for a long time. I even still have the old pair Ive been using for years. They work great for running, working out, and anything else physical. The reason they work great is cause they stay in your ear. I won't probably buy another other brand of in the earphones again, outside of regular headphones, they are the best you can get for exercising or running. I have a white pair and will be getting the black ones soon. Good quality, long lasting and a definite buy good job Phillips.

p2407
sg5
VIn terms of being comfortable and staying in your ears, these are excellent headphones, which automatically makes them better than the stock iPod earbuds. The soft plastic earhook makes them flexible and comfortable. The buds fit perfectly into my ear. They get a little loose sometimes, but not as loose as other brands I've used, and they never fall completely out.However, the sound quality leaves something to be desired. They do pick up quite a bit and handle high volume well, but the mid-range is played up too much and there's basically no bass response. Audiophiles will want to look elsewhere. But considering the low price, they probably already are.

VThis is my second pair of these that I purchased after I lost my first pair in the gym.  They are perfect for running/excercising and are loud enough to be heard over most gym equipment.  I never have an issue with them moving at all once on my head and the sound quality does not deminish when you sweat.  For the price, I can't imagine a better pair of headphones for working out.And the fact that I lost my first pair made me all the more comfortable to buy a second set of these.  I could stomach forgetting these at the gym every now and then and still come out well ahead of what I would have spent on a more expensive pair with slightly better sound.

VI had a pair of these given to me as a present about four or five years ago and I absolutely loved them. They fit well around my ears and I could hardly tell I was wearing headphones. The sound quality is amazing in my own opinion, and it has incredible bass features.My first pair finally busted last week and I just purchased another pair. These are definitely headphones I do not want to be without.I should also add in that they only busted because of my own carelessness; the small rubber fittings around the speakers came off and I lost them.  This eventually lead to the speaker wires becoming exposed and they ripped apart in one of the speakers.

VThese Earhooks fit nicely and don't move around when working out which is a big plus (I have fairly big ears and don't notice any discomfort wearing these even for extended periods of time).  Sound quality is very good with good bass and clear treble.  These obviously won't be as good sound-wise as 50-100$ plus headphones but in the $5-15 range I haven't heard a better pair as of yet.  My last pair was the Black SHS3200 which lasted me about 3 years before the left side finally went out so they last a long time as well.Great value and very good sound makes these a great deal.  If you're looking for inexpensive headphones these are a good bet.

VI've been working out in these for couple months now.  They adjusted and fit around my ears perfectly.  Before I had these my regular ear buds were always falling out.  I do about 30 - 40 minutes of cardio and the movement continually jarred them out which is why I bought these to try.  These ones do not fall out.  Even when I sweat they slip a little I push them back in but they don't fall off my ears.  They are still working great and going strong.  I use them for about 1hr 1/2 hours  two to three days a week with my Iphone 4.  The cord is a little long so I wrap it around but not a problem.  I'm only 5'1" so it may not be an issue for everyone.

And, the sound is mediocre at best.I bought them because they were the only 'behind the ear' option and I needed something today that was not bulky - it was an impulse buy. I  had a pair of Sony behind the ear headphones for years that cost about $12 and they were awesome - and much better. I can't recommend these - I got them for $5 and still feel like I should have passed on them.

VI bought these to replace another set of Philps headphones I've been using for over three years.  They held up well, the reason I needed to replace them was the spring in the shirt clip rusted away, and the sound quality in the speaker in the right headphone was beginning to go fuzzy.The replacement set is decent - very good sound quality, and it fits comfortably.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the speakers don't have adjustable tips like the old set had, and it doesn't have a shirt clip.  Not a huge deal, I just use a safety pin to stop the cord from bouncing around, but would have preferred one with a shirt clip.

I have not experienced that at all.Great cheap headphones.

p2454
sg5
VI perched these for the gym.  I am "sorely" disappointed with these headphones.  Maybe someone with large ears would not be caused pain but I was. The earphone part, which should sit in your ear canal, is so large it has to rest against the outside of your ear.  This is not comfortable and does not allow for optimal sound.  These seem to have been made for one specific ear and are ridged.  The connection from the ear hook to the earphone does not "swivel" reducing comfort. The ear hooks were too big they would fall off when doing yoga.I have learned my lesson! Get head phones that are adjustable since everyone's ears are shaped differently!

p2460

VI was cautious buying these earphones, a little suspicious of the $9 price tag, but these have to be the best earphones I've ever used.  I used the Philips SBC-HS430 headphones for a while, thinking that they must have superior bass to any earphones (they were actually called "Super Bass" headphones).  These earphones however seem to have much better bass. The bass pipe definitely makes a difference. They are also extraordinarily loud. I listen to my iPod with the volume less than a tenth of the way up.  I do agree with one of the other reviews though, the comfort of them could be improved if they provided foam covers.  Overall a great product.

I've gone thru different brands in this price range and most sound like total garbage and break in a few months. These one's I've always enjoyed the sound you get for the price and I prefer the over the ear to hold them in place. You get decent sound on the low and high end. For these type of plugs I'd go with no other than these ones. Highly recommend for people that don't want to spend a lot of money, want decent sound, and a plug that stays on your ears that you don't have to keep readjusting.

I thought, maybe its the song or something. It wasn't ntil I checked the volume of the song, 30/30 that I noticed it was very high and ackward that I wasn't able to hear it. Sure enough, only one side of the earpiece was working while the other was not. It's comfortable for my ears, the ear hooks are perfect!But why..WHY would the earpiece not work. :(I'll just purchase them elsewhere along with a different brand. More research I guess.

VI've always had problems with "ear bud" style headphones falling out of my ears. This would happen even while sitting - let alone doing some sort of activity with them in. I was pretty excited when I stumbled along these headphones because of the ear hook attached to them. They fit well and stay in a heck of a lot better than any of my previous sets. I have had them fall out once or twice while running, but it's usually due to my clothing snagging the cord. My only gripe is that the hook starts to hurt my ears after prolonged use. Nothing major, and easily ignorable, but still uncomfortable. I'll buy another set when these get lost or break.

VThese on-ear buds don't grasp or pinch the outer ear. They have an outer breathe hole and the inner sound hole sits nicely just outside; but not into, the ear canal.  The only problem I have after a few years of use is the clip doesn't aim the diaphragm perfect toward the ear canal.  The sound could be clearer and fuller (with more bass) if it were aimed just right.I am able to hear other people in the room I'm in, at times. They stay in place just fine. They are alright for having music piped into your ear canals, but if you want to be immersed, you should look into a set of headphones that can better isolate the source sound.

VI was skeptical about this product b/c I've never owned earphones that wrapped around your ear. I wanted to try them b/c the ones I had (that just go into your ear) were uncomfortable to workout in and would fall out. I've only worn these once so far and already love them. They are super comfy and the cord doesn't tangle too easily. The cord is a tad bit shorter than my other headphones were but still not bad and the sound is a little quieter which isn't a biggie either b/c you just turn up the volume on your ipod a notch or two more than usual. Other than that, they are great... blocks out other noises, fits and stays in, & is comfy :)

VI've been using this brand/style of headphones for years. I've never been able to keep ear buds in place while exercising and these headphones are perfect for that. They're comfortable and fit snuggly in the ears without movement unlike other ear hook headphones I've used. They are also louder than other brands which is good for exercise. These last about a year with regular use--when they do start to go the rubber inner ear piece is usually the first thing to fall off. They're still useable after that but less comfortable. Eventually the audio will stop working on one side, but this is all after regular use for a year (give or take).

VSo the sound quality is really good, nice and loud and for me sometimes can drown outside loud noises. The problem I have with them though is they are too big, maybe my ears are small I dont know, but they dont fit snug at all. They are loose, and sometimes fall off when I run,or are about to and I have to push it back on my ear more securely. I try to squeeze them together kind of like when you squeeze the hook earrings to make them fit tighter because you lost the back clear piece,lol. But they dont really stay even when thats done, but overall if not for the loose fit, the sound quality is definitely very good. I give it 3 stars.

VI enjoyed these headphones for around eight months before the rubber circular pads came unglued & began falling off in my bag when they weren't in use. It was annoying to have to hunt around for them, but they could easily be put back on. However, eventually the speakers themselves came unglued as well, without the rubber pads to hold them in. Eventually, one of the speakers fell out, the cord got hooked on a pen, & broke.For the cost, these phones have pretty good sound quality, with a slight weakness in bass.The comfort was another con. After 20 minutes or so, I'd feel a hot irritation in my inner ear area.

Before this I had the Nike hook headphones and those stayed in with no problem.  Those wound up breaking (I had them for 2 years) so I purchsed these at Wal-Mart for only $9 and some change.

The sound quality is average. I liked these earbuds so much that I purchased a pair for my girlfriend, who is smaller than me, and the earbuds were not a good fit for her. She constantly had trouble getting the earbuds to stay on her ears. They would fall off while she was jogging because her ears were to small for the earhook piece to hold on to. I recommend these earbuds to men who are looking for an average pair of earbuds at a cheap price.

At times, these headphones may as well be underwater, but they keep on working just fine!

I run all year round in every kind of weather including downpours so these get wet and they still work. When I am running a marathon or really long runs they don't pop out of my ear or come off unless I want to take them off -- that's a bonus for me, I can't be messing with my headphones when I am running. The sound is good and the price is very good. I highly recommend them.

VIf you want a cheap pair of headphones, these are for you.  They arent at a Bose level in terms of sound and overall quality, but if you want something that is great for a work out, these are what you want.  They are comfortable enough in design and the over the ear part keeps the speakers in nice.  They are cheap so if you, sweat in them, break them, or otherwise destroy them as part of a workout, no big deal.  They sound good enough so listening to tunes or audio books are also good.  I have had mine for over a year and now they are starting to sound a little 'tin' like, so I will soon be ordering a new pair.

VGreat Pair of earphones
p2593
sg5
VThese earphones are great. This is my 2nd pair (I stepped on the 1st pair on accident) and I love them. Although they are so great, after very long use, they hurt the insided of my ear so maybe the buds would be more comfortable. If anyone has tried those, please let me know how the feel. Now, I've used these earphones running, working out, and even while riding my motorcycle with my helmet on and they stay in place. I wouldn't say my ears are large, probably normal size so I wouldn't know how they would work out for those with smaller ears. Overall, these are a great pair of earphones especially for the cost.

VHeadphones arrived right on time (I have free 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime). They are a little large for my ears, but they do stay on. I deducted two stars because the first time I used them the right speaker did not work. The sound from the left speaker is great, which is why I didn't give it only one star. I am disappointed that they came defective.Update: Turns out I was a bit hasty in posting my review! I tried the headphones with a different device and both speakers worked! The right speaker was still quieter than the left, but the sound quality was great when I was watching an episode of a tv show.

VI bought a pair of these Phillips clip-ons in black in the store before and loved them for my MP3 player which I use daily. After a few years they bit the dust, which was to be expected since daily use imparts quite a bit of wear and tear so I looked around but couldn't find them in local stores and I tried some other kind. Well now I just appreciate these all the more... Their comfort and sound quality are top-notch. Even after hours of having them in they offer no discomfort, in fact, most of the time I can't even feel them. They have a rich sound and a great bass response for their size, too. I love them.

VA bit uncomfortable honestly. Like a lot of people, my apple headphones were on their last leg so I got these as a replacement. I have been using them for a day and I knew the apple headphones were going to be more comfortable since the shape of the headphones are curved better for your ear but these are just straight up uncomfortable. I have average, if not slightly big ears and even these are too big for me. I almost have to force these in my ear and doing so causes pain overtime in my ear canal. Not worth paying to return these but they will probably end up in the trash once I find a better replacement.

VI'm pretty hard on portable earphones like these, using them daily while active in chores or exercise. I needed a new set because sooner or later (usually sooner), whatever earphones I have will stop working, usually due to the wires at the plug wearing out.The price on this Philips model was right, and I'm very pleased with the sound quality. Very clear and high fidelity. I'm mostly listening to podcasts or web radio, and the spoken voices are very clear -- as if the speaker is in the room with me.For less than $10, these are a great value. I hope the wires will last on this model!

VThe sound quality of the headphones are great. I have no complaints there. However one of the biggest downfalls of these headphones are they are painful to wear! They are not very well designed to fit the shape of the ear. I understand if they are made "snug" to keep from falling out, but I almost cannot bear to wear them! If I had known this before opening the box, I would've sent the product back immediately. So please consider this before purchasing the headphones. (Side note, I do not know if women simply have smaller ears, but keep in mind I am a female. Males might be able to wear these comfortably.)

The only thing that is a slight problem is they don't always stay on my ears. I kid you not when I say I have REALLY small ears so they slip off at times. At times I put my headband over the very top of my ears and that helps to keep them in place :-) These will be probably the best pair a earphones you buy for this price so I say go for it!!!

They feel to big and do not stay in place. I have normal sized ears however to check this i asked two of my friends to try them on. Same result. So I tried wearing them and listening to music and then I feel an electric pulse in my left ear. (I dont know, maybe there was a lose wire). I should return these but looking at them makes me mad so I have put them in a drawer and refused to acknowledge that I wasted $10. I hope you get better pair

I can hear all parts of the music, and can still hear things around me just enough to keep me from getting hit by cars when I go running outside.It's $10, so if you're even bothering to look at them, pull the trigger.

The Brookstones have a cupped contact pod, that is so comfortable as to feel like it's not there, the technology provides a far superior sound experience.  THese Philips, while practical, do not provide anything above the standard apple ear bud quality.  What really sucks, for me, is that the ear clips aggravate the back of my ears.  again, not a problem with the brookstones.  guess i'm going to have to shell out another $30 @ teh stone :-(

He decided to just go ahead and buy another pair of these and is happy to report that they still work as well as the first pair that lasted so long.These saw him through a couple of half marathons as well as all the running he's done before and since.

p2663

VI've tried many sport headphones to use while running. The in-ear style doesn't work for me - either they go in too deep and I feel like I'm inside of a fishtank, or they don't stay snug and have to be fussed with many times during a run.These sit perfectly adjacent to my ear drums. They don't block external noise so I can still hear cars. They produce enough volume so that I can still hear my music or podcasts even on a well-trafficked street if I turn the volume up. They never come loose or need adjustment mid-run. They are ideal for my needs, and I hope they are made into eternity!

VGot this pair primarily for gym use. The hooks are flexible and fits well. The absence of a cushion, however, does give a minor discomfort after a prolonged use. I like the fact that I can wear it with my glasses on. There is a tendency to entangle with the hook, so you need to be a little creative in the way you wind the wire to store it. Lately, I have been getting occasional minor tiny shocks in the right earpiece. Not sure why, but this happens with a number of players, so it is certainly the headphones that are probably leaking some current. Otherwise, it's a good set at a very good price.

They stick to your ears, are comfortable to the point of being unnoticeable, they produce excellent sound with powerful base. They usually wear on me after 1 year which is more than good for the quality and price. I have a few pairs lined up as I'm definitely never changing this brand.Thank You Philips!

VI needed a sturdy pair of headphones for running that wouldn't pop out of my ears, so I ordered these since my father has a pair. Let it be known that if you have tiny ears, stay away. They aren't adjustable and the headphones are actually REALLY thick. They wouldn't even fit in my tiny ears, and it was pointless having the wrap-around as my ears were too little.I'd be wary of ordering these if your ears are really big or really small, as I don't think they'd fit you well. I'd leave a review on how they sound, but since I couldn't even get them in, that's not really possible.

I feel like all these are made for a big man.  Hello electronics companies.....women like to hear music while they work out too.  They are ok if I am sitting still, but the second I start jogging off they come :(  On the positive side, the sound quality is nice.  If you have big man ears they are great.

VDurability is my single biggest complaint regarding headphones. Depending how well you treat them, on the low to mid price range side, I'd say the lifespan of headphones averages anywhere from 8 months to a year. Well two plus months-in, these just went through a full wash cycle and an industrial dryer on high for 50 mins but still sound as if they hadn't. I thought if the suds didn't break them, the high heat would've at least messed with the magnetic element in the buds. Nope, still working fine thank you. Durability and a pretty decent sound make these a solid purchase in my book.

If I'm just chilling out I can use those other earphone but for working out these are my dependable, go to earphones. I'm on my third pair as they only last for a year or so.

I can barely hear most of the music I've tried to play through, especially higher pitches.  I've taken to not listening to music at all until I get my usual headphones replaced.For the second point: uncomfortable.  It's hard plastic that gets shoved into your earhole.  The hooks are too big to hold them in place, so they slide around in your ears.Stay away from these!

VI should have listened to all the reviews saying these are uncomfortable and too big for people's ears. I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews. The thing is, it's not the ear hook that is too big, it's the sound drum itself - which needs to sit in your ear and is a large, hard plastic circle. Imagine putting a US dime in your ear. After an hour like that my ear was sore and painful from the pressure the large drums put on it. They should have contoured it to fit the shape of the ear.Take a look instead at the Sony MDR-J10, or any of the JVC sports clip headphones.

VWent from adjusting my old earbuds about forty times on a typical hour-long walk to ZERO.  I don't even notice these earbuds: they're lightweight, stay in place, and the sound quality is good.  What I notice about the sound is that it's crisp.  I can hear all of the different instruments and voice.  I think one reviewer described a "tinny" sound.  If you're looking for booming bass, perhaps these aren't the earbuds for you.  If you're looking for earbuds to wear during a workout that stay in place, are unobtrusive, provide good sound and are inexpensive, look no further.

I don't care that the description says, "earhook ensures secure fit in all ear sizes"  ... NOPE, not even close. The little not-in-ear speakers sit in front of the ears by about an inch. Handy, if your sideburns do your listening for you.  If Amazon allowed returns of electronics, these would be going back for 1) not matching the description, and 2) being completely useless.

VLasted a year; great for running
p2781
sg5
VAbout to purchase my second pair.Pros:1. Lifetime: First one lasted for almost exactly a year. Having the extra piece of plastic covering near headphone jack definitely helped extend its lifetime. After that broke, it took several months for the wires to become exposed and the headphones to stop working.2. Grip: They're very lightweight and comfortable, and do not fall out of ears while running.Con: The little round pieces of rubber covering the earbuds fall off more often than I would like. Apart from that, a great purchase for the price.

VI like Philips earphones, I have a PHILIPS SHE9500/27 In-Ear Headphones as my primary in-ear headphones, and I wanted something similar to run with.On the whole. I am reasonably satisfied with these earphones. They grip well, and have never fallen out yet while I am running. The hard plastic can get a little irritating against your ear though. Sound is not bad, but the bass is definitely much lower than I was expecting. Having said that, mids are good and it is definitely not tinny. Overall, these are a decent pair of headphones for the price.

VI bought these earphones because the one's that came with my iPod shuffle were annoying me and wouldn't stay in my ear. At first it took sometime to get adjusted to them (they would hurt my ears) but after awhile I didn't even feel them. The sound was outstanding for a $10 earphone but they only have a short span (approximately 10 months). Well, come to think of it, I did use them a lot everyday and they took a lot of beating (I constantly travel and would place them in my pocket or backpack). These earphones were so great that I am going to purchase another set as a backup.

VMake sure you have big (rabbit?) ears/helices!
p2798
sg5
VIt has OK sound quality. Diameter across base of helix of each ear needs to be >1 inch (2.5 cm) or distance from center of outer (ext auditory meatus) to top helix should be >40 cm. Ok not quite a rabbit's ear-but it's an important consideration for this headset. Would have been better if this loop was somewhat elastic or derformable with a  smaller resting sizing to fit snugly around a wider range of ear lobes without falling off during activities such as running. Interruptions to fix your headset can be deal breaker.Sum: Good value, but you need BIG ears....

VWhen U first got the headphones I was excited because my ipod headphones are SHOT and slowly dwindling away.  I tried them on immediately and found them very comfortable and easy to use. When I wore them for an extended period of time i found that the ear piece pressed on the inner part of cartilage in my ear.  That is my only complaint, but maybe I have funny ears. The sound is great and the fact that they wrap around is fantastic because i move alot and i don't have to worry about them falling out of my ear. Plus you can't really beat the price for Phillips headphones.

I've been using this for as long as they've been making it, and it's been perfect at all of that.

VUnder $9 with free delivery with prime. Great little pair of headsets for running or the gym. I am a 34 year old white male with 2 10" subwoofers in my F250. To put some perspective on it I like music to sound good but I do not need a pair of Beats by Dre or M50 headphones to go to the gym. They are plenty loud enough.  My original pair is black and 3 years old. I bought a white pair 3 months ago. Today I bought 3 white pair to keep in each one of my vehicles. if your like me you will probably lose them or somebody will borrow them forever before they malfunction.

VI'm pretty happy with these headphones, been using them for over 4 years as my workout headphones. They've been completely drenched in sweat (and even survived a trip through the washer) and they still sound fine. At least good enough to work out with. I can't use regular earbuds and work out because they always fall out, so the little hooks on these have been clutch. Super durable too, I like the soft rubber or whatever that material is in comparison to stiffer plastics that similar headphones buy. For the money, I pretty much can't imagine better workout headphones.

(constant sweat and even run in the rain on occasion plus I wrap them everytime I am done running) I have bought several types of more expensive ear pieces and none of them compare to the comfort and sound quality I get from these low cost earhooks. I highly reccomend this product and company. They arrived just as promised and were in the OEM packages.

Sometimes they last several months to a year, sometimes they last a month, but eventually either one of the wires into one of the earbuds stops working, the cover falls off of one of the earbuds, or the wires connected to the male jack stop working.All that and I am still buying them because I am not convinced a pair that is 10x more expensive would last even 5x longer.

VI bought these to use while running, as the earbuds that came with my iPod were always popping out.  I figured the over-the-ear design of these would keep them secure.  I was wrong.  The earbuds on these are huge, and don't even fit in my ears.  The hooks are also too large and not secure - they do not have any wire so that you can bend them to the appropriate shape or anything.  I have managed to use them by threading them through my headband when I run, so that my headband keeps them in place next to my ears, but I'll stay on the lookout for some that actually fit.

The price is great, and the sound quality is the best I've heard out of dozens of pairs I have tried. Also, the behind the ear clip is subtle and not awkward looking once on, and they stay on in the harshest of conditions. Literally my favorite pair of earbuds.

VI've purchased this over a year ago (for $6) and used it to train and run a few half-marathons. I've also slept with the headphones on many occasions without any problems. In one occasion the headphone had fallen on the ground in front of my house and I didn't find it until a day later. Sadly the headphone was crushed due to a car/cars running over it. However to my amazement, after I glued the pieces together, it worked perfectly as if nothing had happened. I used it for another six months or so until they finally gave-up. Definitely ordering another one of these.

I would recommend them to anyone looking for a durable great priced headphone.

Like all headphones, they eventually break after heavy use.  I am on my third pair in about a year, but definitely go with these as opposed to more expensive ones if you are using them for heavy cardio.  I had a pair of Sennheisers that cost a lot more and lasted negligibly longer.

So far I have not had any problems with these and I've been using them almost everyday for the past 3 weeks. The loops are made of soft plastic and the ear buds have a metal mesh. I wear glasses and these do not pinch my ears at all. For the price these were a good deal.

For some reason they don't stay on my ears and keep on falling, they did not stay on for longer then a minute...Although I have to mention that while walking they are OK, it is only when I start running I can't keep them on.

Even with the improper size, they don't often slip off my ears unless tugged.EDIT: Dropping the review from 4 stars to 2 because the soft plastic that goes over the screen on the actual earbud came off only a month in. Since I didn't notice it happening, the piece is lost to me and that earbud is far too uncomfortable to put in without it so I'm essentially down one earbud.

VFor the price, usually about $10 or so, they're very good. I wear these mostly at the gym and between the elliptical, treadmill and weightlifting, they take a beating and usually last about a year before one speaker doesn't work much anymore or they get that static sound when the wire doesn't connect well into my mp3. The sound is good for what it is. The only negative is that the wires do tangle a bit especially with the different wires it uses now compared to their version a year or two back. Considering the price though, it's a minor complaint.

VI didn't think I could go wrong with these but they are so darn uncomfortable, I can't use them. I liked the simplicity of the design having had similar ear phones but these simply hurt. I can wear them for about 30 minutes before I just have to get them off. The hook piece is too small or the curve isn't compatible causing the ear insert to press painfully. After I remove them my ears ache.I think these would be fine otherwise but fyi as I was surprised to have this issue given I have worn a number of these styles of ear phones in the past.

VI love these headphones for running.  The over the head style with the foam padding are horrible and I was have a time fining are replacement.  I found these and knew they were what I was looking for.  I actually purchased two pair.  The sound is actually great for running as I do not expect theater quality sound as expressed by others.  You will get a good quality sound for the full range and no the bass will not be accentuated.  Now to avoid being arrested by the Austin, TX police department for not being able to hear them while wearing these.

I wore them for 6 hours straight WHILE WEARING EYEGLASSES and forgot that I had them on most of the time - very comfortable.  I got these at WalMart on Black Friday for 5 dollars.

VThese stay in place during aerobic workouts, and the sound quality is good, although not as good as the buds that come with the iPod. The only issue I have with them is mild discomfort, as the buds themselves are a little large for my ears (I'm female with average or maybe a bit smaller than average ears) and so cause some soreness. The cord length is generous, which is nice if you like to set your iPod on the machine's control deck rather than wearing it on your person. These are a great value for decent quality sound during bouncy workouts.

VPro - Pretty good sounds comes out of these.Cons - Not good for working out. They let in way too much outside noise. In a busy gym with music and people talking, you will hear the outside noise.. Also I could not get these to stay fitted snugly in my ears during workouts where I'm just lifting weights and not running or performing any rapid movement exercises. When I sweat it made keeping the headphones in my ears even worse. All in all this headphone is best when you are sitting still in a quiet environment and not much else.

VI've tried at least 10 headset/ear buds and these are the best I have found for running.  The sounds is good, not stellar but very decent considering the price and intended use.  I always fought keeping earbuds in while running and tried several styles until finding a review on these at Runners World.  What made me really appreciate them again was loosing my last set after a year of use and trying to use yet another sports style ear bud w/ a hook.  After being annoyed for two weeks I went back to the old reliable cost effective Phillips.

I actually prefer sports style headphones as I can keep one side on and one side off so as not to shut out the world while walking the dog or running at gym, but have had problems finding a good fit / low price combo as of late as Sony doubled their price for my favorite model.Le sigh, these are cheap, fit great and have more than satisfactory sound.

VI've tried some slightly more expensive earphones for gym use that fit better, and they crapped out almost immediately. These have been going solid for a couple months now, with no sound issues. They aren't the most comfortable fit, but they do stay put unless I actually knock something (hand, workout equipment, etc) against them. They don't fall out of my ears while running, which is really the whole point of my purchase. I'll likely buy a new pair after the current ones get too gross, and continue to use them for specialized gym use.

VAdmittedly, I have very small ears, which is why I was hoping the headphones with earhooks would help them stay in my ears when I'm running. These were actually worse than the headphones that came with my smart phone in terms of staying in my ears. Not only is the earbud large, but the hook part was way too tall for my ears. I tried bending them every which away with no luck. I even tried sliding the hook part through my hair to keep it in place. No luck.The sound quality was good, but I would not recommend these due to the size.

Good value,  Excellent sound quality, good bass and they stay put when i'm physically active which is the reason i purchased them in the first place several years ago. I usually place my mp3 player in the front pocket of my shorts and run  the cords behind my head, down my back and under my shirt.  This really keeps the cords out of the way of snagging on stuff when being active, which snags are felt more with earhook style headphones.

VBest workout headphones ever. Just buy the little foam/sponge earpads. It actually improves sound quality by giving you a more sealed fit and makes wearing it more comfortable, but as a gym headphones you are gonna lose and destroy those sponges a lot so get a few replacements.Also, these headphones, if they get a hard tug, the wire tends to separate from the jack, so take a little Krazy Glue (or glue of your choice) and put it at the point where the wire enters the jack, increases durability of the headphones 100 times.

VFirst purchased these several years ago and lost them during a move. The last set was purchased two years ago and used almost daily until I knocked one of the ear bud pieces off and couldn't find it. Like them so much that I ordered the exact same thing yet again. They are great if you don't want ear buds that sick into your ears. These are perfect for working out and don't eliminate outside noise as much as the "in ear" buds do. This is great for running or bicycling where you still need to hear what is going on around you.

VFirstly, when I got the box, it was taped together and had been opened before.  I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning them since I'd have to pay for shipping, so I just sanitized them and tried them on.  Unfortunately, the fit was very poor - the buds are larger and bulkier than other buds (like Skullcandy or the Apple earbuds), and the earhooks had no traction.  I tried moving in them and they fell right off.  They might work for someone else, but the packaging and fit were both expected and not what I was looking for.

These solved the problem.  They stay in very well and have a good sound quality.  It takes a full four hours before they start to get on my nerves or hurt a little so it went way beyond my expectations.  I am able to run the long cord down inside my shirt to the MP3 player clipped on my running shorts with only a foot or two extra cord leftover.

VI'd give it a higher score if they fit my ears properly. They are too big and don't loop around my ears but stick out oddly. I bought these as a backup thankfully but it's still highly irritating.

I might just give them away and buy something else.Otherwise they work fine for me. Nothing fancy or crazy awesome. Just a pair of headphones for the average buyer who should probably have big ears.

VDecided to give these a try once again, after one ear bud stopped working on my last pair of these.

I bought two pairs (that speaks to my lack of faith in them working properly, not my allegiance to the brand), so I'm curious to see if the other pair is busted upon opening as well. My recommendation would be to spend a bit more and get a lasting pair of earbuds.

I've always had small ears, most earbuds don't fit me, and these definitely are way too big for my ears. I couldn't even get the bud in my ear and the hooks were so big they were well over a finger-width above my ear and couldn't hook around. I would have sent these back, but I just gave them to my friend as a spare pair.

Given that's several hundred sessions, I'd rate these very highly in durability. Good value for the price. I would rate them higher if not for the lack of bass response.

p3153

VI purchased these to replace some Sony headphones. The fit is tight and secure, better than the Sony ones. The sound is also fine. The only complaint I have about these headphones is that when your body produces static electricity for whatever reason (e.g., friction on certain fabrics), the electricity conducts to your ear canal. This is often annoying, but sometimes actually slightly painful. I've never used headphones that did this. Not a problem when stationary, but can be problematic when walking around, running, etc.

My left ead bud keeps falling off in spite of repeated attempts to keep em on while jogging.Recommendations:If you have large ears, its worth a buy, otherwise, not a good fit.Maybe if they came in various sizes, they are a good buy but I guess the size available here is for ALL ears.

VMaybe I Should Buy New Ears
p3187
sg5
VI had the feeling they wouldn't fit the minute I looked at them. The hook material isn't as flexible or adjustable as other reviews/the product claims it to be. I bought these to go running in and they somehow fall out easier than regular earbuds (aka the ones that don't go into the ear). I'd say my ears are medium sized-ish so I was under the impression they'd work well. Its likely the fact the running involves more motion and movement than these were designed for. Oh well.But the sound quality isn't bad!

VI agree wholeheartedly with another recent review stating these are their favorite.  I have also used for years and years, and love how they sound, stay in your years, and also don't lock in moisture in your ears.  I find that a lot of smaller devices cannot drive enough power to fancier headphones, but these work great for lower power devices.  They also sound decent, stay comfortable in/on your ear for a couple-few hours at a stretch, stay on your ear, and are priced very reasonably.  And now they come in white too!

VI have had the same headphones for 3 years and I have been looking for a replacement. I tried 4 other headphones and none of them felt as comfortable as these. So I went on Amazon and bought the same pair again, but white this time.The fit and comfort is spectacular. The audio quality is definitely enough for my needs (I am no audiophile, though).Philips has changed the jack from being 90 degrees to straight out. You might like it or it might be an annoyance depending on the device that you plug this into.

VWhen doing my search I specifically checked the option for "microphone".  I had been searching for a while so I think I was just tired and missed the fact that these DONT HAVE A MICROPHONE.  My fault.  Having an extra pair of headphones is OK - if they actuall fit my ears.  I've had a couple pairs of ear hooks and never had a fit problem.  My ears would have to be at least an inch bigger for these to fit.  They are now in a ball in my junk drawer.  Maybe a giant will visit one day and I can give them to him.

VI love these types of headphones, and I buy them over and over.  They don't last forever--but then again, I wouldn't expect a $10-15 pair to. They typically last about a year (I mainly use them when working out), and then one side will go out.Despite that fact, I still give them a five-star review because of the value for the price. They work very well and never come off my ears when I work out.  I've never been able to get the plain earbud pieces to stay while running, so this model is a welcome relief!

VAfter reading all the reviews on these and several competing products, I decided to give these headphones a try.  While the sound quality is great, they often fall off my ear while I'm running.  I've followed the recommendations to insert the ear piece first and then pull the back part around my ear and sometimes it will stay in place, but often it does not.  There is nothing more frustrating then having to stop in the middle of a run to put your headphone back on.  Still on the search for a great set of headphones.

VFor the price, these are great for running and working out. I don't have to worry about accidentally destroying them. They stay on really well and have decent sound quality. I also like the fact that they don't plug the ear the way some earbuds do. The problem there is that, while the ear-plug-type buds DO provide better sound quality, they cut out important environmental noise (e.g. the car that you're trying to avoid getting hit buy, the occasional off-leash dog chasing you). I love them and would buy them again.

VI liked the design of these headphones and thought the sound quality was good for the price. They only lasted 3 months for me. I don't think I was especially hard on them. While I did keep them rolled up in my front pocket or in my backpack usually containing nothing heavier than a notebook, I didn't think they'd fall apart on me. The rubber outer covers that go into your ears kept falling off. Then the glue wore off on whatever the metal component is called that projects the sound. Now they're pretty much useless.

These headphones stand up the the abuse put on them 3-4 times a week and with all the stretching and pulling i put on the wires, the ear-buds don't come out and the sound quality, although a bit weak on bass compared to my bose set, is perfect for running around.

VI've owned a single pair of these headphones for about a year now and they're still working very well. I use them usually on a daily basis.The plastic can be kind of irritating to the curve of the inner ear if you wear them for too long. A solution I've found is to purchase earbud covers, and that helps with the cold plastic discomfort immensely.Other than that these headphones are great! they stay wrapped around my ear and I can still hear sound evenly out of them after a full year of use

These headphones are great for anyone because unlike other regular headphones that just go into your ear, this one hooks around it as well. It's great for running because you don't have to worry about it falling out, and for me it doesn't hurt after I pull them out. The shipping was very fast and the quality of these headphones are outstanding. I would recommend these to anyone that wants a simple, not expensive headphone.

VI have normal ears.  They are pretty accommodating when it comes to headphones.While these have passable quality,  they are simply not shaped well for comfort.  The round part of the bud is just too much for the ear to stretch around.  Even when they are just lightly hooked on, my ears soon after start aching from the bud.  Any further out of my eat and you can't hear anything.Sony makes a great over ear headphone for the money.  I thought I was saving a couple bucks and now I regret it.

These ones fall off within minutes (despite the around the ear portion), even though I have only worn them sitting at my desk.  The only way to get them to stay in for a few minutes is to try and jam them into the ear so hard that it hurts.  Bottom line - it's a bad design and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it!  Go get an equivalent Sony product instead.

The fit wasn't bad and they definitely stayed put while working out, but I might as well throw these headphones out now because I'm not willing to put up with being shocked.  Awful product!

Will buy them instead.  Will never purchase a set like this again. Might as well get something from dollar store if you're going to get something crappy.

VThese headphones all over are good. The sound is clear and loud. Also, they are great for staying in your ears. However, I jump rope a lot for excercise and when I put these headphones in, they tend to fall out as I am junping for 5 minutes at a time. I tuck them into my hair so they don't fall out but it happens sometimes anyways. But, overall they are very nice headphones that are cheap and durable. I have had them for quite some time now and they are still going strong. nice headphones

VI purchased these headphones at a discount store and they worked fine for a while...I used them while using a treadmill, walking or skiing (with a helmet on).  Unfortunately I am now searching for new headphones, as the left earbud wire has failed.  If I wiggle the wire around at the jack connection, I sometimes get sound.  It is not the jack (which fits snuggly) but the wire connection inside the cable. I never mishandled or treated them roughly.  Seems like you get what you pay for...

These earhook headphones get the job done, they stay on for my cardio work outs. In addition, the sound quality is quite good. Compared to my previous ear buds, the magnitude of the volume is greater. The only problem I have is that they are not the most comfortable, but I guess that is hard to find in headphones especially when engaging in movement!

VI'm pretty critical of my body but the one body part I've never felt bad about are my ears.  They are neither big or small.  They don't stick out, they don't sit oddly close to my head.  They are all around very average ears but these headphones don't work for me.  The part that is supposed to go behind my ear just slips off - it seems like maybe they are too big?  Not sure.  Sound quality is similar or better than standard ipod ear buds but since these won't stay on, there's no point.

Music, however, sounds a bit tinny.  If you primarily want to listen to music, you may want to get something of higher quality.

The sound quality is not the best, but it is fine for morning and evening runs when there isn't much noise to drown them out.

My husband only uses these when he runs or does yard work. The sound quality is more than adequate for those situations. The earhooks are comfortable & stay in place. He has no complaints.

I'm not sure if the loudness will be satisfactory since I haven't tried them while mowing the lawn yet, but that will be an important consideration.

VDr. Dre has nothing on these headphones. These are the only headphones that I use and they sound great, have an air channel for the bass.Do not be thrown away by the low price. I had to purchase a new pare of these after the ones that i had for 3 years got too much lint and wax in the speakers.I had them in my jeans pocket walking to school, work, in the rain, snow, and heat.they last a remarkably long time for the price.

Vfor large ears
p3620
sg5
VThese earphones are fine, but are designed to fit a large ear.  Because the speakers sit so low, I have to crank the volume to such a high level that people nearby can hear.  Flexible does not mean that the earhooks can be bent to better fit the ear.I have since purchased a pair of Skullcandy earhook headphones - the earhook is less bulky and wraps the ear more snuggly, and the speaker stem is adjustable in length for a better match to ear size.

VI was looking for a good pair of headphones for running to replace the ipod originals.  After using several models I finally bought the Phillips.  I finally found a decent pair! the search is over.  They are very confortable with a decent sound quality.  The only thing I do not like much is the cord but for the price I could not expect more.  So fat I've been able to run for 8 miles without stopping to fix my earphones.  I have small ears and they fit well.

VOnce again, not the solution for small ears
p3637
sg5
VI have ears that spit out earbuds and they're also apparently smaller than average. Despite the claim that these earhooks are flexible enough to fit all shapes and sizes, they're not. If I have the speaker parts comfortably in my ears, the top part that is supposed to hook over the top of my ear is too high, and constantly falls off unless I wear a hairband to bind them to my head. Very frustrating. Why won't anyone make these things in different sizes??

I bought these because I had read positive reviews.  I think my mishap was just me getting used to them rather than a product defect.  I like them because they do wrap around the ear and because they are flexible they don't pinch or hurt the ear either which is nice.

p3649
sg5
VTerrible quality. Certainly not flexible. The ear hooks are huge, and to tilt them back far enough to actually touch the ear is also far enough to yank the buds from your ears, as they do not rotate or flex in any way. The buds are also very hard and not cushioned, quite uncomfortable. I wanted to return them, but the return is over $6 to ship, not even worth it. If you buy these you'll end up with a useless product cluttering a desk for no good reason.

VI bought these to use while I ran as earbuds always fall out of my ears. They work and stay in my ears. I haven't had the 'shocking after sweating' problem - I'm an average sweater, but not profusely I guess. They seem to work well. My only qualm is that the cord seems slightly short to hook to an iPod Nano on my shorts. I pull the cord under my shirt and it has a tenancy to snag on occasion. Overall, for the price, they stay in place and sound decent.

VThese have an excellent sound, much better than the earbuds.  I had to turn my iPod way down when I put these on.  Only thing I wasn't thrilled about is they fit inside the ear like the earbuds and it can get a little uncomfortable after a while.  But because the sound is soooo good I don't have to push them all the way in the ear so I can get around the comfort issue.Now I'd like to find a similar product but that fits on the ear rather than inside.

This pair lasted six months before the foam washer, that keeps the inside of your ear from getting scratched, fell off and was lost. I'll have to buy a new pair because I need them, but I wish Philips would use stronger glue or sell a replacement packet of the washers.

Which wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't purchased these solely for use while exercising.

VFor 10$ there are very few other headphones that offer this much bass. although i'm not an audiophile, the sound of these compared to over-ear headphones is actually somewhat bearable.  these in general are good headphones, and are actually good for the price you can get them for. I've bought maybe 6 pairs through the last 6 years, and they've upgraded the cord and the sheathing underneath, so these are far more durable than other pairs.

VTo the point:  These are very affordable good looking headphones but the sound quality is just not worth it.  There just is no bass coming out of these things, the mid levels are weak and that makes the sound well incomplete.

VThese headphones are incredibly comfortable to wear.  I have fairly big ears, and normal earbuds don't stand a chance at staying in, so I had to go with the over the ear variety.  I've bought three pairs of these at this point, and have been quite happy with all of them.The only caveat is that the shape of it near the ear makes this whistling sound when I'm wearing them for a run (I'm pretty sure I'm not running THAT fast).

I've gone through a few pairs of these over the past 5 years (wear and tear) but Philips is usually good at sending a pair to you for free if something happens within a year of purchase. The sound is good. Only change I would make for these is to have the cable lenght be a little longer.

I am not sure there are any headphones out there that last more than 2 years so for the price, these are just ok

Be cautious when getting these unless you know from past experience that they will fit your ears perfectly.

I had to buy a new one because I lost one of the rubber circles that goes around the earphone. But when I bought this one, I noticed that on the right earphone, there is a buzzing noise when I'm listening to any speech audio, and it's very annoying. I am disappointed. Be wary when buying this, as it may be defective.

VI love these headphones.  I use them everyday walking to and from school as well as when exercising.  I don't store them all that well but they still usually last me a couple of years.  I just bought my 3rd set.Some people complain these headphones are for people with big ears.  I'm 6'5, so I'm big in general and these fit me very well--so they might not be for small people.  Great sound and very comfortable for me.

VDoes The Job - Stays In Place When Working Out
p4075
sg5
VI bought these for working out, and for that, these headphones are fine. I have small ear canals and bud type headphones don't stay in for long - especially during physical activity. With hooks I don't need to worry about that. They're actually pretty comfortable - you don't really feel them. Sound quality is average. If you're looking for a cheap pair of headphones for the gym I don't think you can go wrong with these.

p4081

VMy ears are too small for this product.  With the earbud in my ear, the "hook" doesn't make contact with any part of the back of my ear.  I bought them for running and spent the first 5 minutes of my run trying to figure out how to get them on.  When I finally realized they were too big I hooked them onto my ears and ran with them with the earbud part out of my ear canal (even though I couldn't hear my music very well).

VI give these a low rating entirely because they are so uncomfortable. I can only stand to wear them for about an hour and half before they start really hurting my ears. I've never encountered that problem before with other earbud headphones, so I think my ears are pretty average sized. On the plus side, they have pretty good sound quality for $10, and they stay in place while running and lifting at the gym really well.

Vearphones are fantastic, especially for someone who hates having to repeatedly stuff earbuds in their ears. These are great quality, last through everything (except accidentally leaving them in a pocket and running them through the wash) and still have very good sound quality. Although they're perhaps not very good at canceling out continuous noise (such as on a plane), for everyday use or at the gym they are perfect.

VPhilips Design Problem with SHS3200 Earhook Headphone
p4109
sg5
VI have purchased 3 or 4 sets of the Philips SHS3200 earhook headphones. They work fine for a while until the rubber piece around the earbud gets lost. Then without this cushion, they are very uncomfortable. Philips does not seem to be able to provide this replacement part. I guess I am not very smart for buying 3 or 4 of these headphones. The "shame on me" story. Philips has a design problem with this product.

Only drawback is the behind-ear design gets quite sweaty.  Hopefully they prove durable.

VThe Headphones create a electrical shock because the sound conductor was made of metal. At the same time, the wiring in the ear piece can fall out very easily. Although this is a cheap product with ok sound, the durability of the product does not last very long. It lasted for 3 months for me. They also have a tendency of having this crackling sounds from the headphones. BUYER BEWARE, IF YOU BUY CHEAP, YOU GET CHEAP.

VThe sound quality is surprisingly good, considering the price (at least to my ears).  The big problem with it is the speakers are in a fixed position and do not sit flush against the opening to my ear canal.  This allows outside sounds to compete with the sound I'm trying to listen to.  If you don't mind listening to a combination of your music and the music being played over the external PA system they're great.

If you are just sitting still and listening to music, it would probably work just fine for you.

VI was looking for headphones because my other pair was worn out. When I saw these they looked perfect until I put them on. They fit wrong on my ears and even when I can convince them not to fall off it is still uncomfortable. I tried to do it the way the packaging says but they still didn't stay on for my entire bus ride to work. The sound is fine but the fit is what ruins these headphones.*Maddy*

VGreat Banf For The Buck
p4303
sg5
VConsidering the price, the sound is quite good.  Ear buds do not fit in my ears so these are great for me as they sit right outside the ear.  The loops keep them on your ear.  I have bought at least 8 of these over the years.  I sleep with them on and they ultimately break.  This is not the fault of the product but solely a result of rough usage-any ear piece will eventually break when you lie on it.

I messed with them forever before my run and followed the specific instructions on putting them on. Let's just say within 3 minutes of my run I threw them in the woods! (don't worry I didn't litter..I picked them up on my way back)

VI basically bought these to go running with.  I was replacing Sony over the ear headphones that I've used and liked a lot.  But after a few years, there was no sound in one headphone.  Well, anyways, I thought these would be perfect for running.  I was wrong.  They would not stay in my ears while I was moving.  Plus they don't feel comfortable at all when you put it in.  I think I'll go back to Sony.

Well priced, durable and lasts for more than 9 months.

They are comfortable and fit great in my ears. The price and quality is fantastic. I would deffinetly reccomend this product to anybody who wants headphones for the gym or just plain old headphones.

VThese headphones are amazing, especially for the price. I use them for running, working out, and walking around campus. I cannot recommend these enough. They won't fall out of your ear while running like earbuds will. When I'm on noisy buses, I just turn the volume up and I can hear my music perfectly. Honestly, these are better than my $80 Sennheiser earbuds.

p4799

VI've tried a variety of headphones [twist in / iPod / in ear etc. etc.].... andI would say these are BETTER than the rest SIMPLY because they won't fall out when you move around (ie. Working out / running etc.)Nothing too fancy, BUT if you DON'T want to REposition your headphones every time you take a step, I'd recommend these.Great Value for the $$.

VWhen I received these earbuds 1 week ago, I was thrilled with them, they didn't fall out when I was running which is exactly what I was looking for. However today at the gym the right headphone just stopped working. I've been messing with it for hours but nothing, its dead. I am deeply disappointed. Should last longer than 1 week in my opinion.

VGreat fit, I have always loved the Philips sport headphones. I rode my bike cross country 10 years ago with a pair and they held up to an emense amount of abuse amazingly well.This generation of phones - not so much. I bought these 6 months ago. Left them in the pocket of a wet bathing suit overnight and now one of the ears is dead.

VSound quality and overall earbud construction seem solid. Giving 1 star since they stopped working after about a dozen uses. I'm pretty sure a wire broke in or near the plug, as I could get sound for a while by wiggling the wire near the plug. Now they are fully dead. I liked the low price, but I'd rather pay more for something that will last.

VI bought these for running. They're comfortable and the ear pieces fit well. I usually have a problem with that. They worked well for about 2 months then, the right ear started shocking me. At random times during my run, I'd get a tiny electrical shock. The good: it made me run faster so I could take it off. The bad: I  had to throw them away.

VSurprisingly good for under ten bucks. Bass is really nice, and sound is great. They also feel pretty good in your ear and never fall out. After a while, if you crank them a lot, the speakers will blow; if you also use them at the gym or somewhere you sweat a lot, the rings around the earpiece will fall off; these two things take a good while.

VI walk five times a week and need earbuds that hang and do not fall off.  My first pair lost the retaining ring off one of the buds and became uncomfortable.  So I bought another and the Panasonic.  After comparing the two I found the sound quality less desirable than the Panasonic and less comfortable.  They will do as a backup.

I'm sure these work great for someone, but that person has very different ears than me.

VFor the Love of All That's Holy, Go buy the sonys
p5301
sg5
VThis is my first online review of a product ever. Most likely my last.  I'm usually too lazy or indifferent to care.  Not today.  I just spent the last two hours chipping three inches of ice off of my driveway and sidewalk and steps and wanted nothing more than to rock out to some jams while doing it.  These earphones made it next to impossible.  I hate these things with every fiber of my being.  First of all, the comfort of their "flexibility" is a joke.  The flexibility means it takes you about ten attempts to wrap them around your ear.  You literally have to pull down the top of your ear and use both hands to wrap the thing around so it stays.  Which it does.  For about a minute.  Then invariably one of them will pop off and you have to go through the whole rigamaroll again.  This is espescially fun when you're busting your butt doing yardwork or working out and just need some jams to get you through.  These things make me want to punch myself in the crotch.  Cuz that would be more enjoyable than messing with these stupid earphones every two minutes.  If there is music in Hell, I'm pretty sure you have to listen to it with these earphones.  Please believe me.  I'm crappin ya negative.  Buy the sonys.  Non-flex.

I have never been able to wear earbuds but I have had some "over the ear" earphones that were quite comfortable-these are not.  I feel as if my ears are bruised from just wearing them a couple times.

They last forever but I usually buy an extra just in case I need an additional set. My granddaughter loves these too and she is 15yrs old.

VThese ear phones are find sound wise. I had some trouble figuring out how I could keep them on my ears. I ended up putting in the ear pieces first, then swiveling the hear hooks back until they rested behind my ears. Now they work well and are decently resistant to being pulled out of my ears.
