VSennheiser HD650 Headphones Review
p20
sg5
VSennheiser electronic GmbH & Co. KG (branded Sennheiser) is a private German audio that was founded in 1945. In the last 07 decades, Sennheiser has become synonymous with high-quality products in all areas of recording, transmitting and reproducing sound. Sennheiser is also known for making some of the world\u2019s most expensive planar magnetic headphonesthe He1060 priced at USD 55K.For those with more modest budget and tastes, Sennheiser has a wide selection of dynamic headphones in their catalog. The Sennheiser HD650 was launched in 2003, supposedly as an evolution to the 02 decades old award-winning HD6o0. The HD650 was their flagship dynamic headphones until HD800 was released in 2010. The HD650 has a list price of USD 600 but they can be found for discounted prices that could go south of USD 300.Features\u2022 Open, circumaural dynamic stereo headphones.\u2022 Systems with narrow tolerances (± 1 dB), hand-picked in pairs.\u2022 Highly optimised magnet systems for minimum harmonic and intermodulation distortion.\u2022 High-quality titanium/silver finish.\u2022 A specially developed damping element, made from fine acoustic metal mesh, ensures a precise damping over the entire diaphragm surface, highly constant in all climates.\u2022 Specially modulated connecting cable (detachable) made from highly conductive OFC copper, with very low handling noise, i.e. low structure-borne sound sensitivity.\u2022 Extremely lightweight aluminium voice coils ensure excellent transient response.\u2022 Gold plated 1/4" jack plug with adaptor lead to 3.5 mm jack plug.ImpressionsThe Sennheiser HD650 headphones come in a metallic grey easy-to-open cardboard box akin to the HD700s black colored box. There is no way one could determine if the specimen has been used previously or not. The packing is impractical too as I would never store these headphones in such a large cardboard box and waste rack space. I found the GoodCans Protective Headphone Bag (Large) to hold the Sennheiser HD650 headphones perfectly well and allows for easy storage when not in use.The Sennheiser HD650 headphones are aimed for desktop listening and they come with a detachable 3m long cable with proprietary connectors that connect on either side of the headphones. These connectors are also made by brands like Furutech for DIY cables and there are a lot of aftermarket Sennheiser headphones upgrade cables, available today, from third party brands that allows customizing the length, connectors and conductors of these cables. Aftermarket cables may also alter the sound of these headphones a bit.As part of the package, a non-branded 6.3mm TRS to a 3.5mm TRS jack adaptor cable is included. The Sennheiser stock adaptor cable may be the same adaptor cable used by Grado and Audeze. They are merely wrapped in different plastic sheathing, branding and are priced differently. I have the adaptor cables from Sennheiser and Grado, though the latter is stiffer due to the heavy sheathing used, the connectors are identical and they sound just the same.The Sennheiser HD650 comes with velour ear pads. They are soft and extremely comfortable. Unfortunately, they are unfit for countries with tropical climate. These ear pads are sweat guzzlers and skin/hair debris magnet. This leads to regular maintenance. Improper use will lead to foul smelling and deteriorating ear pads over a short period of time. A pair of additional/optional Sennheiser leather or artificial leather earpads could have been a better alternative for tropical countries.PerformanceThe old school Sennheiser HD650 headphones are meticulously engineered product with clever use of plastic and minimal amount of metal for optimized strength to weight ratio. This results in a headphone that is extremely light on the head and is ideal for long listening sessions. The abundance of plastic may upset users looking for slick headphones to be worn in public.The Sennheiser HD650 headphones do have a clamping force stronger than that of the HD700 headphones. I\u2019m used to wearing Howard Leight Earmuffs for extended periods of time and thus not very sensitive to the clamping force of these cans. I think most people will get used to this clamping force with extended use.The HD650 headphones are rated at 300 Ohms and are easily powered by most desktop devices. The HD650 can keep getting louder without losing composure. With most amps, I could barely get past the 10 Oclock position. I enjoy all my headphones very responsibly in moderate volume levels as my ears are very sensitive and is prone to fatigue very easily. The HD650 is very source sensitive and they do sound their best when paired with good DAC/Amps fed with clean power supply and lossless FLACs.I do not recommend the Sennheiser HD650 headphones for use with mobile phones and MP3s. For that any sub USD 100 cans such as the Koss PortaPro will just do fine. If you are thinking of investing in a pair of Sennheiser HD650 headphones or something similar then please be ready to invest in a quality source to bring out the best in them.The spectral balance is tipped towards the midrange and bass. There is less treble energy and extension than the HD700. These headphones need a good amount of burn-in before they open up to optimum performance. Post burn-in, I could feel the bass impact bloom, vocals more natural and the soundstage become more expansive.The Sennheiser HD650 headphones have a captivating timbre and beautifully lush tone. I feel connected with the music regardless of the format/quality of recording used. The better the source quality the more detailed and transparent they get. With a quality source the HD650 open-back headphones are more transparent to recording artefacts than the open-back HD700 and the Beyerdynamic DT880 headphones, they are almost on par with closed-back headphones such as Sony 7506 and Brainwavz HM5 headphones.ComparisonThe headphones that I would like to compare the Sennheiser HD650 is with the Beyerdynamic DT880 and the Sennheiser HD700 headphones. All three dynamic headphones belong to different price points. The list price for HD650 is USD 600, the DT880 is USD 400 and the HD700 is USD 1000. All of these headphones sell at heavily discounted prices today.Sennheiser HD650 vs. Beyerdynamic DT880Though both old school German dynamic headphones, designed for desktop listening, belong to different price points, they both sell at about USD 300 in Amazon, USA. They compete with each other and makes for an interesting comparison.The Irish made Sennheiser HD650 is a clever mix of lots of plastic with minimal metal and the German made Beyerdynamic DT880 uses a lot more metal by comparison. Both are lightweight headphones and yet I find the Sennheiser HD650 more attractive and ergonomic than the DT800. The Beyer DT880 just looks plain ugly on the head. The only other headphone that looks much worse is the Fostex T50RP orthodynamic headphones.The HD650 has oval earpads and the DT880 uses round earpads. Both earpads are soft velour and is ideal for long-term listening comfort. The DT880 comes with a decent carrying pouch and 6.3mm screw-in TRS adaptor over a 6.3mm TRS jack. The HD650 comes in an impractical cardboard box and a 6.3mm TRS to a 3.5mm TRS jack adaptor cable. I also despise the DT880s fixed cable design and appreciate the HD650s detachable cables better.I initially tried the 600 ohms Beyer DT880 and quickly realized that they are very power hungry and deserves nothing less than a good quality headphone amplifier to drive them optimally and so I replaced them with the easy to drive 250 ohms version. The Sennheiser HD650 is only available in 300 ohms version. On my desktop DAC/Amp, when I use the HD650 the volume barely touches the 10 O\u2019clock position, the DT880 on the other hand, reaches the same level of volume at about 01 O\u2019clock position. They offer very different efficiency levels here despite the similar impedance ratings declared. Those seeking to use the DT880 with portable/desktop devices should try the 32 ohms version.Both these old school headphones focus on what is left in any recording. This makes for easy listening even with older 16 bit recordings just as well as modern 24 bit recordings. Compared to the Beyerdynamic DT880, the Sennheiser HD650 has a tad wider/deeper soundstage, greater transparency to recording artefacts, more articulate midrange, a better extended bass response and are easier to drive despite the higher impedance rating.Compared to the Sennheiser HD650, the Beyerdynamic DT880 appears more neutral, grainier, less dynamic and less engaging. They tend to appear lifeless and boring over extended periods of time. They tend to lull me to sleep more often than any other headphones I own. Maybe, the DT880s are ideal for bedtime listening.I personally enjoy the Sennheiser HD650 more than the Beyerdynamic DT880. I feel the HD650 is in a higher league than the DT880 and feel the latter is overpriced by comparison.Sennheiser HD650 vs. Sennheiser HD700I\u2019ve spent 100s of more hours with both the Sennheiser HD700 and HD650 headphones. My impressions have not changed but I\u2019m now able to appreciate their strengths and differences better. Between the two, it really comes down to a matter of preference, whether you like the sound to be sweet and dishonest (colored for musicality) or if you like the sound to be rude and honest (true to source).I\u2019ll have to give an analogy to better explain this. The HD650 is a like a high performance Plasma HDTV. It has beautiful black backgrounds, unmatched contrast and the most realistic skin tones. Even though the overall picture may appear a tad dark, they are easier on the eyes for the long run and very forgiving of imperfect videos. The HD700, on the other hand, is like a high performance LED HDTV. It has beautifully vibrant colors, almost bordering on over saturation and picture that is sharp (but not necessarily transparent). Even though the overall picture quality may appear to be well lit, they may not be easier on the eyes in the long run and may not be forgiving of imperfect videos.The old school Sennheiser HD650 headphones focuses on what is left of any recording and thus they make for euphonic listening experience with older 16 bit/poorly mastered recordings. The new school Sennheiser HD700 headphones focuses on what\u2019s missing in a recording and thus makes for a precise listening experience with newer 24bit/perfectly mastered recordings. Songs such as Creep by Radiohead and Billie Jean by MJ that sounds trashy with the HD700 sounds more bearable and enjoyable with the HD650.With movies, the Sennheiser HD650 headphones\u2019 dark, polite and laidback presentation, with decent soundstage, makes for an unengaging experience. Whereas, the Sennheiser HD700 headphoneswell-lit, dynamic and articulate presentation, with a wider soundstage, takes you right to the middle of the story. The HD700 is able to resolve background/ambient information better and is also the better headphones for enjoying movies/videos online.There is no clear winner here. The Sennheiser HD650 and HD700 headphones have very little in common, their presentation and the way they approach sound is very different from each other. They do not compete, they complement each other. They currently sell for USD 300 and USD 450 respectively. For these heavily discounted prices they are a great bargain. Together they make for a worthy set of headphones to collect and they have you covered in more ways than any single pair of headphones can.Wrap-upThe Sennheiser HD650 may no longer be a flagship headphones, but they still remain a benchmark against which all current flagship headphones are compared and judged. They may be easy to drive and easy to listen to most types/formats of music but they deserve a quality DAC/Amp and FLACs to bring out the best in them.Those wanting to try an open-back easy-going high-resolution headphones from Sennheiser should start their journey with the timeless classicHD650. They are still the best value in the market today after being in production for over a decade!Pros\u2022 Hi-Res headphones that shine with decent source and lossless music.\u2022 Full-sized headphones that are light and very comfortable for extended listening.\u2022 Ideal for listening to 16bit/older recordings without fatigue.\u2022 Easy to drive compared to similarly rated headphones from competition.Cons\u2022 Open-back headphones for solitary listening only.\u2022 Plasticky build and finish.\u2022 The long 3m cables are a mess to handle for everyday listening.\u2022 Not recommended for watching movies.

VA Former High-End Audio Salesman BLOWS THE WHISTLE!
p32
sg5
VThe Sennheiser HD650 is one of the great bargains in dynamic open-backs. They are about 95% there in terms of overall fidelity compared to the most expensive h-phones, including all four and even five figure models. The HD650's may not have the fancy technologies of orthodynamic or electrostatic units, nor the pricey parts and accessories, but they definitely sound nearly as good and even better in some ways. With respect to detail, three dimensionality, accuracy, and the like, once you get to the level of the HD650's the law of diminishing returns applies in the extreme. Remove the smoke and mirrors, and all headphones reproduce sound via electrical signals which cause diaphragms (the thinner, the better) to vibrate within a magnetic field. While I was a high-end audio salesman, manufacturer reps even admitted to me that headphones were often marked up dozens of times over their true manufacturing costs. Magazine reviewers are compensated to publish rave reviews about so-called "high-end" audio products in order to justify their overpricing. The unwarranted praise gets propagated by naive, barely literate, blue collar types at so-called audiophile websites. But what little empirical evidence that exists, such as objective, third-party measurements of accuracy, distortion, and the like, usually debunks the aforementioned outlandish hype. And keep in mind that retailers train their commissioned salespeople to high pressure consumers into spending the most money possible. Note that price is rarely proportional to fidelity; the contrary myth is perpetuated by manufacturers and retailers in order to squeeze the most money out of every consumer. The bottom line is that if your goal is to reproduce sound exactly as it was recorded, the HD650 is about as good as you can get at that at ANY price, marketing hype notwithstanding.

VFair warning, I am not a crazy audiophile. I use these headphones with a Mayflower Desktop Objective2 with ODAC playing mp3s of various bitrates off my computer.I bought these to replace a pair of 595s. The 595s sounded great but had cheap plastic on the sides which eventually broke on 2 different pairs I had (as I would find out later googling this was a common issue with them) I figured I would upgrade to the 650s due to their reputation and also the fact that they don't have that cheap plastic on the side.So far they have held up. I don't think they are any more comfortable than the 595s (both are very comfortable) or even SOUND any better to me but as I mentioned I'm not a crazy audiophile. I still have the cracked 595s so maybe some day I'll sit down and try to compare the two.I will say that these headphones start off very tight on your head, almost uncomfortable, but eventually they get worn in and feel very good. So if you do purchase them don't panic if they are a little tight to start.

VGreat headphones for classical music, but by an amp and a dac (if using a MAC computer)
p79
sg5
VMy philosophy on rating and buying headphones is simply:  I use it to listen to music that I like and am likely to listen to on the headphones.  This is the best way to decide, but we can't listen to all the headphones out there so I am writing this review.  I find these headphones are neutral (the sound level varies relatively little from low to high and the instruments sound pretty much what they are supposed to sound like) and emotionally engaging.  This is especially true for classical music, female voices, and high tones.  High quality electrostatic headphones can do mid to higher tones better in my opinion, but they do worse on low tones and are expensive and cumbersome.  The 650s are no better and no worse than the 600s in my opinion, but I chose the 650s because they were likely to have product support for the next twenty years because I read the 600s are being discontinued and the 650s sound graphs show that they have slightly more bass (neither one can reproduce organ music very successfully).  I'm sure there are many other good headphones that I would like and am absolutely certain that people have different abilities (that is, they are "golden eared" while I am not) and tastes, all legitimate.  Don't be caught up in the hype of headphone reviews unless you enjoy that sort of thing.  Instead use them to help you decide which three or four headphones to test.  My only caution to average listeners like me is that sometimes the more "energetic," "brighter," "accurate" headphones can lose some of their luster (become fatiguing or annoying) if you listen to them for long periods of time.  Again a subjective experience that you might not have.

VI'm not going to write a long review with all kinds of specs and telling you what kinds of music I have sampled and all that. I consider myself to be an audiophile that cannot afford to milk a bunch of money into my listening experience. I've had the HD600s for years, which until now were the best headphones I'd ever owned. But recently the plastic headband finally had enough and cracked. For almost a year they were held together with duct tape.I knew I wanted over-ear headphones that were open for a wider soundstage. I purchased the AKG701s after reading reviews that they were superior to the HD600s. I drive them with fairly powerful Denon integrated digital amp (150 watts per channel). While I was impressed with the soundstage and instrumental and vocal clarity, these phones are not very efficient and the low end distorts when it's too big. I probably have not given them sufficient break-in time.I read the reviews on the HD650s with more efficient low-end response and committed to trusting what I know about my Sennheiser experience. I spent less than $350 brand new and with only a handful of listening hours, I am pretty blown away. They are as efficient as the Sony headphones I picked up for less than $100 because of a CNET reviewer saying how good they sounded for the money and that they were so efficient you could plug them into anything and they'd sound pretty good even at louder volumes. For me, I thought the Sony's sounded predictably cheap, thin and shrilly at louder volumes. The HD650s are revelatory; the real deal and I am extremely pleased. Even television (Paladia, The Voice) sounds fantastic. Concert blu-ray sounds incredible. My CDs are reborn. How much better will the low-end perform when they're broken in? Something more to look forward to.Thank you again, Sennheiser!

I've been laying on my living room hard wood floor for 2 hours listening to every kind of music whether I like it or not... and this is far from the best quality setup. These headphones do that to you.

VThese headphones are incredible. I bought 4 different pairs of headphones before falling in love with these. I wanted to move away from the Mic/Headphone combo I had been using for many years. I had a pair of Astro A40's which I was very pleased with. My setup has headed in a professional direction though and I wanted to split the mic out to an XLR Cardiod Condenser which I did. The headphone search began. These have such a large sound stage and such great overall sound I fell in love immediately. These are the first pair of headphones where I can truly say I began hearing sounds in some of my songs I never heard before. I try to listen to 320kbps versions of my favorite music, these cans take advantage of the quality.

VA refined sound perfect for classical, jazz or soul
p232

VThe consensus is that the HD600 is more neutral and flatter sounding vs. the HD650, which has warmer and darker atmosphere. Proponents criticize the HD650 due to it being warmer, therefore suffering from a lack of clarity and detail. This is actually the HD650's greatest strength--the warmer atmosphere really shines when it comes to classical, jazz or soul music.I was using the HD598, which similar to the HD600, had a neutral sound to it before upgrading to the HD650. I mainly listen to adult contemporary and soul music so needless to say, the HD650 is right up my alley. I was listening to Sam Smith's "Stay With Me," a song that I'm very intimate with or so I thought, until the HD650 took it to the next level. Oh my gosh, especially the part with the choir singing the "oh's," the sound-stage was so enveloping. It was so deep... and I was overwhelmed with emotions. Next track was "Someone Like You" by Adele. Her vocals were so brooding, so magnificent, the melody even sadder, so emotional--it was beyond amazing, just indescribable. So now I slip the HD598 back on (a more neutral sound, with clearer highs), the overwhelming emotions were absent, the warmth was\u2026 gone! So yeah\u2026 the HD650 suits my style of music so I'm keeping it.The HD600 on the other hand is a jack of all trades but a master of none, so to speak. It is great for all types of music but the 650 has a specialized type of sound, which is superb for classical, jazz, acoustic or soul music. The HD650 has a refined sound to it, that is, it has personality. The sound-stage in both are amazing but the HD650 has an even more 3D, enveloping sound to it. I've also read that he HD650 has higher highs and lower lows than the HD600 but you'll need thousands of dollars in equipment to discern. If you like classical, jazz, acoustic or soul music, the HD650 is well worth the extra money. On the contrary, if your music collection contains none of the aforementioned genres then you're better off with the HD600 and at $100 less, it's a better buy in general.

VI had a go with these headphones and changed my mind about them pretty quickly.  There is all the hype about these and curiosity got the best of me.  I got a chance to listen to them and used music that I'm very familiar with.I heard emphasis on pieces that are not suppose to be there in my music.  It sounded nice, but I want to be able to add my own effects and not permanently like with this HD650.Vocals sounded very nice.  Highs where nice and clean.  Bass was fast, but sounded ok.  Subbass is not there.Sad part was that I was able to overdrive these headphones with a FIIO E12A trying to push some sub bass.Fitment was really good on my head.  Very comfy and light.  My problem is all that plastic for an obscene amount of money and the sound isn't that great for what I like to listen too.I've used an OPPO PM-2 and a HIFIMAN 400i to compare the HD650 against.  Not fair really, planar vs dynamic.  But at the asking price, I feel it was ok to do so.  The used prices are more realistic in what it really is worth.

VNothing over the HD 600 ... not hi def either
p284
sg5
VThe Sennheiser HD 650 headphones are a more recent version of the HD 600.  Compared to the HD 600 they have less efficiency, the headband is less comfortable, and their spectral balance is not as good.  If there is an improvement in driver transparency it is not easily perceived.  Overall, they have the same excessive driver coloration as the HD 600.  Driver coloration is sound that is generated in addition to the sound of the recorded music.  It changes tone and masks detail.  This driver coloration is also present in the HD 700 and HD 800 models.  When auditioned with a Beyerdynamic 880/990 (600ohm), this coloration is strikingly absent in those Beyerdynamic models.While the HD 650 strives to be a mellower version of the HD 600, I don't envision the HD 600 enthusiast automatically finding this updated version more pleasing.Aug 13/15 update ... further explanation on coloration:Coloration can be equated to the ever present tone in one's voice in addition to the intonation necessary for communication.  Let's say one wants to choose a diaphragm for a driver (speaker) and the choice is between aluminum and steel.  If one chooses aluminum the driver will sound good because of aluminum's quiet/non-resonant nature.  If one chooses steel the driver will sound awful because of steel's noisy/resonant nature.  The diaphragm material of a driver determines the loudness and sound "signature" of a driver's coloration.  If one taps a driver's diaphragm with the back of one's finger nail the sound one will hear will approximate the coloration of that driver.  Frequency response aberrations and imbalances are just that - not coloration.  Speaker manufacturers have never quantified driver coloration as a specification and published it.  A specification for coloration distortion for the HD 650 would be somewhere around 10%.  No one wants to see that.  A 0.05% harmonic distortion spec. looks much better.  But, it is a ruse.  It does not indicate how well these headphones sound.I've read comments by other HD 650 reviewers like "subtle sounds lost", "muddy, indistinct".  This is how the HD 650's sound to someone who has adapted to high transparency/low coloration headphones.  In addition to excessive coloration the HD 650's sound compressed or undynamic triggering comments like "seemed like I had noise dampening earplugs in", "very thick sounding".Below is my summary as to why the HD 650 is so appealing:  a)  They have superb comfort.  b)  They have a smooth frequency response and a compressed sound which is easy on the ears.  c)  Their overall sound character is nostalgic and one that people are used to ... but nicer.The HD 650 is not for those who like high definition sound.

VThis is a short review for the Sennheiser HD 650 Headphones.I had never purchased an expensive quality pair of headphones such as these previously, but this purchase is definitely one that I'd make again.Pros:~Comfortable~Light Weight (It barely feels like you're wearing anything)~Incredible Sounding(I purchased a FiiO e10K USB DAC and Headphone Amplifier to use with these headphones and the audio quality (Coming from a pair of V-Moda Crossfade LP2's) is simply amazing. I'm by no means an audio expert, but I definitely heard differences in quality and clarity compared to any other music I've ever heard.)~Great Packaging (Came inside a box inside a box with high quality foam all around)~Long cable, tough, free 1/4in. adapter.Cons:~Noise leakage, this is to be expected with open headphones, so it's less of a con for this set and more of a general conConclusion:This was a purchase I had to think through quite a bit before making, as the price I paid ($299 on sale) for me was still quite a bit for a pair of headphones. Looking back at it, it might be one of the best purchases I've made. I use these headphones daily, even while writing this review and I absolutely love them months after purchasing just as much as I did the first day.

Even tried these with Movies and is also awesome, brings you right into the movie, hear every little detail and sound. Very happy with them, great purchase, highly recommend them for Music, movies and even games.

The frequency response is very even, and the midrange has the detail I need when editing.

VThe best I've used...  definitely on the "very high end" of "midrange headphones"...
p360
sg5
VI'm the sort of consumer who buys "really good" equipment and then keeps it 'til it fails (or is rendered obsolete by conditions outside my ability to control).  So, when my last pair of nice, mid-range headphones died recently, I wanted to get something really nice.  These headphones were my choice to replace the old ones, based upon significant research on my part.First off...  yes, the stories  you've heard are true... these headphones really do have an extended "break-in" period (several days of steady use) before they sound as good as they ought to sound.  I knew this going in, but was still uneasy when I first tried them out and heard almost "hollow and tinny" sound.  Now that I've owned and used them for several weeks, the sound is truly wonderful, however... rich, full, and encompassing, with the best tonal accuracy I've heard on any set I've ever used.  I realize that there are better sets out there... but those sell for thousands of dollars, and honestly, I doubt I'd be able to tell the difference.These are definitely "open" which means that (given appropriate listening volume) you can hear things around you, and those around you can hear (at very reduced apparent volume) whatever you're listening to.  I don't mind that, but bear it in mind if you want to use them to listen in bed, for example, without disturbing the person next to you.  That's not going to happen.As for comfort...  I suppose those with very hard heads would find them uncomfortable at first.  My head isn't quite that large so I feel perfectly comfortable with them on for extended use.I've tried them on my Pioneer receiver in both "pure direct" playback mode and in "headphones" based modes... I strongly prefer the "pure direct" mode.  Any processed playback loses some fidelity... something I'd never noticed on my prior headphones but can definitely notice using these.I'm very satisfied.  They look nice, feel nice, and sound wonderful.  My only "wish" is that I would have preferred a longer cable... and I guess I need to get a high-end extension (which, despite what I've read, I doubt will harm my sound quality).  I want to use them while sitting in my recliner about ten feet back from my home entertainment center.

VA classic headphone - reference quality
p372
sg5
VA classic that still sounds terrific.  Yes, you do need a good,powerful amp if you want to hear them at their very best (I use a Schiit Asgard). Highs are somewhat rolled offbut there is a great deal of detail present (i.e. - NO VEIL), esp. with the right amp. Cymbals sounds just right.Bass is tight, textured, accurate and full but somewhat missing in the deepest region. And oh what a midrange,vocals sound wonderful, tonal colors are accurate, just incredible at this price.  Very comfortable. I'm not sure Iwould choose these as a monitoring headphone myself because of the rolled off highs, but that sound signaturemakes them a great, fatigue free listening headphone. Very nice soundstage. I got them when the price dippeddown to $299 briefly and at that price they are an absolute steal.

VI have spent a lot of time and money testing out all the popular headphones and these do not impress me for the price.These 650's were the most expensive Cans I bought out of the tested units.  I used a decent amp on all headphones.There are so many other good options out there for way less.I prefer the Sony MDR7506 for $85 over these.

VVery nice headphones- they made my music in my home studio sound warm and wonderful , but that didn't transfer to the " real " world of other speakers. They " colored" the sound. To me they were not good monitoring headphones and drew too much power from my Apogee preamp. But I have heard great things about them from a lot of pros. I'm going to try the Focul Spirit pro next. Suppose to be very transparent for monitoring music.

VBest headphones I've ever used. It's a little quiet depending on what you plug it into, like a 3ds, but you wouldn't expect that type of device to power it to max level. Plugging it into something that can power it better like a laptop is where it really shines.

VSo Glad I Spent The Extra Money!
p414
sg5
VSO happy with these headphones!  For a number of years, I used a pair of Sony MDR-7506's, which is what we used in the studios I had worked in the past.  I was checking out a new replacement pair of the Sony's and had a few folks also recommend the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones.  I tried them both, and they both had good sound.  But then my cousin, who is a very high-end audiophile, recommended I spend just a bit more and try out these and the Sennheiser 600's.WOW, what great sound!  The Sony's and the Audio-Technica's were nice headphones, but the extra nuance of sound I get from these is well worth the extra money.  As some have noted, these work better with a headphone amp, but they sound so good I can't take a star off for that because even with my iPad and iPod, they still put out great, full audio.

p420
sg5
VAt $299.99 this is a steal.  I have about 13 headphones now and they are all ~$199.99 to $399.99 price ranges.  I was skeptical about what you really hear from headphones and the big differences in price vs. expectations.  WoW!  This headphone is pretty amazing.  Everything is richer and the guitar strings in the songs just stand out so much.If you thought you could hear saliva and spit before, take a listen again.  Also, this might sound identical to most headphones if you don't have the proper power and headphone amp to go with it.  I'm using this with the Sony PHA-1 and Woo Audio WA7.  Simply amazing... now you know the second reason why God gave us sound.

VI really am satisfied with my purchase of the Sennheiser HD 650 Headphones. What I like is they don't sound like they add or take away from the music. I like to have as little acoustical processing between the musicians and my ears. The equipment is not what I listen to. It is the music. These headphones do that. I have had numerous Hi-end headphones and these are easily my favorite for what they don't do add or subtract from the music. Highly recommend these headphones if what matters to you is the music and not the equipment..

VIm not an audiophile. I just love good music and good sound. Over the past few years ive listened to quite a few well known mid fi headphones, and these are probably my favorites after the he-500s. There's just something about the tonality of the hd 650. It really is a beautiful sounding can. They sound very very similar to the hd 600, but are just a bit warmer and more musical. Im using a schiit lyr amp and hrt music streamer 2+ dac. This headphone is legendary for good reason!

p448
sg5
VBlown away by the entire experience.  Honestly, for how cheap these are, you cannot beat them.  I love Sennheiser cans, but Im not deluded to think they're the only good sounding cans on the market.  But, truthfully, at the current amazon price of 299, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal on quality audio.The phones by themselves, purely amplied without eq tuning, to my ears, sound pretty flat.  There is bass, but its not booming.  There is solid mids, and the highs are high, but not so piercing as to be a true analytical phone.tweak the eq a bit, and you can basically turn these into whatever you want.  You can vaccum clean your ears if you want, or shatter your eardrums with symbols.  Whichever you prefer.I use the cans for everything.  From listening to music, to playing games, to watching movies.  They are excellent in game, trully excellent positional audio without any dolby headphone help or anything.  And music is just a treat.  You really do hear things you havent heard before.This isnt my first quality pair of cans, but its my first truly high end pair.  money well spent.Word to the wise- you need to amplify these to get the best experience.

VThe HD650's are quite a bit less bright which is very good! Dialing in the mids and high frequencies is ...
p460
sg5
VI owned a recording facility for many years and recently moved. Since I am now focusing on my own compositions, I  don't require a full blown, acoustically treated control room/live room for paying clients, but, I still need to very accurately assess balance, eq, compression etc. My monitors sounded positively atrocious in the new, large, open room, so, I needed phones to work. I started with my old ATH-M40FS's and it took QUITE a while and A LOT of backing-and-forthing in various rooms, the car, the boom box etc...before I trusted what I was hearing with them. But, after reading a lot of reviews and scouring the various forums on the web, I decided to go for the HD650's.Whether they needed them or not, I did a burn in of 3 continuous days and then started to work with them. The difference between the two headphones, whether the comparison is fair or not, is a a "useful" difference. At least for mixing. The HD650's are quite a bit less bright which is very good ! Dialing in the mids and high frequencies is not only much, much easier, but, much truer. You simply don't get the high end hash on the HD650's. You get clean, clear mids and highs. There is "no fear" in getting things right in this area.The bottom end is also quite different, one pair being closed and the other open of course. My only wish is that very low frequencies and subs would reveal themselves more clearly on the HD650's. When switching to my monitors in the room, I hear more sub sonic energy in the room than is revealed in the phones. Maybe this is just an inherent deficiency for headphones, I don't know. I haven't had the pleasure of trying planar magnetic headphones for example.If you're not a composer, mixer, engineer, these phones would be an awesome buy. Music is extremely pleasurable, well balanced, and even at higher volume, easy on the ears.

VExcellent "accurate" audio quality, Poor mechanical construction.
p471
sg5
VPros: The low distortion and very flat frequency response of these headphones allows them to reveal every small detail of a recording. They are sensitive, and relatively easy to drive, even though they are high-impedance headphones. Because of the high impedance, they require a higher voltage-swing than lower impedance headphones (not more power, just voltage).  Unlike the often stated "they require 50 or 100 or even 300 hours of use to sound good", I found little or no change after much use. If anything, the bass  was better controlled and less "boomy" right out of the box. If you have a headphone output with limited voltage swing, obviously a headphone amplifier will be necessary to produce enough volume.  However, In my experience, the headphone outputs on most "professional-level" audio gear can drive the HD650s perfectly well.  I've used them with Apogee Ensemble and Symphony headphone jacks, and with Sound Devices 788, and USBPre2 headphone outputs with no problems.  On the other hand, an iPod just won't provide enough voltage for these headphones.  They work well with any audio source that can provide a signal of about +6 dBV with a low (less than 20 ohm) source impedance. If your device can't provide that voltage, even an inexpensive headphone amp like a Schitt Magni-2 will provide more than enough voltage and audio quality for these headphones.  You can use them with a more expensive "audiophile" headphone amp, but that is unlikely to really improve the overall sound if you are looking for "accuracy" in reproduction.  If you want to add enharmonic distortion and prefer that type of sound, then a nice tube-based amp will provide that sort of modification (distortion).The provided "Y' cable is fairly long, and is terminated in a 1/4 inch headphone plug instead of the much more common 3.5 mm plug.  This is a big plus, since the 3.5 mm "portable audio device" plug is generally much less reliable compared to a real 1/4-inch connection.  Sennheiser does supply a short adapter cable for those who use these phones with a portable device (3.5 mm jack).Cons: The construction is pretty basic and not very "professional" appearing. The lower surface of the headband has exposed foam that does not appear to be very sturdy. The headphone mounting frames are plastic, and look and feel pretty fragile.  I've had no problems with the ear-pad foam deteriorating, but apparently that does happen after several years use.The cable ends that connect to each headphone are cheap molded plastic and can't be repaired if damaged. Other manufacturers have come up with better end connectors for headphones with detachable cables.  It's time Sennheiser did the same.I own headphones that cost half as much as these which have less exposed plastic and have leather covering the foam padding on the headband. Of course, they don't sound quite as good as the HD-650s.  The sad thing is that there is no reason that better mechanical construction could not be applied to these headphones.  It would not detract from the high quality sound provided by the drivers.  If phones that cost half as much as these can be manufactured with much better mechanical construction materials, why can't the HD650s?The value in these headphones is obviously the high audio quality. Mechanically, they are poor.  The painted headband is known to "flake" after much use.  The construction does not inspire confidence. They appear to be fragile, and although I use them in professional audio recording situations, I'm  very careful handling these headphones. Hopefully, they will prove to be more reliable then they appear. Finally, they are supplied in a cheap, foam-filled cardboard box.  Not even a plastic pouch is provided to protect the headphones when being transported. At this price point, a hard-case of some kind should be provided.

VI love these cans!  The detail I can hear in my recordings is absolutely astounding.  I know some people think that the idea of break in on headphones is hogwash, but I did find that the sound opened up over time - especially the midrange.  The frequency response sounds fairly flat to me, which is perfect given that I use them mainly for production.  They are *extremely* comfortable, even though they are a little tight on the head at first.  I had heard before buying these that the band tends to be tight, and that was definitely true, but I never at any point felt like they were uncomfortable.All in all I'm extremely happy with these headphones. I've gone through a variety of headphones before settling on these.  For the price, I think these are a great buy.

VThese are great headphones. They provide a forgiving and luxurious sound (not to be mistaken with being "vieled") to my ears and  scale better with higher end equipment. HOWEVER...I had an extremely hard time telling any difference between the ODAC  combo and my standard MacBook Pro output. I also have a schiit vali and an asgard and I still couldn't tell much of a difference except an increase in bass on the asgard and bit more dynamic "punch". But is it enough to justify my 1,000 dollars worth of gear? The hd 650 is only 30-40 percent better on a decent rig than straight off the computer. You decide if its worth an extra 500$.If you want to waist more money on bulls*** then you can waist an extra 600-700 dollars( like I did) on amplification and source.

VI heard so much about this headphone over the years but never tried it. Since the last price drop I thought - let me find out what this is all about. Man, do I wish I had done that earlier - even for a higher price. I do have some nice headphones, like the Hifiman HE-400, Audeze LCD-2, Beyerdynamic T90 and the proper amps to drive them well. The HD650 is the overall chamfer everyday listening. Detailed, punchy, beautiful rendition of vocals male and female, and yet fatigue free. It could very well be the endgame headphone for many many people.They are relatively easy to drive but the better the amp the better this headphone will sound. You can drive it amazingly well with a Cayin C5 portable amp. A beautiful and musical experience. You will love it.

VThese headphones are excellent and I'm sure other reviewers do a better job but there's a certain point when you just can't get better audio. Not saying these are the best but they are 80% there. When people want to keep on upgrading it is a mental thing where "They want to hear something that's not even there", basically these are HIFI and if you have the HD800 you would know what I'm talking about. The audio technology has come way too far for any significant improvements. Spending $5000 just won't get you a noteworthy improvement.BUY these or any of the open back offerings from sennheiser you'll love them.

VGaming head sets are a hype. Spend the money on a good amp n headset and hear the difference.

These headphones are no joke, they do require a good amp and I personally feel the matrix m stage barely fullfills the power requirements for these hd650s. I've started down a road of collecting different headsets. So far i have 2, hd650s and jvc livebeat imported from Japan. Looking at akg next and a higher grade amp and dac.

VThese have been known as one of the best headphones by audiophiles for over a decade. They are. Simple as that.I found them quite stiff out of the box, but a little stretching will give your head some mercy.Make sure you have a decent amplifier to drive these things. I'm currently running them off a schiit magni 2 uber, but I plan to also try a more high-end tube amp. Legend has it the better the amp, the better the sound these things make. Also, cd quality or higher doesn't hurt either.It may take many hours (20-100) to get these a little burned in and sounding refined. I found the treble really recessed upon first listen. 5 hours of pink noise later, and it's crisp and forward and lovely :)Just take good care of them, and they'll last you a lifetime.

VPicky headphones that REQUIRE a headphone amp to 'fill out' the sound
p552
sg5
VDISCLAIMER: Please note that I am not an 'audiophile' and I mostly use headphones for movies. I probably would have found any 'good' headphones at a similar or lower price-point, eg HD-598, DT-880, AH-D600, HFI-780 etc., such a vast improvement as well!The following is my first 'exploration' (ie. burning cash) endeavor into the world of prosumer headphones. I hope that my experiences and feedback help you make a good decision, especially related to the 'total cost' of such a purchase. I am growing to love these headphones and am regretting my lighter pocket less each day, but they are definitely NOT for everyone.== END OF WEEK REVIEW ==I *finally* listed to actual music on these, not just movies and WOW! - these headphones MAKE [GOOD] MUSIC AN ABSOLUTE JOY. I queued up some rock (Queen, The Ramones, Kiss, Bon Jovi, eg.) as well as some techno and dub-step for variety - ABSOLUTE MAGIC. That is best way to summarize the sound: a slight 'tingle' and then bliss as different layers of sound, both distinct and layered, just smoothly 'roll' off the drivers. It made me CLOSE MY EYES, SIT BACK, AND GRIN!These are headphones for music; their beauty cannot be fully realized with movies alone.(Warning: In a song like In A Gadda Da Vida the treble sections are absolutely piercing - to a point were I recommend EQ'ing down the top.)For fun, I setup Equalizer APO (using the Peace UI) in Windows and played with the EQ settings. The 650's PRECISELY FOLLOW THE EQ SETTINGS; the bass can go low in pitch but there is never a glass/skull-rattling 'thump' as with the MDR-X11s or a sub-woofer. I'm not sure if this due to the 650 drivers themselves or is more of an open vs. closed back difference. (Adjusting the EQ for the X11s just confirmed how muddy and indistinct they are at just about any frequency..)After playing around with the equalizer settings I set them back to the default. I found the headphones just SOUNDED REALLY GOOD (OVERALL) WITHOUT ANY EQUALIZER ADJUSTMENTS. An exception to this is for a song like Queen's We Are the Champions, where I enjoy singing to it "as if it were playing on the radio" which is much higher pitched on the chorus. For movies I still enable the small FiiO 10K bass boost.The headphones are VERY COMFORTABLE FOR EXTENDED WEAR if they are worn correctly. The headband needs to be pushed back far enough so the ovals of the earpieces and your ears align. Duh. This placement feels a weird to me, having come from a circular on-ear/around-ear designs were the headband can be placed much more forward.I'm also "in for a penny, in for a pound" and have ANOTHER amp on order, this time in the same price range as the headphones. If wanting headphones that will 'work to their potential' anywhere, get some more forgiving 32-ohms drivers. After playing with the EQ I'm not convinced the FiiO 10k is enough to 'properly' drive these headphones: or maybe I've just upsold myself again! We'll see.== DAY OF REVIEW ==I THOUGHT my previous Sony MDR-X11s were good, probably because of what I paid, but they are rubbish sound in general - and especially in comparison! And if I can notice, that is saying something. The Sony's have more THUMP bass, but sound like listening to headphones while wearing several paper bags. The 650's have shown me a whole 'new' world. (Do note that this is an UNFAIR COMPARISON, because the MDR-X11s appear to do nothing - except perhaps sound isolation - well.)I watched the motorcycle scene at the start of the movie 'Under the Skin' a numerous times; both with the previous Sony's and my new 650s. The 650s made the motorcycle SOUND like a motorcycle and made the passing traffic SOUND like passing traffic - I ride year around so I do know these sounds :) THERE ARE MANY SOUNDS IN MOVIES THAT I NOTICING FOR THE FIRST TIME.The overall difference is WOW! WOW! WOW, WHAT [ELSE] HAVE I BEEN MISSING?However .. WITHOUT AN AMP THE SOUND IS "NOT EXCITING" - perhaps even 'dull'. At first I plugged these into my normal PC speaker sound and then I plugged the 650's into the cheap-$75 FiiO 10K DAC amp I also bought and - WOW! WOW! The movie feels so much more full of energy! The 10K also has a little bass boost that seems to help the low-end.With this setup the bass is not overpowering and headphones carry an exciting energy (I think the term is 'punchy'?) that the Sony's never, ever did. The FiiO amp didn't help the Sony's at all, but it really 'filled out' the 650s. I'm sure a more expensive/refined amp system would be even better, but if you get these, MAKE SURE TO USE AN AMP! I set the volume on the FiiO to about 2/10.I'm giving these 4 starts (and not 5) because;- I'm not an audiophile and have never used other 'good' headphones; so I can't compare with other 'good' headphones- Design is functional (and comfortable) but not stylish; they don't fold, not even a little- The price is a bit high for a non-audiophile like me; I definitely upsold myself- Need at least a little amp/bass boost to help to unlock the "fun" potential for movies- I dislike giving 5/5 stars given for little-used products; they have to prove (or not prove) themselves

VBest sounding headphones I've ever had, bar none.  Having said that, I come from a family of beats users.  I've always thought that beats was the mecha of headphones, but sadly I couldn't have been more mistaken.  Sennheiser has enlightened me to a new way to listen to audio.  I use these for games, music, movies, youtube, etc.  Perfect for everything.

VI have tried many different open-back headphones within the past couple months, and these are by far the best I've heard. I wasn't a fan of any Beyerdynamics, AKG, Audio-Technica or Shure open-backs. To be honest, I even started leaning away from the closed-back Sennheisers, but I have gained a new respect for Sennheiser headphones with these open-backs. I highly recommend these cans for any studio.

VHeavenly sonic bliss. Achievable even on an iPod without amplifier.
p576

VHD 650Heavenly sonic bliss. My favorite headphone. Full rich, lush sounding voices and instruments. Widest sound stage of my headsets with excellent clarity. Very easy to separate and follow various voices and instruments in the music I listen to. Very balanced across the entire range of frequencies without one range over powering another. Everything is very clear. No muddiness of sound. Cybals and chimes crisp and clear. Snare drums nice crisp sound. Bass pleasant with excellent sound decay and appropriate reverberation lasting longer than my other headsets. I can really feel the music around my ears with this headset. The sound envelopes my head instead of feeling like its between my ears. Now I can experience the music rather than just listen to it. Makes music much more enjoyable and realistic sounding. This can be driven by my iPod, iPad, MacBook Pro, Laptops and Desktop PCs without an amplifier. I have no doubt an amplifier will improve the sound, but the sound is already rich and clear without amplification and still better than my other headphones. I'm hearing/experiencing things that I never heard before with my other headsets ... the faint pops that occur from an old LP that has been digitally recorded ... just amazing (from an iPod without amplifier).This is my experience. Your mileage may vary depending upon what you want out of your headsets.Finding the \u201cbest headphone" is a very expensive and very subjective journey. Reading reviews can only take one so far. Opinions range far and wide depending upon the reviewers individual tastes, experience with music and what one primarily listens to. Descriptions of the sound in reviews don't always help due to differences in meaning. For example what is described as the veiled Sennheiser sound may be what I call a mellow laid back sound (not sure). My advise is listen to your music with a lot of different headphones and do your own comparisons to determine what you like. What you hear coming from each headphone is going to vary with the design of the headphone, but also modulated bya. the type of music you listen tob. how the recording was originally made (microphones converting analog to electrical then stored on magnetic tape or digitized)b. the quality of the recording you are listening to (especially if digitized, what was truncated if anything)c. the format in which it is recorded and sampling rated. the equipment you play it on and how it translates the recording back to an electrical impulse to be sent to the headphonee. the headphones themselves (open, closed, type of diaphragm material, how many speakers (i.e. the Shure 500 series has 2 woofers and a tweeter in each ear piece to achieve its balanced sound presentation across its spectrum, I have a gaming headset with multiple speakers)Having said that, the music I listen to is classical to 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, pop, country, jazz, big bands, vocals, instrumentals.I don\u2019t have a dedicated amplifier and play all my headphones on iPods, iPads, iPhones, Mac Book Pros, PCs, Pioneer Tuners. All my headphones sound just fine without an amplifier, but I have no doubt that an amplifier will improve the sound.My music is recorded in MP3 at 320 kbps, but I prefer M4A apple lossless or WAV at 1400 kbps for the best possible digital sound quality. I can hear the difference between 1400 kbps,  320 kbps, and the more compressed music at 192 and 128 which can be found on MP3 sites like the apple store. I convert my CD collection to both 1400 kbps and 320 kbps 44.1 MHz so it can be played at the best quality on whatever system I am using.All my headphones have been broken in with at least a 72 hour continuous play run.My headphones from most favorite to least favorite areSennheiser HD 650Shure 500PTHSennheiser HD 598AKG K550Sennheiser HD 555 modified to 595Sony DLP777  \u2014 brightJaybird Spirit \u2014 midtones muffled due covering that prevents sweat getting into ear piecesSennheiser HD 280Noise cancellers:Bose QC2  \u2014 bass heavy, muddy midtonesBose QC3  \u2014 even more bass have, muddy midtonesDr. Dre Beats  \u2014 too bass heavy, stick to rap and non-critical listening (rap)For me, the HD 650 is a 5 star headphone and by far my favorite of all my headphones. Allows me to truly feel and experience the music I like listening to using the devices I have. My iPods, iPhone, iPads and MacBook Pro can drive this 300 ohm just fine (of course the volume level has to be turned up compared to the lower ohm headphones), but the lush rich realistic sound still comes through better than the other headphones.By feel, I mean that the HD650 diaphragms move so much air around my ears I can feel and experience the music as opposed to just hearing it. The Shure PTH500 can do this in my ear canal. My HD598 does this much better than the HD 555 and has a more pleasant sound to me than the HD555. But none of these come close to the experience I get with my new HD650. It\u2019s like standing in front of a speaker at a concert or DJ\u2019d party except its around me ears instead of having my body feel the sound wave.The timbre, tone, character of the instruments from the HD650 is slightly better than my original reference PTH500. PTH500 and HD650 are better than my other headsets. With these two, I discovered things that I couldn\u2019t hear with the other headsets. Sound stage of the HD650 is wider than the PTH500 which is wider than the other headphones. Both have much better separation of the  instruments and vocals and much better clarity which gives the music a more 3 dimensional enjoyable sound. Much easier to pick out individual instruments and so I can more easily play along on piano, guitar etc. With other headsets I have to struggle to hear the individual parts. The Shure 500 has been my favorite reference headphone since 2008. With its sound isolation qualities, I use it when traveling and when I don't want to disturb others around me. The problem with it is that it can eventually be painful on the ear canals and sound quality (bass) is lost when the ear canal seal is lost when moving around or exercising. Additionally, hearing the crunch of food while eating and listening with the 500s is a consequence of in ear monitors.Both the HD650 and PTH500 have the best balance across all sound frequencies with the widest sound stage. The Bose QC2, QC3, and Beats have more emphasis on bass followed by treble at the expense of midtones, so if I want really loud bass, I\u2019ll go with the Beats followed by QC3, then QC2 for lesser degrees of bass punch.The HD 598 was my favorite after the PTH500 because its open design moves a lot of air allowing me to kind of feel the music, but not the extent of the HD650. It has what I consider a more laid back and mellow sound than the HD 555 and PTH500. Kinda relaxing and pleasant.HD555 DLP777 place more emphasis on treble. If I want high energy treble, the HD555 and AKG K550 are my go to headsets.I prefer the open design over the closed headsets because they just move air better with a generally richer sound then my closed headphoneShure 500PTH \u2014 best overall balance and 3D clarity while physically blocking outside noiseHD 598 -- open, good overall balance, mellow soundAKG 550 \u2014 closed, good overall balance. doesn't move air as well as HD598, but good second choice to the 598HD 280 \u2014 closed thin; waste of my money. was never happy with it.Sony MDP 777 \u2014 closed, emphasis on trebleBose QC2 \u2014 closed moderate bass. muddy midtonesBose QC3 \u2014 closed heaviest on bass. muddy midtoneSo my choices for headsets boil down toBest overall sonic experience: HD650Best outside noise reduction/isolation and overall sonic experience: Shure 500 seriesBest to minimize noise spill into the surrounding environment when I can\u2019t use the Shure 500: AKG 550Best for heavy bass emphasis: In order from least bass to intense bass: Bose QC2, QC3, Dr. Dre BeatsUltimately the \u201cbest\u201d headset is a subjective opinion depending upon what you want to hear and/or experience out of your music. There is a huge sliding scale of perceived quality. I wouldn\u2019t recommend spending much on an expensive headset if your music is 128 kbps compressed. But then again, it is cheaper to just buy 1 headset and grow into it rather than spend lots of money working ones way up to the holy grail of headsets. If I knew then what I know now, I would have just bought the HD650 and stopped there.

VA SIMPLE SUGGESTION FOR PERFECT  HD650s - GET A PURE SILVER CABLE!!
p653
sg5
VI bought a new pair of HD650 two weeks ago.I'm writing this review to give several suggestions to those who already have it and those who are planning to buy it.1) I think the HD650 is superior to the HD600 in that it has fuller bass than the HD600. You can lift the veil of HD650 and give it a close perfect balance over the whole frequency range with just one piece of a nice custom cable.2) I am experiencing a really exhilerating improvement  for HD650 after I replaced the stock cable with a pure silver cable.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00F2JG4P4/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?qid=1425746558&sr;=8-3&keywords;=hd650+silver+cable\u03c0=AC_SY200_QL40&dpPl;=1&dpID;=317K1rw6nLL&ref;=plSrchI'D LIKE TO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CABLE for any HD650 user. It's an easily affordable PURE SILVER CABLE which placed the HD650 onto a totally new level of sound. I would definitely advice you not to waste your money on expansive copper wires or silve-plated copper wires. Actually I also have bought a silver-plated copper wire sold at Amazon and Ebay which is by no means recommendable with regard to the pure silver cable.No exaggerated highs and suppressed lows as a silver-plated cable. With the pure silver cable, the highs became just sufficient to lift the veil and give life to every instrument. Lows became more punchier and faster in response. No loss of bass but more clearly and accurately sounding bass with improved timbre.With the pure silver cable you can experience a huge improvement for the HD650. Highs became more clear, accurate and forward. It gave a near perfect balance which HD650 was slightly lacking.And the pure silver cable provides very accurate timbre for almost every instrument. From percussions. drum cymbals. wooden winds and brass winds and also all strings, you can hear what were unnoticed before. I was very excited when I heard how different cymbals on a drum sounded realistically and differently from each other at a definite ppsition. The piano accompaniment from a violin sonata sounded just beautiful and lovable, not to mention the violin itself. Almost every instruments restored its original timbre and were felt at their position.The sound stage became more open and wide. And the sounds from the instruments with wonderful timbre filled that space.I was also astonished when I hear the applause from the audiences at the end of a tune. What a realistic applause it is!! Just amazing.And even the records from 1959 (Kind of blue), 1964 (Getz and Gilberto) and 1975 (Paul Desmond Quartet LIVE) sounded just as reallistic and gorgeous as the recent ones!! Those who enjoy old jazz would try a pure silver cable. I would highly recommend a pure silver cable. I was totally astounded to realize this. They just made all the old jazz albums perfecly new and more enjoyable than ever before!!Sounds become more 3 dimensional and realistic. Clearer, fuller and much more enjoyable. More expressions and more powers. I felt as if I was sitting at the cafe where Paul Desmond Quartet played. Records older than 40 or 50 years just sounded terrific and realistic!!The ambience and the atmosphere all come so real to you!! It does not only let you hear the music but also brings you there, 40~50 years back from now.It has been just a thrilling and breathtaking experience. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND A 'PURE' SILVER CABLE for HD650!!Thanks for reading~!!

Coming from my Beyer DT 880 600ohm, using a Schitt Lyr tube amp and the modi dac.Both the Beyer and these sound amazing, I can't say which I like more as each are simply 'different'.  For now, I am using the Senn's over my 880s but that may just be new toy syndrome.Either way you go, for music, movies or games both pairs of cans are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions but you will need a good DAC/Amp to really appreciate either.

VFolks, to participate in this hobby you need to be social or have deep pockets. Either you go to headphone meets and actually listen to the products, or buy and sell until you find something you won't give up. No one can tell you what you will like, particularly on something as personal as headphones, where the shape of your head and inner ears are an integral part of the whole.With that said, I have owned Sennheisers for 15 years and these are the best Sennheisers at a price I can handle. Focus Camera is an actual authorized Sennheiser dealer. If you don't like them, there is an active market in used phones. Just take good care of them and keep all the materials they came with.Finally, if you are not an audio hobbyist, what are you doing buying these? There are plenty of phones at $100 or less that could keep you perfectly happy. Great headphones are like whiskey, a lot of the extra cost goes into the final 10% of improvement.

VThese aren't for everyone.  You'll find a million reviews for these headphones all over the internet but overall, my experience with them was that they did sound amazing.  Very forward mids and the detail is unbelievably out of this world.  With that being said though, they just aren't a very "fun" headphone, which is what I'm looking for.  The bass is definitely present, but it's definitely not that earth shattering rumble that I'm looking for.  I knew this going into things, but I thought from what I had read that it would be enough for me (is it ever enough?).I wanted these to be my all around headphone, 50% for gaming and 50% for music listening.  For gaming, I used a mod mic with it and it worked great as far as that goes.  Also, with Battlefield 4, the "positional audio" (identifying enemy footsteps, gun shots, vehicles, etc) in simple Stereo mode was phenomenal as well (as most open headphones are) so they will do gaming very well.

They seem to sound better as they burn in and I would recommend a upgrade of the cords it makes a big difference as I did . For the money hard to do much better unless you want to spend twice as much or more. I would say buy these .

Vnumber 1 rated headphones on head-fi (by audiophiles). the clean sound come effortlessly.  construction could be better however.As opposed to having a recessed, dark sound I think the sound quality is clean and neutral. But the force on my head and the dragging force of the cable make the user experience completely on the opposite side of the audio quality. Every time I use them I'm always in fear that they will break. After a couple weeks, I returned them.

VAwesome.  These cans make my old Sony headphones sound tin-like.  They are so much superior to my Bose headphones.  I'm glad I made the investment.  They do fit VERY tightly, but they're surprising still comfortable.  I also purchased the Fiio E17K ALPEN 2 USB DAC Headphone Amplifier in order to get everything out of the headphones that I could--I'm very, very happy with the combination.  By the way, FYI, the amp made no difference with my other headphones.

VFor the sake of comparison (for those who are familiar), I will compare these headphones to Grado sr325/Alessandro MS-2, Beyerdynamic DT860, and AKG K702, which are all headphones that I have owned in last 5 years. A lot of people have gone into detail and tried to explain the sonic characteristics of this headphone in great detail so I won't delve much into that. Long story short, this headphone is head and shoulders above the other three I mentioned here. I have seen a lot of people debate as to what kind of music these are good for, and some outright criticize it for being bad for aggressive rock or metal music. Let me tell you right now that these convincingly beat Grado sr325 for metal in my opinion, which is saying a lot since Grados are considered one of the best headphones for aggressvie rock/metal music. Grados are extremely fast but they are also too bright and can be fatiguing. These can keep up with grado in pace but aren't fatiguing at all and on top of that, have a fuller presentation.This is not to say that the other headphones I mentioned aren't good, they are all considered audiophile quality phones at their respective price point, and rightly so. However, they all have some qualms that prevents them from being good for all kinds of music. Grados, for example, are very bright, fast, detailed and have a superb mid-range which makes them good for rock and any thing with fast instrument play, like Jazz. They also excel in Guitar solos. But Grados aren't that good, in my opinion, with pop music and 60s, 70s rock which is more mellow. It has somewhat narrow sound stage and lacks fullness of texture, and when there isn't a lot going on with the music, I find the sound thin. I also had Alessandro MS-2 for a while which was very similar to Grado sr325 in sound signature. I would say better for Jazz and Rock (because of reduced treble) but then even worse for slower music (generally lacking in excitement compared to grado). The AKG K702 was, in my opinion, quite dull, specially coming from Grados. But it was not without its own moments of brilliance. Some Rock music, Pink Floyd for example, simply sounded exceptional on AKGs. It was more of a neutral sound with a wide sound stage but when the guitar solos kicked in, they were really fluid and yet laid back, giving it a mellow vibe. Lastly, the Beyerdynamic DT860s were great too, they weren't as alive as grados but had a bigger sound stage and were really really comfortable (most comfortable pairs I've owned to date). But I always felt that overall, DT860 sound was kind of a downgrade to Grado/Alessandro. It did have some positives though. For me, it was more universal than both Grados and AKGs.So well, being somewhat of a sound enthusiast, I was looking for something that would further address these issues. I must say at this point that the only way to know what you're looking for is by trying as many headphones as possible. you're not going to know what you want by using just ipod earphones. It takes time and there really is no way around it unless you spend a lot of money and purchase a really high quality set of cans. But not all people are prepared to shell out that kind of money on a pair of headphones. So, this is really a journey that most audiophiles or audio enthusiasts must be prepared to take as you also discover more of your own musical taste and sound preferences.Anyway, for my latest set of headphones, I knew more or less what kind of sound I was looking for and I concluded that it was going to be either Sennheiser HD600 or HD650. After reading countless reviews, I was led to believe that HD650s require really nice amp or can be very flawed. Combing that with the fact that they were roughly $100 more expensive than HD600, I thought I would settle for HD600 until I have a better system (I am currently using Arcam rPac as DAC with Bravo audio ocean amplifier). Then I found HD650 for $340 on ebay - new, and pulled the trigger. I was prepared to send them back if it didn't work well on my system. Fortunately, such need did not arise. As soon as I plugged it in, I knew I had found a gem and realized what countless people were talking of on forums and reviews of this beautiful headphone when they said that this was the best headphone under $500. They instantly fixed all the issues I had with my previous headphones while still maintaining most of their strengths, and adding some of its own. For example, these have a wider sound stage than Beyerdynamic and AKG; aren't sibilant like grados; have significantly more bass presence which makes them sound fuller compared to all the above; are more comfortable than Grados and AKG; and have their own unique sound signature which is better than all the rest. So for me, they convincingly beat all of the above, in almost all departments.Now, I have not tried any headphones more expensive than this but right now I feel quite content with the sound of these. Mind you this did not happen with earlier phones. I liked them all, even loved them but I knew within days that I was eventually going to have to upgrade. But I waited patiently for years, because honestly, there is no end to this. There will always be something better and more expensive out there that you want. I perceive it as a weakness rather than something to be proud of. However, right now, I feel quite content with the sound of HD650s and I cannot find any flaw. Will it always be like this? Most probably not. But looking at most reviews and people's opinion, this headphone scales brilliantly with other components. So this is definitely something I won't be upgrading for a while before trying different amp/dac combo. Currently, for my budget, this is the perfect headphone and I would recommend it without hesitation to everyone.Also, the common criticisms that you find everywhere about these are quite misleading. People have called it veiled and dark, also slow. I was always a little skeptical towards those thinking - how can so many people praise these headphones that some are calling bad for rock or metal or pop? I think that is more dependent on the source. I don't have a $1000 setup (just $350) and I find it to be adequate to drive these perfectly. Like I said, they sound better than all my other phones in pretty much all genres (this comparison is from memory as I don't have all of those headphones now).Hope this review helps you in your purchase.

VI have hearing problems, so I may not be the best person to review these. But, they do seem to accurately reproduce the music that I'm listening too. I've had a lifetime love of music and was a semi-pro musician for decades. I have recorded in NYC studios quite a few times, usually to two inch analog tape.These cans do exactly what they're supposed to do, and very well. Headphones, like guitar amp speakers need a breaking in period before they start to reach their full potential. I only have about 40 hrs. with these and they sound better with every listening session. I have been listening with no EQ added and they have a good high end and nice mid range punch. They do not emphasize the bass. If you like bass, you'll have to boost those frequencies. If you are going to use these to listen with an iPod or PC, expect to spring for a headphone amp if you want to hear what these can do.If you plug a Les Paul into a solid state practice amp, you might not be impressed with the results. Same with these headphones. The better the quality of the source, the more impressive they are. Listening to some pristine vinyl LPs with the phones plugged into my Yamaha receiver, they really shine.I got mine through Amazon for $349 and they are well worth the price. I have seen them elsewhere for $450-$500. I do not think that I would spend $500 unless a quality headphone amp was included in the price.

V(Hi there. I'm from over in the UK but thought some of you may find my review helpful. Please excuse the UK prices!)I had the opportunity to compare a pair of Sennheiser HD650s with a pair of Philips Fidelio L1s at a friend's house recently. The source was a Nottingham Analogue Spacedeck turntable fitted with a Rega RB250 tonearm and a Nottingham Analogue cartridge. (This is a superb turntable and sounds wonderful!). The amplification was a World Designs HD3S valve headphone amplifier worth about £500. To cut a long story short, after extensive listening over several hours with a variety of material, I much preferred the sound of the Fidelio L1s as I found them far more enjoyable and engaging. I understand that both sets of headphones are in absolute terms regarded as coloured. The HD650 is of course known for its fuller bass when compared to the HD600, which many feel is the better headphone. However one feels about such coloration of the sound, the most important aspect for me is whether what I'm hearing gives me pleasure and fuels my desire to spend long periods of time listening to music. The Fidelio L1s do this in aces. BTW, both sets of headphones have had many months of use.With regard to the HD650's build quality, I thought it was good but it's not in the same league as the L1s which are incredibly well made and use high quality materials. I also noticed that the paint on the HD650 had started to craze along the lower edge of the headband. Not particularly impressive in a pair of headphones that were until recently approximately £350. They were, however, very comfortable to wear and felt lighter and less apparent on the head than the Fidelio L1s, which I also consider to be very comfortable. The ear openings on the HD650s are also nice and wide and should suit the larger-eared amongst you.In conclusion, I felt that whilst the sound from the Sennheiser HD650 was certainly of a high quality, it didn't really satisfy me anything like as much as that from the Philips Fidelio L1s, which I consider to be excellent. I strongly suspect that this is because the Fidelio L1s are more coloured than the HD650s and I prefer this colouration. This verdict brought home to me the importance of making your own judgements when testing audio gear as perceived sound quality is a very personal matter. I also believe the current price of approximately £250 is about right for the HD650s. They are simply not worth the previous price of £350 in my opinion.I would certainly recommend trying the HD650 as they are very highly regarded by many people and may tick all the boxes for you. They just weren't right for me. Some other headphones I have spent considerable time assessing recently that also didn't quite float my boat for one reason or another include: Beyerdynamic DT880 Premium (250 Ohm), Audio Technica ATH-M50x, Philips Fidelio X1 and Philips Fidelio L2. It has to be said though that if it wasn't for the Fidelio X1's itchy earpads they'd have been my first choice. They are fabulous sounding headphones.NOTE: The Fidelio X1 has now been replaced by the Fidelio X2 which are making significant waves in the headphone world. (Check out innerfidelity.com for a great, in-depth headphone review of the Fidelio X2.)So, given that I was unable to settle on the Fidelio X1s, the next best choice for me were the Fidelio L1s. I've got them on now and they sound divine. My friend loves his HD650s too. Luckily there are many very good headphones to be had for under £250 so I suggest doing some serious listening to several pairs before parting with your hard-earned cash.Good luck!

p846

VFrom the very first song I played with these on I knew I finally found the quality of sound I was looking for.Just great where I can play it loud without it hurting my ears and the sound is so detailed and balanced to my ears. If these get better the more I play them like many people say I guess I am in for a real treat (although I cannot imagine much better than what this gives me).Mainly I run these through my Marantz PM6005 but also my Pioneer SC-1522-K. Other headphones I tried with these amps include the HD598, Sony MDR-V6, and the Linx Audio Lost Cause which all left much to be desired. Those sound fine plugged into my laptop, tablet, or iPhone but when hooked up to my Marantz or Pioneer it could not handle the higher volumes without distorting and hurting my ears.Perhaps I will add more later but I just wanted to get a quick review in for these since they are so great.

VI have had these phones burning in continuously for 5 days now and they sound the same as they did after one day. Burn-in doesn't seem to be a significant factor so far.I'm using these through the headphone jack of an orginal Adcom GFP-555 preamp, listening to CD through a PS Audio D-Link III DAC. I have one other set of phones - Grado SR-325i which I originally thought were great but seem to be fatiguing and intense in the mids now. The Grados have an in-your-face presentation. They can make average to poor recordings sound good but make average rock CDs like"Night Ranger's debut CD too intense and forward in the mids to listen to with the Grados. I am mostly comparing to my Magneplanar MG-IIIa speakers which have a beautiful midrange and ample bass for everything but pipe organ music.The HD-650's are the anti-Grados. the HD-650s are very laid back and the bass is. to my ears, really heavy compared to the other frequencies. I think the "extra" bass overpowers the lower mids to a degree, and the mids are already relatively laid back. I also like voices are missing some of the "flavor" they should have. I think that some of the subtle midrange tones are missing or buried in the mix because of the excess bass. I just listened to some selections from a remaster of the music from the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey". I have listened top this music on LP and CD since I first saw the movie a long time ago. I have seen the movie probably a dozen times now in various theatres. I've listened to the music with my Magneplanars and with my Grado headphones, and now the 650s. The rumble of the pipe organ bass pedal at the beginning of "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (the 2nd track on the CD) is certainly deep but has no sound character except "deep". It doesn't sound like a pipe organ pedal - it sounds like a big, fat, continuous deep tone. There's another take on this music later in the CD but it seems to be somewhat different - the bass of the pipe organ pedal sounds more like a real instrument than just a mass of bass sound. I also listened to "Gayne Ballet Suite" and "Blue Danube". These two songs sound muddled and congested. The strings and various instruments kind of blend together. This was really disappointing to me - I expected so much more. After listening to tracks from this CD, I pulled the phones off my head in disgust and put them back on the shelf!I listened to David Lindley's "Pappa Was a Rolling Stone". That sounded pretty good. Lots of bass but not too much. My preamp has knobs for bass and treble which I never use but I switched them into the circuit and dialed the bass back a bit - that helped.I listened to a Rolling Stones CD with "Beast of Burden" and some other popular songs on it and the midrange is clear but I feel like the bass is a lot more prominent than Jagger's voice and that doesn't sound "right" to me based on what I've heard with speakers. Mick's voice should be more forward in the mix and the bass should be a foundation for the music, not overpowering as it is with the 650s.I listened to Natalie Cole's "Unforgettable" CD and her voice sounds a little heavier, lower in frequency, huskies?  than it should. I listened to Elana James' (western swing, electric violin) self-titled CD and, although not the best recording, her violin doesn't sound much like an electric violin (I have seen her live many times). I listed to a CD by violin virtuoso Joshua Bell, and again not the best recording but one I've listened to with my Maggies, and the violin lakes life and lacks that special tone we associate with a violin. I also tried some rock - AC/DC "Highway to Hell", ZZ Top's "Fandango" (live) CD, and Led Zeppelin II. The guitars lack edge/bite and vocals are rather distant and rounded off - mellowed out, no edge or harshness to voices.These phones also do not seem to have the midrange "tone" of my Magneplanars. I'm listening to pipe organ music now on my speakers and the "tone" and feel of the midrange has that special woody and bell-like sound of a good pipe organ and/or auditorium. I have a "thing" for pipe organs and have listened to numerous organs in various auditoriums. The sound of auditorium varies and the intensity of the organ varies but the pipes always seem to have this same kind of sound - just more or less of it depending on the auditorium. The 650s do not convey this special flavor of the pipes and that's big disappointment. The bass-heavy sound, I think, messes with the rest of the sound.The high frequencies sound nice so far - cymbals sound nice without being too much. A little softer but better than the Grados. In general these are very detailed headphones - I can hear subtle little instrument tones I've never noticed before with my Grados.I think the best way I can describe how they sound to me is "relaxed" and "extremely polite" with all kinds of music. If you listen for details in the music, there's plenty to hear. The mid-bass on down sounds pretty "one note" to me, though. These phones are like the college professor I had that taught accounting - all the information was there, but he was the most boring prof. I ever had. These headphones get a lot right but I find them uninvolving, without that spark of life.Many people have commented that these phones and the Sennheiser HD-600 are "veiled". I would instead say they are mellow and a little relaxed in their sound. The details are all there, but not anywhere near as in-your-face as my Grado SR-325i headphones (I'm looking for a more neutral headphone than my Grados). These are very spacious-sounding headphones and I especially like that! My Grados have nowhere near the sense of space the Senns have.My partner, who likes music but is not an audiophile at all, listened to music from the movie, "The Mission" on the HD-650s and on my old Grado SR-80s (the 325i's are at Grado for repair right now). After listening to songs with both headphones for awhile, he said that the oboe didn't sound "right" on the HD-650s and everything in general sounded far away (distant) and he had to really concentrate to hear everything that's going on.Overall, I feel the HD-650's are too heavy-sounding and kind of "dark" - the bass is too strong for a good sound balance. I will be returning them to try something else instead. I have read numerous reviews on the internet where people have said they tried various headphone amps and/or one of several brands of silver headphone cable to control the bass better. If I have to pay a couple hundred bucks for new cables and buy a separate headphones amp for $200-$500 or more, it is cheaper to just try different headphones. There are a lot of high-end headphones on the market; I'm sure there are others I will prefer to the 650s. If you like a laid-back, really mellow phone with no personality, you might like these. I personally find them massively overhyped in reviews and the audio press.

VThe HD 650's are phenominal headphones, but contrary to Amazon's posted information (as of 11/29/14) these are NOT noise cancelling headphones.  In fact, they are an open back design that allows ambient noise to get thru.  They are designed for critical listening in your home or other relatively quiet environments.  If you want peace and quiet on an airplane, these are not for you.Also, while they will work just fine plugged into your iPod, phone or Pono player, since they are high impedance (300 ohm) headsets the volume on these types of portable devices may be lower than you want or expect, even turned up to the max.

VBackground:  These are my second audiophile grade headphones (first:  Grado RS1).I've loved music my whole life. Been to a bunch of great  concerts:  John McLaughlin at the Park West in Chicago / Kinks at the Tower Theater / Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall / Muddy Waters....Dizzy Gillespie both at Grant Park (Chicagoagain). Live concerts give you estatic experiences--yet there's a sadness that creeps at the end because you realize when the concert is over, you'll never hear that performance again.The concert doesn't have end, the music can become part of your everyday life, giving you joy and expanding your senses every time you slip into a pair of 650's. The people at Sennheiser have created a truly classic piece of equipment--with the right companion equipment (proper amp and source material) these headphones will bring you to tears (really).My comanions for the HD650's: O2 amp (buy direct from JDS labs in southern illinois), Fiio X5 (amazon), Sarah Vaughan (Words Can't Describe / hi res file of course / she's immortal, found at all the best places).I know I'm preaching to the choir--these headphones are famously impressive--but there might be one person on the fence, thinking "should I buy these expensive headphones for my girlfriend or boyfriend and I say to that person: " Do it! "

VI've owned my HD 650's for about 6 years now, and probably have listened to 10,000 hours of music with them during that time. They sound just as fantastic today as they did when I first bought them. They are still in great condition physically, too. The black felt material that covers your ears has turned a little brown over time, but it's really no big deal. The HD 650's are the best music investment I ever made. I didn't realize how much better music could honestly sound before I got these. I had been using the standard iPod headphones that everyone had years ago, and I could seriously never go back now. The sound is extremely full-sounding and gives the perception of coming from a wide range of directions. I would characterize these headphones as roughly neutral in character. In my opinion, they don't overly emphasize the low or high frequencies in any particular way.BUT, make sure you also invest in a quality headphone amp too in order to get the best out of them. The Schiit brand of products in particular is excellent.

VFor years my reference headphones was the Sennheiser HD 595. I am by no means an audiophile, but I do appreciate good sound, and am very distinct in what I like and don't like.I never really truly appreciated the 595 until I bought some cheap headphones for international travel because the 595 can't be folded, and was a bit bulky for backpacks and suitcases. Once, when Amazon had a pair of V-MODA on sale for cheap, I couldn't pass it up, and got it as my secondary headphones. But even after knowing they won't be as good as my 595, I was still disappointed, and that's when my audiophile itch began - I was starting to wonder, if my 595 was this good, what headphones out there can be better?Because I love hard rock, especially beautiful guitar rock like Guns N' Roses, Led Zeppelin, Ozzy with Randy Rhoads, and some newer bands like System of a Down and Avenged Sevenfold, I knew I wanted something that would accentuate the guitars and drums. So in other words, I wanted clear crisp highs of the snare drums, the deep bass of the bass drums, and the velvety mids of the guitars.So this first led me to the HifiMan HE-400, because I heard of the wonderful bass it dishes. Maybe I got a defective pair, or maybe I had to wait about 50-100 hours for it to break in, but I didn't have that time, or the money to waste to wait it out, so I returned it. The sound left me very unimpressed and underwhelmed. First, the bass was nice, but everything felt recessed, muffled. It could not come anywhere close to the soundstage and airiness and liveliness of the 595. Listening to the 595 felt like I was on stage, while the HE-400 left me way back in the nosebleeds.Having all these bad experiences left me wanting to come back to Sennheiser, which was what I really wanted all along, but was open enough to try others. So, undeterred, but not having the deep wallet to shell out for the HD 700 or 800, I made a splurge for the HD 650.So, as the title subtly suggests, I am overwhelmed. Even without its break-in time, I already know this is the headphones for me. Putting in the Guns N' Roses Las Vegas Blu ray, I compared the 595 side by side with the 650. After about 15 minutes of tuning to the 650 and getting used to it, the 595 sounds, well, almost garish. the 650 doesn't have the liveliness of the 595, but everything else it exceeds.By liveliness, I mean the 595 brings all the mids and highs to the front, so a rock band feels very festive, and the bass, while doesn't have the kick of other headphones that geared towards music with bass, nevertheless delivers a very precise and well-packaged punch.The 650, by comparison is darker - it's like comparing melted chocolate to the 595's water. The 650 sounds just so much more smooth and velvety. And that bass! It envelopes you, and the soundstage is even more immersive than the 595's.I know every person's ears are a bit different, and enjoying beautiful sounds and music is ultimately subjective, but for me, I love the Sennheiser "sound." So I will keep both the 595 and 650, and am looking forward to another few years when I can grab the 700 and 800.I think for 99% of us, the Sennheiser HD 650 is a wonderful pair of headphones - DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!

VI'm personally not an audiophile though I do enjoy music. I'm an avid gamer and use the Astro A50 for gaming (great product) when listening to music though there is a noticeable difference between them. It's really funny how much you can hear; all the imperfections and such. Very comfortable and you can wear them for hours without a problem. Great for all genres of music I've tried with them ex. Classical, hip hop, electronic, rock. If you have the money and are looking for a serious purchase I'd definitely recommend them.

VSound Reproduction At It's Best
p946
sg5
VThese headphones are extremely comfy I can war them for hours, the padding is quite thick and the velour material is amazing. The sound is just sennheiser at it's best. People think that the highs are rolled off, I don't think they are rolled off they are just a tad lower. The mids sound gorgeous and the low end has a nice kick to it. I would highly reccomend a headphone amp if you are buying these since they need a lot of Juice to sound good. Some amp reccomendations would be Cheap: fiio e12 fiio eo7k or Schiit Modi or JDS labs ODAC. These are just some but there are many more options. Again this is sennheiser at it's best and they are the "BEST" headphone company for a reason. To come up with something like this is truly magical awesome!

VHD650 vs HD598
p951
sg5
VMy review compares the HD650 against my Sennheiser HD598 headphones, which I've owned for something over two years. My 598's still work and sound great, but I wanted to know what the next series up could offer.The 650's have excellent highs - they offer a lot more (surprisingly more) detail than the 598's without ever sounding harsh. The mids provide at least as much detail as the 598's. The 650's bass provide a nice tight thump and is layered, whereas the 598's bass is underwhelming. As an aside, the bass won't shake you - you won't feel it in your chest like a good home theater/car audio system will provide you. Having said that, the 650 probably gives about as good of bass as a headphone can give.The 650 is a little more streamlined and solidly built than the 598. The 650's headband is more narrow and isn't as cushioned, but the fit is just as comfortable as the 598 and the 650's seal around my ears is tighter (a good thing). The 650 has a fairly strong clamping pressure, but so did the 598 when I first put it on. Having said that, both headphones are very comfortable and if you're like me and have sensitive ears you'll acclimate to the feeling (or gently bend the headphone band to relieve the pressure).My Sansa Clip+ mp3 player powered them fine (at a high energy sucking player volume level to produce a comfortably loud audible volume). My Onkyo home theater receiver is more than enough to power them. I should say I'm very skeptical of many headphone "good ideas" - expensive cables, "burn-in," and headphone amps have never produced a superior sound, in my experience.Does the price justify purchasing the 650 over the 598? If you're a music listener, sure. If you can buy them at a discount, definitely. But if you use these for gaming, maybe not. When I played Battlefield 4 with the 650, I can't say I noticed a sound improvement over the 598, but I wasn't swapping headphones back and forth to form a strong opinion. I will say the gaming audio difference, assuming there is one, isn't jaw dropping.

VI've had my HD 650s for three years.  I listen to them mostly with an iPhone, which about half the time is with a $150 Fiio headphone amp and the rest of the time with no headphone amp.  I also use them with my California Audio Labs CD player and my Linn Majik integrated amp.I like but don't love them.At first, I thought they were AMAZING.  I was comparing them to other headphones I've owned, which until that time were in the $250 and lower price range.Since then, I've had a chance to hear nicer headphones (with my iPhone and with my stereo).  I would say that the HD 650s sound very good, have good definition and a pleasing open soundstage.  But so do most other open-back headphones in the $400-500 price range.  The HE650s sound a bit different, a bit more laid back, perhaps.  But no better than average in this category.When it's time to replace them, I won't be buying another pair of HD650s.Should you buy these?  I'll bet you'd enjoy them a lot.  But if you can, try to listen to some other models first.  For example, AKG K701/702, Beyerdynamic T70 or DT880, Audiotechnica AD1000X, Denon AH-D600, Shure SRH 1440/1840.I would say the people who award 5 stars to the HD 650s fall into one of three categories:1) People who are comparing them to cheaper headphones as I first did, or to Bose.2) People who are comparing them to other headphones in the same price range and prefer the sound signature of the Sennheisers.  This is a matter of personal preference and I won't say these people are wrong.3) People who know a lot more about headphones than me and know some reason that I cannot determine why the HD650s are better than others at this price point.  I'm the first to admit I don't know everything, so of course you'll read lots of other reviews before making your purchase decision.But make sure you don't base your purchase decision only on reviews by people in the first category.

VI wanted to like this headphone. I have used HD595 for several years prior to getting the HD650.Sorry to say, this is a terrible headphone compared to the competition.The good:Good bassGood comfortOk soundstageNon-fatiguingNot too leaky.The bad:Roll-off in the high frequencies makes this headphone more or less unusable.It's the famous Senn veil at its absolute worst.. What a disaster.What were they thinking?? This is a quite expensive headphone, and one should expect something better for that amount..And they have some heavy competition:AKG Q701 is in the same price range and that's really a much better headphone.Almost anything from Grado, including the cheap models, beats this on SQ.Spend the same amount on a headphone from Hifiman and you will most likely be a lot happier.Something went wrong with the design of HD650, and interestingly there are still a lot of HD650 fanboys..

VI have owned the HD650's for several years now. I have listened to kinds of things with them - jazz, classical, EDM, action movies, drama movies, PC gaming, you name it. They might be best open, passive headphones available for under $1000. They are not portable by any definition. They do not isolate external noise at all. If you plan to listen to headphones in a noisy environment, look elsewhere. I would say they are the best headphones available under $500 in their category. I also own more expensive headphones and I still use the HD650's every day. The soundstage is epic, the frequency response is wide and disicplined, they never lead to listener fatigue. I've heard headphones which hit far harder in the low end, but if you really wanted that you wouldn't be reading this and would have already bought into the Beats garbage. They are more comfortable than some headphones twice the price. Unfortunately, they require some kind of dedicated amplifier to drive them properly. Even a cheap solid-state amplifier (well under $50) makes a huge difference. If you plug them directly into an iPhone, Android, or Blackberry device there will be gaps in the frequency response (almost no bass, muddy treble), but the listening experience is still acceptable. Battery-powered devices just can't swing the voltage enough to drive these headphones correctly at any reasonable volume.

VStunning sound quality. The imaging and separation are the best I've heard, soundstage is monstrous and there is very little fatiguing if any at all. No sibilance or muddy low end. Attack is fast and smooth, decay is slow. Warm warm warm. It's like having a jazz club sitting on your head. Each instrument gets its own spotlight. Comfort is a 9/10. Some slight clamping but, for me, it's fine. Nothing like some reviews claim. There's nothing I can throw at the 650 that it can't handle. For example, Gotye's song "State of the Art" builds so many layers and sounds that many headphones wash out and can't keep up. This set of headphones delivers every detail.

Jazz-rock-pop-classical--even a litle rap top my long term "set list." These fones  are excellent for all circumstances.  The key?  Even balance that is true to the recording.

p1047

VI have tried so many different headphones over the years, but I always find myself going back to my "old comfies", the HD 650s.Comparison to Other Models - There are some that do better in other areas. For better treble clarity, the AKG K701 kind of takes the cake. However, they get a little TOO "crisp" for my tastes sometimes, depending on the music. My MrSpeakers Alpha Dogs are some of the most comfortable headphones I've EVER worn, with great sound and prominent/tight bass... but they need a LOT of juice to drive them right.The HD 650s are just fantastically easy to listen to. They are well-rounded, smooth and liquidy. The highs aren't as crispy as other models previously mentioned, but the mids are divine. My favorite use of mids with any headphones I've heard are from these cans. The bass is also tight, responsive and prominent, but never too overwhelming.Do you need a separate amp?  -  The most simple answer, is "maybe not" but it would be underwhelming. They will sound good/fine, but depending on the equipment you're using (I bet an iPhone it will be not that great), you will have a tough time finding more than a "passable" level of volume.- I can plug directly into my laptop and it sounds quite nice. It uses the Creative Labs X-Fi MB3. I play lossless audio with Foobar. It drives them decently - especially for gaming.- With the Fiio X5 it sounds pretty good. The gain has to be set to "high". It sounds 20x better when paired with the Fiio E18 through coaxial. It's quite amazing the amount of punch and audio pressure you can get when you pair those two devices with the HD650. I would say that's the beginning of the "good" with what these cans can offer.- When plugged into my Centrance Hifi M8 it sounds AWESOME. If you're spending the kind of dough for a headset like these, it makes sense to invest at least as much in a good amp to drive them to their potential. The higher you go in quality, the better they seem to sound.Gaming - Love them when plugged into my Sennheiser G4ME dongle. Sounds better than the PC 363D, but those are my favorite "gaming" headphones, and with no mic on the HD 650, it's find to stick with the 363D.The best soundstage and directionality of gaming with any headphones I've heard is with the AKG K701s, to be honest.Watching movies and listening to music is the best.It's whether or not you can deal with - or prefer - the organic, soft-toned texture of Sennheiser's sound that will determine your opinion of these headphones. For classical, jazz, blues and acoustic stuff, these excel. For hard rock, they are pretty good, and with instrumental rock I prefer something a little more "bright" in the highs. For gaming, they are darned good, actually in the top three favorites. Bass does not drown out important audio cues in-game, which is great.So, yeah... I'm a huge fan of these headphones. Highly recommended, as long as one understands what kind of sound they like. Unlike most other headphones, I can listen to these all day and my ears don't get tired. Many other excellent headphones can give me ear fatigue after a while.

VMust have Reference Headphones
p1053
sg5
VThe HD 650 is definitely a reference class headphones.The HD650 unparalleled dynamic transducer produces the best mid range I've ever heard.  These are not your typical 40mm driver found in sub $300 headphones.  The HD650 diaphragm has variable thickness, specially tuned.  These German Audio Engineers really know their stuff.  The vocal it produces is simply phenomenal.If you already own or are familiar with other reference level headphones, you might not notice any major difference upon the first listening of the HD650.  But give it a few weeks of trials, then the sonic quality will become apparent.  Its ultra low distortion make the music sound pure, authentic, and clear.All I can say is that every headphone enthusiast should own one of these cans.  Not that it should be the only one in your Hi-Fi arsenal, but definitely one of the must have.By the way, I don't normally give full mark ratings (5-star for Amazon).  Because I always believe there are always room for improvements.  Unless it is something out of this world, then it'll get a 5-star.  So a 4-star rating in this case is an outstanding rating.

VI recently broke my beloved Sennheiser HD555s. They have since been re-soldered and mostly work, but I needed a new, reliable headphone. I had Sennheiser HD598s at home and enjoy them, but didn't want to get another pair of the same headphone for work.Long have I wanted to experience the HD650. For years I've looked up the mountain at them.When the time came to pick up new headphones, I looked for the best possible deal.My criteria: Good for very long listening sessions (8-12 hours in a day with rests), so they must be extremely comfortable. Good to great to listen to. Solid build quality.I tried the following:- Audio Technica ATH-AD900X: These felt cheap and didn't sound great. Nor were they comfortable.- Beyerdynamic DT880 (Pro and 250 Ohm Premium): Honestly, these sounded excellent, but I have longish ears and they caused discomfort after a while.- Various other headphones I could get my ears on at local stores (the two above I purchased and tried for a period of time).The Audio Technicas were "good," but I didn't feel they were worth even a discounted ~$150 price tag. They sounded worse than 598s and the build quality felt terrible. The Beyerdynamics sounded great, better in some ways than the 598, worse in others. I would have stopped my search there if only the ear cups fully surrounded my ears.Ultimately, I bit the bullet and bought the Sennheiser HD650 after a few weeks of searching.First impressions:- Sound Quality: Good. Better than my 598s? Not sure yet.- Comfort: Good. Worse than my 598s and 555s. The ear cup fully surrounds my ears and doesn't jam anything down, but it's relatively clampy.Amp/DAC pairing first impressions:For DACs, I tried Creative X-Fi Titanium HD, AudioQuest Dragonfly v1.2, Schiit ModiFor Amps, I tried Creative X-Fi Titanium HD, AudioQuest Dragonfly v1.2, Schiit Magni, Schiit Vali- Creative X-Fi Titanium HD: The Creative worked well as a DAC only. It didn't do great as an amp for the 650 (sounded a little muddy).- The Dragonfly did well as a DAC only. Nice and clear. As an amp, it didn't do great with the 650.- The Modi did okay as a DAC, but I didn't feel it was as clear as the Dragonfly as a DAC in front of an amp or the Creative X-Fi as a DAC (via RCA out).- The Magni was fairly underwhelming as an amp pairing for the 650 (and it was noisy with my 598, causing crackling sounds). It wasn't but, but was a little sluggish.- The Vali was decent as an amp pairing for the 650. Felt a little cleaner and brighter than the Magni, but still wasn't quite *there* for me.I continued trying to find the best way to make the 650 work for me. I really wanted to love them. So I listened to them.For the DAC, I ditched the Dragonfly and Modi because the Modi was worse than the other options and I already had a Creative X-Fi Titanium HD, and its DAC sounded very good to me (roughly the same as Dragonfly).For the Amp, I decided to grab an Objective2 (from Mayflower, customized Desktop O2 with RCA input and power in back and 1/4" headphone out).Second impressions:- Wait a minute, I'm starting to get it... these headphones are... awesome.- Paired with the X-Fi's DAC going to the Objective2 amp, the Sennheiser HD650 sings. Great clarity, crisp responsiveness, good highs, good lows, good mids, good soundstage.- Am I just imagining things? Maybe if I try my 598 they'll seem just as good. Nope. 650 is more punchy, has deeper bass, and feels more musical than the 598.- But they're still clampy (less so than when I got them due to wear). So I searched the internet and discovered you can gently bend the metal on the headband by extending them as far as possible and bending just the metal portion slightly (I gripped the metal exclusively). Ahhhhhhh... there's Sennheiser comfort.Conclusion:Paired with a proper Amp and DAC and given some time, the Sennheiser HD650 lives up to its position on the throne of sub-$500 headphones. I picked mine up for $410 here at Amazon and don't regret it. Even if at first I admittedly was considering sending them back.

VCompared to VModa M100
p1100
sg5
VI can't really bring anything new to this review that anyone else hasn't said. What I can bring is my experience with owning the VModa M100 to the Sennheiser HD650. I have both headphones playing out of a Firefly from woo audio at work. At home I have a Fiio E09/E07 set up.Regarding sound, Their both really fantastic, Sure the 650 is balanced and highs are super clear, but the sound as most know is very characteristic of Sennheisers sound which is more neutral flat and clear. Just something perfect for hearing something as it was meant to be. The M100 Produces a very wide range soundstage if you have great equipment to power it. Its also got more of a bass response for more modern music. So their just two different but great headphones.Build Quality - This is where the M100 really pulls away from the 650. The M100 feels like it was designed for the military to be used at shooting ranges and in airplanes. The 650 just feels plasticky and delicate. Like I have to set it down gently. That if it fell off the table the mesh on the outside might dent or chip away.Fit - The M100 is my commuter, I wear it in the winter when its cold out it keeps my ears warm. And in the summer it makes my ears sweat. There is no breathability as its almost a complete closed back. Which also helps with sealing out all environmental noise. Band feels nice never needed any breaking in and adjust well. The 650 breathes fantastically well as I can wear them now for hours and hours with out feeling hot in the year or fatigued. The strap at first is very very tight, to the point where i was getting headaches at first. After the second week of long day usage it finally wore in. The Ear cups are also very generous and fits around the side of your heads and don't even touch any part of my ears.I really do love both of them and find that I listen to both equally. Or one for different times of my life. On an interesting note, The M100 can be driven by anything and can be used for all your gadgets. The HD650 not so much, i would consider this a strict desktop home audio set up with a good amp needed to get full potential out of the headphones.

VThese are for sure my favorite pair of headphones yet, though from what I have heard others dislike this brand either because there's not enough bass reproduction or they are too tight, luckily they fit my head snugly and I have only had ear pains wearing them for over 10 hours. The bass reproduction is a more neutral tone than most headphones but still can kick when listening to deep audio. These headphones have an outstanding sound stage and open design that allow my ears to breath. The design is pretty modular and parts look fairly simple to replace so don't worry if you break something.

VBest pair of cans I have ever owned!!!!
p1130
sg5
VI upgraded from the HD 540s which served me very well for many many years.  However upon putting these cans on my head and playing some high rez (320 Kbs) tracks immediately confirmed that I had made the right choice.  The build quality of the unit is excellent.  Everything on the headphones is tight and solid.  I have used them both on my Onkyo home receiver (which was best) and on my Sound Blaster X-Fi card.  True to the reviews these headphones are warmer in sound and favor the lower range (bass) which is just fine with me.  However to my surprise they kick the highs with clear, sharp, and clean tones.  So the overall range exceeded my expectations.Now that I've got the fan boy stuff out of the way a word of caution.  These are open air units and if you have never used open air cans your in for a treat.  BUT they do require you to understand that your environment that you use them WILL impact your experience.  Also anyone in the space you are using them will be treated to the track you are enjoying as well.If you have the money I highly recommend buying these.  If you don't have the money go to the blood bank, sell your blood, and get these cans.  What are you waiting for you could die tomorrow so seize the day, buy these headphones, and transport yourself to an audiophile headphone heaven.(Note: There are more expensive units out there that I'm sure kick these 650s @ss but for the money I think these are the best on the market that I have tried.)

I recommend you to use an amplifier as well because of the high impedance. All of my friends whom I showed this headphone said this is crazy. And, this headphone experiences inspired them so hard so they got interested in sound quality and some of them bought some decent headphone.

VBeing an engineer, I find myself scrutinizing everything. I'm disappointed oftentimes, especially when it's blindingly obvious there was little thought put into a product design. I often swap gear just to behold something new. My obsession is not for the latest and greatest however; it's for well designed products.I've been on a sound journey of sorts. While still an amateur by some standards, I've learned a lot. I've tried nearly two dozen headphones of various styles over the past couple years. I've found  my over-the-ear headphones though.. these are the ones. There are countless reviews already covering sound characteristics, so I'll just say that these sound amazing. Bass is solid and deep without being overwhelming, soundstage is excellent, mids and highs are clear and present. Drive them with a decent amp of course.On form, function, and design, this is a STUNNING piece of hardware! Weight is perfect, clamping force is perfect, feel is perfect. I hold them up with one finger and am pleased with the weight. I put them on and feel confident they'll stay in place as I move around. The cups fit around the ear nicely thanks to their shape and size. The quality and softness of the earpads and headband cushion make me smile, materials selection is top notch! Can I get more stuff that feels this good?On durability, I'd like to first say this, it falls on the owner to use a product within its design parameters. Any well designed product has design intent built into it; in other words, it's meant to be used a certain way. Use it in that way with care and precision, and the product will last. I scrutinize these to find solid, satisfying design features everywhere. They're sturdy for a product so light and nimble. The metal headband offers good resistance when adjusted, the cups swivel on well designed pivot points, the cable plugs in to a durable connection point for a solid connection. The metal mesh is beautiful yet tough, the housing is a light metal. I could go on and on.. rest assured it's obvious the Sennheiser engineers earned their pay with this one.This is an unconventional review as I focused mainly on design quality. Product design is important to me. If you're like me and you find yourself scrutinizing things, I assure you'll appreciate this beautiful piece of technology.  There's a reason why this design has stood the test of time and remains relevant. It's hard to improve on something so close to perfect. These are a brilliant set of cans folks. I love them and I'm keeping them. That's saying a lot.  I'm done, I've found the ones..

VI am almost a collector of high-end headphones.  I actually think these give my HD 800s a serious challenge when paired with the right amount of power.  You absolutely need a headphone amp to get the most performance from these gems, but you don't need to spend that much on the amp to get great results.  Even the bargain priced Schitt-Magni drove them very well.  I actually find them to be outstanding when played through an OPPO BPD-105.  This player has remote volume control, and ample headphone power to get the best from them.  I really can't find any material flaw in their sound.  It may lean a touch to the warm side compared to some of the the more clinical sounding options out there, but it is not enough to feel like it is impacting the accuracy.  With a solid state amp, they just sound like the have a high quality tube amp in the mix.Highly Recommend!!

VThe sound is fantastic when you play the right CDs. Yes, the right CDs. Not all music is recorded in the same manner. I do find the open back design sort of annoying though because you can hear EVERYTHING around you and you can't listen to them in the same room with other people because they can hear the music you're listening to which defeats headphones in my opinion. For music like the The Beatles, though. It's like candy for your ears. You will hear stuff you never ever heard before on lesser headphones.

VI have tried many headphones and setups at local shows.  From electrostatics to very high end dynamics.  These headphones paired with a Woo Audio WA6 or WA2 and a nice DAC will sound fantastic.  I recommend some nice 6SN7 like vintage sylvanias or RCA's and a USAF-596 rectifier.  Of course FLAC as your source and it sounds perfect...

VHD 650 - King!
p1248
sg5
VBusting The Famous HD 650 Myth - Is It Really Hard To Drive?All that is Audiophile BS!It isn't hard to drive.It sounds just fine out of an iPhone or MacBook Air but the volume just isn't there. Also, the inbuilt DAC is as good as it gets. But iDevices don't have the voltage or current to drive a phone like HD 650 sufficiently. So even at low volume there is clipping resulting in audible and measurable issues.At very low volumes you're okay but there is still clipping as there is no reserve. You definitely don't need to change the DAC.All you need to do is get a powerful amplifier (read powerful, not expensive): that is powerful and transparent, to provide enough clean power. Something like a Superflux HA3D or Objective2 is more than enough. A FiiO E12 isn't enough and it also colors the sound audibly, so I won't recommend that.As long as you can a good enough amp that is transparent, a HD 650 will sound as good as it gets. Unless of course you're talking of coloring the sound, tubes, placebo, volume changes, clipping etc.An Asus STX headphone jack is way more than enough to drive HD 650 to its full potential. An O2/ODAC should audibly be similar as well. And so will other expensive systems like Benchmark 1 and Violectric amps. Everything else is either color/distortion, clipping or plain placebo!Audiophile AMP Myth Busted!Audiophiles feel an amp is supposed to change/affect the sound. Wrong!It is supposed to be a wire with gain, to amplify the signal, i.e. make it louder.I accept most amps in the market do color the sound, but that isn't what an amp should ideally do. And a lot of non sense out there is plain placebo. Whether you like it or not.Color = Distortion. Period!As long as you have the correct amp for a headphone (this isn't synergy but there is a measurable science behind this), and you're not clipping and of course the amp must be audibly transparent, all of those amps will sound the same.To get the volume equal you need to use a Millimeter. Doing it by ear or by a sound level measuring device is non sense.As far as the HD 650/600/800 are concerned, all the below amps should sound more or less the same, if not absolutely identical:STXO2Benchmark 1Vioelectric neutral ampsAlthough there is more to this than merely output impedance, but a good rule of thumb is that for a dynamic headphone, if your amp's impedance is less than 1/8th that of your phone, you'll be fine.The STX has an impedance of 10.7 ohm. So phones that are 80-100 ohm or more will be just fine.HD 598 is 50 ohm I think. So technically there will be a sound signature change with slightly more bass and slightly less treble, and audibly so. But thankfully I have tried a HD 598 with it and it is fabulous indeed. Not as much as the HD 650 of course. :DO2 and a Benchmark 1 have impedances below 1 ohm. So they can pretty much run any phone out there.And this rule doesn't apply to planar phones like LCD2.And then of course there are some exceptions that require too much voltage/current like HE6, K1000 etc.The STX and O2 are fine for HE6 as far as measurements are concerned. From what I've read by other science people, that is. For K1000 - No!Transparent = Transparent wrt the audible domainIf two amps are audibly transparent, they will sound the same minus placebo, irrespective of one being better or vice Verma.If one is colored/warm/bright etc, of course there will be a difference. But a very slight one. These differences get exaggerated out of promotion. Even a colored one may often be difficult to tell apart in a Double A/B Blind Test.Audiophile DAC Myth Busted!Transparent = Transparent = iPhone/ ODAC / STX / AEX / MacBook = SameColored = Distortion = Slight Difference = Muses/ Android phones (I jus got heard Moto G 2014 though)Colored DACs may sound slightly different. But that is distortion. Not hi fidelity. That is not how a DAC is supposed to be.A DAC isn't supposed to have a sound. If it is audibly transparent, it sounds the same. End of story!An iPhone DAC is good enough for any application in the world. It is that flat and transparent.HD 650 v/s HD 598A HD 650 sounds better than a HD 598 even out of a MacBook Air. But the MBA amp isn't powerful enough to do justice to it let alone making it loud enough. It is okay though, but not ideal. But it is 100% transparent and clean.An STX or O2/ODAC or Superlux HA3D/iPhone is as good as it gets.Everything else is either placebo or color, and it is mostly placebo.I have been a victim of this placebo thing for years as well. No more!If you have enough volume without color/clipping (this is hard to say without measurements) you're doing great!The HD 598 is great.But the HD 650 is a small but clearly audible jump across the board. With the only drawback being that it is a bit darker but nevertheless more natural and refined.The HD 650 is as good as it gets under USD 500-1000 once you take into consideration comfort, warranty, sound etc as well. Of course the LCD2 is a big jump in terms of sound, but the HD 650 is far more neutral (I'll explain soon) than a LCD2 at least, perhaps not in absolute terms. And the LCD2 is a pain to wear.Under USD 500, HD 650/600 are undisputed kings. Beyond USD 500 it may become debatable. And of course although I have not tried the HD 700, I'm sure it should be a decent jump over the HD 650/600.Don't compare to phones like K701/702 or DT 880. There is a reason the Sennheiser is more expensive and sought after.The ear doesn't hear sound like a flat Frequency a Response. So no matter how you find the FR curve of the HD 650, that doesn't make it overly dark. That is probably the curve followed to an extent by the ear as well.Of course HD 600/700/800 might be a slight touch more neutral, with HD 800 being on the bright side of neutral.Treble:HD 650 is better than HD 598 but only where treble is truly required. HD 598 is livelier and more fun otherwise. And far better to the untrained ear. And I do agree HD 650 is slightly dark, so perhaps not for everyone. But it is possible to get used to it and even enjoy its natural sound.Bass:HD 650 is louder than HD 598 in bass. Both are tight. Pretty tight. HD 598 is a tad tighter. HD 650 is a tad softer. Neither is bass heavy/light. HD 650 is definitely softer and with more rumble I guess.The tightest I heard the HD 650 was with a Beta22. But it wasn't neutral. It was warm. No doubt. Far from transparent.Mids:HD 598 is mids forward. HD 650 has magical lush mids. Need I say more? Ya, HD 650 is slightly better.Comfort:Both are great. In their different ways.HD 650 v/s HD 800HD 800 is slightly more detailed, refined and with more treble. But when you compare them side by side.I compared them with Muses and Project Ember (not STX, just for those naysayers).They are very close. HD 800 is better. But HD 650 is slightly more natural.The difference is far less than people make it out to be.The difference is similar like that of going from a HD 598 to a HD 650. It is there. But not night and day, irrespective of the amp/DAC.I've even tried a Beta22/Lehmann BCL, just to shut people up. :PIf I had the money, I'd take the HD 800 in a heart beat. But I don't. And the HD 650 is close but not quite there. So it is well worth the price as well.And although I've not tried it, the HD 800 runs just fine out of a STX. My friend has tried one with a STX and an Essence One and there wasn't much difference unless you try to start nitpicking, and there isn't much difference even then.A FiiO or iPhone amp is of course not capable of running the HD 800 though, with the exception of FiiO desktop amps perhaps. Won't comment on that though.But the HD 800 is definitely a superior phone and I'd definitely get it if money wasn't an object. But a HD 650 is a close rival, though in a slightly lower league.

VThese headphones have officially blown my mind.  I have them attached to a xonar stx and set the impedence to 300-600 ohms.  It has truly changed the game.I upgraded from the senn 558 which had the foam mod done to improve bass response.  The amount of clarity, especially in the realm of bass and drums, is dramatically improved.  Listening to Hendrix, Led, the Stones and the beatles has never been this good.  Individual instruments have never shined through quite so much.

VNo Regrets - My ears like 'em
p1271
sg5
VThere are so many headphones out there, the choices were overwhelming. I got these after reading article after article for about 3 weeks. My local Best Buy pushed Beats and Bose for high end, but no Sennheiser (600's on up). My town doesn't offer a store with high end headphones, so I was taking a risk when I pulled the trigger on these. Remember, everyones processing of noise is different and though these may be perfect for me it may not be perfect for you.My other review for the AudioEngine D1 DAC talks about my set up (and my background), but a couple things changed since then. I use this with the mentioned DAC on an iMac (2010) and Macbook Pro (2012) using iTunes with Amarra (full version). I also used this on my Pioneer VSX-521 Receiver (not high end, but had it for a while) with my laptop/DAC plugged in; set to Direct Mode. This allowed me to have amplification without the receiver processing the sound with unneeded filters.The headphones were packed in a blue/grey Sennheiser box. It's cardboard, but thicker and tougher with little metal hinges to open the lid. Inside the headphone were nestled in molded foam. It also came with a 1/4" to 1/8" adapter. I chuckled a bit because I haven't seen an 1/4" plug since I was a kid.I was worried after spending the money that my DAC wouldn't push these monsters. I completely forgot these were NON-POWERED phones, but my DAC worked quite well with them. These should not be used for an iPod or phone (according to articles), but I was surprised at the sound using my iPhone 4S and Bongiovi's DSP app (volume at 9). This was just a test, not normal use.The sound was extraordinary to my ears. I first tested it on a 24/96 version of the Brandenburg Concertos and was amazed of the separation of the lows, mids, and highs. I could distinctively focus on each instrument. I then tested this on a 24/96 version of Dark Side of the Moon. Though my QC15's were good, these phones were amazing when listening to more demanding music such as Classical or Progressive. It's been a couple of weeks and they've changed the way I listen to music. I can't even read to music anymore with these on because I'm too focused on the sounds coming at me.There are enough reviews out there for the HD650 to make a good informed decision, but as I said, it's subjective for every person. I plan on building a Crack Headphone Amp to power these even further, but right now I'm loving what I'm hearing.

VBased on all the positive reviews, we shelled out the $500 for the Sennheiser HD 650 headphones thinking they would be better than the Sony headphones we already have (MDX something, $200).  We received the Sennheisers yesterday, and they are going back today.  I can't really say that the quality was good or bad, because, even at the highest volume, it seemed I had noise dampening earplugs in.  The little booklet that came with the headphones says that the Sennheiser phones make one feel surrounded by the music...I was left wondering, "Where's the music?"  I kept searching the phones for a switch or volume control, or something that would indicate a bad connection or damage, but to no avail.  Lesson learned; more expensive does not always mean better.

I received the Sennheiser yesterday, and was so disappointed in the quality of the sound coming out.  Even at full volume, it seemed that I was only listening at half volume or less.  Subtle sounds were lost, as was the "boom" "boom" of the base.  I was expecting so much more for $500.  I highly recommend the Sony product.

VI have owned these phones for nine years, and as a studio engineer (of over thirty years) use them for many hours every day. They have not chipped, broken, fallen apart or failed in ANY way. They are the most reliable, well-designed and well-built phones I have ever seen or used.I am completely and intensely satisfied with the HD 650s frequency response curve, headband pressure, sound quality and craftsmanship. As with any personal sound device, headphones are one of the most notorious for preferential choice. Since these are not cheapo phones, it is recommended that one try to find a set to audition prior to purchase. However, that said, just scope the vast majority of very positive reviews by some of the most respected top audiophiles, and go ahead and get these phones without remorse.Additionally, when trying to describe how these headphones "sound," especially compared to the huge number of other, decent ones out there, putting these on and tuning in is like a breath of fresh air. You might listen to a dozen fine examples from top-end makers - in all price ranges - but when you put these on, you are home. The sheer comfort and complete lack of "bad" sound is almost overwhelming.

VMy first try at the HD650 was not so good, it was muddy, veiled and I end up selling it and keeping the HD600. I felt the HD600 was better sonically. After I bought the Asus STX with headphone amp and bought another HD650, totally diffrent story. The HD650 is great but you must have a headphone amp. I notice the HD600 does not scale as much with an amp, but the HD650 scales up. From what I've read, the better the amp/componets the more the HD650. I am looking to get a tube amp and try that out. I still be connecting the tube amp the the STX RCA jacks so the STX might still be the low part in the chain. I ripped all my music to WAV. I belive I used EAC to rip a bit perfect copy.

VGreat sound, less comfortable. Get the HD 600
p1304
sg5
VI had a pair of HD 600s for 4 years and loved them.  I work in the consumer electronics industry and I used the HD 600 professionally to listen to audio from new hardware under design and on several occasions I was able to detect minor problems just by listening.  I moved and the HD 600s didn't move with me. I missed them and I decided to splurge on a new pair, and the HD 650 seemed like they'd be an upgrade.  In retrospect (I've owned the 650s for 9 months now) I feel I made a mistake.Sound:While the 650s deliver great sound, I find the 650s not living up to my memory of the 600s.  I no longer have the 600s or any test equipment and I hate to resort to audiophile lingo like "less rich" or "slightly muddy" so let's just say I feel the HD 650 are "almost, but not quite as good."  FWIW, I listen to the HD 650 with a DACmini, which theoretically is superior in every way possible to the equipment I used to test with the HD600.Comfort:The HD 650 are also too tight for my liking and feel a little heavier, hotter and generally more tiring to wear.  Even after several months I find I need a break if I wear them for more than an hour or so.So while the HD 650s are very nice, my recommendation is: save $100 and get the HD 600.

I can say the sound of them (at this price) is amazing, I really don't think is worth to spend 3 times more to get a HD850 to get like 10% more on audio fidelity.

VOh, one of the most beloved and well known headphones in the audiophile community. These were my 'dream' headphone since the beginning of my audiophile journey. One I never thought I'd ever buy back then. It's also one of the few headphones that after I learned what sonic quality I wanted in a headphone, didn't think I would personally like. If I had bought them months or years ago, I'm not sure I would've liked them. I tend to prefer a bright, aggressive, bass and treble-centric headphone. The HD650 is known to be the opposite. Dark/warm, relaxed, and smooth, with dulled treble response. You can see why I was very adamant about not ever giving these a chance.It wasn't until recently that I wanted to venture out and look for something a little different from my normal preferences. An alternative that I'd use whenever I wanted to sit back, and enjoy a soothing sound, with forward mids/vocals that I could watch my TV shows, movies, anime with. Ironically, my secondary can is considerably more expensive than my main can (DT990s) at the time. Lol, Head-fi logic. Well, I went and took the plunge, hoping for the best, but expecting the worst. I thought I would hate them. Really. It was an experiment that would cost me, but one I needed to do at some point, as the HD650 was always that ONE headphone I was always curious about (more than any other).So what happened? Did I like them? Hate them? To my surprise... I loved them for music, movies, TV, and anime, and liked but wasn't thrilled by them for gaming. Let's get into the sound.Bass: The lows. Well, this is surprising. They are actually pretty bassy. Not DT990 bassy, but they have a nice, full, bassy sound. I'd say it's between the DT880 and 990 in presence. It's a warm bass, with medium speed. Pretty much ideal for all-rounder headphones with good bass that would please those that like balance and a fun signature. The bass quantity is enjoyable for all crowds, unless you're a pure neutral-head or pure bass-head. I didn't find myself wanting more bass, though they do roll off in the sub-bass, which is typical of most dynamic headphones, something the HE-400 has no problems with.If I could score the bass, it'd be; Quantity: 7.5, Quality: 8. Just really pleasing bass all around.Mids: This is the star of the show. And when I say star... I mean, it is absolutely one of the best interpretation of mids/vocals I have EVER heard on any headphone...EVER. I'm usually fine with mid recession as I tend to prefer bass and treble emphasis, but MAN... once I heard the HD650... it made me see mids in a whole new light. The vocals are so sweet, so upfront, so rich, so haunting! Based on mids alone, I recommend this headphone to ANYONE looking for a headphone that does vocals some amazing justice. The only other headphone that provides really sweet mids that I've heard is the Audio Technica ESW9, but the ESW9 is a closed on ear, with a considerably smaller soundstage, and overly smooth treble, and stuffy sound signature in comparison. The ESW9 is good, but not HD650 good.The HD598 also has very forward mids, but I felt the lean bass, and thinner sound, made the mids sound unnaturally forward and shouty. The warmth and fullness of the HD650 basically destroyed any chance the HD598 had in a direct comparison. There was no competition. The HD650's mids demolish the HD598's in tone, realism, and richness. The HE400 is often compared to the HD650, and despite my preference for the HE400, the HD650 is clearly the king of mids here. The HE400 has great, INTEGRATED mids, that don't sound pushed back or forward with a realistic tone. That being said, the HD650's forward mids are special. The HD650 clearly wins here. As far as Q701 and HD650's mids, the HD650 wins again. The Q701 has forward mids, but they aren't nearly as full sounding, or as rich.Long story shot, the mids are godly. If I had to score them: Quantity: 10, Quality: 10. That is perfection, because that's how I feel about the HD650's mids.Treble: Oh the treble. This is single-handedly the ONLY reason I have put off getting the HD650 for so long. If you read about the HD650, the treble will always be discussed and debated on. Are they too smooth, rolled off, undetailed... veiled? This is a debate that will never end on Head-fi. As a fan of treble sparkle and some emphasis, I was absolutely mortified about hearing what people said of the HD650's smooth, laid back, dull, treble.So how did they sound to me? Surprisingly, I REALLY liked the treble! I didn't LOVE it. I still do prefer some more sparkle, but as the relaxing alternative to my typical treble emphasized headphones, I didn't find the treble overly smooth or dull on the HD650. Trust me, when your main can is the DT990 which is known for it's SUPER treble emphasis, and compare it directly to the much more reserved and rolled off treble of the HD650, you would tend to notice a huge difference. In all honestly, I really thought the treble on the HD650s was right where it should be for the type of headphone that the HD650 is. Without that treble, I think the HD650 wouldn't sound as rich and 'creamy' as they do. Would I use the HD650s as my ONLY headphone? To be frank, no. They performed well in absolutely everything except genres that desired an aggressive signature. Stuff like metal, and EDM just didn't have the energy on the HD650s. So no, they aren't the perfect all rounders. However, through some vocal dependent tracks, and stuff like movies, TV, and most non-music needs (even gaming), the HD650s are indeed in a very good place. Unfortunately, I tend to listen to EDM and metal more than anything, so the HD650 lost a few points.To score the treble; Quality: 7, Quantity: 7. If the treble is boosted by a bit, these could be what I'd consider very natural to neutral with a slight emphasis towards bass. I think they'd be less rich overall though, so I personally wouldn't want to touch what makes the HD650 what they are.Amping: I have the HD650 paired up with the Audio-GD SA-31 which is much more powerful than pretty much any amp most of you use, or would use, so I'm not exactly sure how they'd sound with less power, but I personally felt that they aren't as hard to drive as people make them out to be. They need considerably less power than the DT990/600, and possibly even the DT990/250. I'd say they'd need about as much as the DT990/32 for at LEAST volume level. We know power =/= volume, but it helps. To be clear: they do not need a lot to be driven LOUDLY. I tested them with the Mixamp only, and they can be driven off it loud enough. I didn't test it enough to see how well they're actually driven, but they sounded good. They may be a little thinner sounding, which could actually be a good thing for gaming, as it makes pinpointing sounds a bit easier than the very rich, thick signature the HD650s have with the SA-31.Okay, so how did they perform for gaming?---START GAMER SECTION---Soundstage: I haven't gotten to the specifics of gaming with the HD650s yet, but I'll mention the soundstage first. With and without extra amping the Mixamp, I felt the HD650's soundstage to be medium sized. Not big, and not little. However, I didn't find them to be stellar in terms of depth, so the sense of space for gaming, wasn't as good as I would have hoped. I was always expecting the HD650 to not be the greatest pairing for Dolby Headphone, and my fears were slightly warranted. The front/back depth isn't great. Let's get that out of the way. The width is good, but not close to being the best. The DT990 destroys the HD650 in both depth and width. So how's the air within the soundstage? Well, the problem with the HD650, is that it's a very full sounding headphone. Thick, warm tone tends to make the soundstage seems less airy and smaller. This is one of those times where a thinner/leaner sounding headphone has the advantage, like the AD700/HD598/K701. The HD650 isn't STUFFY like say the ESW9, but that rich tonality doesn't help gamers.Positioning: Positioning and soundstage tend to go hand in hand, so if the soundstage isn't great, the positional cues will suffer. How did the HD650 fare positional-wise? Well, they were good. Not great, and could obviously be better, but they do their job. I could play something like Black Ops without any problems, though having used headphones much better for soundstage/positioning, I could tell they lacked a bit. I'd put the HD650 just ever so slightly above the DT880 positional wise, but they aren't that much better.Clarity: You need clarity for soundwhoring in competitive gaming. Despite the laid back treble, I found the natural tone of the HD650 to be very detailed. The forward mids came off very clean and clear, and I felt I didn't miss any sounds. I've heard better overall (even the 990's are better for soundwhoring). The problem is that the HD650 is a very thick sounding headphone. Basically, the issues I explained in the soundstage section is what hurts clarity for gaming purposes.---END GAMER SECTION---Comfort: I mentioned that Sennheiser likes their clamp. The HD201, HD280 Pro (!), PC360, and HD598 all have some form of clamp. The HD650 is no different. They do clamp a bit more than I'd personally like, but it's a minor gripe overall. I find the HD650 to be very comfortable overall, and over extending the arms a little, to wear the HD650 slightly loose alleviates the clamp a bit. I've felt better, but not much better. The velours are great. Not too firm, and not too soft. The cups are huge and will fit ears very comfortably. I like the oval shape, which makes them easier to use while laying down compared to circular cups.Value: The Sennheiser HD650 is a considerably expensive headphone. If your main purpose for getting a headphone is gaming, there are considerably better options for less. If pure audio fidelity, and non-gaming purposes is your main purpose, the HD650 is incredibly hard to beat. Their sound signature is just stellar for most things, save for a few genres, and they're competent for gaming, just not stellar. I personally can't justify owning both the HD650 and HE-400, so I stuck with the HE-400 which is a more energetic, and better equipped for gaming use.Final Impressions: The HD650 has a very special place in my heart. It took years to finally take the plunge, but I'm VERY glad I did. They have quickly become one of my very favorite headphones. Though their gaming performance isn't as stellar as I would have hoped, it's better than I expected. I absolutely love the HD650 overall, and they have made me see the importance of mids, if even for just non-gaming, non-music use. Movies and TV shows are made for the HD650. Their incredible tonality, rich/full sound, perfect mids are an absolute blessing. Treble is definitely it's weakest aspect of sound, but they aren't veiled, just...reserved.For gamers looking for all-rounders, these do put up a fight. They're better than the vast majority of headphones I mentioned on this guide in terms of audio fidelity, but in raw performance for gaming, they're outclassed by others costing considerably less.

VHello,I have been on the search for a good set of headphones to use for general music listening, and as studio referencesAlong with a FiiO E9K and Topping TP D2 as amps, I picked up a set of these and a set of AKG Q701'sWhile the 650's have a nice, full-bodied, rich sound, the tonal separation in comparison is incredibly noticeableDepending on the type of music you listen to, the additional bass response from the 650's may make them worth the money, as the 701's do not have as full a bass response, but when it comes to overall audio clarity and tonal separation, they pretty much destroy the 650's, as the 701's keep the bass frequencies nicely separated, whereas the 650's carry more bass, but at the expense of frequency separationI listen to a lot funk, jazz, and house music, so your mileage may vary when it comes to tonal preferenceAlso, these things grip your head like a monster if you have a large head, they give me headaches after half an hour listening, even after I stretched them consistently over a period of days

VI Prefer the HD600's,,,
p1338
sg5
VI'm a music lover, but also enjoy music production in various forms.  I enjoy a lot of genres of music. I do love to sit back and get lost in the music but I also like analytic and critical listening as well.  It's a little hard for to me to review these, since I'm not the targeted demographic for these.  They seem to be designed for more laid back listening or for those that enjoy a more colored sound to their music.  Not even an eq (which I don't think should be necessary for a $499+ headphone) is going to make these work for me.I own quite a few pairs of headphones, the AKG Q701 / K702 / 271MKII, the Beyerdynamic T1 / DT 770(80ohm) / 880(600ohm) / 990(250 ohms), the Grado 325is and the Sennheiser HD600.  I have had a chance to compare them all to the HD 650's and felt like the 650's didn't do anything that some of my other headphones didn't already do better.  I tried the 650's on several different headphone amps and just didn't feel they did anything special.  The main reason I didn't fall in love with them though is the HD600's. I purchased a pair of HD600's about a year ago and I loved them after I spent 10-20 hours.  When I reached 30-40 hours in I knew I would never part with them.If I had never heard the HD600's maybe I would feel differently.  They are very similar in design and have a lot of the same sound characteristics.  The HD650's have a bass boost and they are not as clear as the HD600's to me (I guess "veiled" is as good a description as any).  I feel like by DT 990's already fill that niche with a much tighter bass response (although the higher frequencies will bother some).  Now everyone has their own tastes and everyone hears music differently. Some would say the Grado's and Beyer headphones are too harsh and grating when it comes to the higher frequencies.  If you feel this way, the HD650's might be for you, although I don't find the HD600's to be remotely harsh.I really thought having the HD650's and the HD600's both would give me the best of both worlds, but to me they are too similar with the main difference being the HD650's are more veiled and bass heavy.  The head phones sound a little "slow" and at times even a little bit murky on the lower frequencies.  On some records it can feel like the bass is seeping into the mid-range.  Some people love a colored headphone with an enhanced bass sound that is more forgiving on lower quality music formats.  It works with a lot of types of music and I can see why some people prefer them.  If you are a bass head, this head phone may still be a little too analytical for you though.  There is also no question that the HD650's are the better looking headphones, the HD600's paint look like a bad pair of hammer pants from the early 90's.The HD650's are a huge step up for most people and are a great mid-fi headphone.  I just wish I would have had the opportunity to listen to them both side by side before purchasing both.  I had to get both to see what everyone was talking about, but it was an expensive "adventure."  I just don't think you really need both, if you like one, it's not worth getting the other.Either way I have to take off two stars.  One because they are severely overpriced for a mid-fi headphone.  You can usually pick up a pair of the 600's for around $280-300. You could even find a high end set of headphones like the T1 or the HD 800's used around $800-900 if you are lucky and they smoke the 650's. I'm not sure why the 650's go for $499.  The other star is because even though a colored sound may be what some prefer, I don't think you should label them "reference" headphones or audiophile headphones.  To me, getting rid of the 650's was an easy decision. To sum it up:PROS:*Cosmetically, this is a stellar headphone*It is very sturdy and parts are interchangeable between the 600's and the 598's*The cable is detachable, why don't more companies do this?????*It comes packaged in a nice sturdy box that you can use to store them in*Great for people that like an enhanced bass curveCONS:*$499 is far too much for a mid-fi headphone, especially when the HD600's often go for around $300*The colored sound disqualifies this from being Audiophile or Reference in my book*The foam in the box smells funky, but I find this is the case with the HD600's as well

p1343

VI've owned my hd650's for about 3 years now. I own them along with Senn HD25, and Shure se530 in-ear. In this whole time I've only owned a small portable iBasso D2 - Viper headphone amp. Due to Mortgage, wife agro and other obligations I've been unable to spend money on a new amp to properly drive the 650's. Because of this I preferred listening to my se530 in ears (which are fantastic btw).Recently I purchased a good bang for buck Fiio E09k desktop amp and wow. the Senn HD 650's now sound absolutely amazing. I've started listening to more 24bit lossless audio (FLAC) and it really brings a tear to my eye, especially FLAC ripped directly from Vinyl. Bass is especially what amazes me - In deep vocals, bass drum and electronic bass. Also acoustic guitars and classical string just sounds much, much more detailed. Essentially whether i'm listening to electronic, classical or rock I constantly have a big grin (remember this is a big grin after listening extensively to my se530s). My next upgrade will probably be to buy a Schiit Asgard2 amp because I already have a *ok* DAC (with swapped opamps) and I'm sure i will notice yet another gigantic "upgrade" in sound.The HD650's have gone from great sounding to my goto headphones all because they are now being powered correctly. If your considering these pricey headphones then go buy them (now!) but make sure you have a decent amp in line too. (I suggest the Schiit Asgard 2 ~$250 or more budget Fiio E09k ~ $110) and grab a DAC too along with decent interconnects. (i made my own from CAT5)You won't be disappointedPS: there is a lot to upgrade in the future with these, better interconnects, replaced HD650 headphone cable etc, but I won't go into that. Quick searches on head-fi forums and you will find all the details you need

VNatural - and some comparison to AKG k-701
p1348
sg5
VI like a natural, balanced sound that is a close to the sound of a good acoustic instrument or voice in a real room as I can find.  These are very easy to listen too and very natural sounding.  When they err, I think that they err on the side of warmth and I like that.  You kind of listen into the music with these.  I also have AKG k-701's.  I like the 701's too, but they push the detail forward and are not as warm sounding.  There's lots of detail in the Sennheisers, but it is laid back and less "in your face."  In addition, the 701's NEED a good amp to sound good but these (while benefiting from a good amp) don't suffer as much with more common equipment.They are comfortable for me with glasses on, but a bit tight even after hundreds of hours.  They are not fatiguing to listen to.  Since I got them, I only put on the AKG's when I want to have the detail of my music "light up" which is sometimes fun but is not how I hear live music.

VThese were THE BEST headphones I've ever listened through. The problem is that they are specifically designed for one purpose and that is to mix, and not only that but to mix in a quiet room due to the open air technology.unfortunately I need to exchange these for a pair that I can record with. I will however be trying Sennheiser 380 series for that unless there is something better recommended. I need them to be silent so that they don't bleed in to the mic.I previously had a Sony set and they were good, but all the material deteriorated on them after a few years. I hope that Sennheiser doesn't do the same thing.

VPerhaps my expectation was too high -with all these 5 star reviews.I was hoping it would sound better than listening to my current audio/speaker system,but it did not come close. Perhaps that's the limitation of the headphones.Perhaps all these rave reviews were written by people who never owned a goodstereo sytem.My first listening impression was that the headphones sound did not produce wow factor nor struck mewith 3D clarity or impressive soundstage.For those ears used to the slightly brighter sound, HD 650 will not be very impressive at all.Overall the sounds seemed to have been filtered, restrained or muffled. The so called Dark sound.This is perhaps a  good thing for a  long period of listening since it hardly produce any ear fatigue.Is that trade off worth? I tend to think so. Also human ears adapt to new sound so as you keeplistening to it you will notice less and less of the shortcomings of the sound spectrums that you noticed in the beginning.Like most headphones in the market, HD 650 is over priced. It just is not worth $500.

VAfter taking a break from the audio world, I was thrust back into it when my son wanted a pair of Beats by Dre for Christmas.  I had (of course) seen high profile celebrities wearing these, and at $299 I had to see what they were all about.  So I set out to see if they were worth the price.  Long story short, I ended up auditioning dozens of headphones.  I actually purchased a pair of Beyerdynamic DT880 Pros, Grado SR125s, Audio Technica ATH-M50's, Shure SRH440s, and a few not even worth mentioning.  After listening to them all for hours, and evaluating them for clarity, comfort, neutrality, and sound stage, I finally thought I had a winner with the Beyers.  But I then found out that my iPhone was woefully inept to drive them adequately.  I purchased the Fiio E17 headphone DAC and amp to drive the headphones.  And realized that, although the Beyers were great, they were far from neutral.  They just sounded that way because I didn't have enough power to run them properly.  After a few weeks of research I decided to get a pair of Sennheiser HD650s.  These cans are truly awesome.  But they ARE power hungry, so its a good thing I had purchased an amplifier.  After setting these up with some test flacs, I was blown away at the clarity.  While the majority of the cans I've had really sound decent, they sound really bright (especially the Grados and Shures).  In other words, the treble sounds harsh.  On the other hand, the Sennheisers sound smooth and flat.  The sound stage is wide and airy.  They have a similar sound to the Beyers, but without the slightly exaggerated bass.  They are light and comfortable with velor pads that seem to hug your head.  In my opinion, if you have the cash, don't hesitate because you won't be disappointed. With an impedance of 300 ohms, these can be cranked up to ear damaging levels without distortion, so be careful.  The only thing I can say about them on a negative note is that since they're open-back headphones, anyone next to you can hear what you're listening to.  But for me, that's not an issue.  Oh, and by the way, I did get the Beats for my son...oh well, can't win 'em all.  I hope this review helps.

VExcellent entree into "serious" headphone listening
p1388
sg5
VThe HD-650 is legendary among enthusiasts, and commentary is not hard to find (start with Innerfidelity.com and head-fi.org), so no need to launch into a detailed review here. But for more casual users looking to step up their headphone game, these are very highly recommended. Debates rage about how to characterize the sound and place it in the pecking order, but I'd say the HD-650 is the ideal entry-level audiophile headphone, which is not to say entry level overall, nor the end-game of all headphonia. The "warm," some say "veiled" sound is forgiving of loud genres and poor recordings, if not the absolutely most neutral choice available, nor the ideal choice for pristine recordings of classical music, for instance. To the extent that the sound is "colored," i.e., not completely neutral, this coloration is widely regarded as favorable, more so than most. Not unlike a preference for tube vs. solid state amplification, and, indeed, HD-650 shines with OTL valve amps, according to enthusiasts. HD-650 is otherwise an excellent all-around performer with different music, and also responds well to a variety of upstream equipment (amps and DACs). It's possible to listen straight out of a laptop or iPod, but HD-650 responds well to sophisticated purpose-built headphone amps and audiophile-grade DACs, including those that exceed the HD-650's price. With a fairly high impedance at 300 \u03a9, having some kind of dedicated amplification is highly recommended. Bear in mind that the price for HD-650 on Amazon does fluctuate substantially below the $499 list price, but HD-650 is otherwise an excellent price/performance proposition.

VIf you mostly play highly compressed MP3 files and plug your headphones straight into your computer, buy cheaper headphones.If you rip your CDs to lossless files, have a separate digital audio converter (DAC), these headphones should be on your "short list." You will need to spend at least twice as much to get a noticeably better sounding headphone.I paid $412 for my HD650s. Yes, that's a lot of money, but I still consider it to be a great bargain. With a good headphone amp, these 'phones sound simply amazing. They are top rated by quite a number of headphone audiophile web sites.Personally, I'm using the Schiit Modi (DAC) and Magni (amp) to drive these. The pair cost $200 plus shipping. That brings the total to just over $600. This system is phenomenal!!

VI will not suggest that I've auditioned every other headset in existence. I will instead suggest that as far as headphones go, HD 650's represent a glass ceiling for how good head-based audio can sound. Combined with a Xonar Essence, these cans will give simultaneously emit a warm soundstage and every environmental/digital artifact of whatever media you choose, regardless of quality.These headphones are worth $500. My only non-problem is that there is nothing that COULD sound better without assaulting your chest cavity, and that level of impact (which is obviously exclusive to real speakers) becomes a glaring lack when the sound is this good. You will want to physically lean forward, toward the veil, when wearing 650's; and nothing makes that staring into the abyss more maddening than noting the lack of corporeal substance to the sound that even relatively cheap standing speakers provide.Consider this a warning. I seriously doubt anyone would regret buying these on their merits as headphones, but at this tier the 650's are trying to transcend the category and that limitation can be infuriating.

VOne of the best options out there
p1441
sg5
VFor some strange reason, I waited a long time to buy these headphones. Silly me. We review one of Sennheiser's top headphone options.Originally released in 2003, the HD650 is certainly aging. In fact, the headphone market has exploded since its debut and it's no secret that there are better headphones out there. Heck, even Sennheiser has their flagship HD800 and the soon-to-be-released HD700, $1,500 and $1,000 respectively. But just because there are more expensive options doesn't mean those are the better options.If you start reading into a site like Head-fi (which I love, don't get me wrong), you'll start to feel like the HD650 is a thing of the past. Why buy the inferior HD650 when the HD800 exists?? Well, a couple reasons actually:(1) 99.9% of people would never, ever consider spending $1,500 on headphones. Most people couldn't afford it. Most that could wouldn't find the point in buying them. The HD800 is a unique headphone for unique people.(2) The HD800 is probably the pickiest dynamic headphone ever made when it comes to powering them. Typically the rule of thumb is to spend as much on an amp as you do on the headphones. That's upping the ante; 99.999999% of people wouldn't spend $3,000 on a headphone setup.The HD650 is a relative bargain in today's headphone market. So let's forget about all the more expensive, technically more superior options, if only just for the rest of this review.::::: BUILD & AESTHETICS :::::Though all plastic, they feel very sturdy and look quite sexy. I much prefer the graphite look to the HD600's mid-90's green marbling. Yuck. The velour pads are squishy enough, though the actual surface is a little scratchy. Doesn't bother me. Many people find these to clamp on your head pretty tight. Also doesn't bother me. Some people recommend stretching these out over a basketball or a stack of books and while that works nicely for most headphones, DO NOT attempt to stretch these out. There are plenty of horror stories of the headband's hard plastic simply snapping in half. Bear the slight pressure for a while and the HD650s will slowly and safely loosen up to fit your melon better.Detachable cable? Heck yeah! While this seems like a simple, unimportant thing, I value this feature so much. What if you snag the cable on something? What if your stupid cat chews through it? What if? In that case, you simply remove the old cable and stick in a new one. Plus, this often-overlooked feature allows you to quickly and easily upgrade the stock cable to something more worthy of these headphones. Me? I upgraded to the $300 15' Cardas cable. Sound nuts? I am... don't judge me. To my ears, it made a substantial difference. The nicer connections and larger gauge made the notorious "rolled-off" property disappear and I swear I can hear a more precise low-end. Definitely consider this worthwhile upgrade.::::: THE SOUND :::::What do they sound like, you ask? To be quite honest, I didn't like them at first. I came from mostly listening to the Denon AH-D2000 which offer more of a WOW! experience since they have super punchy lows, scooped mids, and diamond-like highs. The HD650s simply didn't impress me. There was no WOW! :-(Then I kept listening... and listening... and then I realized something. The low-end doesn't thump my head around. I'm hearing the warm, present midrange of Norah's sweet, sweet vocals. I also don't get lost in a sea of bright cymbal splashes. What in the world does all this mean?! It means they are pretty darn neutral.The HD650 is an open-backed headphone. This generally allows for a more accurate sound. When headphones have closed backs, sound gets trapped inside, bounces off your ears and muds up the sound (oh no!). Open backs allow longer frequency waves (lower notes) to escape as they should and produce a clearer sound. Open backs also means that the HD650 has terrific imaging. This is how it "places" instruments and people "around" your head. Ever notice how in-ear headphones trap the sound into this narrow beam in the center of your skull? That isn't the case with the HD650. Yay! The only negative is that your music is very loud to those around you. These headphones are generally best suited for private listening in a secluded space.::::: BASS :::::While the bass doesn't kick hard, it does exactly what it is supposed to. It establishes a solid platform for all of the other instruments to build off of. Some headphones have so much thick bass it makes me want to throw up. These simply play the notes they are supposed to. I hear the tone of the kick drum, which isn't something I've ever noticed with another set of cans. The most important thing to remember is to listen to properly mixed stuff. Many sound engineers will actually mix in less bass nowadays to compensate for people's bass-boosting tendencies. Other engineers boost it in the studio to keep consumers happy. Take a listen to some well recorded upright bass and it's as if the bass is in the room with you. The attack is almost perfect, the warmth is there and you can hear the fingertips scrape across the resin. Overall, the bass presentation is nearly perfect, unless you want punchy-thumpiness, in which case there are better options.::::: MIDRANGE :::::The midrange is sweet. Some headphones sound "scooped," while others pump honky midrange down your throat. Headphones are under the ultimate midrange test with chunky electric guitars and most vocalists. There isn't much else to say... The HD650 renders the midrange very well, nestled between warm bass and clear treble. No complaints!::::: TREBLE :::::Many people say that the HD650s "roll off" the treble. In my opinion, the general population has a skewed standard, People tend to like things unnaturally bright (as well as unnaturally bassy). Listen to someone singing or playing a guitar and then listen to these headphones. Listen really carefully. In any case, most people have lost their upper-frequency hearing anyways, so many people will never notice this "problem." I think the treble is crystal clear and appropriate in volume and presence.::::: REVISED HD 650 :::::Many audiophiles insist that the HD650 is a warm headphone. Some say that they're "muffled." These comments are still floating around the interwebs. Let me be clear here: Sennheiser revised the HD650 a few years back (2007-ish?). Basically, they changed a few dampening things on either side of the drivers and magically removed the dreaded "Sennheiser Veil." It's not there. The HD650 is not "rolled off." It is not "bass heavy."Having a strong musical and AV background, I can tell you that the (newer) HD650 is a very well balanced headphone. If anything, people generally want those "punchy" dynamics, which means hard-hitting bass and screeching treble. So yes, in comparison, a well-balanced headphone would have a "warm" sound.::::: THEY'RE PRACTICAL :::::Well, more practical than the HD800. At only ~$425, these are a steal in today's headphone market. I've listened to headphones that cost twice as much and sound half as good. At 300 ohms, they'll struggle out of an iPod. In fact, don't even attempt it. I used a $300 aftermarket cable and powered them with an $850 amp, however, the HD650 will sound superb through an entry-level amp and its stock cable. We're talking $600 said and done--maybe less with common price flux.::::: OVERALL :::::After 600+ hours of burn in, I find the Sennheiser HD650 headphones to be nearly perfect. I guess they aren't "the best" in any one, specific aspect, but overall, they are a serious contender for the world's best dynamic headphone. Many will disagree with my observations, but those are pretty much only people spending thousands upon thousands of dollars on audio equipment. These are among the most incredible headphones I've ever had the pleasure of listening to and are a relative bargain.Don't think; just buy.(I previously posted this review on my website, Kolulu, but thought it would be more helpful here. Hope this helps!)

VI got these headphones for my son as a Christmas present after he asked for them. He previously owned a pair of Grado SR225i headphones which he had enjoyed. After getting the Sennheiser HD 650s he will most likely never pick up the Grados again. The build quality and comfort of the HD 650s is beyond superior. As for sound quality, he tested them with a headphone amp using flac files through Foobar2000 and heard sounds in Pink Floyd and The Beatles that were previously inaudible with his Grados. These headphones are completely worth the money, but are obviously harder to drive than cheaper headphones. Use these headphones with an amp!

VIf there is one thing that Sennheiser knows how to do, it is make quality, outstanding performing headphones and the HD 650 is another in a long line of great products.I received these as a gift and have tested them on several different types of music....pop, jazz, classical, opera and country western.  Have not tried with hip hop or rap, as I do not listen to much of either of those.Probably the best description is on classical.  The ability to pick out individual instruments is incredible, there is no "blend" of the sounds like with many headphones, each of the instrument and instrument groups are clearly definable.  Vocals come clear and clean with obvious seperation between the vocal and the insturmentation.All in all, great headphones.  The ear cushions are comfortable, if a bit tight to begin with, but that loosens as the headphones are "broken in" to your head.Absolutely worth the money.

VAmazing sound, some caveats
p1457
sg5
VFirst off: These headphones sound fantastic. Since their debut a decade ago, they've become one of the standards against which all other headphones are compared. Audiophiles describe the HD 650s as "euphonic" (as opposed to the more neutral HD 600s). I particularly love the warm, rich vocals these headphones produce.Comfort-wise, these are good but not great. At 9.1 ounces, they're lighter than most audiophile headphones. But I still feel some strain on my neck and a slight pinch on my ears after extended wear, as is the case with nearly all headphones I've tried. The most comfortable headphones I've tried? The Bose QuietComfort 15s, which are slightly lighter (7.4 ounces) and distribute that weight evenly around my ears. The QC15s also have modernity on their side: A single thin cable with iPhone controls and in-line microphone, rather than a thick split cable with a 1/8" plug; a nice carrying case you can fit in your backpack rather than the shoebox the HD 650s come in; low impedance so that you can get plenty of volume out of an iPhone.Of course, comparing the HD 650s with the QuietComfort 15s is apples to oranges. These are audiophile headphones intended for use at home with an amp; the QC 15s are travel headphones, best-suited to wearing on planes and trains (where their active noise cancellation shines). But my ideal headphones would combine the lightness, comfort, and portability of the QC 15s with the rich sound of the HD 650s. As far as I can tell, those perfect headphones don't exist yet.

VThese cans beat out the Bose quiet comfort 3's and the Beats Pro for my love.Pro's: extremely lightweight and comfortable for long listening. Clear crisp sound which doesn't sound muffled. Gets better with an amp. Left and right audio seem spaced out.Con's: long cord annoys me a bit when traveling. They require an amp for volume and a richer experience. They take some time to break in.

p1467
sg5
VI am an audiophile that is willing to spend a fairly hefty amount of money for good quality headphones.  These are, in fact, extremely well made and have a tight fit.  The issue is that the bass is absolutely lacking.  I had to increase the volume on my laptop or iPad to hear it at all.  For this price, I can't live with that.  They should be relatively perfect.  Surprisingly, my husband's Bose noise cancellation headphones sounded night and day better than these did.  Bottom line, I returned them.  I will update the review once I find a pair that I am completely happy with.

VFirst experience:Out of the box it's hard to adjust the head band.  At first it seemed like I couldn't extend it beyond what would correspond to a child's skull size.  Couldn't believe that my head is that much larger than average, but wearing the headphones felt so uncomfortable that I was already considering sending them back.But finally I had the guts (fearing I would break my brand new headphones) to pull real hard, and sure enough it turns out that you can extend the head band a quite a bit, even more than I needed.  Oh well.With my ears in the right place the sound was *a lot* better too.  Quite happy about that.Comfort:These headphones are comfortable, can wear them for hours without getting tired of wearing them.Sound:At the risk of being thought of as some bass aficionado, I do know when I hear a weakness in the low ranges.  For the first time in the many years many years that I've had my Yamaha amplifier I enabled its equalizer to compensate.Don't get me wrong, I am happy with the rest of the sound spectrum, just not ecstatic because my expections were, rightly or wrongly so, higher.While it's not an apples to apples comparison of course, I had expected these headphones to create a sound experience that would be a step up from my Mission 79 Series loudspeakers.  They're great speakers, so could it be that the Missions are really that good ?  I had always thought that the purest audio experience was impossible with loudspeakers, and that good headphones would always win that contest.  But after having heard electrostatic speakers at a friend of mine I do believe there's always room for improvement.Now what?  I'll give these headphones a chance to "break in" as many other reviews mention, I'll be patient and come back after a while to add an update to the review.I probably should get myself a decent headphone amplifier first.

VThis year, I got in to higher quality audio.  I started with a modest sound card for my computer and then went on to stand alone Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) and headphone amps and higher quality bit rate music and lossless formats.  For headphones, I went from the Koss PortaPros to the Bowers & Wilkins P5, to the Audio Technica ATH-M50s and, due to one amazing Amazon sale, the Sennheiser HD650 set.  I like the Sennheisers significantly more than the others.  The comfort is astounding.  There is just the right amount of clamping pressure to keep the headphones in place but not press too hard against the head.  I wear glasses and most other headphones I've tried get uncomfortable with headphones.  The HD650 does not. The earcups are large with a very nice soft material.  Other headphones make my ears hot and sweaty.  The HD650 cans do not.As far as sound quality, I won't pretend that I am any kind of expert but I can say I like the sound very much.  Music/vocals are clear.  There is plenty of bass for me although if you like excessive amounts of bass you might want to look elsewhere.  I've heard headphones where the higher frequencies made me cringe and that has never happened with the HD650.  I have not experienced many other high end headphones and acknowledge that there might be some better sets of cans out there (at pretty high prices of course) but I'm extremely happy with my Sennheiser HD650 that I doubt I'll buy another pair of headphones for a long while.A few things to note:-These headphones are not very portable.-The cord is almost comically long.-They have an "open" back which means sound will leak out.  If other people are around, they will likely hear what you are listening to.These aren't necessarily cons, just things people should know before purchase.

VI won't try to sound like an audiophile with this review, other than to say that I found the Senns as wonderful as advertised, and well worth the persistently high price. I am comparing them to Beyer 990 Pros, and pair them with a FIIO E17 which seems to power them OK.The Senns are cleaner and more refined throughout the spectrum over the Beyers, but never boring. I've found some of the monitor type headphones a little bland for me, with a bit more emphasis on treble. The Senns are brilliant without being harsh, and out of the box, the bass is plenty adequate for me, and more polished in the mid bass.So enough of that. I have one major and one minor problem with this set - the former may be a deal breaker: I honestly can't wear these comfortably while wearing glasses. The high set pads combined with the heavy clamping pressure (that's the minor problem as I suspect this will improve over time) prevents me from wearing both. It would seem silly to wear contacts just to listen to music. Grumpy face.I'll keep experimenting with this, but it is the first time I've bumped into this issue while trying different headphones.  I would keep this in mind if you wear glasses, but other than that, these headphones have been a revelation.UPDATE: as expected, the clamping force improves over time, so the effect on eyeglasses changes also. Now the pads squeak on the frames with even minimal head movement. So if I hold my head still, it's all good. This may be the trade off that I make as I continue to enjoy these more and more. The clarity is outstanding. The seem neither too warm or cool (the Beyers in comparison seem warmly muddy). I have had "studio" or "reference" headphones that seem sterile to me. These invigorate the music and despite the detail, I find them forgiving enough to enjoy music of different bitrates and codecs without being over analytical. I guess.

VThis is my first audiophile class headphones that I owned. At first I only bought skull candy headphones because of its stylish designs and at the time seemed excellent in sound quality.then I bought a set of beats by dre solos,and thought those were pretty good...then I somehow came across an add about high quality audiophile headphones...I read about the hd800 and how it was considered to be one of the worlds best headphones on the market. Saw the price for it and almost passed out. How can people pay that much just for headphones?! It didn't make sense to me at all! I've been spending no more than $200 on my previously owned headphones, and I thought those were waaayyy to expensive already...So...I was curious to why people would pay so much...did some reading on them, and found the sennheiser a to be highly recommended on a lot of audiophile websites and reviews. So I decided to try them out. I could not see spending over 1k for headphones, so opted for the hd650 instead. It was half the price and was still recommend just like the hd800...now that I own the hd650, I've not gone back to using my skull candy headphones or the beats. They're toys compared to these...Nice build quality, excellent sound...although I don't like that people can hear what I'm listening to when listening at high volumes. A lot of people complain about the tightness of these headphones clamping force, but it didn't bother me. Maybe cause I don't have very huge head.another complaint I hear about is the paint chipping on the headband. Mines haven't cracked or chipped yet. I think it's mostly cracks on owners who have larger sized heads than I do. My headband doesn't really bend that much.i haven't put in enough hours for the recommended burn in period, but they sound excellent and can't wait to see how they sound when I finally do burn them in. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great set of headphones. Of course you need to pair these up with a nice amp for it to work great.ive paired these with headroom's portable micro amp and they work great together.

p1503
sg5
VMy biggest fear with purchasing HD650's was needing a super duper $1000 amp to drive them.  That just is not a fact unless you need to be deaf quickly.  For my money HD650's sound great with a light weight portable amp like a FiiO 11 or 17 (with too much power you will deafen others in the room - 650's are really open back!).  I have Shure SE535's, GRADO s80i and AT-ASW9's as well as BOSE QC3's and BOSE IEM 2's so I have heard some pretty good stuff before the 650's.  They will work at comfortable=low volumes with an ipod classic for those out there that want to try it.Conclusion - The 650's are a complete listening package that just fill your ears with music.  Just so good that I am not even thinking about the next step.  Thank you Sennheiser for capping this search for the holy grail of headphones.

VAfter using these for quite some time it's time I gave a review:Pros:Open headphone design allows you to hear all around you really well.Even though these are 300 ohm they work great with my iPhone and iPad.Solid construction (except for the headphone cables).Very comfortable cloth covered ear pads.Very roomy ear holes.After putting them over something to stretch them overnight they were very comfortable.Removable cloth ear pieces (so you can clean them with water and shampoo).They sound better than average.Cons:These $500 headphones almost immediately required replacement wires, made by the same company, that are of a much higher quality. Why not just put the good wires on them to begin with?! Poor quality on expensive headphones is unacceptable.The disco speckle plastic is embarrassing. Did adults design this or 16 year olds that just saw 'Staying Alive' for the first time?Most importantly:Would I recommend these headphones to a friend? No. Never. Overpriced, purposefully cheap lead wires you are required to replace immediately, and a horrible look that will make you feel like you're wearing headphones from the 1980s.I feel kind of ripped off buying these. I should have just gotten something that looked better and sounded just as good for half or a third of the price.-- update 2014-12-13 --Almost two years after replacing the stock headphone cables, that immediately broke, I'm now forced to replace the sturdier cables that should have come with these $500 headphones to begin with.With how little I used these, two years is an unreasonably short time for the cables to have broken, again, so you know what? I don't think I'll be replacing the cables. And I won't be buying Sennheiser ever again.

VI am using these headphones with a Fiio E09K amplifier and E17 DAC. I decided it was time to upgrade from my previous HD 558 headphones. I thought that those headphones were really awesome at the time. Right out of the box, the difference of the HD 650s was immediately apparent to my ears. They absolutely crush them and sound mediocre in comparison. The 558s have this very airy, relaxed kind of sound to them, and are not tight at all. The mid range was there, but lacking. The 650s sound much more "there", like the music is right there with you. The bass is very nice and accurate, and tight with a good punch to it, and when it gets deep it has this slight rumble to it without being drowning to the other ranges, which I love. (I love bass, but so many manufacturers get it wrong, and give quite muddy, and sometimes, literally painful bass reproductions. The HD 650s are not like that.) Trebles are incredibly crisp and clean, and reveal details in songs I never even knew existed before. It sounds like your hitting the hi-hat right next to you, that's how good it is. The midrange REALLY shines through on this, and is what connects the two ranges. This is where many headphones and speakers fail miserably at reproducing. I can hear details unlike ever before. Vocals and backup vocals are absolutely clear and distinguishable from each other. You can hear individual strings in guitar playing. I can hear the actual hit of the bass drum, not just the bass of it. The snare sounds very clear and crisp. You can hear the pick hitting guitar strings, the fingers moving up and down as the guitarist switches chords. Classical music is incredible. What you thought was one violin before was actually 3. Everything is in balance and you are totally immersed in the performance.The build-quality of these headphones is top-notch. They are made from very high quality materials, and feel extremely sturdy. You take one look at these headphones and you know they are NOT cheap. They are built to last. They weigh more than most, which I am totally OK with, in fact I prefer it. They put a decent amount of pressure on your head, especially at first, but they are not uncomfortable, and I can listen to them for hours. (may be because the band inside is actually made from metal, and not plastic)I cannot wait for these headphones to open up to their full potential. They have about 25 hours of use so far, and I can already hear differences from when I first used them. They are worth every penny I spent on them, and I would recommend them to any serious audio user. You are not gonna get much better than this in this price range.

VI got this product to replace my aging Sennheiser HD 595. I really like the 595 they served me well as a movie watching, call of duty playing, and sound/video editing do it all headphone.  So deciding whether to upgrade actually started by looking at the new style of the 595 I didn't like the color. So I looked at Sennheiser other phones as well as Grados, I'm so so glad I did.The Senniheiser 650s look great and sound fantastic. First, I stuck in Sade - "Send me someone to love" and I feel the love for these phones. Next I decided to stick in Disk 3 of my Stereophile test CDs these phones brought out clarity I'd never heard before. They made my 595s sound muddy.  They are particularly good at bringing out clarity with instruments like cymbals and vibrations on string.  Next I plugged them into my Yamaha S90ES to play some Chopin with Grand Piano set, wow, they sound so good that they actually make the synthesizer sound more...synthetic. The phones provide great tonal balance. If you like boomy big bass look elsewhere these cans (headphones) keep bass pretty much in check as they are tight and will require equalization to be bassy.  That being said everything so far sounds bang on from hip-hop to vocals to Rachmaninov.Highly recommend.Things to note about these cans:1. They need power to sound well.2. The cord is slightly shorter than the 5953. If you adjust them to be just a little tall, they will fit very snug on you jaw muscles. This worried me a bit since my wife and I will use them for sound editing and recording for extended periods. So fitting appropiately to your head is a must.

VThe sound is amazing. You can hear each instrument very clearly. My music has never sounded better. As all the other reviews state, you really do need an amplifier. It's a good headphone without one but it's an excellent one with an amplifier

VIt took a long time for me to settle down on headphones. This was not my first but most probably my last. I didn't realize that understanding your preference on the Closed and Open can is exactly what drives your decision on the headphones. Most of the times you need both.I previously owned a variety of earphones and headphones and I always thought the Bass was extra or there was an obvious difference in the way they sounded when i listened to it in my car. I rate my car stereo (honda) much better than Bose because for some reason it engrosses me in the song better. Thats when i heard about open can and after a lot of reviews zeroed in on this.Though it cannot be used in a noisy environment (you'd need closed cans at least) this is one of the best and the truest sounding headphones ever made ...1. The Bass is just right - they don't boom into your ears preventing your ears from adjusting to the melody that plays in the background nor does it fall flat. It's there and it's just enough.2. The treble is perfect as well. For instruments that are made to sound more treblish this highlights it well.3. The arrangement of sound around the ear feels like an Orchestra rather than a 2 sound track. - this was the most convincing factor i ever had. Listen to a Violin Western Classical - something like Four Seasons and you ll know what i say.4. This doesn't feel like the song is sung in a studio or closed space like it does say on a Bose Headphones rather sounds like people sitting around you playing for you. Ofcourse the sound engineering of the song really helps.5. I somehow feel that listening to music live and listening to a headphone line has been superbly blurred by this. It's the same sound, easy on ears and i end my day listening to a playlist of 50/60 songs on a recliner. You ll have no idea how good this is for some one who enjoys variety of music.Pick up some songs that you've loved to listen on your speakers (with Bass in Normal not extra not flat) and then use the headphones .. its bliss ...

VThese headphones are slightly colored.  Most people prefer that, but if you're using them for studio monitors, you won't find better than the HD800's.  Trust me.  But for everyday use, these can't be beat for dynamic open headphones.  Combine them with a full tube amp and I highly doubt you'll find a better "stuck on an island the rest of your life" headphones.UPDATE:  After having owned these for over a year now, let me elaborate on my thoughts on these INCREDIBLE headphones.Value:  This is tough.  If you like open headphones, and love lower model Sennheisers, like the HD595, HD598, HD600, etc, then you'll surely LOVE these.  I owned a pair of HD595's for several years before I accidentally broken them due to the stupid long cable.  These sound very similar to those, only with a slightly darker top end, and much much much better bass.  And, they're just better overall, in soundstage, speed, bass depth, bass extension, resolution, etc.  Some people just don't like the open headphone sound.  That's perfectly fine, and if that's the case, you probably won't like these.  But if you've owned open headphones and like the open airy spacious natural sound... then you'll ADORE these.Comfort:  4.5 stars.  They're Sennheisers.  Pretty much all Sennheisers are extremely comfortable.  They're light.  The pads are usually comfortable soft velour.  They usually have medium light to light clamping force.  They have really large oval cups that fit the largest of ears.  If comfort is high on your list, these might fit your bill.Value: 5 stars.  These headphones bat outside their league.  Outside their price range.  I've seem MANY people go from these headphones to new headphones in the 4 digit range, then go back to these.  LOTS OF TIMES.  It's for a good reason.  These headphones are going to be a future classic.  You can quote me on that.  If you've never owned "audiophile" quality headphones before, this price might seem high, but trust me, to upgrade from these, you usually have to buy Planar Magnetic headphones like the Audeze LCD-2, LCD-3, LCD-X headphones or similar.  Those are all $1500+.  If you've never had good quality headphones, these might not be your best first choice.  Not because they don't sound good.  These sound incredible.  It's because these headphones are 300 ohms and require a pretty decent amp.  They scale well with good hardware upstream, so a good DAC helps a lot too.  (and source audio, you'll want 320 KB/s mp3's and FLAC if possible)Soundstage: 5 stars.  Do these have the best soundstage ever?  No.  HD800's have that title.  Why do I give it 5 stars then?  Because these headphones have a better soundstage than 98% of the headphones out there.Resolution:  4.5 stars.  Great, but not to the level of Planar/Ortho headphones.  If you've never heard $1500+ ortho headphones, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyways.Treble: 4.5 stars.  I'd give it 5 stars, but the treble on these headphones are rolled a tiny bit.  You may hear them described as "dark" or "veiled".  That's relative.  To me, I prefer darker headphones anyways.  Bright headphones are fatiguing and give me a headache after a few minutes.  These roll the highs just enough to make them easy to listen to for hours, yet leave enough treble there to leave the top end nice and sharp.  No sparkle.  Sparkle bad.  (depends on who you ask lol)Mids:  5 stars.  Sennheisers' bread and butter.  These have incredible mids.  Through tube amps, or hybrid tube amps, the mids are lush.  Liquidy.  Warm.  Female vocals will give you the chills.  The warmth of the mids on these cans will make you smile in aural ecstacy.Bass:  4.5 stars.  These headphones are probably the only headphones from Sennheiser with really good bass.  The bass isn't as tight or deep as on Ortho headphones, but for open cans, it's incredibly impressive.  I give the bottom end a tiny tiny bit of EQ to boost the bass, but other than that, it's the best bass I've heard from open headphones yet.  The punch is pretty solid.  I'd rate punch 3.5 stars.  Bass extension is really good.  I'd rate it 4 stars.  Overall though, I give it 4.5 stars considering these are open headphones.Scalability:  5 stars.  These cans scale like crazy.  Upgrade your DAC: you'll heard the difference.  Upgrade your amp: you'll hear a difference.  Upgrade your tubes: you'll hear a difference.  These headphones just keep giving.I used to own HD595's.  They blew my mind.  The bass on those sucked.  Worse than Bose Tri-Ports, which were aweful themselves in bass.  But you know what?  I loved the lush mids so much, as well as the airy soundstage, I didn't care about the lack of bass.  Those headphones broke later (my fault, not theirs), and I was forced to upgrade.  These headphones are an improvement in every way.  (other than weight and clamping force, the HD595 was lighter in weight and clamped lighter, but not by a whole lot)What's the best amp to drive these?  EASY.  Bottlehead Crack with Speedball upgrade.  They're hands down the best amp for these headphones.  Ask around.  You'll get the same answer.  Any full tube amp will do.  Even the hybrids sound good, but for some reason, these headphones come alive with a full tube amp like the Crack.DAC?  Any external DAC will suffice.  The $99 one from Schiit is fine.  Bifrost Uber even better if you can afford it.  O2.  Lots of choices.  Just don't drive these from the on-board audio on your motherboard.  That's just wrong.The best part about these headphones?  The headphones two to three times its price are only a marginal 10-20% better, if that.  And those usually require another 4 digits worth of gear to be worth getting.  These headphones are at that bang for buck price point where you really start to get diminishing returns when you try to upgrade from these.Pros:  Lots.  Value.  Soundstage.  Lush mids.  Soft highs for long listening session with no fatigue.  Awesome bass, in headphones that have open airy sound.  Removable cable.  Scalability.Cons:  ONLY con: You will have one HELL of a time finding headphones to upgrade to from these headphones.  Be warned!  These are so awesome for their price that you'll have a really hard time finding headphones you'll like better.  That's not really a con though, but since I can't think of any cons, I'll list it as one anyways!If you've heard other open headphones and like the huge soundstage and open sound, and want to upgrade: GET THESE.  Don't even hesitate.  You'll be blown away.  Just make sure you have good source files (320 mp3's or FLAC) and a full tube amp like the Bottlehead Crack amp.  Thank me later!  Enjoy!

VUsing the Sennheiser HD 650 Headphones as monitors for an electronic drum set, with Android mp3 as source.Tried some burned in AKG Q 701 Quincy Jones Signature Reference-Class Headphones ($250) and Sennheiser HD 558 Headphones (($180).  The AKGs were balanced, but weak.  The 558s pushed out so much bass, I lost my snare drum.  I know for twice as much money you should get much higher quality, but the Senheiser 650s are off the charts.  It's like falling in love with music all over again.  I guess I might be blown away if I tried their $1500 model, but for $500, I feel like I'm getting a bargain.  Sortof like getting 6 cheeseburgers for the price of one.They certainly are not sound-cancelling - my gf can hear them across the room.  But what I hear inside them is like being Alice in Wonderland.

VGreat Headphones - but need proper electronics to drive them
p1562

VI've had these headphones for over a year. Like most people,I'm used to listening to music on my iphone or computer with earbuds. I've listened to Apple, Vmoda, Etymotic, Sony, Stax, and Sennheiser models over the years. The experience with these headphones is completely different from every phone listed except Stax.Physically, the HD650's are large and bulky. They fit over your ear and press firmly on your head to seal. The cord is long and thick (close to 10 ft. When compared to better in-ear headphones, they are not that comfortable to use for long periods of time (a few hrs max). The backs are open so sound bleeds into the room around you.If you try to drive them directly from your iPhone or PC (I have a Macbook pro), you will be disappointed. First, the volume is very low, and second, the sound quality is not great- clipped and a little distorted with little dynamic range.I was very disappointed until I purchased a separate headphone amplifier (Fiio E10). The difference is amazing. You can hear most every nuance in instruments and voices. Rips at 320K sound much more open and clear than at 128K. Old recordings, especially those from the 70's and 80's where the engineers mixed extra treble sound harsh and squeaky. Great recordings sound amazingly clear (even from the 40's and 50's). The same applies with movies.I used them with a Pioneer airplay receiver and Apple TV but wasn't as impressed as with the Fiio.Bass is good (you can hear the instruments) and tonal mix is fairly even. The sound quality is effortless and very detailed without being harsh or fatiguing.Overall, these are excellent headphones but you need good source material and good electronics to appreciate them. And forget about using them with an iPhone.

VThese replaced my Bose AE 2 $150 phones. I paid $499.99 for these and simultaneously bought the NuForce Icon HDP for $429. First off they fit great. I have a large head and was a little worried about that. They make my I-Tunes coming from my H.P Pavilion dv7t Quad Edition laptop sound incredible. In person, they look gorgeous too. Spending $928.99 was a hard choice but what an enjoyable payoff. The NuForce makes an excellent difference from just plugging directly into the headphone jack, night and day actually. I researched forever it seemed but was absolutely worth it. Go for it.

VA review of these legendary, yet misunderstood headphones
p1572
sg5
VIn this technical review I will explain and gives a few examples why the HD650 are the excellent headphones that they are.  I'll also dispel a few misconceptions about its performance.  Initially, I was unsure whether it was really worth buying these expensive (unfortunately now even more expensive) headphones, since the HD650 has earned a special reputation on certain large forum sites on the Internet.  Apparently the HD650 is great, but at the same time is "veiled", with a "dark sound signature"; it's also "hard to drive", "picky about amps, scaling with more expensive amps into the >$1000 territory".  It created confusion in me and I thought to myself if all that really makes any sense.  So I first researched electro-acoustic principles on an informative blog and learned some truth that made logical sense.  Then I finally purchased it.Cosmetically, the HD650 has a nice clear-coat finish over the titanium-silver (actually pearl grey) color scheme, where the small multi-colored sparkly flecks of paint can be seen around sunlight.  Even the outer side of the grille gets the sparkly treatment, while the inner side is bare stainless steel.  The stock cable (which is just fine BTW!) is thick and very supple.  It only has subtle low frequency microphonics when tapping it with fingers, and none when it's rubbed against clothing.  The fit of the headphones is secure, and stays put during left/right and angled up/down head movements.  The somewhat strong initial clamping force lessens over time.  The modular construction of the headphones makes disassembly easy.  For instance, tilting the ear cups downward a bit past the resistance as if trying to lay them flat unsnaps the upper half of the ring from the central hubs.  Once the upper half of the ring is then pulled out, place the ear cup in your lap with the cable entrance side facing you, and using your fingers in that area, firmly push away the lower trim piece which simultaneously causes the grille to come off as well!  Replacing the headband pad is simple.  (Remove the capsules beforehand.)  I managed to get the edge of my thumb just behind the Made in Ireland plastic stopper and pushed it out quickly and forcefully.  Then extend the metal band until it comes out.  Repeat for the other side.  Now slide the pad out.  It is not glued on.  To reassemble, first carefully feed the edge of the pad all the way through the narrow groove of the plastic arc.  Then put the left and right bands through the second groove behind the pad and snap back in the stoppers.Now, with all that out of the way, the best and easiest way to evaluate headphone performance is with 20Hz to 20kHz sine wave sweeps (download the logarithmic one at audiocheck.net) and pink noise.  If it sounds even and clean, then that would carry over into normal use, since sine waves are the basic building blocks of sound reproduction.  Similarly, a TV display's performance is seen with gray-scale linearity, RGB coordinates for gamut accuracy close to BT. 709, white balance targeted to 6500K, etc.  If it performs well there, such a display would be accurate for normal program material.  For audio, the sine wave sweep should not contain frequency sections that get your attention in terms of peaks, valleys, ringing or other anomalies.  I'm happy to report that the HD650 has a remarkably even and linear response during the sweep!  The so-called "mid-bass hump" isn't even perceived as being louder than the 500Hz area.  A critical area (especially for female voice and higher notes from strings and wind instruments) is from around 700Hz to 3kHz.  It is totally even there!  The HD650 does a fantastic job in that portion of the spectrum as it's incredibly natural and transparent sounding.  It's also very easy to hear the treble frequencies become finer sounding during the upward progression.  Pink noise is smooth and balanced.  It's virtually impossible to discern any imbalance between the higher frequency portion of the noise with the lower frequency portion.  I would like to point out that the compensated frequency response graph at Inner Fidelity shows a 15dB notch around 5 to 6kHz compared to 1kHz.  But actually there is no audible recession of 15 decibels in that area when listening to the sweep!  It is flat when listening by ear.  That notch is responsible for these headphones not imparting harshness and sibilance.  There is a slight audible dip at about 7kHz and another at 10kHz.  But after that the high treble is actually nicely extended and present, especially in the 12 to 16kHz region.  At the other end of the spectrum, the deep bass lacks a few dB of rumble in the lowest octave.  Overall, the HD650 has a substantially flat response and a lifelike timbre.  And the HD650's wonderful transient response can be attributed to its high frequency extension, high damping factor from the amplifier for the lower frequencies, and the low mass aluminum coil.  Everything is critically damped.I also conducted a comparison with the HD598 and HD428.  The HD598 lacks the bass response, bass weight, fuller body of the low mids to the start of the upper mids (200Hz to 750Hz) of 650.  But the 598 gets into big trouble with the lower treble and beyond.  I can detect a bit of a dip after 1kHz and then there are a couple of sharp audible peaks and a bit of shrillness from around 2kHz to 5kHz with an indistinctness over all the high frequencies afterwards.  Its pink noise has some emphasis in that area (the 'tssshhh' sound), with the lower frequencies being slightly quieter.  Hence, its sonic character is lean and bright in the upper mids and transition to the low treble.  It's easy to notice that female vocals don't have a natural timbre and cymbals lack detail compared to the HD650.  Onto the HD428.  A little bit of distortion and looseness is heard in the lower bass area but progresses quite evenly until around 3 to 4kHz where it has quite a big noticeable drop, and comes back up to about 10kHz and then gently rolls off the rest of the highs.  Its pink noise is tilted towards warmth with the lower frequencies a bit louder than the higher ones.  Though Headroom's graph shows a weak bass response for the HD428, it does not take into account how the human ear interprets low frequency resonance inside the closed ear cups.  (A quick sweep or 3 second chirp also reveals an echo-knock inside the right cup).  Bass is quite tight, but lacks real impact or weight (except for the fabric material tickling the ears), even though it gives the impression of a little more bass than the 650 due to resonance (but that resonance affects the perception of low frequency transients).  But at least the 428 does not have that harsh low and mid treble of the 598!  It seems more like a 650 with a subdued, mellow or recessed response from the low treble and beyond that, but it's a surprisingly clean sounding can for the price!  Its treble is more articulate than the 598s.  I think it represents a superb value along with the HD448 or HD449 and is pleasant for long listening sessions too as it doesn't offend my ears like the more strident HD598.So now that we know the HD650 is actually very balanced in frequency response (which also relates to good dynamics), it's on to distortion.  It can be summed up briefly:  This headphone's distortion is inaudible!  That means pure, clean, smooth, full-bodied sound with natural harmonics beings heard leading to accurate timbre, high resolving ability and detail retrieval since there's no discernible garbage being introduced by the transducer.  There is a clear and precise differentiation of all frequencies and octaves.  Headroom's graph for the 500Hz sine wave distortion (tested at 90dB) shows the HD650 has vanishingly low levels, lower than some other high-end headphones more expensive than it.  It has a really small second harmonic and that's about it!  Higher order distortion is virtually non-existent.  The HD650 is so linear that even when turning the volume up, it still doesn't seem like it's loud enough!  The sound never gets thick or harsh.  And there is no grain at all in the sound.  The HD598 has some graininess in the mids and highs that is ever-present indicating odd order harmonic distortion.  The HD428 isn't grainy, but has a bit of a smoothed over thickness or lushness in the mids and lacks articulation, indicating even-order harmonic distortion.  But generally, the even-order harmonics are not as offensive as the odd ones.  Headroom's graphs back up what I heard from all three.  The HD650 is a real winner here.Since harmonic distortion will necessarily produce intermodulation distortion when multiples tones are present, IMD is never nice to hear.  I can back this up with an example.  Corona's Rhythm of the Night R.B.X. Euro Mix is a well-mastered Eurodance song that has a strong grinding bass.  Once the main bassline starts at 0:36, and particularly at 0:42, the HD598 outputs a significant amount of IMD at very high volume.  The bass and treble become garbled and the song becomes an unenjoyable mess.  The HD428 chokes too.  Occasional pops can be heard since the smaller driver doesn't have enough excursion capability.  The HD650 is totally unfazed by the high demands, rendering the controlled bass with clarity, impact, and weight with appreciable bone conduction as slight vibrations are also felt through the front teeth when both rows are touching.  I do not recommend listening at such high volumes for any extended length of time for obvious reasons.  In fact, I hear more nuances in the music at more moderate to low volumes.  It may not be as stimulating that way, but it's better quality listening.I also found three easy examples of frequency response differences among all three cans!  In the CD Maxi Single of DJ BoBo's Somebody Dance With Me, at the female vocal section "I've got this feeling, somebody dance with me!", the words "feeling" and "me" are emphasized.  With the HD428, they are recessed in amplitude and thus a bit dull and lacking in dynamics.  With the HD598, that pitch is where a narrow peak occurs, so it's shrill and bright sounding there.  And with the HD650, the response is perfectly balanced with controlled dynamics.  Likewise, with 2 Unlimited's No Limits, the female vocal part "There's no limit!"  the "limit" is a similar pitch to the above example and will exhibit the same thing.  Again, the HD650 has such a wonderful and natural timbre in the critical high mids.  And an easy example of the HD598's emphasis in the upper mid to low treble transition is Sonic the Hedgehog 3's spin-dash sound effect.  It is very loud and strident.  On the HD650, it's so clean, balanced, and it's easy to hear the real clarity and "fineness" of that sound.  Now which headphone is more veiled? ;)  There's no hype in the highs with the HD650.  Hyped-up highs seem to be the new audiophile Flavor of the Times.In terms of source material requirements, lossless files or 320kbps MP3s would provide optimal sound quality.  128kbps MP3s sound thinner, particularly in the bass and midrange, due to the missing data.  Also, songs whose average volume range from about -12dB to -18dB FS will showcase the excellent micro and macro dynamics and effortless sound projection of these headphones.  The majority of pop, rock, and dance music up to the mid-1990s hover in that range, whereas nowadays most music is unfortunately compressed to a loud overall level with hardly any dynamic range.Next up is the physical inspection of the transducers.  The HD650's 40mm Duofol diaphragm (part number 600129 minisys) has a large dome with a noticeably spherical or rounded surface area.  Although the dome's diameter is slightly larger than the HD598's, the latter's dome is flatter and deflated looking in comparison to the 650's.  The HD428 has a very tiny dome and voice coil (the latter seems to be only about 10mm), which will naturally limit its bass performance.The last section is the awesome spatial sound.  With the HD650 the stereo image is psycho-acoustically perceived as occurring in a free and open space.  It is instantly recognized by the auditory system like so.  I get no sense of the ear cups creating any sort of boundary to the sound.  Whether it's real-life acoustic or synthesized music, I can sense the soundstage size of all the different songs I have in a realistic way that's absolutely natural and also true to the source.Don't get too caught up in Sennheiser's marketing when they say 45 degree angled baffles by themselves automatically create a speaker-like sound as that may create a sighted or expectation bias.  There's a near negligible difference in the radiating point of a mono signal when I listened to angled (HD598) and straight (HD650) baffle design headphones.  Yet the HD650 easily beats the HD598 in width, depth, height, and separation even though it doesn't have angled drivers.  I'll explain why the spatial sound is superb.  The 650 has close-tolerance drivers (max. 1 dB difference) meaning both left and right channels have nearly identical phase (time) and frequency (amplitude) response, which are required for good imaging.  So in that regard, the HD650's transducers are reproducing the electrical signal (i.e. the source) with much greater accuracy.  Pink noise is perfectly centered without the slight shift towards the left like on the other two headphones.  The sine sweep is also centered all the way from 20Hz to 20kHz and does not pan to the left and right with the upper mids and treble like the lower-end models.  And compared to the other models, during stereo playback the HD650 has a solid phantom center that is present (thanks to the constantly centered sine sweep), while the left and right channels are simultaneously heard separately just outside the pinna (instead of in the ear).Elaborating a bit further on the previous statement, the center portion of the mix is *distinct* and is experienced as *separate* from other sounds that are placed towards the left and right while they are *simultaneously* occurring.  The asterisks denote the differences between the HD650, which has precision-manufactured drivers, and the HD598, which does not.  For example, in Madonna's "Dress You Up", the beginning part where she says "you've got style" there are reverb tails of "style" at the left and right that are separate from the main center with the HD650, but not with the HD598.  Any slight pan or shift during the sweep will result in lack of stability in stereo imaging performance.  For instance, in Phil Collins' Another Day in Paradise, during the chorus, "Cause it's another day for you, you and me in paradise" the HD428 shifts the "me" to the left of center compared to "you", since the former is an upper mid sound while the latter is a lower mid sound.  The HD650 has no flaws here.  And phase information in the music (e.g. reverberations from the instruments in the hall in classical music) seem wide open.  And the totally open chassis design further allows the sound to radiate out without contributing its own reflections.The HD650's earcups utilize a proprietary plastic (there are no ABS labels unlike inside the HD598) that is quiet and solid when the gloss black portion adjacent to the earpads is lightly tapped with a fingernail.  Likewise, only a nice distinctive metallic sound can be heard when tapping on the grille when the headphones are worn or held.  Doing the same thing to the HD598 reveals a hollow plastic sound.  Indeed, this attribute (lack of resonances in the housing) along with the aforementioned driver matching contributes to the sense of transparency in the HD650's stereo imaging, in that a pure audio image that consists only of time and level differences is formed in the mind.It's also finally worth mentioning that the HD650, since its distortion is so low, will reveal the relatively high distortion from tube amps.  So this "scaling with expensive amps" mentioned in the opening paragraph essentially means listening to the various amounts of second harmonic distortions of tube amps.  I personally would recommend pairing the HD650 with a nice solid-state amp.  It doesn't matter how much that amp costs, but about getting one that measures well (flat response, no distortion or noise), has near zero output impedance, and provides enough voltage (anything in the 2 to 3 volts RMS range is absolutely sufficient) for a powerful and exciting dynamic range.  In the audio industry, higher priced gear does not always translate into better performance.  This industry has some strange things going on now, like ridiculous price differences between the high-end models. Considering I bought the HD428, HD598, and HD650 new from Amazon last year for $50, $180, and $350 respectively, it seems a bit odd for the next two models to cost $1000 and $1500.The HD650 has a full and well-balanced frequency response, extremely low distortion with its clean, pure, and smoothly detailed sound even at very high listening levels.  It has no discernible diaphragm or earcup resonance which would otherwise produce a peak in the mid-range or treble response and has a wonderful, naturally open spatial sound.  Sennheiser may never voice a reference headphone this nicely ever again or at least for a long time to come.  What more is there to ask?  The HD650 easily satisfies the criteria for true high-fidelity reproduction.

VTerrible quality, amazing sound
p1578
sg5
VFor a $500.00 set of headphones you would expect the quality to match the price, but in this case it does not. I have owned a pair of HD650s for almost five years and have had numerous problems. The paint began to chip and flake off after a year of use and small cracks developed in the headband a year later. Finally, after five years the headband broke in half. Superglue did not fix the smaller cracks because once you get them, the integrity of the headband is compromised and you will experience pressure and pinching. I have also had problems with having the sound disappear from the right or left channels and have replaced the cable. A month after that the twin tiny gold coils where the cord is put in the headphones came loose and I had to replace those also. A $500.00 headphone quickly became a $600.00+ headphone after a couple of years. The amount of maintenance on my other headphones don't even come close to the amount of time and money spent on fixing my HD650s. The look and feel of the HD650 screams cheapness, it doesn't even come close to its competitors. In my hands it feels like a child's toy compared to a high-end headphone.The sound is amazing. It feels like I am standing right in the middle of the music and standing next to the orchestra or artist. It is a very warm sound and I forget I am even wearing headphones (before the headband cracking). It is too bad the quality doesn't match the sound. After going through all the headache of repairs the HD650s, I don't ever want to own a pair of Sennheisers ever again.

VAlthough these are my first audiophile grade headphones, I have owned and listened to a fair amount of hi-fi gear, and auditioned even more. I'll be brief. They produce beautiful music, not treble-happy, forward sounding Grado-esque, more of a fuller, musical LCD-2ish. The clarity with a good dac/amp rivals anything I have heard of yet. Very comfortable too. All in all, a true world class product that every self-respecting audiophile should own at least once in their lives. Highly recommended!

VI'm no audiophile..lets be clear on this..but these headphones arequite simply the best I've ever owned FOR MUSIC presentation..especiallyclassical and piano..the mids and high end reproductions are superb;I agree with many here that these cans need a break in time and theyalso need (but do not require) a separate headphone amp..they like and needpower to bring out the highs in particular..I don't listen much to works witha lot of bass..these cans don't seem to be designed for bass..also I havefound that the Sennheiser 180's do better with speech (live TV) than the 650's..this just might be my hearing, however..I like many baby-boomers have lost a lot ofmy high-frequency hearing capacity and rely on SOA hearing aids to help mewith the musicOnly negative I have (4 stars instead of 5) is the somewhat short cables that came with the 650's..tooshort for most of us that do not want to curl up with our amps..got the Cardascables to go with the 650's...the combo can't be beat

VI bought these headphones on December 2011 and have since been thoroughly using them. I am absolutely happy with my purchase and here is why:Pros:- Fantastic sound, albeit a bit on the darker side in comparison to Grados(amazingly natural mids, and poignant lows with controlled highs)- Requires at least a 100 hours of burn-in (200 hours recommended if you want to hear the true sound); so it keeps getting better- Amazing bargain at $350 (and still a great bargain at $500), as the sound quality is truly unbelievable- Extremely comfortable to wear for long hours- Fares excellent in general useCons:- Requires a powerful amp to reach its full potential- Build quality and design are average

VThe old adage goes; "you get what you pay for". These headphones are by far the best audiophile headphones I've ever had on my head.  The comfort goes unmatched among other headphones I've wore. It is important to note these headphones take a bit of wearing before they conform to ones head ( they come very tight and over time they will adjust to your head). I've also owned the hd 580's "they lasted about 4 years of daily use"I was a bit weary of buying a pair of headphones over $400, but when I stopped and thought about how much I actually use headphones, I thought it would be a good investment.If you are looking for daily computer headphones and listen to music in loss-less format. GET THESE HEADPHONES.I would highly recommend picking up the Asus Xonar Essence STX amp sound card ($199)  these Sennheiser need power to push (I'm not talking about getting them louder i'm talking power to resonate the highs and lows)Once you go Sennheiser, you never go back.

VI have absolutely nothing bad to say about these headphones. I waited about a year from deciding that I was going to buy them, to actually buying them. These are definitely worth every penny, but it's not worth it to stretch your earnings to be able to buy this. It's a luxury item, nothing more.Re-listening to all my music in high-definition is the most fun I've had in a while. Some people might think it's weird, but simply sitting down and listening to music is a very relaxing activity for me now.I paired these with the Fiio e7/e9 combo, and my music sounds ridiculously good. Indescribable.

VSennheiser HD 650 HeadphonesAfter having owned the HD 555 for 2 years, I decided it was time to upgrade. I settled on the HD 650,I was a little worried at first wondering if there could be that much of an improvement over my HD 555, well I didn't have to worry the difference was huge. The sound of the HD 650's right,from the box is fantastic.Bass is punchy and tight, Mids and highs are buttery and smooth. They sound great all around. the fit and finish on these headphones is wonderful. I bought mine refurbished for $310 and they were definitly  worth the price, even at full retail I could easily recommend these for anyone who enjoys music, For me at least, I have found my headphone Nirvana. So buy with confindance . You cant go wrong. if the high price of these should scare u off,I can also recommend the  HD 558's,as I was never dissatisfied with the sound of my old headphones.

VThese headphones are amazing!  You won't be disappointed.After using a loaned pair of HD600s for a few weeks, and researching the heck out of headphones, I settled on the HD650.  I had read that they were very much like the HD600s but with added bass.  Lots of people have lots of different opinions about sennheisers but that particular comment about these two models was repeated far and wide.These headphones do need amplification, and they depend a lot on the amplifier for their sound.  Without any amplifier they won't sound so great.  With a cheapo amplifier they'll sound okay.  But with a good amplifier they will sing.  I haven't yet tried a great amplifier but I'm really looking forward to that because I imagine they'll sound even better.

p1641

VI was retiring my HD 595s after they cracked at the temples (just like I was warned they would).  The Senns fit like a dream and had unbelievable sound, but the cheap build came back to bite me and made me regret spending the money.  So, thinking the grass might be greener, I bought the Grado HD325is and was really excited to get them, at first.  The "Grado Sound" is highly subjective, you either like it or you don't.  I found it to be "tinny" and overly bright to the point of distraction from the music I was listening to.  So, I sent the Grados back on the same day I got them.Which brings me to the Sennheiser HD 650s.  I had really wanted the 650s, but the high price was a point of contention for me.  After being underwhelmed by the build quality of the 595s, I was hesitant to take the plunge.  I knew I would need a decent amplifier to push the 650s which have a high impedance, and that meant even more cash layout.  But, I wanted to own the best cans I could get for my money, so I ordered the 650s and the FiiO E9 amp along with the E7 DAC, which fits right into the E9.From the first moment I listened to the 650s I knew I'd made the right choice.  I really loved the sound of the 595s, but even their great sound is just a mere shadow of the crisp clarity and detail you get from the 650s.  And the build quality of the 650s has renewed my faith in Sennheiser as well.  Where the 595s had plastic parts, the 650s are metal and I'm not worried a bit about them cracking.The 650s are really bright and not at all muddled.  Some people talk about the "Sennheiser Veil" which is supposed to be a damping of the high end, but I don't find that at all in the 650s.  I'm utterly impressed with the sound presentation.  I've listened to all types of music with theses cans, from jazz to rock to classical and I've enjoyed the nuances of each thanks to these incredible headphones.  I don't feel like I'm sitting in front of the musicians.  The soundstage makes me feel as though I'm surrounded by the music.  I can hear every single instrument clearly.  The brushes against the cymbals are just as clear as the warm, rich bass.  These cans really shine on pieces where the musical instruments are layered.  You become completely immersed in the performance.Comfort is never an issue with Sennheiser.  The Grado cups were made of some horrible, scratchy plastic that instantly irritated the ears.  The 650s fit over the ear instead of sitting against them, as the Grados do.  You can listen to the 650s for hours on end and never miss a beat.  Velour padding ensures a comfortable fit.So, are there any drawbacks to the 650s?  Well, yes.  The price is the single biggest drawback.  These are not cheap.  But with build quality like the 650s have, you won't be replacing them for a long time.  These are "open" headphones, which means that they're not ideal for airplanes, cubicles or anywhere else that you don't want people to hear what you're listening to.  But they're absolutely perfect for home use, which is exactly what I bought them for.So, my overall opinion of the Sennheiser 650s is that they're the standard of what headphones should be.  They are absolutely superb in their sound presentation and their build.  These headphones, like all cans, need a break-in period.  I have heard it might be as much as 300 hours for the 650s.  This allows the diaphragms to "loosen" a bit and makes the sound even more incredible.  I'm looking forward to many years of heavenly sound from my 650s and I'd recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to settle for less than the best.*Disclaimer -  I've never got to listen to the Sennheiser HD 800s, they are WAY out of my price range, so I'll be content with the 650s as the best sub-$1000 cans on the market

VCome Down the Rabbit Hole (So Worth It)
p1653
sg5
VThese are the first step. Like anyone looking to make this kind of investment for headphones I did a lot of reading before buying. That is only going to get you so far. You need to hear these. Ten years ago I listened to a pair of HD600 straight off a disc-man with NO amp. I was completely blown away, I set out to find the perfect headphones for one hundred dollars, that was a mistake. I kept buying headphones in that range over the years and nothing came close. I was torn between these and the 600's, but decided that I loved the look of these and a few reviews pushed me to get the 650's. I highly suggest going to Guitar Center or some place that you can compare them, I believe the 600's maybe the superior sounding ones (it's always the ugly ones). It's been said that a good set up is the  Lehmann Audio Black Cube Linear amp/HD600 using a 650 headphone cable. But there is no way I'm paying that kind of money for an amp...I'm not an expert and I don't plan to collect anymore headphones (unless I end up with a pile of extra money). If you are just getting into quality sound, these will destroy what you thought was possible for home listening. Even without burn-in, and an expensive amp and listening to a 128kbps file in itunes, you will want to throw out your old headphones, you will look at them with disgust and you will start ripping everything you own at lossless. These only get better with everything you bring to them, they are hungry for better. More than likely I'll be getting a Schiit amp as my first amp. Currently running these from an Apogee One for digtial or a Technics SA-5170 for vinyl and happy with this setup. I'd love to understand why people think these should have a dedicated amp.Things that you will notice when you listen. The sound stage will be expanded, the clarity and richness will be improved, the separation: you will hear things you never noticed (one voice will clearly become 3 layered voices, one piano will become 4, fingers will slide on strings) everything will become a personal concert. If you are on the fence about these don't hesitate, it's like going from and old TV to a HUGE HD one with bluray. If you are an audio pro, you probably already own these. If you didn't like something about these and you think they need to be amped, you have more money than brains (or very good hearing). If you want to significantly improve your daily enjoyment of music, buy these now. Like everyone else says there are cons: The band is tight, they are open so you can hear everything in the room (ie keyboard clicks and talking) and people can hear the headphones. These are most likely for home use only. Good thing they look more comfortable than most of the furniture in my house. You should know by now what you are getting into with these.These come in a huge foam lined box, there was nothing to cut, no way to tell if it had ever been opened or not. The cord is kevlar (think bulletproof vests) and replaceable, one time I sucked them into the vacuum roller (not this pair), seemed bad but survived (HD 495). They are light and comfortable to wear for me (not as comfy as my HD 428). They look amazing, much better than the HD600's. I think there is a lot that could be improved about how they are built (comfort and usability), but I'm insane when it comes to small details.You will want a multi-disc player or good quality digital music (big hard drive). What I listened to so far: NIN, Tool, The Cinematic Orchestra, Sam Prekop, Zoe Keating, Underworld, Aphex Twin, Miles Davis, Amadeus Soundtrack, Kodo, Led Zeppelin, Billy McLaughlin, Doomtree, Yo-Yo Ma, Alice in Chains (unplugged), Rodrigo Y Gabriela, Nirvana and Jimi. And I'll go to bed after I listen to everything that exists...These shine with live and acoustic tracks.Don't wait 10 years like I did. Get them now and start hearing your music for the first time. So worth it.On a side note, I'd consider getting a second pair of these rather than spending the money for a nice surround sound system. I figure the audio is as good but much cheaper. If Schiit is reading consider making an amp for movie buffs and their girlfriends to share. Update: I'd suggest the wireless HDR 120 for TV and Movies.

VSimply outstanding (But know what you're buying)
p1671

VBefore one buys these cans, one should understand what they are--and are not.  The following is critical info. before even considering these earphones:* These are "open air" phones.  Sound leaks (in and out).  That isn't a defect; it's the very design.  Therefore, if you are looking for studio application using condenser mics, look for closed cans.  These are not meant for that application (or any other) where a sound leak is unacceptable.* These require considerable power.  If you want something for your i-pod or other portable gizmo, these will work *only* if you invest in a good headphone amp.  If your primary music source is consistently a portable music player, these phones may disappoint; they may not be what you are looking for.* These headphones require "breaking in" to the tune of 80 hours or more to sound their best.  That being said, they sound great right out of the box.  Think of it like a great merlot, but better: as it ages to perfection, you still get to drink it in the interim.* The quality of the sound from these (or any other) phones directly depends on what you have hooked down the chain! It's the GIGO principle.  If these are powered by quality gear, they will SING!* I was initially disappointed with the aesthetics.  They looked too "plastic-like" for gear in this price range.  They felt a bit cheap, honestly.  They have held up very well, but the plastic owns the landscape.  I do realize that one can't make comfortable headphones from stamped steel, but my old Sony V600 phones are plastic--but don't feel fragile.  I am (overly?) careful with the 650s.I received these as a gift from my BF.  To date, and in terms of the sound these cans provide, I have not found a pair of headphones that provide more of a "wow" experience than these.  The 650s are simply outstanding.  But take note of the information above.  These are not i-pod "earphones," nor are they studio monitors.** UPDATE 1/9/2012 **Since my initial review above, I have driven these many miles.  They only get better.  My initial worries about them feeling  a bit "cheap" (read "fragile") are now lessened.  I had the misfortune of pulling back a studio chair and pulling these to the floor (3+ feet).  It didn't phase them (but avoid this if possible!)The more I experience these, the more impressed I am.  I emphasize the word "experience."  These cans are for experiencing music, perhaps like you never have before.  If you want to analyze and listen, there are better phones out there for about the same amount of money.  If you want to "fall into" the music, these are for you.  I just can't believe the sound.

VI owned a pair of Sennheiser 580 HD for over 10 years with nearly daily use. So when it came time to replace them, I had no concerns that Sennheiser would still provide an outstanding product.The overall build quality of these headphones is above my expectations. Not only do they feel sturdy, but they are emensly comfortable to wear for hours. I also love that so many of the parts are easily replaceable so they can be kept for years.In terms of sound quality, I've never used a better pair. The lows have a great punch, the highs sound perfect, and they are clear throughout the entire sound range.My only complaint? (not really a complaint) Any quality issues with my audio source is even more apparent.

VThese headphones have a few issues. First, there is a characteristic 'dark' sounds from Sennhesier, which I don't prefer. Second these are very power hungry and you good a good strong amp to drive them, not good for computer use without a headphone amp, and the soundstage is odd. You hear the mix hard left, hard right and right up the middle, but the three directions don't come together. At this discounted price, probably best for the money, but not perfect. Oddly sounded best with trance music or singer songwriter music. R&R; sounded odd with the vocal lacking in volume.

People say you should let them break in for a while before they sound their best, so I've left them plugged into my amp all week while watching TV; they sound a bit better (even though they were very good out of the box) and I expect they'll improve after a bit more burn-in as well as after I get the Cardas upgraded cables.The only word of caution on these is that, since they are open cans, they may not be the best in quiet environments as everyone will hear what you're hearing or extremely noisy environments as they won't block out the sounds. They are perfect when you're home and want to crank up the sound without having the neighbors call the cops. I even hear subtle sounds that I seem to miss when listening with my surround system. These would also be good for someone who has a bit of a hearing problem: they can wear the cans while everyone listens with the speakers.If you'll be in crowds & noisy areas (office, planes, subway, etc) you should look at closed headphones, otherwise these are great. They're light for their size, comfortable, and sound fantastic.

VBest cans I have ever heard, make my music listening experience wonderful. I enjoy with all genres. Some bash these with classical but my set up is great making the music come alive. Only bad thing is you need a sub, I use Fiio F7 DAC. Although that is standard on cans of this caliber.Comfort: 10/10Sound: 10/10Price: 8/10 (You know they are taking you to the bank a little, but it is worth it.)Durability: 10/10 (Seems very solid, great warranty, worried about ear cloths getting dirty though)They are not portable due to open design, and the carry box they come with is huge. So if you are on the move, not useful.

VTHE BEST headphones I have ever had
p1711
sg5
VNo, I don't have gifted "golden" ears, but am young enough (19 as I'm writing this) to have a proper hearing ability.I have gone through so many headphones, from Skullcandy's G.I. (which IMO, sounds like a total crap), JVC (okay, but hurts if wore too long), to Sennheiser PXC 450 and finally Sennheiser HD650.I'm not going to go deeply into its sound signature, and there are plenty of other reviews out there with fancy graphs and numbers (head-fi is a good source).When I first bought the Sennheiser PXC450, I thought it was the best headphones I have ever heard, but after reading that HD650 is the king of Sennheiser under $1000, I decided to cough up some cash.I bought this beast along with Fiio E7 and E9 combo amp, and couldn't be happier ever since.FYI, this headphone IS open, so I can't listen to them when I'm studying in the library (because the sound leak will bother others around me)This means that I have to go back to PXC 450 when I'm listening in public, which, btw is still fantastic. But after being so used to hearing the superior sound quality of HD650, even the PXC 450 sounds lackluster.Also, if you are considering between HD650 and Dr. Dre Beats headphones, HD650 completely blows both Studio and Pro _combined_ out of water. Beats sure looks good, but pricing them in the same range as HD650 is a ridiculous rip-off. I'm not saying Beats sound terrible. They are actually quite decent, but for $300 to $400 you are paying, there are so many better choices out there, like Denon AH-D5000, AKG K701/K702, Beyerdynamic DT 880 (600 Ohms version), and Sennheiser HD650. These headphones MUST HAVE amps to be properly driven.The build quality is excellent. Unlike Bose, Beats, and other headphones out there, almost entire headphone is made of metal and high quality plastic. The pictures does not really show its texture and color. When I saw the pictures on the Internet, I thought it looked kind of chunky, old, and dull, but when I held it in my own hands, it screamed quality and it was beautiful. It's definitely different "beautiful" from Beats Studio. While Beats is like modern, minimalistic beautiful, the HD650 is like your father's vintage Mercedes - classic beauty, full of authority.The cables are removable, and after some research, I found out that there are third party cable makers that make replacement cables (that are supposedly superior than the stock cables) for HD650, but those cables cost more than a hundred dollars, and I doubt replacing the cables will improve the sound noticeably. Stock cables are fine for me.The included case is a nice touch, but don't expect it to be useable for carrying your headphone around. The probability is, you will NOT be able fit the case inside most backpacks. The included 1/4 inch to 1/8 inch adapter is extremely useful when using the headphone with a portable amp (i.e. Fiio E7).HD650 is also the most comfortable headphones that I ever had. The cushions have velvet-like texture. I like it even better than the PXC 450, which has plushier, faux-leather ear cups, but hurt my ears a little after 8+ hours of listening (if you actually think about it, eight hours is a VERY long time). I have small/narrow head, and thus, don't have any clamping complaints like some reviewers have.I consider myself an under-budget music lover (audiophile), but I take my musics seriously enough to get the best out there (that I can afford). While HD650 is out of reach for many college students like myself, if you can get them, they are worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY! I liked mine without the burn-in time, but after the burn-in, I LOVE it! (and, no, I'm not a musics major/minor or sound engineering major/minor; I just love listening music)

VMy go-to home cans
p1723
sg5
VOkay, I'm an earbud geek. I own higher-end products from Ety, Shure, Ultimate Ears and even Senn in the buds category. Always on the lookout for a good efficient earbud that doesn't absolutely require a separate headphone amp for decent sound. The ie7 from Senn sounds pretty good plugged directly into my iPhone 4s.At home I don't have those limitations. I use the hd650 with their original cable--I know there are some mighty fine upgrades out there but haven't tried them. This cable runs nicely from the side table where the phones and amp live to my inherited Eames chair. Heaven.3 years ago, I built my own SET tube amp, impedance matched and bias adjusted specifically for the HD650. I've had these phones for going on 9 years now and they have never sounded better. For a long time I was running them with a Creek amp and that setup by the way sounds very, very good. If you have these and a Creek OBH-11 you have better sound than 99.9% of humans. Be happy.I was, but my trusty Creek got lost in a move. Never being satisfied, I began my search for something that cost less yet sounds way better than the Creek. At this point you're in DIY territory. If you're good with electronics, can read a schematic and can do a professional solder joint, then you too can learn enough to build a great sounding headphone amplifier. Mine cost me about 65 bucks in parts and a bit more than that in good audiophile quality tubes. It runs very hot, and it makes the bass just jump off the HD650. There are very good solid state headphone amps for the 650, and Musical Fidelity makes a great tubed output stage that will take the edge off a lot of solid state preamps. So you can get wonderful enjoyment out of this set of cans even with a solid state amp section.But the HD650 was flat out made to be driven by tubes. You have never heard something so balanced, smooth, non-fatiguing and yet with authority up and down the spectrum coming through something attached to your head (unless you've paid substantially more). I lost my Creek amp, spent a few weeks sourcing plans and parts, got a buddy to help me cut, smooth, weld, powdercoat and drill my chassis, then spent a couple of nights putting everything together, switching resistors and pots to balance the sound, adjusting bias and setting up for the high end of the HD650's rated input voltage, cleaning the silver contacts, and setting up.Since then I've burnt out a tube and replaced the pair with a different-sounding pair. Not much, but definitely more treble without sacrificing that sweet smoothness that is tube gear's utter lack of odd-order harmonic distortion. When you clip this thing it still sounds nice. It's hard to clip at anything like tolerable listening levels, but there are some Floyd tracks that make any amp/speaker combo nuts, and also some hi-fi organ recordings that will put your gear into shutdown if you try to play them at actual volume levels. In situations like that, the 650 has been pretty well-behaved since switching to tubes. With solid state amplification you felt like you might break them if you didn't immediately cut the volume under some circumstances, but this setup gives me more volume with less stress on the cans.I have reached my own peak of happiness with these headphones. I know there are even higher mountains out there to climb, but I have no desire to even try. The HD650 is a stone cold bargain in headphones considering the sound it can deliver. I listen to a lot of choir and small combo jazz on these, as well as my sister and brother-in-law's piano recordings (they are both working concert pianists as well as music educators). So once in a while I get a new piano piece on an SD card in the mail--the past couple years it has been mostly Ravel so I guess I'm learning to like Ravel. Brother-in-law always converts live to Apple Lossless using the good mics and generally good acoustics and electronics in the university's recital hall. Musicians can be picky about their recorded sound. iTunes spits it out to the iPod Nano which has surprisingly good sound using a Russ Andrews interconnect (inexpensive and HIGHLY recommended for good sound breakout from Apple products). The iPhone sounds fine as well, but I think the Nano sounds better.The look of this setup is just fantastic as well. iPhone/iPod with its up-to-the-minute tech and styling, hooked up to my homebuilt tube amp, designed to evoke in miniature the great Marantz tube amps of the past. With a gorgeous pair of HD650s next to it. The one thing I'd like is a nice charging dock like the one Arcam makes with a remote. The Russ Andrews cable is plenty long enough to not need a remote--I can just hold the device in my hand and operate it without getting up, and the Arcam dock won't sound any better. But the cable still won't charge the device.The bottom line of all this gear-bragging, the reason why I went into such detail about the setup I use, is this: all of it was designed around my Sennheiser hd650 phones. They are the basis for all the effort I put into the rest of it (okay, that AND saving significant money over just about any decent retail headphone amp). I should get one of those little "Works With iPhone" stickers and put it on my tube amp.If the hd650 ever breaks, I will probably buy another one just like it, unless somebody can show me a less expensive option that sounds better--which I doubt.One of the great bargains in high fidelity. If you want great sound and can't afford thousands of dollars in amps and speakers, you can get great sound--privately--with these cans and a minor investment in a good tubed headphone amp or even a good solid state one.When I bought these, you could get them all day long for $350 and I got them on sale at $290. You don't see those prices today. I figure I'm into my current setup--iPod interconnect, amp and headphones--for under $500. You will pay more today, but there is simply no cheaper way to get this kind of great sound. Period.

VWorth the money, a totally different sound experience
p1734
sg5
VI am no expert and hardly consider myself as an audiophile.For several years, I repeatedly searched for high quality sound equipments (amplifiers, audio players, loud speakers etc) on online retail shops and ended up realizing that I would end up with a setup worth thousands of dollars which I probably wouldn't even be able to listen to at a proper volume level, to avoid disturbing my neighbours.Despite my love for listening to high quality music, I refrained myself from spending too much money for it partly due to the reason above and ended up with medium quality sound systems (head-phones, ear-phones, loud-speakers etc.) and apparently missed a lot, until a few days ago.I ended up buying HD 650 from amazon.com with an indirect trigger from a friend as we were looking for a wireless headphone he could use.The first tracks I listened to with HD 650 was "Massive Attack - Paradise Circus (Gui Boratto remix)" along with "Paul Kalkbrenner - Aaron" and "Royksopp - Tricky Two". I can clearly remember, it was such an incredible experience. But the funny thing was, any thing I listened to afterwards was sensationally different from what I could recall and I ended up with "Hammer - U Can't Touch This" after like 20 hours. Incredible. Honestly, I probably didn't enjoy the sound quality in Ministry of Sound Club in London this much. Amazing.Can this head-phone replace an entire sound setup? no, they have their uses (e.g. when you are not alone)Can this head-phone give you the please of listening to high quality music at the highest volume level you can endure? yes, and it is not only my opinion. I noticed that any one who tried this head-phone in my house either froze for several minutes or ended up shouting "this is awesome".Make sure you have a proper amplifier that you can plug this monster to.

VThese headphones are quite possibly the most fantastic sounding bit of kit you can buy. I don't just listen to music, I engineer it - which means I'm listening twice as hard as most people. It's my job to hear the flaws, imperfections, equipment issues, techniques used, sound stage - all of it. And the 650's reproduce the music faithfully enough to allow me to hear it all. If you want the best, this is probably as good as it gets in this price range.

VI won't gush too much because it's already been done here and elsewhere on the 'net, however I will say the HD 650s really deliver on nuance, and they are lush, layered, musical, and bring a new level of emotion to music.  These are audiophile adjectives that I used to think were a bit pretentious but are truly the best way to describe the HD 650s.  They are uncanny in their ability to spatially separate instruments and sounds.Indeed they are laid back and perhaps "veiled" as some say, but it's a good thing and you're not losing any detail.  For maximum enjoyment listen in a very quiet environment and use high quality source material and a good amp.Cheers.

VI like to listen to music anytime and everywhere I can. That is the reason for buying a new pair of full size headphones. My experience with this type of cans is a pair of very old Philips (1993). Of course that my first choice was Bose (it is in every big store). I listened to their demo and it was a good sound, but the fact that I was unable to listen to my iPod made me not to choose them. Being at Best Buy I asked one of the sell persons what would he recommend. He suggested Klipsch (I own a 2.1 system which sounds very good),Sennheiser or Bower and Wilkins (besides the Beats and Bose). Although I never heard of Senheiser I purchased HD280. I do not want to comment on this pair because I returned them after one week (very disappointed). Then I thought I should try B&W.Again;, the same experience (the cans could not handle high volume and they were not around the ear). At that point I started to do some online research and combined with the desire of buying from a store (Best Buy) that has a physical location in my town I purchased Sennheiser PXC 450. I thought I would have everything in one can; NC, good sound and comfortable to wear. I cannot say that this cans did not sound good, but there was something artificial with the sound. The lack of big bass and the sensation of overprocessed sound convinced me in spending a little bit more. So I got the HD 650 and wow, what a difference. I have a sound that makes my endorphines flow. It is a concert to my ears. The bass is there but the ear drum does not pump and treble is just as much as needed. The sound is clear and I was able to discover new sounds in the song which I did not know they existed.This is not necessary a good thing (Lady Gaga's Born this way has so much instrumental background I did not hear before, that It bothers me). I will keep this cans and I will purchase a portable amp so that I can enjoy my iPod (Send station pocket dock recommended).

VA brief history of headphone usage; I grew up with your standard white plastic in-ear headphones, which make me cringe nowadays. When I got a bit older I wanted more bass, so I traded them in for Koss SPARKPLUG, which turned out to be almost *all* bass, and they were very uncomfortable, not mention hard to keep clean. I read a lot of good things about Koss PortaPro, and they are indeed the best *budget* headphones (for mp3 players or the like) I've ever heard, but the cable was very short, and it wasn't the type of headphones for serious (and critical) listening. I bought the Sennheiser RS-180 for movies and games (late night listening), and while they did perform very well, especially as far as wireless headphones go, they just lack that natural musicality; good sound, but nothing that'll make your hairs stand on end.Edit: I've had to reassess my entire review, and I've discovered a few crucial steps to enjoying the 650's with the Icon HDP:- Maintain a good auricular hygiene (ie; clean your ears often and carefully with an ear cleanout bulb). (Hopefully you already do, just saying).- Connect the Icon HDP to one of the faster USB-ports at the back of your computer. If you have music on an external source, use a fast port for that as well.- Very important! When your computer's detected the HDP, go to Sound settings on the Control Panel. Click on the HDP and Properties. On the Enhancements tab, disable all of them. On the Advanced tab, open the drop-down menu and pick the bottom option (best one). Accept the changes.- Connect the HD650's. Turn the volume knob to about "10 o'clock" (assuming you have all the Windows/iTunes volume controls to maximum). "11" is about as loud as you could ever want.- Now you're ready to open the music program of your choice, I mainly use iTunes (with EQ's, more on that below). Play a song (I'd recommend 320kbps mp3s at the absolute least). Enjoy. (If it "acts up" it's with no sound, you opened it too soon. Close it, reboot if needed, restart it. If it's very slow (a second or two between each song), check your song source; if it's external, is it on a fast USB-port?)I was sorely mistaken, let me make that clear. Don't use the HD650's with any source other than a good headphone amp, and if you have the Icon HDP, follow the steps above. A few incorrect settings is the difference between night and day soundwise. I've also had a bit of play time (or "burn in"-time) with them now, but I doubt that's really relevant; chances are you won't listen to them once and then give up, it's more likely you'll be glued to your seat for just one more song.There is a revelation, a "wow"-moment that I'd been missing out on. It's all here now, and it sounds truly wonderful. I listen to a lot of rock and metal, and beyond the incredibly sharp tapping of cymbals or gunfire-tactile drums, metal that's "epic" becomes grander and even more epic. Between each snapping rimshot, there's absolute silence (if intended). The vocalist screams right in your face, and you can pick up any use of doubled vocals; even if they're both growling or screaming. The stereo seperation's so good that when the drummer does a little "roll", it travels around your head, and all this without ever losing the melody or bass; but let's be clear on this: it all depends on how it's been recorded and mixed. If you're listening to a black metal garage band, chances are you won't be hearing much of a "soundstage", but it'll still sound about as good as it possibly could (just remember that you're only as good as your source; a high quality mp3 may sound very good, but lossless files are recommended). In many songs, even while the band is shredding away, you'll be able to clearly pick up and follow the sound of reverberating guitar (if it's there). In Arch Enemy's "Savage Messiah", that's just the case; a sustained guitar note wallows sadly in the background, and is later replaced by the haunting melody of a keyboard. In Paramore's "Misery Business", there's the feedback of a sustained guitar under the melody, to kind of ground the overly racious tune. Wonderful. So if you're a metalhead like me, there is a lot to be gained from the HD650's, sure, but not nearly as much as in other genres; you won't lose out on the "wall of sound" though, and now it's more like a fortress. The overall first impression is that you'll really come to appreciate the drumwork more than ever before, but there are a few gems hidden among the guitars, bass and vocals too. Oh, and if you're a fan of folk metal, i.e Eluveitie, you're in for an enormous treat. Wow.Classic rock benefits from the same points as noted above, but depending on who you are, you may be devastated or delighted to hear the "seams"; it's even clearer here what the limitations of musicians and time period were. "Immigrant Song" is almost too basic; the galloping drums and rhythmic strumming chugging on, but Plant's voice, the echo of guitar strings and thick clear bass all but make up for it. It's especially fun to hear John Paul Jones climb the bass strings like a kid on the pre-chorus, and Plant's eerie "whoo-ooh" leading the song to conclusion. "Stairway To Heaven" is and always has been from another world, a world where the gnomes and elves of the forest come together to rock you into submission. The acoustic and electric guitar dance around like newlyweds, but I was disappointed to hear more than one little crackle - beauty has its own price, and it's probably a fault attributed to the original recording. It can kind of ruin the illusion of a legendary tune (and yet the alternative's become too horrid to imagine).Acoustics are hard to put into words, definitely one of the highlights of listening. Whether it's Johnny Cash's somber plucking on "Hurt" enveloping you instantly, so present it sends chill down your spine, or a more ethereal experience like Into The Wild by Eddie Vedder, the only word to describe it is magical. I know it's a cliché, but I'm always surprised when you hear the vocalist spread his lips and clear saliva away or do a quick inhale before singing; and across most genres of music, you'll finally be able to hear the lyrics clearly. On "Ain't No Sunshine", Bill Withers holds the tempo down by tapping his foot softly, something so obvious I'd never paid attention to it before now. You almost get the feeling you've violated these artists by stepping into their world; like you're embarrassed to hear their every touch, strum and pluck to a fault. On "I Feel Fine", there's someone kicking off the proceedings while breathing in shallow little gasps, almost in tune with the song.I can't give an assessment on classical music; although I have some Wagner and Karajan conducting the Beethoven symphonies, for me they're a layman's little touch of class, a kid's attempt at fancy. I also have yet to really listen to them.How about pop and dance music? As I suspected, pop music sounds about as wonderful as ever (being that it's often about grabbing your attention or tugging at the heartstrings). Alanis Morisette beautifully balances heart and tempo on "Flavors Of Entanglement"; from the huge rasping beats of "Straitjacket", the soft piano on "Not As We" or the playful bassline on "Giggling Again For No Reason", you never lose sight of the most important tool; her voice. Light and smooth, she's right on center stage, only to occasionally jump out and grab you with ethereal trickery; this wordless musical breathing is also common with Enya and Sissel Kyrkjebø. For two notable examples, sure to make your hairs stand on end and plaster your face with a permanent grin, have a go at Sissel's "Lær Meg A Kjenne" and Michael Jackson's "(I Like) The Way You Love Me". Enya's "Aníron (I Desire)" from The Fellowship of the Ring has to be one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard in my life, simple as that. If you find that stuff a bit dry and boring though, you can always find comfort from Lady Gaga. It's appropriate that one of the first songs that jumped out and transformed is called "Speechless". On Born This Way, she truly gets to sing, and you truly get to enjoy it; "Hair" showcases Stefani's entire bag of tricks; her gorgeous and powerful voice, her insanely addictive melodies and the enormity of her dance/rock soundscape. But don't miss out on the rest of the album either; "Government Hooker" is a great example of the production, how the bassline is deliberately sharp, attacking you and disarming you all at once. Michael Jackson's decade-old Special Editions are a must; everybody knows his fantastic voice, but now you can finally come to appreciate how well these songs were played and put together; the omnipresent keyboards, percussion and strings. I got one delightful surprise in "Black Or White", when you've heard it about half a million times on tinny little radios and cheap stereos, you can't appreciate how enormous the song really is, with a solo guitar that grabs you by the throat.Electronic music benefits from the same effects as metal; if you're into dubstep, it's an aural assault on the senses, in a good way (perhaps electronics tend to sound a little too good though, robbing them slightly of their uniquely rebellious sound). And when you combine the two, i.e Korn's The Path Of Totality, you've reached heavy music fan nirvana.To clarify and summarize; I use the EQ settings in iTunes, because I want to get the emotional experience first and foremost. It's about enjoyment, entertainment and pleasure, I'm not a studio engineer, nor do I like listening to robots. Using EQ shifts the focus and can provide you with the icing on the cake; for rock music, the "Rock" setting is a given, punching up the bass and commencing attack mode. For softer pop songs and guitars, "Acoustic" brings out the lighter more ethereal tones, but stay away from the flattening abomination called "Pop"; if you want a fun punchy pop song, I'd recommend "R&B;", it may be a bit on the smooth side bass-wise, but it does the job well. It's strictly preference though; playing around with them can be great fun and very revelatory; it's your music, you should never be afraid to customize!And I've never heard AKG headphones, or Music Streamer DACs, or any other combinations for that matter. I do not doubt that they sound fantastic as well; it's simply up to preference. But I can tell you that I have never heard anything like this musically in my entire life. Now to dive into the sea of music and swim.

VI was a little hesitant to pick these up reading the reviews of audiophiles who mention the amount of amplification and possible extra equipment that may be needed to enjoy these cans.Although chilling out with a glass of wine and enjoying some pre-recorded music is an amazing treat, I primarily wanted reference headphones for my home studio.  And what I will say is that these are perfect for this purpose.  If you have an audio interface for recording you have enough power to drive these things.  Way more than enough.  I want to stress that point because many of the reviews here are not written from the perspective of the recording engineer, and of the avid listener.  But once you have these things and crank some music through them for a couple of days (the break in period which does make a difference) you will be able to make all those fine tuning mix adjustments you were afraid to do with closed back headphones.  Are your guitars balanced?  How is the panning on the kit?  Are the vox too bright?  You now have a great pair of reference headphones to make those decisions.  And although I primarily record metal, I just need to say that Steely Dan though these things are an amazing treat.

VI'm no audiophile, but I listen to music anywhere between 4 and 12 hours a day and have for the past 15 years, so I take music seriously enough to not take it too seriously...Over the years I've upgraded to phones in the $50 range, then $100 range, then to Sennheiser HD595's in the past few years. I've been contemplating these since I bought the 595's, but the cost was too prohibitive at the time. I finally was able to purchase these at a sub-$400 price and am glad I finally have them.First off, even without any warm-in period, I hear a noticeable difference over the 595's. There is a crispness and overall fuller sound, granted I have them plugged into a headphone amp via the optical out on my computer (Asus Xonar Essence STX card). Most of my music is 320k mp3 - For the most part, I find little difference in what I listen to between FLAC and 320k mp3 format, so have saved my self the space. These phones bring new life into my mp3's.They are a little tight fitting compared to any of the other phones I've used, but as some reviews have said, they loosen up a bit over time. The cable is plenty long enough and replace/upgradeable if the desire ever came. The overall appearance of them is modern and sleek, though they are a mostly plastic design, some of the lacquer paint seems a bit cheap for a phone in this price range.Overall, I'm happy I finally made this purchase and can't wait to see how these sound in a few months time after being nicely worn in.

VI owned the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 before these, and wanted better sound.  I wanted to hear sounds that I'd never heard from headphones before.  After searching the internet for a few weeks, I finally made the decision to buy these.  After reading so much, I discovered that you can't really BEAT the performance of these headphones without spending upwards of $900.  I also found out they required a proper amp to drive them; so I bought a Little Dot MK III at the same time.  I have been blown away from the sound since day one(I bought both 12/15/10).  Every day I use them, I am reminded of how great they are.  I don't know what to say about them that hasn't been said before.  They have a very solid history if you do a bit of googling.  A+ item.  If anything ever happened to them and they were out of warranty, I would definitely buy them again.EDIT:  I forgot to mention that, one of the biggest complaints from people is that it clamps on your head too tight.  This is obviously because the adjustable metal bands are still tight and fresh from factory.  Since they are metal, you can just bend them ever so slightly outwards, reducing the tension on your head.  I did this when I got my headphones and it made them feel as if they were meant for my head.

VFantastic sound but poor design
p1785
sg5
VI won't repeat the reviews about the fantastic sound quality, but after nearly three years and hundreds of hours of use, it's time to report on some unacceptable flaws at this price range.- First of all is the very uncomfortable pinch of the ears, which has become less of a problem after the first year, but is still very present even now. The phones do not envelop the ear, they are pressed strongly against it, and it rather hurts at the beginning, even through the pads.- The bridge slips back and forth on the top of the head, there is not one good position that stays fixed if you move a little around.- The cord is very good and sturdy most of the length, but becomes very thin after the split between the two ears.- This is especially bad at the point of contact with the connector: The connector is strongly inserted into the headphone and when the cord is pulled, the connector won't pull out but instead, the wires inside the cord will break from the constant pushing and pulling that the cord endures during its lifetime. I see other Amazon users experienced the same problem multiple times on Sennheiser stock cables. The connector should envelop the cord more rigidly and progressively along a centimeter or two more, so the cord cannot be pushed and pulled at a 90° angle, which breaks the wires inside the cord.- Not too happy about the price that went from $500 to $350 either, this was clearly a rip-off then and probably still is now.

p1796
sg5
VThe best headphones by far that I have ever used. They don't have to be loud to sound great. The amplifier that comes with it does not really add that much if anything to the music quality. I don't even use it anymore. My son has had a set of these headphones for a few years and we compared them side by side and his definitely sounded better with deeper bass and also seemed to be more sensitive making the same volume setting sound louder. This demonstrates that these headphones will sound better and better as they are broken in. They are very comfortable and light. They do let more sound out for other people to hear than other more traditional headphones. The music sounds great with all musical genres from classical to rock. Highly recommended.

VIn an internet full of audiophile pontificating, rants, raves, and snake oil, the Sennheiser HD 650s are the real deal.Like most people considering dropping this much money on headphones, I read and researched until my head hurt.Unable to find a local dealer who stocked this model and would let me try a pair out before purchasing, I decided to take a risk and order them sight unseen (a practice I do my best to avoid and which I would not recommend).Fortunately, I have rarely been happier with an audio purchase.Comfortable and capable, the Senns are a joy to use.I find myself trying to sneak in a quick listening session on my lunch break or whenever I have a few spare moments... they are that good.With them, I hear things in recordings that I never knew were present, and I dig the slightly warm, mellifluous sound signature of these cans. Bass is profound without being annoying or artificially exaggerated. I would call them perfectly natural and entrancing. I had no idea headphones could sound this good or be this comfortable. (Be aware that they will probably seem quite tight at first, but this clamping effect lessens with use.)If all the talk of needing to spend thousands of dollars on a dedicated headphone amp for these cans in order to part the dreaded "Sennheiser veil" has you spooked, don't be. They aren't as hard to drive as some would have you believe, and there is no "veil."They WILL definitely benefit from good amplification, though (and you will not realize their full potential if you try to use them directly from an iPod). I have found they sound marvelous with vintage Marantz receivers that can be obtained inexpensively, as well as from modern dedicated headphone amps. (I am using a Cayin HA-1A with them with great results). If you are using an iPod as a source with your headphone amp, you will want to make your files lossless to get the most enjoyment out of these cans, as they will definitely reveal the flaws in poor recordings or low bit-rate files.While these cans might seem expensive at first blush, they are actually a rare audiophile bargain: they will not only give you years of enjoyment, but they will also hold their value.Shop around: they can be found for significantly below retail price. If you can find them for a great price, you can use them for years and still get most of your money back should you ever decide to sell them.  (Just be sure to buy from an authorized dealer or your warranty will not be valid.)I wish I'd taken the plunge on these cans years ago: all that time spent listening to mediocre $100 headphones that never really satisfied seems like a waste in retrospect.If you love music, get these headphones.

VMy second favorite pair of cans
p1807
sg5
VI've been using my HD 580 for over 12 years now, and my HD 600 for over 6 years. I figured it was about time for me to upgrade my HD line to the 650. These cans are just awesome. Right out of the box it played with ease and outclassed my HD 600. After about 2 weeks of constant use, the drivers and cabling broke in. The HD 650 was finally performing at it's best. The biggest difference I noticed was the bass. It outstrips the previous models in quantity and quality...being a bass head, this was welcomed with open arms. The HD 650 is by no means a bass monster though, especially when compared to headphones like the Denon AH-D7000 and the Beyerdynamic DT 990, but they hold their own and remain extremely musical. For the most part, I use these cans for all genres of rock, jazz, and some drum & bass. I can't recommend these headphones anymore highly if you're looking for great do-it-all cans.I must qualify my review with this, I do use a headphone amp and DAC fed by a Mac mini playing ALAC files. So, that will greatly improve the sound quality and expose more nuances of the headphones.

VSmooth as silk
p1813
sg5
VMy previous experience with headphones was limited to lower end ear buds and Sennheisers (PX100).  I wanted something a little more substantial so bought a Beyerdynamic DT990.  The DT990, while providing tons of detail up high with a great punch down low, was way too shrill in the upper registers for my tastes, even with some burnin.  It left my ears ringing at the end of a listening session.Then, the most magical set of phones this side of a grand arrived.  The Sennheiser HD650.  This is nothing like the DT990.  The sound is smooth as silk and more laid back.  There's still tons of detail (though a bit more curtailed than the Beyer) and most importantly I can listen to it for hours with no strain and no ringing in my ears.  This is the headphone you use to relax after a long day of work while still being able to enjoy the fine details in your favorite song.Coupled with the ASUS Xonar STX headphone amp audio card - which is a PHENOMENAL combo - I haven't had this much joy listening to music in a long long while.Pros:Smooth, soothing sound quality while still retaining great amount of detail.  These headphones will melt your stress away.  Replacable, removable cord.Cons:Headband a little on the tight side (Beyers win in the comfort department) but a little bending of the metal (not plastic) portion of the phones improves comfort.  There's a lot of plastic in the phones, which may affect long term reliability - so far, it feels plenty sturdy though.  Beyers win in the appearance department.Bottom line:These phones produce a smooth sound with no harsh/shrill bite.  While you may want some bite in genres such as Rock, these win handsdown compared to brighter phones like the DT990 for my collection of music and movies.

VAmazing Audiophile Cans
p1819
sg5
VReally love these headphones. As has been expressed in other reviews these headphones need proper amplification to really shine.  Personally I'm using the Darkvoice 336SE tube headphone amp with the Cambridge Audio DacMagic using toslink out from my pc and they sound amazing out of that amp/dac combination.  These cans have incredible imaging and sound stage presentation with strong tight bass bass response.  The top end is also very extended and detailed as well.  Another great feature is the detachable cable which allows for aftermarket enhancement by upgrading to a balanced configuration or high end SE cables. I upgraded to the Moon Audio Silver Dragon cable which seems to provide additional transparency and clarity over the stock cable which already was quite good. These headphones are absolutely a pleasure to listen to and I look forward to many years of great sound out of them.

Words in this review to describe the way the sound will never justify these sound. This is the best 500 dollars I have ever spent on anything in my entire life as a human being. People who say these NEED an amp, can please stop there. These EASILY overshadow any headphones that are un-amped that ive ever heard. I own K701's and many others, these in my honest opinion are the best um-amped headphones Ive ever heard.

VI was fortunate enough to pick these up lightly used from a friend, with the Cardas Cable, and I will say, they are the best sounding pair of anything I have owned, I simply hear things I didn't even know were there before, its simply amazing. From a looks point of view, they lack, in other words, they look like a 200 dollar set of headphones, not a 500 dollar set, however they are built like a 500 dollar pair of headphones, and I find after a half hour with them on, I stop noticing they are there. I do not believe one needs a headphone amp to drive them, however to really experience them fully one does need some sort of amplification, an iPod for example drives it very poorly as the impedance mismatch very large (300 Ohms, vs the rated 32 ohms)  and also, the drivers in them are quite large, so some sort of amplification is recommended, I use an NAD 7140, and it sounds lovely.Edited Jun/4/12I have owned these for a bit over a year now, and I love them even more, they really do need an amp to drive them, and as much as I thought it was made of cow patties, they really do open up over time, and perform better with more time running. I would recommend it to anyone who need good cans, and can afford it.

VNot Comfortable Initially
p1836
sg5
VFinally got this to see what the fuss is all about.  I've been collecting high-end headphones and this was the only guy missing in my collection.Sound quality-wise, this is a no-brainer.  Exactly what I was looking for because I was bored of the flatness of AKG and not impressed with the Denon's artificial sound stage.  The Senn 650 is somewhat in between for a good balance of true sound with some ever-so slight flavor.  Bass in not over-whelming like the Denon AHD2000 but much more noticeable than the AKG K701 or any of the Grado line.It has a 1/2 inch plug which makes sense because you're not bringing this guy with you on your commute.  They're open-back meaning noise escape like portable speakers and more importantly, you will barely hear anything if this is not connected to an amp.That being said, I was very underwhelmed by the presentation because these are very expensive headphones and they came in a box made out of cheap outer cardboard.  The build quality cannot compare with the Denon AHD2000.  Out of the box they do not feel like its an expensive piece of electronics.  The brand name is painted on top of headband with white paint.  Seriously?  Comfort is just horrible for this class of headphones.  If I paid $100, I wouldn't mind, but for so much money this better fit like a glove which it did not.  The most comfortable headphones I have so far is the AKG K701 - so good you don't even feel like you're wearing anything.  Even the D2000 are better than the Senns because they don't pinch your head by being quite loose, maybe even too loose.Overall, it's not the prettiest headphones and nowhere near comfortable, but it does provide a great balance between true sound and unique playfulness that will be hard to find elsewhere.UPDATE: headphones are quite comfortable after some time.  I basically use these with my Nuforce AMP/DAC all the time now.  These are probably the best headphones in my collection because they are quite comfortable and the sound quality is just amazing.  I think if I was stranded on an island and I can only pick 1 headphones from collection I would not even hesitate in choosing this pair.

p1842
sg5
VIn the price range of $400-500 you won't find many audiophile headphones that top the Sennheiser HD650.  You will not regret pulling the trigger on these headphones.  However, to get them to really shine you will need a headphone amplifier to drive these cans.  My source is a Hifiman HM-601 and it can drive these cans decently well.  Combine a good source with these cans along with some 24-bit FLAC files and you'll be in heaven.  Also consider using an upgraded cable as well down the road (not cheap though).  Lots of reviews out there, I can say the hype is real.  It will be a while before I feel the need to upgrade.

p1853
sg5
VI just got these headphone today and I can already hear the difference from the one I was using for the last 5 years(Bayerdynamic DT990). From what I read from other reviewers that these cans will open up after breaking them in for about a month or so. I am very excited about this and cannot wait till the day it happens. For audiophiles like me the only thing that is missing is the Cardas aftermarket cable ($220 for 10ft) with the package. Personally, the Cardas cable will make a significant mid and high frequency output difference than the stock cable and you should invest the money on purchasing this together or immediately after purchasing this headphone. As for my fortune my co-worker has the same headphones for his studio and I was given the chance to listen with it before purchasing it. Otherwise, there is not much to say than what has already been posted by other reviewers.

Vthese things are truly the art in semi-affordable sound experiences..everyone has really commented above about them so i will not waste your time..here are 2 things to keep in mind though1. you will need an amp/dac or (amp and dac) for these. Powering them off your ipod is probably not gonning to be enough juice. And yes, the quality of that connection will make a big difference. So be prepared to spend at LEAST $300 for something to boost/amplify/convert the signal. (More realistically $1000+ ... but i understand we all have limits)2. Remember your sound quality will only be as good as your recording source. If you have songs from itunes.. you will hear things in the songs that you had no idea were even there (aka problems..). Since itunes compress their songs so much you will hear some deficiency in songs, and in all honestly these might not be the headphones for you. You will want to make sure your recordings are either in FLAC.. or to save space.. MP3 320 kbps or MP3 V0.. Anything lower than that can really make a listening experience poorly.think of these things like a high performance car. After its tune up, special battery, and correct shinning.. nothing will touch it.. But you need to make the effort to hear the difference..

VFirst, I love music.  Well, most all music - not a big fan of gangsta anything, rap or country (except Patsy Cline and George Strait)The music library I have built through the years spans multiple genres (excepting the above noted!)About 5 years ago, I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD590s.  The first song I listened to through my new toy was Sister Sweetly by Big Head Todd and the Monsters.  My jaw hit the floor!  The sound was so crisp, and separated; the bass punched and the midrange was RIGHT THERE, and high end was alive.I spent the following few months buying CDs of my favorite old albums I'd listened to as a kid.  Slowly, the CD collection grew and the Sennheiser 590s seemed to improve.When I bought the HD590s on the He-dRo-m website, I spied the HD650s, but did not have that kind of cash.  That website rates the 650s as the best cans available, anywhere, for that price range.  The reviewers lay down a trail of praise as wide as Mama Cass' bootie.  I had to have these headphones!Well, I bought the Sennheiser HD650s on Amazon a few weeks ago (at an AMAZING price), and bought a HeadRoom Portable Micro headphone amp to drive them.  I listen to an ipod.After some time listening to the HD650s, I am returning them.The sound is, well, beautiful yet lacking...  A wide "aural picture", with a lack of bass punchiness, midrange fullness, and highs that I can't get my ears around.Every sound is present - front and center.  The separation and  distinction of all fequencies is beautiful - I have never heard anything like it.  But, the music...lacks...emotion.It is as if a professor is at the front of class describing in clinical detail a "first kiss".  He describes everything that is felt, in excruciatingly accurate detail - her eyes, her hair, the smell, the breeze blowing past, the birds in the trees, the feel of her lips - etc., yet, it...lacks...emotion.  Even though he nails it!Over the past few weeks, I have performed multiple "tests" comparing the HD650s to the HD590s - through the new HeadRoom Portable Micro Amp, which has plenty of power to drive the big 650 cans.Clasical, Pop, Rock.  The 590s have been "matured" through years of use, so they produce more responsiveness, and tactile punch of bass - The 590s have the sound that I like.Please try to understand the following:  I spent 3 weeks trying to sell myself on the 650s - the published reviews are so high, I have wanted these for so many years, they look amazing, the build quality is awesome, they are comfortable on my head.  The sound just lacks emotion for me.  They reproduce the music flawlessly, but - they don't pull me into the music - I feel like a bystander to the performance, even though I am in the front row.After reading many reviews of headphones after the past few months - I have come to the conclusion that we all have a certain "aural picture" which works best for each of us.  The comparison between the 650s and 590s has made this clear to me.  I am looking for a pair of headphones right in between these - the sound separation and distinctness of the 650s, the bass and presence of the 590s.Does anyone make such a set of headphones?  I don't know, but I will find them!A few years later, I have received some responses - thanks.  Actually bought the Sennheiser HD 600s - they are great.I have changed the review from 2 stars to 4 stars - personally love Sennheiser head phones  - just not the 650s - get people off my back - Live Long and Prosper

VI used the HD 590's for a couple of years without a headphone amp and enjoyed the feel and sound for the most part. But recently I decided that I wanted to blast off into the audiophile galaxy and so I picked up a pair of HD 650's along with a Music Hall OBH-11 Headphone Amplifier. Two words: audio bliss! If you dig electronic music with a lot of detail like myself, then this headphone and amplifier pairing will tantalize your cochlea. I didn't know music could sound this good.

VGreat Sound, Comfortable Fit
p1905

VThese cans feature a clean, accurate, open sound with astonishingly deep base. The ultra flat response curve may not please those who are accustomed to phones with boosted base or treble response. The HD650 is not suited for use on portable players as they need adequate power to perform. In any case, they are far too revealing for use on anything but uncompressed high quality sources.I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable these things are. This compensates for their truly ugly appearance.All and all I am very pleased with my purchase of these phone. To top it off I got an extremely good price from Amazon affiliate Sonic Sense.

VA Great Listening Experience
p1922

VI recently purchased these on Amazon for $339 thru Pro Audio Express. They were delivered in 2 days and were in perfect brand new condition! When I put them on I noticed that it almost felt like putting a clamp on my head but it was also a feeling of quality design. I previously had a pair of HD570's that were incredibly comfortable; my son has inherited these. The sound difference betweek these is quite remarkable.  I have listened to them on my laptop and also on my new Pioneer Elite SC-27 receiver so I can echo the comments about being sure you give these an adequate power level to do them justice. I will say that even on my computer they sounded pretty nice but some of the musice would sound kind of muddled as their just wasn't enough juice. I spent the better part of a weekend reading every review I could find on these and it seemed that the only people who complained about them were people who were professional sound engineers or people that didn't give them enough power. If you have a decent home theatre system and you are looking for headphones(my wife often requests that I "put on the headphones") I highly recommend these. Depending on your financial well being these are worth every dime for the quality of the listening experience they provide.

VI have received the HD 650 aprox.2 weeks ago.Prior to buy them I've been researching /reading reviews for at least 2 weeks I have also tried to listen to them before buying but unsuccesfully.However after reading hundreds of positive reviews/commentaries ...I really believed that they are one of the best headphones on earth among AKG 701/702, GRADO, etc...  I had been listening aprox. 5 days, 6-8 hours per day and I could not believe that they sound a little bit better than my $19.99 Sony Headphones purchased back in 2003.I'm listening mostly everything ,from Jazz, Blues to Heavy Metal,Disco,Pop,New Age.I have tried everything.I paid $320.00(brand new) from an authorized reseller. I read already the break in MYTH(50-200 hrs.) and I really don't believe it, I have also read that you need a headphone amp.(that might be true) I'm not an AUDIOPHILE, I also don't believe that if you put a $2-300 cable it will significantly change anything unless the cable is damaged.  That being said today I went to Best Buy and I bought : Bose QC 15 , Beats Studio Monster and Sony NC60.After only 30 minutes, I dropped Sennheiser HD650 and SONY NC60.Now I have to decide between Bose and Beats. CONCLUSION:If you are just a normal person not an AUDIOPHILE , I strongly recommend BOSE or BEATS ,you need no $2-400 Cardas cable, No $300-1500 headphone amplifier, You don't need a suit case if you're traveling, there is also a huge sound leakeage because they open headphone.

And, boy, do they ever OPEN UP.Sennheiser has truly outdone themselves with these superb headphones.If you're thinking about buying these, stop thinking about it, and buy them!

VI had bad experience with Sennheiser's HD555, which is over priced for the sound quality, so I was a little bit concerned with the higher end HD650. I am a big fan of Grado and AKG 701, but HD650 is not disappointing at all. It is very different in sound signature (darker, warmer) with strong bass and lower mid-range, while it doesn't lose treble much as HD555 does. It did sound very like inside a concert hall when I was watching Josh Groban's performance.Due to its high impedance and lower sensitivity, HD650 may require very strong amplifier to deliver higher level sound. My beloved Sansa Fuze could not drive it to high level, and some of the other computers I tried could not either. On the other hand, the high end Dell laptop my wife uses had no problem with HD650 at all.Highly recommend if you want to enjoy music and when you do have a good source to drive these headphones. Personally I would consider AKG 701 for their lower price and neutral sound, and Grado phones for their easiness in driving capability and fun sound signature as well. None of these provide sound isolation and none of these look very fashionable to match with your Apple or Sony gadgets. So these phones may not be suitable for you if you care more about the look than sound.

VWonderful Sounding, Wide Open with a headphone amp
p1956
sg5
VWith my Cayin HA 1A headphone amp, these Senheisser HD650 headphones sound wonderful.  They are very open, yet without harshness.  They are 300 ohm impedance, so they may sound veiled unless run through an amplifier which really opens them up.  In fact, I needed to pick out some warm tubes to tone them down with my headphone amp just a little, and make the female voices a little less lean and more textured.  Never harsh with any tube selection though.My only quibble and the only reason these headphones did't get a 5 rating, is that I personally don't like the gimicky pseudo exotic crushed velvet feeling.  It feels a little like something greasy is touching the skin to me (although brand new).  My Sennheiser HD280 headphones felt much better against the skin with their fake leather.  The slightly larger cups seemed slightly too long to me also, as it managed to touch the sensitive skin just below the lower jaw under the ear.  Although the crushed velvet didn't feel bad at all, the Sennheiser HD650s just didn't feel quit as good as the fake leather on the HD280s.  I think people who don't mind turtleneck sweaters may like the feeling of these headphones though - whatever that means.Wonderful sound for the money.

VOh man, by all means if you have the cash do not hesitate picking a pair of these up!  However, be aware, to really make these babies sing you need an headphone amplifier.  They will work without one; however, the sound is no where near the quality with an amp on the back-end pushing some power into these babies.  Also, when you first get these they may not sound completely clean (maybe a bit muffled).  Do not be alarmed, after a week or two of good listening time these things really break-in and it's all cream cheese from there - sweetness.  Again, if you don't have any  issues dropping $400 for these cans plus an amp, go for it...these are the BEST headphones on the market today!  Another reviewer said it best...the Germans did it again!  Cheers, Sennheiser!

VAmazing out of the box
p1966
sg5
VBefore I purchased these headphones I had been keeping an eye on audiophile websites to try to understand what I needed to make awesome sound in my home for relatively cheap.  The Sennheiser HD650 reviews were consistently positive, but I was apprehensive because everyone kept saying that you need a headphone amp or that the senns will not be loud enough and sound "veiled" without an amp.  Well I think these audiophiles are tooting their own horns, trying to pretend that they can hear magical veils and such, in order to justify the 1000s of dollars they spend on audio equipment.  I plugged these things into my laptop's sound card right out of the box and they sounded 20 times better than my Bose around ear phones, with every type of music I sampled.  I did not think that there would have been this much of a difference between headphones, but anyone (I tested this theory with my girlfriend and a couple of friends) can tell right off the bat that these headphones sound SOOOO much better than standard headphones, or even upper end Bose headphones. I imagine this is what music producers and sound engineers intend for you to hear.  I cannot recommend these headphones enough.  They are FANTASTIC and worth every penny (I got mine on ebay Best Offer for 320).  two thumbs way way up. These headphones have made me rediscover music.  The Germans did it again.

p1971

VThey are first class cans. Pros: they provide a round, balanced sound with exceptional bass. Extremely comfortable. Cons: the sound is too round, that means they lack a bit of detail in the top spectrum and the soundstage is not very open or precise. They reproduce very well pop/rock as well as jazz piano trios. Excellent reproduction of piano and drums as well. For classical music I prefer AKGs 701 because of their unsurpassed soundstage and the impressive rendition of detail. The AKGs are not very strong on drums and piano, though. So I ended buying both (this option would be too expensive for speakers of this quality). I use AKGs for some recordings and the 650s for other recordings.

VReference quality (good enough for me anyway!).  Prefer to AKG 701s and Beyer 880s.  Well made.  Similar to the 600s but slight improvements such as a thicker cord --- which actually does help the sound quality a bit.  Accurate.  Good bass.  Excellent SQ but a bit veiled.  It helps if you can try it first.  I like punchy but like these, too, and find them worth the money.  For 300 ohms, not that hard to drive --- but yes, use a headphone amp for portable devices.Almost as good and a bit more upfront sound --- try the Senn 595s and save some money.  Both are very comfortable.

VJust received my HD650's. Picked them up manufacturer refurbished for some decent $$$ savings from an authorized re-seller. My headphone amp (headroom portable micro) is due in next week so my rating is without a headphone amp. I am a Senn fan and own a couple pairs on top of the 650's (HD590 and PCX250 noise reduction). Compared to my 590's these have a much bigger sound stage and as previous posters have said you hear things in high quality recordings I never heard before with the HD590. As far as coloration goes or veiled response, I think that has to be a source material issue or equipment issue. Plugging these into my Marantz 8500 receiver and listening to an SACD or DVD-A is true bliss, just a little taste of heaven. MP3s sound great too, either plugged into the receiver or piped thru my logitec PC system (their top o line with separate headphone amp). Bought the portable amp for my ipod, figured it should increase my satisfaction with both the 650 and 590 while on the go. First time I tried the 650 was on a 256k MP3. The sound difference between the 590s and the 650s literally gave me chills and this is before the recommended "burn in".I am by no means an expert, but love all kinds of music. Unfortunately (or fortunately) due to small kids and wife can't play my music at levels on my old AR9s like I used to. These HD650s are an awesome substitute. Pull the trigger on these and you will not regret it. They live up to the hype. Just make sure you buy them from an authorized reseller (like Amazon, not a third party seller) or the warranty is no good.

VI have listened to my music for the last few years using Paradigm Studios including the Signature sub woofer. I have come to appreciate the effortless sound produced by this system, not only its accuracy, but an exceptional soundstage as well. Headphones weren't generally necessary, but if they were, I did have an older pair of Denons. Well, my friend said she wanted my old Denons for her iPod, so I had a chance to look for something newer. I purchased the 650s. Simply said, get ready to hear what you've never heard previously. Good and bad. You hear the entire recording. Clearly. Incredible subtle nuances. You don't miss anything. Play your favorite SACD and it's like you purchased another recording.As far as coloration, well to me that's subjective. If I were the engineer mixing the recording, I might believe they warmed up the sound just a small, small bit, but if I were listening just for the enjoyment, I'd say Sennheiser nailed it. Open. Transparent. Natural.The only weakness, and I hesitate to call it that, is the sound stage. Although very accurate in their placement, the 650's don't match the depth and overall spatial presence of the Studios. But then again, with the 650s, I can turn my head or shift my seat and the soundstage doesn't float.Folks, I'd say the Sennheiser 650s are a great investment !

VFantastic headphones with a WARNING!!!
p2002
sg5
VDon't get me wrong, these are excellent sounding headphones. They have good soundstage, very musical and warm sounding like you're in a concert hall. Only thing is I wish it had a bit tighter bass. I've had them for over a year now (bought these babies over eBay, its cheaper). BUT, they are extremely PICKY. Over the year i've spent big $ upgrading the cable, purchasing a number of amps just to get rid of that nasty veil. All along thinking that my amps weren't giving it enough power, but I was wrong. It was my source all along. These headphones will not sound good when you play mp3s though them. They will sound bloated, muddy, and veiled. I learned that the hard way. Well except for some, they sound decent. Most of my music collection is mp3. Most VBR or at least 192 kbps. But if you want to hear the best from these headphones expect to play only actual CD, vinyl, wav, flac, alac, or other lossless codec. Also I recommend a good DAC and headphone amplifier. So expect to spend at least 1k on your equipment to bring out the best of these headphones. Yeah, they are pretty cheap in comparison and a good value  but they come with a price!!!edit 9/27/08: mp3s actually do sound decent to good through these headphones but that will all depend on your DAC. a high quality DAC is HIGHLY recommended. none of those cheap $200 DACs. those will not cut it. get a good one and you will be rewarded. i recommend getting an Oritek modded zhaolu. those make CDs sound very close to vinyl. it's world class and no more of that digital harshness.but of course, you can always get some Grados, those make anything sound good. even straight through an ipod. :)oh yeah, and don't forget to upgrade the stock cable. it's crap. get the zu cable or the cardas. i had the cardas first and then i upgraded to the zu's. and i kept the zu's because they help bring out the highs more.

VI've owed these headphones for 1+ years and use them everyday for most of my listening....CD, DVD, TV, vinyl, etc.  OK, I'm a headphone guy.  I have a fairly high end CD player and headphone amp from Musical Fidelity.  The break-in period is extensive so, anyone writing a review before using the phones for less than 100 hours is probably too early.  I like all types of music.From the view of a layperson, I find the 650's a great fit to my listening preferences.  The 650's produce a warm, balanced sound (for my ears) that is pleasant to listen to for extended periods without fatigue.  Some may find them a bit heavy on the low end but it's hard to say because of the wide varity of recording styles and sources.  The Cardas cable upgrade (pricey) tends to re-balance the sound by reducing the bass a bit.  Others have strongly suggested a headphone amp to drive the 650's; I've never used them without one for comparison.The headphones are comfortable but heavy compared to the lower end models.  Workmanship quality is excellent.Shop around for price.

V[Audiophile] Headphones
p2013
sg5
VI have owned the HD650, HD600, AKG K701 for almost a year now. I have heard them being plugged into a soundblaster to a $3000 headphone amp... sources like the Benchmark DAC1.  I have heard them with the OEM single ended cable to Equinox XLR balanced.  I've even had the opportunity to build my own components: Opus dual mono DAC, AMB mini^3, Tangent PPAv2, AMB Beta22 during this adventure.  The HD650 and 600 are my favorite.  I preferred one over the other depending on the upstream equipment.  They say the 650 are the most "scalable" cans out there - i strongly agree that they're sensitive to component changes.From an [audiophile] perspective, price is irrelevant.  They are Cheap being a flagship model: check price of Edition9s, GS1000, AD2000.  Construction wise, they are solid.  If you want something that can survive being run over by a truck, get Beyers.  The cables are interchangeable & upgradeable.  The headband will snap if you try to bend it (bend metal to adjust clamp...duh)  Otherwise they are comfortable enough to keep on my head for hours.The HD650 has awesome bass for an open can (could be a little tighter), it is not bloated and extends very deep when given balanced amplification.  The 600 has better bass by a small margin.  The HD650 has very extended highs, but is polite in this area (cymbals in some recordings exhibit this).  It's difficult to make 650 sibilant (harsh S), but possible - tolerable even when it does.  The 650 has above average headstage wider>deeper (a compromise to make it work with a larger range of music).  It's very good at portraying details like ambiance and the recording area.  Overall, the HD650 have an inherent flavor or coloring whatever you want to call it - they are very WARM sounding cans and a little laid back.  Relative to other cans i have heard, 650 are actually close to neutral in terms of tonality.  It's impossible for a headphone to do everything right.  I think this is a very good shot at it.The easiest way i can put this is that you should have the minimum decent equipment (generally not suited for portable use) otherwise the HD650 may sound bloated, veiled, non-energetic like the critics say. They still sound better than mid-fi headphones unless you try to run them straight out of a non-SQ oriented PMP (or anything non-SQ oriented for that matter).  When the HD650 are fully balanced $$$, they shine.  If you don't want to invest in those things, get the HD600 (much more forgiving) or other headphones because these aren't for you.  For most people, i would recommend the HD600.  Your ears may vary.

VI recently got these headphones from Amazon Market place at about 50% of retail. Was a very tough choice buying headphones online and only relying on reveiws posted by others and other websites like cnet.Choices were HD600, HD650, AKG K701, Grado SR325i. Also considered some by Denon. HD650 fit all my requirements.Sound was important but not at the cost of Comfort and durability. These fit your whole ear very comfortably. Durability has be be seen.I like the open air design because I have a 5 year old daughter, this way I am aware of what's happening outside also. Leaking noise is no problem as the only place I will be using these will be in our media room.Others had stated that the sound from these is laid back. Took me a while to research and find out what they meant, and how the sound from Grado is different then these.Works perfectly for me. I am in my forties and appreciate music seated in row 5 than in the front row or right in the middle of the concert. I have not tried Grado and one day might buy them and might like their sound better.I own HD555 but miss the Bass. I have a set by Denon, which has good bass but too tight and not as clear as these. NO WAY AS CLEAR AS THE HD650. These just sound wonderful. Can't wait and see how they are after about 50-100 hours of break in.Cardas cables: Maybe after about a year when I want to take my listening level up a notch.Right now these are plugged into my Harmon Kardon AVR 525.

Finally, my search for the ultimate Cans is over.Played "Aja" Steely Dan regular CD and it never sounded better. Very comfortable wearing these headphones.

VI must say I didn't like the sound when it arrived in my hands, until I recabling it. HD650 doesn't come with best sound without doing any thing, however, it sounds fantastic when you pair it with a good amplifier and cables. It can sing, with warmth sound as you heard with a tube amplifier. But if mismatching an amplifier, it would sound awful; the difference is so significant.

VRumor has it that Sennheiser will be introducing a new top of the line headphone early next year, so if you're not in a huge hurry, you might wait to see if the HD 650s will be dropped from the product line.  If they are, you'll probably be able to pick up a pair at a reduced price.The HD650s are great headphones, but they are not perfect.  However, neither is anything else.  I've (at one time or another) owned the top offerings from the "Big 3" makers of dynamic headphones:  Sennheiser, AKG, and Grado.  I've also tried Ultrasones.  Each brand has a distinctive "house sound."  Translation:  some recordings will sound better on one brand than the others and vice-versa.The 650s have a warm, laid-back sound...with a bit of hump in the bass frequencies.  This is a mixed blessing.  It helps out some recordings, but leaves others sounding a bit too bassy.  If you are using them on a portable amp (which will have less prodigious bass than a home unit due to power supply limitations), the slight bass hump may really help the sound.  On the upside, the midrange and high frequencies on the HD 650s are totally smooth, the phones have a great soundstage, and they are fairly comfortable.  To get the most from them though, you will need a separate headphone amplifier.I use my pair with an aftermarket Cardas cable.  To my ears, the difference (and improvement) in reproduction was there from the start.  The Cardas cable opened up the mid and high ranges over what I got with the stock cable.  However, I can't say you won't be happy with the HD 650s without a replacement cable.  We all hear things a bit differently due to the shapes of our outer ears.  To some people, the Sennheiser line has a slightly veiled sound.  A Grado will sound like you are on the front row or on the stage itself.  A Sennheiser will place you a few rows back in the hall.A bit further down, someone recommends the HD 600s over the HD 650s.  I say try them both out.  I find the high ranges on the 650s to sound a bit smoother and they are perhaps a bit more extended.  On the other hand, the HD 600s do not have a bass hump.  The differences in sound are apparent, so try both out if you can before buying.Even though this review may strike the reader as being a bit negative, it's really not.  My hope is that it's a realistic assessment from a listener who is not a fanboy or a pimp for any brand.  Is the HD 650 the best dynamic headphone out there?  Maybe...  maybe not.  Let your own ears be the judge.  I love my HD 650s and can't see myself selling them anytime soon.  However, I also own two other pairs of headphones from other manufacturers and find myself rotating between them all periodically.

p2041
sg5
VThese headphones sound absolutely incredible and I don't know what praise I can give them that hasn't already been said many times.  The only downsides I can think of (open design, hard to drive properly, non-flat frequency response) are design decisions that given these cans their beautiful sound quality so they can't really be considered downsides.  Every time I listen to these I am in my own world of musical bliss and find it hard to stop listening.  It is always "just one more song" and "just one more..." until next thing I know it is 2:00am and I have to be up for work in a few hours!The best advice I can give is to drive these properly, do not hook them directly up to the headphone jack on, well anything except for a quality receiver or amp.  Actually I would highly recommend a headphone amp such as one from [...]  I am currently using a Headroom Total Bithead and the HD650s sound incredible and as I upgrade my amp, dac and source material in the future, the HD650s will only sound better and better.If you can afford these, they are worth every penny.  There hasn't been a second that I have regretted my purchase and these are one of my most prized possessions.

p2046
sg5
VI auditioned these headphones after reading some of the reviews and could not believe how disappointing they were.  I have a background in audio engineering and production. But mostly I just enjoy listening to good music....accurately!  Anything else is an insult to the recorded material and the listener for that matter.  If the listener chooses to make eq adjustments at home to suit his or her tastes then that is a matter left for their individual decision making.What Sennheiser has done with the HD 650 is grossly alter the natural balance of the source material in a way that makes these things useless for anyone serious about recorded music.  Muddy, indistinct, boosted bass, severely rolled off highs and a midrange trying to peak through from behind all that bass.  Serious reference quality transducers should not do this.  Consumer gear throws that kind of stuff at you. For the price these cans are a joke!Sennheiser's HD 595 offer a far more balanced sound at half the price.If anyone is serious about a high end headphone purchase the AKG K701 get my highest recommendation.  At least that's what I bought.......Cheers,Gregg

VInitially I was dissapointed as I found the sound sort of "opaque", when compared to my Grado 325's. I am etiher getting accustomed to the sound or they are improving as I use them more. One thing I must say is that if you want to listen to jazz, new age or similar music, the Grado 352's are much better because they deliver a brighter, more detailed sound. If you want to listen to classical music, the Senheiser HD650's are a very good choice. Again, I hope that they will keep improving overtime, as happens with speakers.

VIf you want high quality headphones, look no further. The Sennheiser HD650 Headphones are excellent, I own a pair of Shures EC5 and they are very good but the Sennheiser are a step above, make sure you "burn" these phones in for a good 100-200 hours. You will need a powerful receiver or a headphone amplipher. I tried them with my ipod but the ipod could not "drive" these phones correctly. I have tried various music (rock,jazz,classical) no matter, you will hear wonderful things in the music that you never heard before. Look around you can get them much cheaper than the $400.00 price tag. I paid $298.00 right here in the marketplace!GET THEM !!

VMy review is based on just one day of listening but I've no doubt it only gets better from here.  I use my HD-650's with my iPod.  Before you jump off the edge about this, let me qualify by saying that to run these phones with iPod you MUST invest in a good quality headphone amp, which I did.  Don't let anyone tell you that mp3 sound is 'questionable'.  Certainly not from this perspective.  With the HD-650's I hear things I never heard before on songs I've listened to for years.  I've transferred my CD's to iTunes and with the HD-650's I hear them as never before.  I know $500 seems criminal to charge for headphones, but you can get them cheaper if you shop around and it's worth the time and energy.  I've tried all types of headphones, on-hear phones, in-ear phones, ear buds, etc. and I keep coming back to Sennheiser.  I'll never leave them again!

VEcho most of the positive comments in other reviews. Wonderful sound overall...I find them neutral, which can sound a bit "dead" to some, especially if you're used to "colorful" speakers. They need a fairly powerful headphone amp if you want the best sound - your portable iPod probably isn't up to the task unassisted. Like many fine speakers, I find they needed a good 8-10 hours of listening to fully break in. The semi-open air design lets you hear what's going on around you, which I like but it's not the usual "dead zone" you get from sealed earcups. Finally, I find the fit slightly snug, but not annoyingly so. Great choice overall.

VThese are great! Especially for people who understand the difference between listenng to music as pleasent background noise and experiencing it and being enveloped by it. If you really want to get sound quality that sounds damn close to what it must have sounded like when the musicians recorded it these headphones wll give you that experience amd for the price of a not particularly fancy pair of speakers they a great bargain in my opinion.I have owned mine for 3 years now ad they have become one of my most treasured posessionsa.There is ONE thing that is not good about these headphones however. The headphone cable Sennheiser supplies with them is CRAP. There is a gentlemn who custom-makes his own Sennheiser headphone cables  (called "Red Dragon")which improve the sound of these headphones immesly. I was surprised at the difference and the true aural bliss that the HD-650s combined with the custom-made cable provide.  So to get full milage out of these beauties you would be wise to buy a better cable which raises the price a  bit but if you really love your music and want to experience every nuance of it I think it is a bargain and a purchase you are not likely to ever regret.

VI agree with a prior review where it was stated that "these headphones are great, but no religious experience."But dag they do sound nice. Very mellow, very smooth. You will listen to music on the top volume because they are really smooth. Unfortunately your music might start to sound a little sleepy. I like the beyer 880 esp if you have EQ control because they are much comfier, look cooler, and are lighter.They both are awsome though. Go with the beyers however for price and the reasons I mentioned.

VI'm not going to go on and on about my background and qualifications of merit for you to value my opinion, so just take it for what it's worth....  every red cent!It really is true, with all other headphones you are a spectator, a mere observer of the music.  With the HD650 you are right in the middle, and it is right in the middle of you, with amazing detail in spatial separation, even distance.Go ahead, get a blanket and get ready for the chills you will get from your favorite tracks, again and again... just amazing.No other compares to the quality of sound on this set, well suited for any genre music or type of recorded work.The other components in your system will be the weak link in the chain, so the better they are, the more you will get out of this set.  I don't think you don't need to go run out and buy amps or other stuff immediately.... relax and enjoy them.  The sandisk player is great with these (with eq) and the higher output mp3 players like Cowan sound incredible.  You won't really be happy listening to mp3's unless really high quality, so if mp3 is your media, make sure to burn your tracks from cd whenver possible.

p2114

VI am not an audiophile and so perhaps my perspective is somewhat primitive. I have to qualify by saying that I have a fairly good sound system to the tune of maybe 5K.  My first reaction to these speakers especially after reading all the rave reviews from experts was, "that's it?"  To my untrained ears it sounded veiled, distant and indistinct.  I did not feel like I was "in the audience" as some described.  I allowed for the break-in period, upgraded the cable to Cardas and bought an X-Can V3 headphone amp, and now I have to say that the veil was lifted and the sound is superb, though it still does not compare to a higher end speaker system.  I recommend the 650's but not without the upgrades which brought the total tab to over 1K.  So if the price tag seems reasonable I would highly recommend it.  I would give it a 4.5 if that was possible, but in my feeble ears, the sound was not a religious experience as expected from other reviews.  But I can settle for just excellent.

Vthe HD650 is artificially-colored
p2120
sg5
VHere's a quote from the Sennheiser HD650 owner's manual:  "With the HD650, Sennheiser has followed the changes in the listening habits of music-lovers and the way in which they experience sound.  In spite of all purism and the highest demands on precise sound reproduction, a slight change in listening behaviour is detectable.  Today many music-lovers want to feel the sound more instead of plainly analysing it."What they're admitting is that they have artificially flavored the HD650 with extra bass, beyond what is in any original recording.Please note that this doesn't make the HD650s a bad headphone.  They're not, they're great headphones, since they're related to the far less-colored HD600s and HD580's.But unless you're a bass-freak, you may want to steer clear of the HD650's.  The extra bass muddies up the midrange and treble.  I've owned the Stax Classic electrostats and have owned the 580s, the 580 Jubilees, and the 650s, and vastly prefer the value-laden 580s or else the 600s.This is one area where spending more money moves you backwards, not forwards.

p2126
sg5
VYes, there may be technical reasons to go with a studio monitoring set of headphones if you're going to be editing sound, but for listening and pleasure of wear, comfort, and all around improvement over previous Sennheiser HD's I love this set.  I have had it on for about 24 hours and have to force myself to take them off to greet people and talk at breakfast--YES ALL NIGHT LISTENING and hearing my digital music anew.  My HD600 and other HD's before were fine, but this has quality I don't mind paying the hefty price for.  The bass is profound.  I am not going to argue that technicians might find it colored...at some frequencies, but I am not a technician, but a person who listens to music for pleasure, and my health.  HEALTH!! YES!! Music therapy!!!  And these are better than analysis or shock therapy any day!  I also have tinnitus and it takes special quality to pierce the constant internal noise in my head and this set seems to allow the hiss of my tinnitus to come from outside my head while the music gets inside my head (and a big head HD650 makes too!)  I also was on a rifle team in the old days when we didn't even wear earplugs and for three years I shot a rifle 300 times a day.  I find the HD650 pitches the sound into my right ear in a more excellent manner than any other device for listening I have used.I have bunches of ear pods, and iPod plug in phones, and other earphone and headphones, but I will not soon put these down.  HD650's to me are exactly what I was looking for.  HOnestly, I thought I'd have to pay closer to $500 to get this quality.For technical reasons, I suggest you listen in a headset before you purchase them if you are wanting to engineer sound...the bass can be too revealing at lower end...but why not?  Of course most vendors let you return them in under 30 days.  I think Amazon does.  What's to loose, try your ears in these headsets is my advice.I love them.  I don't want to take them off.  They are so comfortable I forget they are on.What else would I like on them?  Expresso machine and maybe some low fat cheescake balls from Sonic dipped in straberry sauce!Oh, Tibetan chants, Gregorian Chant, in Cathedran music, and voice are fabulous.  I can hear the individual hairs in my ears responding to individual waves!  This is specific and sort of magnified listening.  5 stars.Maybe one quick story about the HD650's:  I have been listening to a recording entitled CALLING THE LAMA FROM AFAR, and it is Buddhist chant, and fabulous keyboard work mixed and really is inspirational for those of us who like that sort of thing, but I listened to the album last night for the 140th time at least, but the FIRST time on these headphones, and when some of the Tibetan percussion was played, I took the headphones off to see what the new sound in the house was (you can hear your environment some in these open earpieces which is great--ears like noses like to breath too--and anyway, I realized it was the same recording I'd listened to 150 times but now in a new and much more realistic way.  The percussion ring was three feet behind my left ear off to the back--that's amazing!

p2132
sg5
VThese cans are comfortable, smooth, silky, laid-back, dark, easy on the ears, and easy both on older analog and early digital-glare ridden recordings.  Sure, they kind of fill in some slight gaps and muddy details and are not very neutral for this price range, but it is nice to have one pair of headphones that puts all of the details, good or bad, right in your face and another pair that will make even lesser recordings sound good.  Such a thing is the HD650.  I also have the AKG k701 which is big on detail, to the point that, especially with poor recordings, my ears get fatigued quickly.  Also, some music that's recorded well enough just sounds more flat and lifeless on the k701s, because the HD650s add that extra little bit of lusciousness, without excessive distortion.  With other audiophile headphones, many recordings will sound bad.  With the HD650s, almost all of them will still at least be listenable, even though the better recordings may sound better on other headphones like the k701.  Because of this, they are indispensable.  For those looking for detail, weather or not it will make some recordings nearly unbearable, try k701.

VMy review should end there.  But for those who need to know more, here's my take.  My head-amp is a Musical Fidelity XCan-V3 and I use the Cardas replacement cable.  I also own Sennheiser HD600s, AKG K701s and Beyerdynamic DT880s.  Each has its special qualities, and all are superb.  I listen mainly to classical music, so let's talk concert halls.  The Sennheisers are like a "warm" 19th century hall: think Symphony Hall in Boston or the "old" (before the 90s refurbishment) Carnegie Hall.  (The AKGs and Beyerdynamic phones are like a 20th century hall and are "airy" and exciting.  In fact, the Beyerdynamic phones, to my ears, emphasize sibilants but are otherwise superb. The AKGs "throw the best soundstage" and their presentation almost seems as if it is coming from somewhere outside of my head, which is very unusual for a headphone and quite beguiling. If forced to choose, I'd probably narrow it down to the HD650s and the K701s.) As for any differences between the two Sennheisers, I prefer the HD650s.  My HD600s are about 5 years old (I don't think I've put in more than 500 hours with them, though) and they sound slightly "grainy" compared to the HD650s.  The HD650s respond to transients faster and are thereofore somewhat clearer and more involving, to my ears.  Again, all of this is very subjective, but I was just listening (through the HD650s) to the new Abbado recording of Mozart's "Zauberflote" and I have never heard a celesta sound so beautiful and ethereal.  But be forewarned: No matter what anyone says (and several professional reviewers claim that they are quite comfortable), the HD650s are a far tighter fit than the HD600s. They grasp the sides of my head with some force, but this becomes less acute after a few moments. I can also somewhat alleviate the pressure by pushing outward on the earcups from time to time and by adjusting the rake angle of the earcups so they they are angled more to the back of my head than to the front.  I strongly recommend that you try them on for comfort before buying.  (In contrast, the Beyerdynamic phones are extremely comfortable on my head, even more comfortable than the HD600s, and are just about the most comfortable "high-end" phones out there that I have tried, but the sibilant emphasis issue is important to me.)  Remember these are headphones.  First, if you're uncomfortable wearing them, they're likely to stay unused; and second, they may likely sound different to you than they do to me because our ears are shaped differently.  It is very important to listen to headphones before you buy.

VFirst of all, I recently discovered the joys of listening to Sennheiser's headphones. They have this sweet warmth to them that just can't be found in many headphones. Of course, there are other high end headphone/in ear monitor manufacturers out there such as Grado, Etymotic, Shure, and Ultimate Ears. But for headphones, though, Sennheiser is simply amazing. The HD650s, being Sennheiser's flagship headphone, must be incredible. Are they? One hundred percent YES! I listened to these at my audiophile friend's house with the Xcan v3 headphone amp, cardas cable upgrade, and tube buffer. I was dumbfounded. These babies produced such a succulent, sweet, and sexy sound. The highs, mids, and even the natural bass amazed me. They were designed to have a laid back sound for classical music. So, naturally, when I tested them, my friend put on some classical music. I thought that I was in heaven! After about 20 minutes or so when he removed them from my head, I felt a bit angry in a "Hey man, that's not cool" sort of way. They sound amazing amped up, but they also sound fine unamped. I am currently saving up to buy either the Sennheiser HD580s or the HD595s (I haven't decided yet). If you have the cash, go for it!

VThese are excellent headphones but understand that these are "open" headphones meaning they let outside sound in. For live recording they are totally unacceptable.  Headphones are comfortable and they sound fine, but if you're wanting to block outside noise, these are NOT the headphones for you.  For live recording (closed headphones) the best Sennheiser has to offer, I believe, is the much cheaper HD280s which aren't in the same league as these.  I'm disappointed Sennheiser doesn't have a "pro" closed headphone.

VNOT THE BEST CHOICE FOR CLASSICAL
p2159
sg5
VCOMFORT: (Grade, B). The earcups are relatively deep, but not deep enough for ultimate comfort. Even after years of use, they don't let me forget that I have headphones on. On the other hand, the 650 feels much better than headphones with shallow cups that squash your ears (and make them sweat). The velour earpads can be replaced, which is good because they do wear down and attract dust. The ultra-soft, velvetlike velour is much better than pleather.BUILD QUALITY: (Grade A-). The interior of the padded bridge is made of a hard, flexible metal that won't be cracking or breaking any time soon. The plastic bridge will break if you stretch it too much, so if you want to make the 650 less tight adjust the flexible metal NOT the plastic. The phones are sturdy without being heavy. After dropping them hard three or four times, they finally did require repairing, though. (One of the drivers got dislodged.) Still, these are very sturdy phones and don't feel cheap.SOUND: (Grade, A-) Does the 650 have a "dark veil," as is often claimed? The 650 user's guide says: "In spite of all purism and the highest demands on precise sound reproduction . . . [t]oday many music-lovers want to feel the sound more instead of plainly analyzing it. The HD now captivates your senses where you used to be a mere observer. It allows total submersion into an ocean of music." I take this to mean that the main difference between the 650 and its HD predecessor is that it favors balance over precision. Some music tends to sound too bright (i.e., bass-impoverished) on headphones, so maybe Sennheiser tried to balance things by reinforcing the low end. Some people claim there is no dark veil, but then why does Sennheiser say "in spite of all purism"? It seems to me that Sennheiser is admitting that the 650 isn't neutral. The sound signature is warm, slightly dark, silky-smooth, and very easy on the ears. (I can listen to them for hours with no hearing fatigue.) However, when I upgraded my headphone amplifier to the Lehmannaudio Black Cube Linear, the 650 did become less dark. On the best recordings I own (in terms of sonics, not performance), Lookin' for Love and Live in Tokyo, there is a clarity that verges on the miraculous. Maybe the "there is no dark veil" crowd is right after all? And yet it sounds like the treble is rolled off, which is one of the reasons why the 650 is not ideal for classical in my opinion. It is almost always with classical music that I perceive the dark veil. In extreme cases, the dark warm sound turns into congested sound. As for the low frequencies: I find the bass satisfying, but it's not the deepest bass I've heard on headphones.TO AMP OR NOT TO AMP:  As long as you have a high-end home system with a good headphone jack (and a good recording), these phones sound pretty good. According to popular observation, however, the 650 should be "juiced up." So I got a headphone amp. Did it make a difference? Sure did. Amping enlivens, brightens, and tightens the sound. Originally, I used a Headroom Micro Amp, which was pretty good. However, eventually I upgraded to the Lehmann and it made a noticeable difference.WHAT SOUNDS GOOD ON THESE PHONES AND WHAT DOESN'T: These headphones can be finicky, but they are not altogether unforgiving. In general, however, the 650 sounds good OR bad depending on the quality of the recording, They are best judged on the basis of state-of-the-art recordings. You might listen to a favorite piece of music and be disappointed with it on the 650 (I know I was). You will be tempted to blame the headphones, but the fault will likely be in the recording. Pop and rock that has been well recorded sounds mindbogglingly good on the 650. Classical music lovers might want to take a look at the Sennheiser HD800. The latter's angled drivers create a better orchestral soundstage. Speaking of soundstage . . .SOUNDSTAGE: For symphonic music, the 650's soundstage is just too narrow in my opinion. It sounds like the orchestra is being pushed in from the sides. Upgrading my amp added a greater sense of depth (given the right recording you WILL get a 3-D soundstage), but not much was added in terms of horizontal space. Classical music doesn't envelope you on the 650 as it does with other headphones. A nice thing about the soundstage, though, is that somtimes instruments and voices sound like they are behind me, a nice effect when it happens. There is also no lack of vertical space.Another criticism of these phones is that they put you at a distance from the music, "a few rows back," but I find that it largely depends on the recording. For example, listening to Lookin' for Love, Marlena Shaw's voice could hardly be closer. Very often, these headphones puts things right in the center of my head. But they are also good at placing instruments some distance away. It all depends on how the music was recorded.BREAK-IN TIME: What is this stuff about "burning the phones in"? Is there any truth to it? I asked somebody at the HeadRoom company, which deals specifically with headphones and headphone gear. He said yes, the diaphragm has to loosen up a little to sound its best. Lesson: don't judge the 650s overnight. Give them a little time.LEAKY: Thanks to the wide open grills, these are the leaky phones. They are not to be worn if you need to keep noise in or out.CARDAS CABLE: You can replace the factory cable that comes with the 650 (just pull out the old and plug in the new). I chose to upgrade to the Cardas. Is the difference between the stock and Cardas cables that huge? The Cardas brightens the sound and adds clarity, but it is more unwieldy than the factory cable, which is lighter and more supple, so if you move around a lot while listening to your headphones save yourself some money and stick with the stock cable. The Cardas always seems to be in my way when I move around. I keep stepping on it, and it has caused the phones to drop to the floor several times. I find contact noise not to be a problem, although another reviewer complained abou that. The Cardas is thick and gray. Its color-coded (black/red) wires make it lootk like something from workshop: unpretentious and functional. But if you don't mind the unwieldiness or barebonesness of the Cardas and don't expect to move around a lot, I do suggest ugrading because it brightens up the sound. (I have been told that it's just the placebo effect, but I find that hard to believe.)BOTTOM LINE: (Final Grade, A-). The 650 doesn't make me hate my speakers, but it's still an excellent choice for people who are serious about their music. To really hear what the 650 is capable of, be prepared to spend more on the amp than on the actual headphones. Depending on what I'm listening to, I find that sometimes these phones can be somewhat uninvolving and analytical. This is especially true when they are unamped (or improperly amped). Properly amped, however, they take on a speed and energy that makes them quite involving. Particularly considering their excellent price (compared to other high quality headphones), these are a great buy.WARNING: After mailing my headphones to Sennheiser for repair, I was called and told there was a problem because they were not purchased from an authorized dealer. I purchased them brand new here at Amazon from ELECTRONICA DIRECT, a seller often featured right on the product page. Sennheiser told me that I probably purchased stolen phones. Shoppers who want the warranty honored SHOULD NOT BUY FROM ELECTRONICA DIRECT or any unauthorized dealer. Verify that the seller you are buying from is recognized by Sennheiser. Sennheiser was finally kind enough to repair (actually they replaced) the phones after I complained up the chain, but it was a hassle.

VThere's nothing better than sitting in your favorite easy chair with these headphones in the dark, stone cold drunk, and listening to Sisqo's "Thong Song" on repeat, over an over. These headphones reveal more details, so sounds from recordings are now reproduced that were once unnoticed, like the missing period after the Dr on a Dr Pepper can.  I've had these cans for a couple years from now, so I can speak from experience, much like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it. I mean the sound is fantastic.  I checked out Halloween sound effects Vol 2 from the library, and the whole CD had an eerie, surreal quality, just like when you're on vacation in another city and Jeopardy comes on at 7 p.m. instead of 7:30. Unfortunately, while listening to these headphones, outside noise comes in.  That reminds me of a time while listening to the Thong Song, my cat Brutus knocked over a potted plant with his tail, which completely smashed on impact after colliding head-on with one of my indoor garden gnomes.  I was so angry I jumped straight up, just like a maggot when you fry it in hot grease. What was I talking about again? Oh yeah, can't recommend these headphones enough.

V1. They sound great without an amp.2. they sound much better with an amp.3. they feel like wearing a "pillow" on your head4. Soundstage is excellent, a bit laid back5. There is less volume in the treble region, this allows the music to last longer without wearing out your ears.6. If you remove the foam over the drivers the sound becomes a bit clearer and brighter, however the soundstage changes and for me it sounded a bit out of balence when i did that.7. there are after market cables that cost the same as the headphone itself, i cannot say if the cable actually make it sound better.8. Other great headphones: KGS K 701, Grado RS-1, Beyer DT 880. however, it is worth noting that the Sennheiser cost less than all of these.

VI did much research on headphones and cables and headphone amps to drive them.I had to do all this on a small budget.I got the HD 650  and the Cardas cable upgrade 15' and took a giant leap and got the Creek 21se headphone amp and the Audioquest King Cobra RCA and hooked it up to the CA Azur 640c v1 CD player and replaced it's stock cord with the Audioquest NRG-2 power cord and removed it's black RF ferrite noise stopper.Also got the Monster SW200 surge protector with stage 1 clean power circuitry to plug the CD player and the amp in to.Also added three model 2 vibrapods for CD player.Next it takes quite a long time before I could reap the benifits of these combinations.In other words there is a break in period for most of these purchuses.After playing a CD for an extended period of time of about 80 hours I've reached what what everybodys been raving about; the ultimate nirvana.It's just miraculous the sound quality that comes though these set of headphones.You don't know what you missing just listening though  speakers.These headphones are far more engaging.It's worth noting that if you not able to make some of these sacrifices you should look at another headphone.It takes alot of power to drive these headphones and nothing short of an amp just won't do.When all is said and done it set me back about$1400.With this large investment I'm thrilled to have years of high quality headphone listening.Update:Four months later:Incredible,Extraordinary,Phenomenal.

VAs a lover of classical music I am a confirmed headphone listener. No set of speakers will offer the same amount of detail, most living rooms will add acoustic distortions, and many of us are not lucky enough to be able to play Mahler or Shostakovich at full power on a daily basis without getting into trouble with the neighbours.For years I have been very happy with the Sony CD1700, an excellent headphone which is my point of reference for evaluating the HD650. The rest of my hifi set-up consists of a Marantz cd7300 CD player, PM7200 amplifier, and Musical Fidelity X-Can v3 headphone amplifier (a mandatory commodity if you intend to spend serious money on a headphone like this one). Also, I invested in the Cardas replacement cable for the HD650.It is often said phones like this one need a 'break in' period. I used to regard this merely as snobbish audiophile technobabble - but found it to be actually true. Initially, I was less than pleased with the sound of the HD650, to put it mildly. Mid-range, mezzoforte strings (which make up a VERY large part of orchestral music!) sounded grey and weirdly disembodied. Stereo separation was exaggerated while the middle part of the soundstage seemed empty. Compared to the breezy, open sound of the Sony, the Sennheiser seemed compressed and less immediately involving.Things were not helped by the fact that the wearing comfort of these cans is markedly inferior to that of the Sony. The HD650 has fairly small shells that are not ideal if your ears aren't quite that small. Also, they are clamped against the head rather tightly, which is not entirely pleasant. The Sony, by contrast, simply lets you forget you are wearing it.But then, after about 50 hours of listening, things had changed rather much. Not with regard to the wearing comfort, obviously, though you do get used to the way the HD650 feels; - but soundwise. The sound had opened up completely; not only is it now as fresh and involving as that of the Sony, it is clearly superior. Everything is incredibly focused, tightly in place, resulting in a very clean sound picture. The bass is far superior to the Sony, and is noticeably warmer. Bass drum strokes or double bass pizzicati sound nothing short of sensational. Instrumental colours are marvellously defined throughout the orchestral ranges. The level of detail is quite simply stunning. I am not exagerrating when I say that I've heard new things in nearly every disc I played until now (in an old-time favourite, Bernstein's DG recording of Stravinsky's Les Noces, I was bowled over by the precision with which the four piano's, which had always sounded as a single instrument to me, were individually separated). Interestingly, a sense of underlying energy is retained even in the softest passages; I notice that with this headphone large scale symphonic works may sound completely satisfying even when played at fairly low volume.All in all, I am now extremely pleased with this acquisition. It is hard to imagine that headphone sound can be much better. Listening to a well-recorded disc (and beware! these cans will mercilessly reveal which discs aren't so well recorded) you can easily imagine yourself to be sitting in the concert hall.As a postscript: I am less sure about the cable issue. Many HD650 owners advise the replacement of Sennheiser's stock cable with a Cardas cable. Now, I always have the feeling that in these more esoteric regions of audiophilia, there is somewhere a point where actual sound improvements become extremely minimal, and myth or even madness set in. Yet, as I was splurging anyway, for once I went the whole hog and bought myself the Cardas cable, too. Frankly; you don't really need it. I will not go so far as to say it doesn't make a difference; it does. There is, at times, an extra sparkle to the sound. But it certainly is not a prerequisite to fully enjoy the wonders of the HD650 (quite apart from the fact that the Cardas cable is a hideously ugly thing to behold, makes the phones far more cumbersome to wear, and unlike the thinner, more supple stock cable causes contact noise).

VSennheiser = Pure Audio Bliss
p2195

VI originally was educated about the audio beauty of Sennheiser headphones over 5 years ago, having only experienced the most basic of Sony headphones that you would get at a local electronics store. I was under the assumption that headphones are headphones, what could possibly be different about a pair with a name I had never heard of versus a pair made by an electronic giant like Sony? As I slipped the Sennheisers on my ears, I never looked back.Ignorance was NOT bliss in this case.Soon after I got to experience what music is supposed to sound like, I quickly purchased a pair of Sennheiser headphones of my own and have enjoyed them ever since. From their cool, velvety feel to the crispness of audio clarity, I challenge anyone to find a headphone manufacturer that exceed Sennheiser.My Sennheisers have given me hours upon hours of sonic joy and I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you give them a chance. Are Sennheiser headphones more expensive? Are Mercedes more expensive? I am sure if you ask a Mercedes owner to give up their keys for a Ford they would laugh at your just as quickly as I would if someone wanted to replace my Sennheiser headphones with a Sony pair from Best Buy.You will NOT be disappointed.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION

VAs others have said, these are the best headphones for the money and in many people's opinion, as well as my own, the best headphone.  They say that these need a burn-in period (60 hours or so) but these sound great and are extremely comfortable right of the box.  Of course, they truly do get better as you use them though.  For those who want the quality but don't like the idea of spending hundreds on an amplifier, Headroom ([...]) has their own brand of cheap, portable headphone amps that work great (they're similar in size to an iPod - a bit taller and wider).  A also took a risk of buying a $150 Cardas cable to replace the one that comes with the 650s.  I immediately felt guilty and maybe crazy for buying such an expensive cable, but then I plugged it in.  The Cardas cable is the most amazing cable I've ever owned.  The instant improvement of sound quality, as great as the 650s sound, was dramatic.  So for the best headphone grab a pair of the HD650s and for the true audiophile willing to drop the cash, pick up a Cardas cable too.

p2205

VThe HD650 is a superb headphone.  Unfortunately,someone complain about quality of sound.However, I guess that those people do not know about "break-in"(or "burn-in") period.Almost all the headphones do not sound as good as a well used pair when you are listening to music with a headphone for the first time after you bought.In a word, headphones must be "electrically" adapted by playing music for total of hours in order to sound to the intended best state.Break-in period needed for producing the best sound depnds on a headphone.I guess HD650 needs break-in period of over 100 hours.What you need to do for that is to just listene to music you like.After that period, you will be suprised by remarkable quality of sound produced by HD650! If you use a good CD player and a headphone amp, the sound quality would be more impressive!Anyway, enjoy outstanding HD650!!

VSo headphone.com calls them "simply the world's best headphone." I can't speak for the Grado or AKG contenders. I can say that they're better than my Sennheiser 590's, and that is shocking. Which leads me to my first (and probably most important) point about this headphone. They cost a lot. A whole lot. Sennheiser has many units, including the 580, 590, 595, 600, and 650 (among many others), which could be construed as 'reference' quality. You'll spend about half as much on one of the 5xx models as you will on the 650. So if you were to ask me whether the 650 is *twice as good* (that is to say, it costs more in proportion to its increased capability), I'll tell you no, probably not. I might just not buy them, given the decision again. Perhaps if the price came down a bit. At any rate, they are really a superb headphone. The sound is really incredible. You never really realize what you're missing in a recording until you've heard it through a set like this. You can hear the saliva in the back of a vocalist's throat. I'm not kidding. Everything is reproduced clearly, accurately, crisply, and I've yet to find any recording (Vocal, Classical, Electronic, etc) that can tax them. I suppose I'll stop trying to some day, but it's just wonderful to hear the headphones doing their job. The construction is far more solid than the 590's are. Where there is plastic on the 590, you see metal and (no kidding) Kevlar. They are more attractive. They are also quite a bit heavier. They have a 1/4" connector instead of the more customary 1/8" mini connector -- this doesn't particularly bother me, I'll get to it in a minute. Like the 590, they are an open headphone. That is, they are not "sealed" or "isolated". Sound from around you will seep in, and it is possible for others to hear what you are listening to (somewhat). They are less comfortable. My guess is because of the metal band, the "spring" mechanism that keeps them round is tighter than the 590's, and it pinches. It really feels as though somebody is compressing your head. The ear cups are fine. They are almost identical to the 590's, but a little larger. So, you probably wouldn't be here if you didn't know you needed an amplifier for these headphones (this is where the 1/4" plug comes in). However, it bears mentioning that you should not even consider buying these cans without first buying a capable amplifier. The PPA/PIMETA amps are cheapish, and Headphone.com has some that will work fine. To demonstrate this, you'll need another headphone and the 650. Connect the other headphone to your amplifier. Listen at a comfortable level. Then, relax a second, and attach the 650. The first thing you should notice is that the white noise is gone. The second thing -- other than the sound quality, of course -- is that it is much quieter. These cans need a lot of power to drive them effectively. Look at their specifications and you will understand (300 ohms of impedance!). Buy em if you want the best and aren't afraid to spend the $$. Buy the 590's or 595's if what you need is a stellar headphone and you don't want to spend too much. Use the extra money to buy yourself an amp. You'll need it.

VMy expectation of the 650 was rather great, with it's 0.05%, 10-39500 and ratings on headphone.com ... the problem is that they are drastically colored. Sennheiser states that these cans were developed with the way music listeners listen to their music today. That's cute, but to do this they have colored all the audio ranges with a "creamy" sound that dulls all the details. All wave lengths are dropped so you get artificial bass in all spectums leaving your not-so-average-music-listener feeling like you are listening to great music but it's not the best.I just finished an extensive review the another serious audio listener and engineer and we both agree that there needs to be more advertizement on these cans to let you know that they are pre-toned for your average listening pleasure. There's no way I would do mix-downs or proof a final track with the 650s ... they are just not accurate enough.The best cans out there are still the HD 600s. They're numbers are slightly lower than the 650s but it's not going to cause you grief with colorization. You can get to 10 with 650s and 12 with 600s in the lows, but because of the colorization and everything begin in the lower bracket you'll wish they produced the 650s with the extra low and no colorization.650s are a disappointment. When you train your ear to hear everything being played and recorded and want the most accurate listening that you can you'll want the 600s.

VThese headphones produce a soft, lush and beautiful sound.  I have several other headphones including Grado and Bose and these are much better.  The headphones in my opinion deserve a good headphone amplifier to get the most out of them.  And with a headphone amp the sound is like a sound system costing thousands.The headphones are not light.  The headband adjusts and the earpads are velour and very comfortable.  I do, however, feel the weight of the headphones but nonetheless can wear them for extended periods.  The quality of the sound makes me not want to take them off.  I also find myself listening to music at a lower volume because the quality of the sound is so good that I don't need higher volume to find that I am immersed in the music.This product is expensive and worth the price.
