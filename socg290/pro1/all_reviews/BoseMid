VVery comfortable earbuds with great sound
p38
sg5
VThe sound quality and comfort of these earbuds are the best I've been able to find.  The silicone tips are great for running and never get uncomfortable.  The earbuds also come with a clip, which is convenient for clipping to the neck of your shirt to keep the cord from flapping around too much.The only criticism that I have of these is that one earbud typically goes dead after 6-12 months, but I suspect that is from running and wearing it to the gym which causes a little bit of tugging as the cord/phone bounce around in my pocket.  I wouldn't avoid this for that because it seems to happen with all earbuds.

VGreat product but not as durable as you'd think
p56
sg5
VLet me preface this critique by saying that I love these earbuds. That being said, after almost a year of owning this product I have found their durability is not as strong as you might think, since the product is "Built heavy-duty to stand up to your active life."Comparing these earbuds to several other brands that I've spent time with such as the regular apple pods, JayBird, SkullCandy and Sony:The Bose Freestyle Earbuds have the BEST fit, the only pair of earbuds I have EVER owned that stay in, without fail, for the entirety of every workout. To me, this is paramount, more important than style, comfort, and even sound quality.However, there's no real compromise because compared to most other sports-fitness brands (sony and skullcandy's in particular) I find the Bose has a noticeably better sound quality, clearer mediums and the bass doesn't sound overpowered like in the sony's.Compared to the JayBird X (which is the earbuds I switched from) there is a catch-22. The JayBirds, being wireless, are more convenient and (in my opinion) more comfortable HOWEVER the Bose stays in your ear and maintains a seal much more effectively throughout a workout. On top of that, I find that the Bose let's in just the right amount of ambient noise so that I can wear them while on a road and still maintain control of my surroundings. And on the note of sound, I think the Bose and JayBirds have a pretty comparable sound quality, with JayBirds having an edge maybe a little bit when the seal is perfect (but I favor the consistency of Bose).There is one downside I'd like to touch upon; when I bought these earbuds, I took notice in the advert of "Built heavy-duty to stand up to your active life." Since buying them, I've been using them at-least twice a day for workouts, everyday and then throughout the day while I'm at work. I get a lot of use out of them, but have always been careful with them. I have a waterproof case that I carry them in when not in use, I don't use them near water, and dry them off after workouts. My pair still sound great but the microphone and function buttons have space between them, which I believe sweat unavoidably gets into. This has caused my microphone and button "pod" to stop working. They are no longer able to change songs, adjust volume, or speak into. This, of course, is not earth-shattering but for the amount of money I paid ($125 at the time) I would have hoped for a more durably designed and appropriately marketed product.

V6 months after buying these, the wires near the headphones jack broke, and I had to "wiggle it just right" in order to hear anything. A few weeks later, no sound at all. I went to a Bose retailer, and they told me the product I received wasn't even a genuine Bose product, as the serial number in the product was not printed in the way the company officially prints their serial numbers. This product is all scam. Do not buy, or you will likely regret it.

VI've listened to the older model of these headphones and was blown away. However, the set of headphones I received did not perform like a normal Bose product. I have other Bose headphones and Bose speakers and feel that these don't come close to what I was expecting. I'm not sure if Bose as a company just made lower quality headphones or if Amazon is selling 2nd tier products. At this point, I ended up putting these away, seeing as how my standard apple headphones beat the Soundtrue headphones in terms of quality. Absolutely not worth the $80.

Not worth the price.And honestly, the sound is good because it has good bass. But overall, it makes my music and audio in games become kind of "muffled". The sound quality is not balanced. It has good bass but in return, it lowers the other components.Regret buying this.

VGreat earbuds for quiet environment (not exactly for outdoor use due to lack of noise isolation)
p253
sg5
VThese earbuds are great for indoor use. When you are in a quiet room, the sound with the stock no-noise-isolation eartips is very good and balanced; I even turned off bass boost on my mp3 player - bass frequencies are well heard without it. But as soon as you go outside, there's lots of external noise coming through which makes me want to take my noise isolating pair of Sennheiser instead. You can try to fight the noise (to a certain degree) by buying a pair of noise isolating eartips for these earbuds (either from BOSE or from a no-name Chinese vendor), but then the sound balance will be shifted and you'll get more of the boomy one, with less bass clarity. So to me this is a product for a quiet environment - that's where it shines.

With the same cost I believe I could get much better product. I expected much more from Bose.

VI received these as a gift for Christmas and I'm really impressed by the sound quality in these little ear buds.  I've been through a few cheaper ear buds, and have mostly just been using the standard Apple ones because they're not bad and a pair comes with every iPhone upgrade, so I have a ton laying around.  I also have some wooden ones that were about $70 and the quality is pretty good but they don't fit in my ears well.  These Bose ones blow both of those pairs away.  The silicone grips that hold them in your ears fit perfectly and are so comfortable!  The only thing I would change, if anything, is that I wish the cord were a bit thicker.  I'm always afraid if I accidentally tug the headphones too hard that the cord will break.  But the sound quality and the perfect comfortable fit of these makes up for that little complaint quite a bit.

VBest Quality headphones I have ever owned!
p389
sg5
VThese are the best in-ear headphones that I have ever owned. The build quality is superb and the HearStay tips are excellent. I use these headphones with my iPhone 6 Plus, Play Station 4 controller, and various computers and these work absolutely flawlessly. The sound quality is amazing.The box comes with 3 HearStay tips (S, M, L) along with a carrying pouch and a clip. After almost 1.5 years of use, I have seen barely any damage to the tips, headphones, or the wires. The rubber at the bottom of the headphones is starting to disintegrate as shown in picture attached. I also use these headphones when I exercise and run. The headphones stay in my ear and never require any adjustment to keep them there. The HearStay tips do require some cleaning as lint, tiny hair, or earwax may get stuck in them. But cleaning the tips is very easy, just pop off the tips and use a cotton swab or just compressed air to clean the tips and the metal mesh on the headphones. I am very happy with these headphones.

VThe SoundTrue's have a rich, full sound without being too heavy on the bass. They are heavier in the low frequencies than SoundSport Ultra's, though. I had bought a pair of SS Ultra's first but upon listening to them I found the sound to be too thin and emphasizing on the mid's and high's. I use the SoundTrue's to listen to the low freq's so I can transcribe a song's bass line. I am very happy with these in-ear headphones. After returning the Ultra's Amazon refunded my original purchase.

VDon't require a tight seal
p436
sg5
VThese are my new favorite  ear phones. I have purchased so many $100-$200 over the years. What I hate about most of them is that they require you to tightly fit the ear phones into your hears and create a tight seal in order to hear them at their fullest. This tight seal causes a few problems for me. 1) after about 30 minutes, they're irritating and start to hurt; 2) every time the cord rubs on your shirt, you hear it loudly in the ear phones; and 3) you can't hear anything going on around you. So if you're walking down the street, you're completely cut off from surrounding sounds.So a friend of mine suggested that I try these Bose ear phones and he was dead on. They don't require a tight seal but still produce great sound with deep and rich bass. I can wear them for long periods and they never hurt my ears. And since they don't require a tight seal, you can hear what's going on around you.

VI have been looking forward to seeing first hand if these or Bose is "advertisement" or "quality". So if you want an unbiased review, here it is..... I have used OEM and cheap earbuds all my life. The nicer set I would use is the Samsung set that came with my Samsung S5 phone. (Picture attached.) Below you will find my pros and cons list and the my final opinion.Pros-Nice zip up Bose box to keep them stored in. (I do have to ask why it was so big.) I would rather it be closer to the size of the headphones for pocket portability.-They feel nice, come over as well built and look stylish. (Long term and more use may move well built to cons. But for now it is a pro.)-The inline controller works well and just like other smart phone ear buds I have used.-They include a clip to use to assist with keeping them in place during physical use.Cons-Cost. For $115.38 which is the current price, I feel cheated as a customer and wish I went with a different brand.-Sound quality. I realize Bose is not known for a deep bass or a "thump" and rather for a smooth and crystal clear detailed sound, however, these almost seemed to be void of any at all which was disappointing. (And as some others have pointed out, when you have ZERO bass, you should expect nothing less.) I was just hoping for a mix. A little bass but still the crystal clear detailed sound.-None of the ear pieces seemed to be what I needed or maybe could benefit from a better design. The included ear pieces did a fine job of keeping the earbuds in my ears and they did feel very nice and light, however, I got a much fuller, cleaner and more depth full sound by adding slight pressure to my earbud with my fingers. Since I will not be walking around or using them with my fingers putting pressure on the ear buds, I think some investigation needs to be done to get that fuller sound without applying any pressure.Final Opinion.Sorry to say, my $20-30 Samsung OEM earbuds outperformed the BOSE hands down in sound quality. The Bose won hands down in terms of looks, fit and build design. Shame I could not combine the quality I have with Samsung to the design of the Bose. I wish I would have tried other earbuds such as the Audio Technica line up. Took a risk based on reviews and the advertisement of quality and was surely disappointed! Win some lose some.

VSeriously the Best Earbuds in the History or Market of Earbuds!!!
p549
sg5
VLet me tell you, when I say I could go through 20 pair of headphones in two weeks, I definitely mean it. Whether the cords snapped, the wires frayed, the sound cut out, one earbud stopped working, or I just lost them, earbuds and I never got along. I got these Bose Freestyle Earbuds last Christmas, and I could not have asked for a better pair of headphones.I use the earbuds every single day, for hours on end, never yet having one problem. I've treated these earbuds like they were made of gold, never once letting them sit around or get tangled in any way. If I need to stop using them momentarily for whatever reason, I still fold them up neatly and place them back in the case they came with. The case is very handy, as well, because they don't get tangled or damaged while I'm taking them with me every single place I basically ever go.The noise cancellation is of such good quality in these earbuds that there have been days when I don't want to deal with people but also don't want to listen to music, so I will just put the earbuds in my ears and not be listening to anything. I can hardly hear my name being called from the person sitting next to me. The sound quality is amazing, too. I hear beats in songs that I had never heard before, even the oldest songs you can think of. Talking through the microphone also has surprising quality, sometimes I can hear the other person better through the headphones, especially in crowded places.The green and blue matches me to a T. My two favorites colors are lime green and a pretty royal blue, and these couldn't match better.The earbuds are so comfortable that you can forget you even have them in your ears. I can prop my head on my hand, lay on my pillow, lay in awkward positions, it does not matter how the pin drops, these earbuds are the most comfortable pair you will ever put in your ears. They actually come with 3 different sizes sets of ear pieces.Bose is probably the number one music brand in my household, so it was no surprise that Bose was chosen for me for Christmas, but these earbuds go above and beyond of anything I could have ever imagined. I can't even fantasize at having another pair of earbuds for years to come.These are the best quality earbuds I have ever come across, the most comfortable thing one can imagine stuffing into their ear, their sound is fantastic, and they're so durable, even though I haven't tested this aspect because I treat them more like babies than earbuds.Bottom line is, don't even think twice about the price of these earbuds, you'll know the first time you use them what a good decision it was. Maybe even the best decision you'll make for a couple of years. Don't hesitate. If you've thought about these earbuds, I say push the purchase button and pace until they come in because you have no idea what you're missing.

VOrdered these for travel, but ended up using them on a regular basis instead. They function well with my samsung and are great for taking calls when I'm on the go. They are also surprisingly satisfying for the music I listen too. So when my Bose QCs aren't strapped to my head, these ones are in. This was my first time using this style of ear piece which at first was a little combersome getting them in and out of the ear, but I'm glad I went with it because they fit very well, they are not at all uncomfortable, and they can be used for running or exercising too. Overall same amazing quality I expect from Bose and a great functional addition to my lifestyle.

VI bought these to replace my beats in ear headphones and I am soooo happy. I have always used Bose headphones in the past but received a beats headphones from my husband so I used them. I hated the beats headphones because the music quality was poor. After the beats headphones stopped working, I went back to Bose. You can hear the difference! The base is more prominent and the voice is crisper. Not to mention, the Bose in ear actually stays in your ear. I use it to go to the gym and run on the treadmill and it never comes off. I highly recommend this product. I am truly satisfied in every way.

VMost comfortable earbuds you will ever wear
p583
sg5
VComfort:I wear these all day and completely forget they are there. I'm hesitant to call them "in-ear" headphones, as they are closer to some kind of in-ear-on-ear hybrid. They fit ON your inside of your ear is the best way to describe it.Sound Isolation:None at all. It's like there's nothing in your ears. Personally, I like this feature because It allows someone to say something to me without having to rip out my earbuds and go "what?" although walking past traffic or construction completely drowns out whatever you're listening to unless you crank the volume to like 3x normal.Sound Quality:Perhaps I've been spoiled by my Audio Technica ATH-m40x cans, but the frequency response noticeably slopes down when you get into anything over 12 kHz drops off to 0 around 18 kHz. This made for an unacceptably warm sound for any kind of critical listening or professional music work. "Crisp highs" is not quite accurate. I was able to EQ it to a perfectly acceptable sound quality. The rest of the range is fairly balanced, and despite not fitting completely inside your ear, the bass is perfect (excellent for EDM).Build Quality:I accidentally (tragically) dropped one of the earbuds in a bowl of ramen and now the bass is quite muted in one ear. These are advertised as "water resistant", but when I dropped them they weren't even half submerged, yet the sound was affected. Otherwise, the wires are very sturdy, with excellent flexy things where the wire goes into the earbud and the jack (I don't know what they are called, but they are better than many other earbuds I've tried). Also, the cord is a little short. I'm almost 6 feet tall, and when I run the cord under my sweatshirt into my ipod in my pocket, I can only lift my ipod to about stomach-level.OVERALL:The amazing comfort more than makes up for any qualms I have with the lack of trebel response. If these were 60$ instead of 100$, I would absolutely recommend these to anyone looking for unmatched comfort and acceptable sound for casual listening, but as they are a bit pricey I would only recommend these to someone who will take very good care of them (expensive to replace) and doesn't mind a bit of EQ-ing.

The product was under warranty still and they shipped me a new pair of headphones within 7-10 days.  The customer service people were knowledgeable and friendly.  The overall process was so easy.  I very rarely write reviews but my experience with their customer service was so awesome that I had to write a review.

VThese are excellent headphones.I've used them every single day last year. The isolate sounds extremely well. Great to work out or even just walk around in. I've worked out plenty of times in these headphones and they produce great sound. I usually play basketball and these stay in your ear as you run, dribble, shoot, and drive. The quality of the phones have not seem to have worn down.Almost 2 years later, these perform as good as they did when I first got them.

p707
sg5
VI've had a pair of these for a couple of months now and I'm very pleased. I had a hard time deciding on whether to get these or the Shure SE215 (for roughly the same price). I eventually decided on these because they had better reviews. The sound quality is very good. I've heard better, but for the price, they fit. You can easily distinguish each instrument in every song thanks to the clarity too. As for build quality they're pretty sturdy. I've dropped them a few times and jammed them into my pockets hundreds of times and they look brand new. Heck, I even listen to them in the shower sometimes and they're still fine (not recommended). The gummy ear piece fits really well in my ear and is pretty snug. You can tell these were meant for athletes. This leads me to my first complaint though. After a few hours of listening the top piece that goes in your ear does start to hurt but if you are just using them for two hours or less you'll be fine. Also, these are not sound isolating at all. Not only can you hear everything around you but if your music is loud enough someone can easily hear what you're listening to.  All in all, good pair. For the price I expected a bit more, well... shock (it is Bose after all) but I'm not disappointed either. If you'd rather spend less money and get the same sound quality pick up a pair of Skullcandy Full Metal Jackets. They're around $40 and sound just as good.

VThe Best Earbuds for Anything
p737
sg5
VI was gifted these Earbuds for my birthday. 1.5 years later, they still sound and look great! I have lost them, washed them, and done every sort of activity using The Bose Freestyle Earbuds, but they refuse to break. The only wear is a slight decrease in the sharpness of the audio and slight paint peeling on the earbuds' detailing. The earbuds never come out of my ears, and are awesome for exercise or studying. The only downside for a typical user, could possibly be that these earbuds let in all outside noise. Overall, having payed $130.00 for these, I am extremely satisfied. It seems that these earbuds have been now discontinued for a newer model, but that model is known for wire splits and frays. Now that these can be bought for $60.00, I would definitely pick them up. Overall 10/10, I have no complaints.

p801
sg5
VSound quality was ok nothing special I dished out 100 bucks because I wanted something with quality sound but that is also durable. The wire is just like any other heap hone wire which seems foolish to me. Big problem with headphones is wires rip. That's pretty much the main reason you get new ones. You'd expect them to protect the wire with a bit more padding but nope. At this rate these 100$ ear buds will need to replaced just as often as 20$ ones. I've had skull candy titans for a long time the sound quality is pretty much even with the bose sounding a little better depending on the music.

When I went back to my Apple headset at start of buttons failing, I realize the quality was not much different.  Originally, I was blown away by the sound when I first put them on, but I guess the sound quality degraded as well.Hate to bash Bose as I love their products and own a Soundlink 3 that I love and people admire.These In ear headphones., I do not recommend.  Do not live up to the long lasting quality I expect for Bose.  Money wasted. Very frustrating.

VHeadphone plug snapped on two pairs
p902
sg5
VPurchased with intended use for my phone while lifting weights and talking hands free. My first pair snapped within a week of purchase while my phone was in my pocket. After taking precautions to avoid any sort of mishandling, the plug on my second pair snapped after a month. The plug itself appears to be long and durable but because of the long build of the plug, any sort of tension at the base can place a surprising amount of pressure on tips of the plug interface.Aside from being extremely frusturated with the amount of money I've dumped into these, the sound quality of these headphones are outstanding and sit comfortably secure in my ears. The clips on the headphones are useful for keeping the cord secure and to avoid the "tug feeling" from your ears. The bass carries through better than all other in ear headphones I've tried and would be extremely satisfied with the product if it were not for the poor build of the headphone plug.

VI have a serious fear of purchasing electronics of any sort for myself, and this includes earbuds. Often times I am afraid I haven't done enough research and am throwing money at something not worth my hard earned paycheck... That being said, I am beyond in love with these headphones. They're cute and the sound quality is AMAZING. I have been living under a rock as far as sound is concerned before snatching these earbuds up. Well worth every penny- the iphone integration is really nice and the little holder that comes along with them is perfect for storage.

p944

VThese are great headphones, but Bose should really change the tips to the StayHear version which also fits these phones.  The new tips make all the difference in the world, taking these from an adequate headphone to an exceptional isolation headphone in just one step.  The isolation tips are comfortable to wear and sleep in and make the sound a much nicer crisper tone, but with great bass.I would buy these again, but at first chance would replace the tips with Stay Hear tips. 4-Stars for these since I had to replace the tips for better performance.

The sound is drastically better than your normal $20 earbuds and you can still here outside noise, which is good for me because I wear them running. If you're looking for high-quality earbuds that look good and won't hurt your ears after extending periods of listening, these are a great choice.

VIf you are looking for headphones that stay in your ear while you are doing any physical activity. Then these are 100% for you. My biggest gripe with them is the sound is so low. Other reviewers warned me but I thought it was an exaggeration. If you wear this to a gym that plays loud music you will barely be able to hear your music. If you're running outside cool go for it.ProsGreat Fit ( These will not come out your ear)ConsVery low volume ( and cancels 0 outside noise)Overpriced ( I honestly think these should be $50 Max)Overall I wouldn't recommend them to anyone unless you plan to use them in a quieter setting.

VI've owned this pair of earphones for over a year now, and just purchased a second pair (one for at home, and another on the go). I was tempted to upgrade to the Bose Noise Cancellation version 20i (which I gifted to my husband and he loves), but decided to stick with the set that works for me. Maybe if Bose comes out with a really good wireless, bluetooth headset with good battery life, I'd love to get one of those (hint hint). Anyway, from a true Bose fan who hasn't received any free products for review (though wouldn't mind that for Bose), I love, love, love this headset!In terms of earbuds -- I love this design, but I find that earbud preference really depends on the individual. There are some folks who like the tiny buds (like the Apple ones) that go all the way in, but I find my ears get irritated after those. I also like the style of headset that hooks over the ear so the headset doesn't fall out, but there's usually some sound loss, so I think this earbud design is the perfect in-between.

VI would give these zero stars, but the system does not allow it. I could not be more unhappy about these - they are shaped so awkwardly that none of the three sizes actually fit in my ear. They kept popping out and even when sitting still, the design is so ill conceived that they had to be on the highest volume in order to hear what was playing. Total waste of money. My cheap Skull Candy earphones are a million times better.

The second pair I bought less than a week after I purchased the first. Between the two I\u2019m wearing these headphones eight to twelve hours a day.  They work fine with my Android phone an LG G3.

VI've bought two of these over the last few years...and they've both had the same issue. The rubber coating on the cables gets brittle and cracks in multiple places...sometimes in less than a year. I've had a LOT of earbuds across all price ranges from Bose to Sennheiser to cheap $10 Panasonic. The ones that held up the absolute worst? Bose. The $100 set held up worse than the $10...and that's under careful and light usage.I contacted Bose and simply asked them to simply replace their defective products, but they wanted to charge me almost as much as retail. At the end of the day, Bose is behind the technology power curve in so many of their products abd doesn't stand by their products. If I'm paying $100 for your product it better not fall apart in less than a year while the $10 product doesn't.Overrated.

VAmazing sound for such a small bud. Only problem is it doesn't go in deep enough for the purity of sound to be pure. If I hold them w. my finger, it's amazing. IF I don't, it's just better then the other ones but not amazing.

VI decided to buy these headphones to replace my Apple's headphones which have a problem with their cable. Compare to the Apple's headphones, these Bose headphones feel uncomfortable and bulkier. Even with the smallest fitting size, it does not fit well into my ear. The sounds quality is also flatter than the Apple headphones. I am not sure these Bose headphones are worth their price.

VIf I could give these headphones greater than 5 stars I would. Before finding this model, I had gone through so many brands and models of headphones and could never find any that were right for me. Either they were too large for my ears and fell out when I ran, or the sound quality was horrible, or I\u2019d hear thumping sounds when I accidentally tapped the wires, or they hurt my ears. Generally it was a combination of all of these factors. Then I found an article about the best earbuds for people with small ears, and decided to give these Bose headphones a try when I saw that an unpopular color was significantly discounted. I love everything about them (even the color). The sound quality is amazing, tapping the wires causes no distortions, and they fit my ears perfectly. I have done two 8-mile runs with them in my ears and they have never even come close to falling out of my ears. I think that pretty much says it all!

VI am EXTREMELY happy with these. Of course, I've used the earbuds that come with the iPhone, and they don't sound good (and they slip out of the ear). I tried the Beats in-ear buds, and I thought they sounded very poor for the money. And though they have different ear-canal attachments, they still slipped out. These are in the same price-range as Beats, but they sound great and they are very comfortable to wear in the gym. 6 months of use and NO issues!

VI love it. Latest in a long number of bose headphones that I have been getting. Sound quality is as good as earlier versions of this in-ear. One thing that I do not like in this version is the metal part where the headphone is inserted into the audioplayer. In eralier versions of the headphone the part had a L-shape that I found more convenient to use. This version has lost the L-shape and I find that it sticks out a little more and is not as convineinent. On the plus side, the phone wires don't get as tangled up as my earlier versions used to. All in all, I am liking it very well and will stay with Bose.

VI upgraded to these after my 5-year old Bose earphones kicked the bucket. These feel about the same quality as every other earphones that I\u2019ve run across over the $50 mark - they will last a couple of years with heavy use before they start to fail. Every set I\u2019ve owned has eventually lost the sound in one of the earphones and my previous ones were the first to last past a year. In fairness I\u2019ve had issues with Monster, Klipsch, and Shure\u2019s longevity after months of normal use; it\u2019s inevitable due to the repetitive bending of the wire connecting to each earphone and then the plug. Long story short, I am not going to ding Bose on making fairly standard quality earphones. The sound is decently balanced and since they don\u2019t actually jam into your ears like most in-ears they provide way less isolation, but a larger soundstage. I like the sound signature, the bass seems more dialed down and tighter than other Bose products. Where these headphones shine and why I continue to buy them: they are unbelievably comfortable. Unlike other earphones, these sit in my ears perfectly without having to constantly deal with the seal of other typical in-ear models, such as Beats, B&O;, and B&W.; I can wear these for an unlimited amount of time without feeling the need to adjust them in any way, I don\u2019t know of a single other pair of headphones \u2013 in-ear, over-ear, on-ear \u2013 that accomplishes this. These are almost perfect if you don\u2019t need noise isolation.

Please, when you pull them out, always pull at the jack, otherwise the wires might detach same with pulling the wires to get them out of your ears.

VBest In Ear Headphones I've Ever Had!
p1478
sg5
VI'm a heavy heaphone user, meaning I wear my headphones every day for multiple hours and I can't even begin the list of headphones I've bought in the past decade. So far these have been the best pair I've ever had! I purchased these after my JVC over-the-ears crapped out in April. I've never been one for in-ears because even the best brands popped out or hurt (SkullCandy, Apple, JVC, etc) then a friend let me try these on I instantly noticed the difference, so comfortable accodring to him "you can fall asleep in them" (and I have since) and felt really secure. After discounting I got these for $88 but I think they are worth the extra markup, though I wish they included more replacement earbuds, more on that later.Pros:-Sound- I've often found in-ear buds to sound grainy and less rich, I notice none of this with these, but it's Bose sound hard to really question it (sorry I'm not more of a scientific audiophile)-Comfort- have fallen asleep in these, great for long plane rides, long term use. Have excercised in, barely any issues with falling out-Remote control and mic add to functionality, have used successfully for phone calls-Color scheme- went with the iced blue, love it and the touch of red makes it easier to find-Carry case is a nice addition for travel, wish it was larger enough for my iPhone but it is decent size for a smaller mp3 playerCons:-Silicone earbuds may fall off- I've only had one incident so far where I went to reach for my headphones and one of the silicone earbuds had fallen off at some point and of course I couldn't find it, they're really impossible to use without them. Had to trim down a larger size one to fit temporarily before finding a store. Just be careful, use the carrying case, and should you lose one go to a Bose store or a Bose reseller a lot of the ones here on Amazon did not see legit...-Earbuds are "sweat proof" they're sweat proof enough that that the water doesn't get through the silicone to destroy the sound or get it wet but don't be surprised if the earbuds get a lil slimy...just wipe them doen with some iso later

VI was initially hesitant to spend this much for some ear buds, but WOW!  Feels really good in ear, even after long periods.  Sound quality is top notch for lows and highs, no ear-achiness like some ear buds get after 2-3 hours.Bad:  The cord is just garbage, its too stiff and gets in the way.  It's like the QC team forgot to inspect or product test that  part this design.

VExtremely comfortable, zero noise canceling
p1514
sg5
VThe Bose headphones have some great qualities and some terrible qualities, depending on what you're looking for.Pros: The most comfortable in-ear headphones I have ever owned. They produce great sound quality and the microphone works very well with my iPhone. In a QUITE environment, they are perfect and you can wear them for hours without knowing they are in.Cons: ZERO noise canceling- I don't mean some I mean zero. If you have any background noise you will hear it; regardless of how loud you play your music.My recommendation: If you're like me, you listen to your headphones at the gym, on planes, and places that will inevitably have background noise. If you like in-ear headphones buy the Shure SE215 headphones. They are about the same price, have similar sound quality, and will completely eliminate background noise. I find the Shure foam earbuds to be very comfortable and once you find the right size and preference with foam / silicone ear bud fittings; they are perfect.I bought the Bose headphones because I lost my Shure SE425 earbuds. I just found them and will be using them in place of the Bose earbuds- they are $300 and well worth the cost if you use your headphones on a regular basis.Like I said- extremely comfortable but not the ideal headphones for me. I was pretty disappointed with them and thought I would get a much better product for $125. Would return them, but past the 30 day refund date.

VI've had these about 3 months now and love them. i am a homeschooler and i listen to soft music through these and they block out the surrounding noises. i would be giving these a 5 star but the bass isn't really all that good. i like drake and artists like that and these just don't provide the bass that i want. if they could make something right in between beats over powering bass and bose under powering it would be perfect! other then that, they are very comfy, and well built.

VGreat sound,very comfortable but does not  cancel or block noise from a riding mower. Actually is good for walking, running or bike riding because you  can hear background noise. Do not fall out like most ear buds. I prefer my noise cancelling quiet comfort headphones but these serve their purpose for day to day use and as a hands-free phone attachment. As with most Bose products, might be a little costly for the average person.But once you own Bose is hard to enjoy anything else.

p1597

VThis is my third pair of Bose in-ear headphones. The first two were of the older sort, the MIE earbuds, which literally disintegrated after about a year and a half of use - the earbud leads simply developed tons of small holes, exposing the wiring underneath, and the volume and control buttons totally failed. This was after daily but careful use. I was initially very impressed by this new version -- the leads are thicker, the volume control cluster more robust. After only 2 months of *gentle* use (seriously), the right earbud stopped producing sound unless pressure was applied to the jack, and then the left one followed suit, and now I have a $119 piece of plastic. Returning it under warranty to Bose now.

VI do not recommend these if you're into weight lifting. I used to have the old IE2 and got these. The old ones had the end not sticking out, but these do. When I was deadlifting, the ends snapped when the bar was near my waist. They've been showing wear and tear for the past 2 weeks and I've only had them for a month. I'm very upset considering my old pair lasted me for almost 2 years and these broke almost immediately.

VAs with most Bose products, these sound superb. Long cord is great, too. Most importantly, these will NOT fall out of your ears in the middle of a performance. I had tried several other designs but none stayed in my ears for the duration of the performance. The silicone "wings" keep these buds in place without weighing things down. Pricier but worth it.

But the best feature is that, after wearing them for a few hours, your ears don't feel like someone has bopped you and given you cauliflower ears.  No soreness!

VYes, these are awesome headphones, but not sure they are worth the price tag.  I was expecting great sound quality and on the instrumentals it does sound great, but the vocal quality is average.  Other complaint is that to truly get good sound quality you have to use these in a quaint environment.  When using where there is fair amout of background noise(train), the audio quality is hidden as they do not block out exterior noise well.  Super comfy and light however

VI got these headphones for my birthday, and I use them everyday at work.  They are excellent! Although I wish I had the one with the built in microphone for phonecalls, I am not disappointed with the product at all.  I would highly recommend these to anyone looking afor a good quality earbud with decent noise cancellation.

VMost earbuds hurt my ears if I wear them for too long, but by using the small size of these, I hardly have that problem at all. They fit my ears well, sound is great, etc etc. I've had them for several years now and the wire casing started cracking a few years back, which is why they're only 4 stars. They still work fine (so far) but that is something I've noticed. Other than the wire exposure, they're lasting a long time and are quite comfortable.

VThese are worth the price and do sound great, but I have two small nitpicks about this product compared to the old Mie2i Model.-The plug is straight, unlike the Mie2i, which had a nice angled plug.-The sound sounds a bit more muffled. Still great, hardly noticable once you've been listening to them for awhile.I would definitely reccomend these to someone looking for a pair of portable earphones with good sound, unlike Beats and other "fake" high end products.

VThese sound extremely good. I absolutely love listening to music on these. I'm not a sound expert, so I can't talk about highs and lows. However, I will say that the bass on these is actually pretty good. They also fit in my ears pretty good, which I was surprised about. The biggest reason I got these was the remote/mic attached to them. I got the iOS version when they were on sale for $90 and I've got to say, I'm happy I pulled the trigger and got these. Now, I just want to get the Bose Wireless Soundlink II speaker.

VI love these earbuds. I think I use them probably at least an hour or more per day. I use them for all my phone calls, listening to music at the gym, podcasts while on a walk.They sound terrific. Good bass, clear definition, high quality sound. They're comfortable to wear for long stretches. They stay in tightly even while working out.I've had mine for almost a year now and they're doing great under heavy use. No wire fraying, or other signs of damage.If these ever do wear out, or (more likely) if I lose them, I'd totally get another pair.

VBest earplugs ever!I am not a huge fan of the bass and listen to lot of vocals and hence mid frequency is my primary concern. And this Bose just kills it.The only other product that comes close to this level of balance across the sound spectrum was theCreative EP-630 Earphones (Black). However, over the years a lot of counterfeit creative products are doing the rounds and hence moved to this.I bought the old version of this a year back and one more a year before this. I doubt if I will ever look for any other earphones/plugs.

VGreat headphones, but the sound that they produced wasn't as...encompassing as I was hoping for (might just be how I enjoy listening to music-I personally like headphones that cancel out all outside noises without having to turn the music up too much). I'm a current music student and having a good pair of headphones is really important to be, but these just didn't really did it for me. Definitely good overall, but I don't know if they're necessarily worth all the money. And while they definitely stay in your ear, they start to make your ears sore after a while of having them in.

VI love the sound from these things and cannot complain there.One small caveat; If you are using these in extreme or "harsh" environments, these may not be for you. My older set has the wire cracking up and down the whole thing starting at the connector.Worth the money for the time I have had them? Absolutely. Would I like to not see that at all? Of course.I knew this going in and I am making a more concerted effort to keep the wiring clean and free of oil/dirt/chemicals.I am using these with a Evo X5 Second Gen and they sound super sick. I love the way the ear buds sit inside my ear without really bothering me at all. Sometimes I forget they are in and that says comfort.

I have always had trouble with ear buds as I have small ear canals and after 10 minutes or so my ears are usually giving me fits and I can't have them in my ears too long as they continually bother me. BUT these Bose in-ear headphones are just perfect for me. They are so comfortable that I forget I have them in and while enjoying audible e-books I can have them read to me fore hours on end and truly enjoy the ebook as well as the great sound. When listening to my ipod music the music is much better than on any other ear bud I have tried using, so I am very happy with this purchase.

The silicone ear inserts hold the earphones comfortably and securely in place without having to jam an over sized rubber bulb into the ear canal. Admittedly, for many reasons, not everyone is a fan of  Bose products but I'm no audiophile and I truly enjoy the sound of these earphones. The sound is crystal clear with deep clear bass tones, not overpowering. Great comfort and great sound.

VI was using the iPod earbuds and they hurt my ears on my 8 hours a day of conference calls. I wanted something better that I could use when I run too (I'm in training for a half marathon).  These are perfect. I love everything about them. My coworkers have them too and love them but complained about the wire being worn down, so I bought the canopy extension for $10. I figure if the product decays in a year past it's warranty I can still exchange them.  Overall: great product. Sound quality is great, and using for running is good.

He insisted on paying for another pair as he says they're the best earbuds he's ever worn. He works out of the house and uses his cell phone as his work phone so these are in his ear all day long - very comfortable and sound quality is great.

VI have had these head phones for only a couple of weeks and the left ear bud has already "blown out." I do not listen to my music excessively loud, but if I play anything above the medium volume meter on my iPhone then the left ear bud starts to static. The sound quality is fantastic when listening to low volumes, however, it is terrible when you turn it up.

VI have been using bose headphones for many years and gave these for gifts 3 times as well.  First. I love the new color!! The model before had a very obvious wire color where it did not match a lot of my outfits. The ear kernerls are good since it does not fall out even when u run. Its not completely sound proof like in-ear headphones so safe to listen while walking around the city.Do aware that it will hurt a little when u wear it for a long time!Also, the wire is on a softer end so i recommend you to put it in the case rather than throwing in your bag. It will rip off as you pull out more within a lot of things.The microphone and volume control works very well with iphone 6, and please look at the picture that the insertion to the device is straight, not curved.

VBought these a couple of months ago, and find them to be the best in-ear phones I've had so far, including the Beats and the Apples and the Candys and the others. They have very good sound quality for listening to music or voice, the mic's sound quality is great per th people on th other end of my conversation, the extra thingie on the ear parts hold them in my ears even when they are inadvertently tugged when something catches on the wires, and the wires don't tangle up as much as other brands' do. I am very, very satisfied. And, I use these a LOT -- phone conversations when my hands are busy (always), for listening to music or radio when at home, or podcasts when I am walking or at they gym. Even my husband tried them out and bought a pair, and he prides himself on his audio discrimination powers. I am really glad they come in at least two colors so he could get his own pair and not mistake mine as his...

VI can't explain how much I love these headphones. I bought a pair after owning the PowerBeats by Dre for two years and I have to say, though the sound quality is the same (which is superior), the durability of the product is much better. I would recommend this to a friend.

VI was looking for a step up from the Apple ear pods that come with the iPhone 6 as a byproduct, which I consider to be decent sounding earbuds, nothing too outstanding. These definitely exceeded nearly all attributes of the Apple ear pods. These are far more comfortable given their winged tips that conform to your ear. Although these aren't technically noise cancelling, they do indeed isolate the music to a certain extent due to their physical design. I noticed upon most reviews composed about this product, people are discontent with the outer shell being entirely plastic and claiming they are more susceptible to breaking. While this is true and there are other headphone options to choose from in terms of durability, I feel as though this is greatly exaggerated. It's not like this plastic is gonna shatter into a million pieces if improperly handled. I honestly don't know how people manage to break their previous plastic earbuds to an extent that general expectations state it needs to be prevented with a more durable material. These are good earbuds, just don't mistreat them. They even come with a convenient carrying case if you're concerned about it. Anyway, the audio quality I noticed upon first listening to these earbuds was excellent. I could immediately tell that low ends and bass are emphasized, which I personally like. Mids and highs definitely shine through and are clear as day as well, but depending on the variety of music you listen to, you will probably notice the presence of low notes before anything. This doesn't dismiss other pitches in audio because all around, the sound is universal for everyone's liking. You're probably not going to find better earbuds at this price or lower if you're reading this in 2015 or maybe 2016. They're dope man.

VGreat sound and great fit.  Plus these aren't the kind that seal the ear-canal, so you don't get that sealed in feeling like you have a head cold.  The little wing thing is the secret to holding them in place.  A set of Aukey bluetooth headphones I have also has that piece and it works great to keep them from falling out.  The color of these in the pictures is more red than reality, but the "cranberry" description is right on the money.  I got these to give as a gift and they seem to be as good as a pair of older Bose IE2 headphones, which are my favorite wired in-ear headphones.

p2599

VMeh. I bought these as a treat for myself, hoping to get better sound quality than the iphone earbuds. I think the apple earbuds sound better than these, honestly. These have a lot of bass, but the highs are non existent. They sound like the apple earbuds after 8-9 months of use when they get dull. Pretty disappointing. Would have never bought these if I could have tried them out beforehand. I find myself still reaching for my apple earbuds instead of these.

Getting a set of Bose for $79.95, is considered a good day to me.

VGreat replacement for the white earbuds!
p2700
sg5
VI have had these buds for almost a year and I love them. I bought these after my apple earbuds died. I use these everyday for working out and everything else. They are definitely sweat resistant (unlike my apple earbuds) and they stay in my ears very well. The mic/volume control is at a great place close to my mouth when I have to take a call (this is really important to me since I often have just the right earbud on with no music in case I get a call while i'm out and about). The buds are as conformable as the apple buds which is fine with me because I liked the feel of those. I thought I wouldn't like the little red clip but it actually comes in handy especially when working out (it is also detachable so no worries if you hate it). These have very little if any noise reduction. The sound is better than the apple earbuds and they seem to be durable so far (I'm not delicate with them and so far no problems). Also note, if the apple earbuds were too big for your ears, these may be a great replacement as they come with three sizes of rubber things and the small one seems to fit my friends who had this problem.

VGood earbuds with limited bass
p2777
sg5
VI am a headphone/earbud nut with several pairs of headphones at any given time including the following: UE TripleFi 10 (my best sounding but least comfortable), Bose QC25 (only used for traveling), Klipsch X10 (my most comfortable), these Bose SoundTrue, and multiple sets of throw away earbuds used mainly when I workout.I bought these after my X10's stopped working in one ear and getting tired of going through many, many pairs of cheap earbuds purchased through my company's onsite store while trying to decide on my next set of earbuds.Sound/Comfort: Sound for the SoundTrue falls below the TripleFi 10 and X10's but is pleasant, well balanced, and clean while lacking the bass I get from the other two. I think this has to do with the way the Bose fit since they don't have a good seal versus the other two. They're very comfortable compared to the TripleFi 10's (which tend to fall out when moving around a lot or working out) and more convenient than pulling out my QC25's since I like to leave them off one ear so I can monitor my surroundings while working at my desk.Price/Durability: The SoundTrue were way cheaper than my TripleFi 10's & X10's and were cheaper than the X11i's I considered. The cord seems sturdier than the X10 and cheap earbuds so I am hoping this set will last a while. Based on the cords, I think they will be more durable than my X10's so I may make these my workout headphones and then buy a set of X11i's for using at my desk.Overall: I'm mixed on these. Not over the top happy about the purchase but not feeling like it was a bad buy. They will be useful for the gym due to their perceived sturdiness but the fact that I am missing my old Klipsch earbuds tells me I should've spent the extra money and purchased those rather than being cheap this time around. After using these for a few weeks, I'm pretty sure I will buy the x11i's sometime soon.These were one generation old when I purchased them so the price was way less than list. Giving it four stars due to the price balanced against the sound.

VGreat earphones so far. Took on our trip. Used on plane, phone and whisper.Expensive but sound and quality is excellent. Decided to try Bose and replaceall the many other earphones I have purchased recently. Biggest plus for me isthat I notice the volume level for the Bose is about 4x less than my otherearphones! I modified it with the Stay Ear tips. Works for me. More bass butI can adjust frequency with my Samsung phone.

p2825
sg5
VOrdered a pair of these after ordering the 'regular' SoundTrue version (the ones WITHOUT the inline controls). Once I found out that they made these with the inline controls I sent back the other ones because I didn't like having to control the volume via my phone. The controls, for me, make all the difference in the friendliness of use and are simple and intuitive. I normally wouldn't spend this kind of cash on earbuds, BUT.........I use an Amazon credit card, so I build up cash-points with it and these were essentially 'free'. I've owned several home-Bose products in the past and have always loved their sound so that's why I initially tried them. While they don't have the 'deep' bass that some people prefer, they DO have a nice clean sound. They 'sit' in your ear canals rather than 'sealing off' which lends to their sound, and at low levels you can actually hear someone if they talk to you. I like them and would recommend them to others.

p2855
sg5
VI'm a true believer in Bose headphones, in their sound quality as well as how they're manufactured. I currently own the in ear Bose headphones prior to this model and I absolutely love them! Unfortunately, my last pair of headphones is starting to wear down within the cord, which is why I decided to buy a new pair. I ordered this new model of Bose headphones to use with my computer and ipod. When I took the headphones out of the box and examined them I noticed that they're not made as sturdy as the last model of the in ear headphones I own. The style of the headphones and material feel cheap to the touch, very plastic! it's as if they are trying to cut corners to save money. They are very light and airy, and makes me feel like I could break them quite easily. The sound is the same but the quality of the headphones have sadly declined over the year. I wish I could buy the old model instead of these.

p2902

VMy husband had a previous model of these headphones, and they fit him perfectly! The sound on these has much improved! One little note: My husband likes to watch television to shut his brain off. Being polite, he uses an extension cord for the headphones.  We do not know why, but his trusty cable does not work. He has the model with microphone for Samsung. I transmits sounds and acts like normal headphones with everything except that cable. Again, he is a gentleman.  He is currently using the old Bose headphones, which after many years of use have become frayed.UPDATE - These headphones were originally used on a Samsung Galaxy S4, now being used on an LG V10 - everything still working great!

VI love these headphones! Great sound, great fit. The only downside is after a year of use, the cord  split and started shorting. But you know what, it's fine because for how often I use my headphones, these held up well. If I had crappy cheap ones I know I'd have to replace them several times over the course of a year, so really...not bad for the price and quality. I recommend using the storage case for your headphones when not in use. Might extend the cord life!When my first pair went kaput my bf let me borrow a pair of his cheap headphones and man, I couldn't handle it. Had to go back to bose.

VEasy to use and durable
p2992
sg5
VPros: Easy to use and durable.Cons: PriceThe Bottom Line: I would recommend these to a friend or give them as a gift to someone. You could think of these headphones like a mid-2000s Honda Accord. There\u2019s nothing super flashy, but they\u2019ll get the job done just fine while being durable and reasonably affordable.For the past two weeks I have been using these headphones on a daily basis while I workout.  These workouts range from intense cardio to just lifting weights.  I like to listen to music to stay focused.  Before I got these headphones, I was using the ones that came with my iPhone. The problem was that they consistently fell out when I was being active.  This has not been a problem since I got these Bose headphones.  They have done everything that I have expected them to do.PRICE:Some people might balk at the price of these headphones.  What they don't realize is that it is an investment.  You have to pay a little more money to get something high quality.  You will pay more for these headphones than if you bought generic iPhone ones, but these will perform better in every aspect.  Basically you have to pay a little more to get a little more.  The price is comparable to headphones with similar functionality.SOUND QUALITY:The sound quality is a little bit better than average.  It is better than the iPhone headphones, but they aren't as good as more expensive on-ear/over-ear headphones.  They do have a good soundstage though.  Again, think Honda Accord.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing spectacular.DURABILITY:The durability of these headphones is exceptional.  They are sweat-resistant which is a plus while working out.  There is no sign that these headphones will start to fall apart anytime soon.ABILITY TO STAY IN EAR:I love how these headphones are engineered.  The little wings are what allow the earbuds to stay in place.  I have not had a single instance in which these headphones have fallen out of my ear.  You would think that this design would be uncomfortable, but that\u2019s not the case.  You can hardly feel them.  The headphones also come with a set of slightly bigger, and slightly smaller, wings so you can adjust them a little bit.LOOKS:I got the black model for iPhones. The cord is a swirl of black and dark grey. The actual earbud piece is solid black with an inconspicuous BOSE logo.  I wanted to avoid bulky looking headphones that wrap your ear. These headphones are small enough to not look funny.

VBest Headphones for Active Use
p3052
sg5
VI hope these never break. I've had them for a long time, carry them with me everywhere, stuffed in a bag that I cram in my purse or my briefcase. I have tried so many different types and these are by far the best. They get abused frequently, but still work as expected. I use them outdoors with everything and can hear clearly. They have yet to fall out even with heavy activity. If I could change one thing, I would make the cords flat so that they tangle less.

VThey always stay in my ear, even through long distance running/cycling. The sound is great, and the earbuds are comfortable and feel like they are floating next to my ears.I would suggest these earphones to anyone who runs/cycles outside because they are not canceling/have the effect that some earphones do when the buds fill up your earhole (technical term). They almost fill it, but leave enough space so that you can hear what's going on around you without having an adverse effect on the sound quality.

VThese headpones are no better then the stock apple ones and they are triple the price. On top of that they are hands down the quiets headphones I have ever owned and if you crank them up to full volume anyone near you can hear the song just as loud as you can. Then if you go down to the first 3 volume levels you literally can hear it, these are not worth the buy.

VNot a fan of writing reviews for Amazon but sometimes you just have to. These earbuds are just awesome! First off other earbuds I have tried just didn't want to stay in my ear, thought I would try these. Yep they stay put. The sound is superior to any previous earbuds I have tried. Other earbuds would be loud and "sound good" but still hurt my ears after listening to music for a half hour, these Bose SoundTrue earbuds are loud and clear with seemingly perfect balance of highs and lows, can listen to music for hours now! I play a few games on my phone and I'm hearing sounds not heard before. Good price and great sound! Maybe I should have just started with these, could have saved some $$$ not buying those cheaper brands.

p3228
sg5
VOk so after reading reviews, I hear some people say that they aren't what they expected, and I get what they are saying. And on the other hand I see many people say they are perfect, and I also get what they are saying. So to clarify a bit. These headphones are meant for a certain kind of people. What kind of people you might say?-Well if you are a parent with small kids around, these would be great to listen too while doing chores while the little ones are playing because they don't have noise cancelation. And will help keep an ear on them. And if you have your music or audio book playing at the right level you can also hear what is going on around you.-Also, if you aren't a bass head that demands bass and are into clarity more then bass, these baby's are for you. The clarity is rich and vivid, for a more relaxation type of listen.-These are great for conference calls or for just taking a simple calls. It's true what they say, you can't even feel that you have them on, which is a plus.-They stay in your ear just fine, but I think they over hyped the stay in ear thing.Over all they do there job, so for the people who want a comfy in ear headset and just need something to get you through and want an upgrade from the traditional headsets then these Bose SoundTrue InEar fit the bill.Now for those who said they aren't what you expected. I feel you my friend. I was expecting a bit more. I'm used to in ear head sets to actually be in ear, and while these are technacally "in ear" they don't feel like it. It's like it's teasing you with the sound, like you want a deeper sound to come out but you won't get it. In my case I needed something just to use around the house and maybe go running with. But I didn't need nothing to fancy. So if your looking for something more in the "loud department" with deep bass.. Please look elsewhere! I wouldn't use these in the city with loud noise around, cause it will interupt your listening and it will be hard to zone yourself out, since these aren't noise cancelation. Also if you want these for the gym, I would look for the sport kind.. These are more safisticated and just ment to be used lightly, I feel.My 4 star rating is based on the "over hype" most reviewers gave it. You will get the amazing Bose quality sound but in a more public way, the outside noise is transparent with your music and it's hard to really get in your zone while in public places. It's like the headset teases you with its amazing comfort and your expecting more out of the experience but in reality that's all it gives you. If you are a simple kind of person and like to listen to relaxing music and chill under a tree on a sunny day then these are for you. If you demand deep loud music and like to lose yourself while listening, you might want to go with something else.

VBose SoundTrue Headphone Positive Review
p3233
sg5
VBose SoundTrue In Ear Headphones are a quality choice for everybody; whether you just want headphones for casual everyday use or a good option for a more active lifestyle. This product is constructed with user comfort and durability in mind.  Bose has designed these headphones with StayHear tips for the users\u2019 comfort; these earbud tips provide a fit that stays firmly in your ears for hours of comfortable listening.  I use these headphones for a variety of daily activities ranging from studying and walking around campus to working out at the gym.  No matter the situation these Bose headphones stay in my ear, and provide the upmost comfort.  An included feature with this product is that it comes with multiple sizes of the StayHear tips for any size ear.  Bose headphones come in five different colors: black, white, red, ice blue, and indigo, these color choices allow you to have a basic solid color or headphones with a mixture of colors that stand out. The one thing to not overlook with this product is the fact that there is no remote wired in to pause, skip, or stop your music.  This is a common feature included in a lot of other brands; however the other brands do not perform at the same standard of Bose SoundTrue headphones.Bose is known for producing high quality product, but with that comes higher prices.  SoundTrue headphones are priced at eighty dollars, which is fairly competitive with other high quality ear buds.  The durability and superior comfort is reason enough alone to spend a little more money than average on this product.  I have owned my pair for over a year; they have been through the washer and dryer multiple times and still work great.Overall I have had a very positive experience with Bose SoundTrue Headphones.  The sound quality is amazing, the durability is superior to the majority of other brands, and the comfort of there StayHear ear buds are superior to anything on the market.

p3256
sg5
VHonestly, I had high hopes for these, but they're not much better than a $12 pair of Skully Candy. If given the choice to spend $100 on headphones again, I probably wouldn't recommend or buy these again.I'm hoping that they last longer because I used my earbuds on a daily basis. The sound is not particularly rich or deep or loud. The shirt clip is nice and the 3 button iOS controls are nice too, although very high up towards the bud.They are somewhat comfortable, becoming a little much on a 4 hour flight. I even ran for an hour and 30 minutes with them and they were fine, but again, not a particularly complex or loud sound quality. Maybe it's just the limitation of an earbud?

p3262

VIt feels like I am always buying in-ear headphones to find a pair that doesn't suck, so I was a bit nervous buying these because of the high price. Bose makes great speakers though, and the reviews were good, so I took a chance. These headphones are great. Sound quality is high as you would expect from Bose, and the headphones do a great job covering the whole range of sound from bass to mid to treble. The sound is well balanced. They are also surprisingly very comfortable. The in-ear hooks in the picture are a flexible material, not hard plastic, and fit comfortably in my ears and the headphones don't fall out. The headphones are a good weight and the cable is long enough. The headphones also come with a case to carry them, but it does not come with any type of cord wrapper, so it's a little awkward to stuff them in the case. Overall I highly recommend these headphones to anyone willing to spend the money.

p3285

VI purchased these headphones about three weeks ago. I wear them to the gym, and while I am running. I was really needing something that stayed in my ear well, didn't tangle easily, and of course produced great sound quality. The Bose Freestyle Earbud were a good fit.ComfortAlthough these headphones did take some time to get used to, they stayed in my ear really good. Now that I am used to them, would say that they are even comfortable to have in. While I am going out for a run, I have no concern that I am going to lose a headphone.CordI am very pleased with the cord. It is really heavy and durable. The weight of cord keeps it from getting tangled. I hate having to untangle my headphones every time I go to use them. I also really like that while I am running, the cord is weighed down enough that it doesn't get in the way at all.SoundThe sound quality is excellent. Although, I do wish that it was a little more insulated (I can still hear quite a bit of background noise). I was impressed with how well these little headphones produced noise.Ultimately, I am very happy with this product and would recommend this product.

sg5
VThese are great headphones, especially if you\u2019re a college student like I am. They fit almost all of my wants and needs when it comes to a pair of in-ear headphones.In this review, I will be assessing these headphones based on these criteria:\u2022 Build Quality\u2022 Style\u2022 Fit/Comfort\u2022 Sound QualityBuild Quality:These headphones are really well made. They feel durable, and have survived many drops and tangles. Strong build quality is essential for college students who will be tossing their headphones in pockets and backpacks, and although these come with a carrying case, I seldom found myself using it and they don\u2019t look any worse for wear.Style:The headphones have a sleek design and their shape is nothing like other in-ear headphones on the market. The body is all black and the Bose logo is displayed loud and proud on the side of each earbud in white; a design choice that some will love and some will hate. Fashionable \u201cbrand name\u201d headphones are a popular trend among college students. I\u2019m personally indifferent towards it.Fit/Comfort:The ear tips on these headphones are unlike any other. They are shaped to not only fit inside your ear canal, but also hug the upper section of your ear with an extension from the tip. It\u2019s overall a very comfortable design, but it takes some getting used to. The cord is usually out of the way and not noisy at all, which is essential for when you\u2019re using them on the walk to class.Sound Quality:The sound quality put out by these headphones is above average. Songs sound clear and detailed. The ear tips don\u2019t form a complete seal with your ear canal, leading to background noise being detectable. I don\u2019t mind this, as when I\u2019m walking I can hear traffic or other pedestrians if I need to pay attention. A side effect of this is also less pronounced bass, something college students with Beats headphones might find off-putting, but I personally don\u2019t like excessive bass.Overall these are stellar headphones for a college student, and I look forward to using them for years to come.

VI bought these headphones a few weeks ago at a big box store. I have a Bose Sound Link Mini2 speaker while I absolutely love. I wanted a pair of In-Ear Headphones to wear at work and be able to carry easily in my purse. The sound is outstanding! These are Not the noise canceling headphones and that is just fine with me. I like to be able to hear the sounds and chatter going on around me while still getting a full, rich listening experience. I mainly listen to my Audible Books with these though sometimes I do listen to music.My only (personal) issue is they are not as comfortable as I hoped. When I had the medium tips on they hurt my ears. I switched to the small tips and that has helped tremendously. I just have very small ear canals. All in all, well worth the money I paid for them. Happy with my purchase.October 21, 2015 Update. My ear canals start to itch after having these in my ears for about an hour. These will only be for listening for short amounts of time IE lunch breaks and my two 15 breaks at work. Sound quality is still excellent and they are easy to carry to work in my purse.

VDespite what I have heard about these being equivalent to $20 headphones, I can tell you that is absolutely not the case. The sound quality is above and beyond, as you would expect from Bose. Crisp, clear and rich at the same time. They are well put together and have a very clean look. The 3 tips included allow you a custom fit, and even with my odd shaped ears (and different on both sides) it was easy for these to fit me securely and stay put throughout the day. The included case is great and these are fairly durable and will hold up if you treat them well. They are not made for extreme rough use, but for my needs they are perfect.

VMost comfortable in-ear headphones by a large margin
p3365
sg5
VThese Bose headphones are probably my favorite way to listen to music. At the time of purchase, comfort was extremely important to me, and I made the purchase largely based on that factor. One reason for this was that in the past I'd found it difficult to quickly put in and take out in-ear headphones, as they generally cause uncomfortable pressure when the sound-isolating seal is made, and require fiddling to make the fit perfect. With these, you can barely feel them, and you can take them on and off quickly because, as they are not sound isolating, there is no seal. They are by far the most comfortable in ear headphones I've ever tried.When I got away from the noisy Best Buy and city streets, and began to listen to more music on them, I was pleasantly surprised by a couple things:1. Bose's well known smooth sound signature has been improved and refined, but retained its super soft feel. Every sound that comes out of them sounds like it has been carved out of rich mahogany, wrapped in a soft blanket, and left to spend lazy summer afternoon in the sun, occasionally spritzed with cool spring water. The sound is quite distinctively Bose, and of course, being such, those who want the most accurate and neutral sound won't like it. These are quite detailed, but the enormous depth of the sound makes it easy to filter out sounds that are less pleasant, and the apparent detail of the rounded, three dimensional sounds that are present is thusly enhanced. If you are a listener who prefers to absorb energy and emotion from your music, then more accurate, less soft sounding headphones would probably be better. If you prefer to feel in control, and perhaps have a more participatory relationship with your music, as I often do, the absolute inability of these headphones to make a harsh or unpleasant sound will be a plus for an active listener.2. The bass is very powerful, and very detailed. I've rediscovered bass lines again for the first time since I heard them on speakers with a separate subwoofer. In fact, it is so powerful that if you already have a pair of bassy headphones, it might make sense to get a pair that is more neutral. Variety is the spice of life, and also of headphone ownership. That's not to say that the mids and trebles are bad, far from it. Just that the bass is truly remarkable, and the warm sound of the headphones works well with it.All in all, I am very happy with them, and will use them as my benchmark for mid-priced headphones going forward. This being said, sound is very subjective. I recommend getting a pair that you can return if they don't sound as good to you after a few days.

p3394
sg5
VI highly recommend these, as they are very comfortable to wear and provide an equalized sound stage, balanced levels, and accurate sound reproduction. As many have pointed out, these are not a sound enclosed earphone, meaning you can still hear what is going on around you. This can be excellent if you need to hear what others are saying and not jumping out of your seat when someone tries talking to you and you don't know they are there!A few things to watch for:-Cord length is very short, so you may want to get an extender.-I recommend trying all 3 sets of tips with the SoundTrues to find the best fit.-Microphone/controls may snag or catch on your shirt (one of the reasons I went with the plain ones)-Colors are nice, however I recommend sticking with the classic black and light grey that Bose is known for.Overall, for the price, I would give these a 4.7/5 rankingRead the descriptions and reviews and make sure you know what you are buying.

Vworth the buy, stop wasting money on other cheaper earphones and just do yourself the favor and get these!also yes they are in-ear earphones but dont exactly go inside or feel strange when on like other "earbud" earphones, the best way i can describe it is that they go right over your ear canal entrance and the material of ear pieces keep the earphones on and in place while listening and moving, i use them for workouts to office breaks, no complains at all.

VI'm so disappointed with these headphones.  I love Bose products, I have some of the QuietComfort 15s and they're absolutely incredible.  I couldn't have made it through grad school without them!  These, however, are a completely different story.  Like most other people, I thought I should change my ways and buy a pair of nice ear buds instead of many of the $10 ones at CVS.  And of course I turned to Bose.  The sound is awesome, but something about the shape of the ear buds is so strange, it actually amplifies the ambient noise around me.  I brought them in to work and I could hear every single word of my coworker's phone call while I was listening to music on them until I turned the volume up to a really uncomfortable level.  I tried all 3 sizes of the earbuds and it just didn't matter.  My $10 cheapos did a much better job of suctioning into my ears and blocking out noise around me.  I guess I'm going to just stick with those for now..

VLOVE these Bose headphones... wanted a pair of headphones with great sound quality that were not over the ear and not ridiculously expensive.-These bose headphones have great sound quality for music and streaming TV and videos.- The fit is great, it comes with three different sizes for all different sizes of ears. The fit is snug and comfortable.- I also like how it syncs and works with my iPhone, I don't want to talk on my phone without it

VTerrific In-Ear Headphones
p3590
sg5
VThere are hundreds of in-ear headphones from which to choose, but this Bose model stands out in several respects. It is not a noise isolating type, but rather is designed for those who would prefer not to completely cut themselves off from surrounding sounds, such a conversations, traffic, warning signals, etc. Yet the sound is of a very high quality, and under normal conditions (e.g., on a walk or run), the music is perfectly clear. However, this is definitely not the headphones you want to use on a flight as the engine sounds will drown out the music. I would say this is the choice for those who do not like to insert the tips fully into the ear for whatever reason. I would add that these are extremely comfortable earphones and they stay in place.

VMy old MIE2I ear buds I feel were the best ear buds available (purchased October 4, 2012 - they replaced the Bose predecessor ear buds I wore out before them) and they've been used continuously ever since.  It got to where I had electrical tape around the input jack, both ends of the volume controls, and at the connections of each ear bud.  After much teasing from my wife I purchased the new SoundTrue ear buds.  I wish I'd done that sooner as the sound quality is much improved.  I listen to music on my iPhone at the gym daily, and my Kindle too (watch movies, tv shows, YouTube).  GREAT GREAT GREAT!

VThis pair has a very balanced sound, without excessive punch in any part of the spectrum. This is overall a good thing. They are pretty comfortable, and the inline mic and controls work very well with iPhone. Noise isolation is subtle compared to other pairs I've owned, like Etymotic. Don't expect these to drown out a lot of ambient noise. The up side is you are still aware of your surroundings. I do believe the sound gets better as you break these in more. It's not phenomenal sound, but it's excellent for the price. I wear these everywhere, including the gym. I'm careful with the cord, but I see how it would wear quickly with careless use.

VHad these buds since December 2014. Since then I've hiked, walked, ran, and longboarded with them in. They're great, for the first four months. The rubber on the outside of the cables aren't very durable. These are the first headphones I've had that have torn, the outside rubber came loose exposing wire and causing me havoc. Pausing music opening Siri changing volume changing songs it is aweful and as of recently it killed my right ear bud. With amazing sound quality I loved these headphones (that's the reason I'm giving it a 3/5 not a 2/5. But the design didn't live up to what I was expecting. Now on the search for some new buds.

p3762
sg5
VI purchased the headphones to use while working. Mainly I was looking for a set of headphones with good music quality, could compete with vehicle noise and outside traffic while I'm out about. I've owned them since February and they did meet my expectations, in under a year they have broken. I no longer hear anything but there is no tear or braking in the cord but it started as a small issue most likely because the design that makes the plus stick directly out of your listening device phone/ipod instead of the old L shape design that headphones used to have.Biggest plus for me was that they fit my small ears.Biggest downside is that they aren't rugged enough and the plug design adds an additional 1 1/2 to the length of my phone which isn't an issue until I sit down and then its too big and awkward and thats clearly what caused the breakage.

I cannot use the other kind that sticks direcltyin your ear without the "in-ear holders" and have tried other brands of headphones that were okay but didn't last very long. So far these are proving to be excellent headphones which seem to be able to take a beating and keep on running.  The in-ear holders are soft, and once placed in my ears, I can hardly feel them. Plus they stay put. I highly recommend  these.

VCOMPARISION REVIEW: Amazing Comfort, Good But Not Great Sound, Excellent Value.
p3914
sg5
VHere's what I can say about these Bose SoundTruet headphones. For comparison, I own the following in-ear headphones: Sennhesier IE800 ($800), Cardas EM5813 ($400), Sony XBA-H3 ($350), Klipsch Image X10 ($350), Sennheiser CX 500 ($90), Sennheiser MX 75 ($65), Sony MDRXB50AP ($50), JVC HAFX1X ($30).  I also own a number of over-ear headphones from Sennhesier, Sony, Grado and Shure.1) The COMFORT is the strongest aspect of these headphones.  These are easily the most comfortable in-ear headphones that I've tried. The small silicon "wings" tuck into the ear grooves to hold the headphones in place.  There are 3 wing sizes to get the fit correct.  I have worn these headphones for over 6 hours straight and they create no discomfort whatsoever - not even the smallest amount.  I cannot say that I've ever had another in-ear, on-ear or over-ear headphone that I can say the same about.  My 2nd most comfortable headphone (Sennheiser IE800) I can wear for 2 hours and then my ears are tired from the pressure on the ear canal (there is no sound fatigue with the IE800).Most in-ear headphones create a seal with the ear canal.  This seal creates a richer, fuller sound and stronger bass.  Almost all in-ear headphones sound better with a tight seal.  However.... because the ear canal changes shape in minuscule ways due to the ear muscles and air pressure,most in-ear headphones that seal the ear canal will cause ear fatigue or discomfort with extended use.  Better designed models with ports will cause less fatigue because the air pressure is greatly reduced.  Because these Bose SoundTrue in-ear headphones do not seal the ear canal and gently rest at the ear canal's entrance, there is no ear fatigue or discomfort to the ear canal.  The silicon wings hold the headphone in place in the most comfortable way I've experienced in a headphone yet.2) These do not block environmental sounds at all.  I can be listening to music and have a conversation with the person next to me without any difficulty.  The ear tips do not create a seal in the ear canal.  Also, there is no noise cancellation feature on this Bose model (which is good for me because electronic noise cancellation gives me a headache and distorts the original audio recording).  I would not recommend these headphones for a gym, office, subway or noisy environment where sound isolation or sound cancellation is required.  I would, however, recommend these headphones for activities like running or bicycling on city streets - where environmental sounds should be heard for safety reasons.  I use these headphones during my neighborhood runs with great success.  I can hear the car driving up behind me without any difficulty.3) The SOUND QUALITY is on par with in-ear headphone in the same price range of $100-150.  I would rate these as better sounding than my Klipsch X10 but not as good as my Sennheiser CX 500 (fuller sound, better bass).  Headphones like the Sennheiser IE800 (considered the very best in-ear driver headphone that money can buy), the Cardas EM5813 and Sony XBA-H3 are all very, very much musically superior.  This comparison is not to say that the Bose SoundTrue are horrible sounding.  On the contrary they are quite good at their price range, but for someone wanting audiophile sound Bose simply cannot deliver.My other headphones like the Klipsch X10, although more expensive, sounded noticeable worse and weren't as comfortable.  The Klipsch X10 is identical to the X11, and is often considered the most comfortable in-ear headphone on the market.  The Bose supersede it.  My Sennhieser IE800 are also more comfortable than the X10.The most notable area that the Bose SoundTrue is lacking is in the fullness of the sound.  The Bose sounds hollow and thin.  The sound lack body. This is in-part due to the non-sealing fit.  However even when pushing the Bose headphones into my ear canals to seal them, the sound does not change all that much.  Compared to my top headphones, the bass does not have the punch, the trebble is scratchy and fatiguing, and midrange lacks detail and depth.  The soundstage (sounds 3D) is okay, but definitely not wide like the Cardas EM5813 or Sennheiser IE800.If you are searching for in-ear headphones that sound great, the Sennheiser IE800 are the best that I've heard and most other reviewers agree.  My IE800 are nearly identical sounding to my Shure SRH1540 ($500) - so close that it's hard to distinguish (a tiny fraction more midrange detail and a wider soundstage).  For those who know headphones, the SRH1540 are considered to be possibly the best over-ear headphone for under $1,000.... and the IE800 is legendary.  If you can't afford the IE800, then consider the Cardas EM5813.  They are considerable less expensive, look amazing and sound remarkable.  They are a "dark" sounding headphone that is bass-heavy but remarkably clear.  (Beats are a joke compared to the EM5813).  The construction of the EM5813 is unique, unlike any other headphone on the market and excellent... but not intended for exercise.4) The BUILD QUALITY is very good.  Although the entire boy is made of plastic, it feels sturdy while remaining light weight.  Bose wanted a headphone for active people and they nailed it.  There is absolutely zero microphonics (the echo sound in the headphones that the cable makes when rubbing against clothing, walking, etc).  I can listen to these while running intensely and the sound is undisturbed.  I wish I could say the same for the IE800 (it's biggest shortcoming).  The Bose description states that these are water resistant and they have resisted my sweaty ears perfectly.  These headphones are very light weight.  I hardly notice that I'm wearing them.  The cord length is very good.5) The MICROPHONE QUALITY is excellent.  My voice sounds crisp and clear during phone call and computer (Skype) calls.  I use a Blue Yeti microphone on my PC (considered the best computer USB mic under $300) and can say that while the Blue Yeti sounds amazing, this Bose SoundSport is not far off.  I would never recommend the SoundTrue for audio recording, but for calls it is excellent.My FINAL THOUGHTS are this:  The Bose SoundTrue is an excellent and top choice for anyone wanting a headphone that is comfortable and decent sounding.  For exercise, I doubt you can find a better wired headphone - period.  I couldn't and I tried a lot of headphones.  However if you want to reap the most pleasure from your music, then you're better off spending more.  These Bose SoundTrue headphones are not poor sounding, however they are not great either.  If you have experience with Bose and think that this is the best brand out there (or Beats)... you have a lot to learn.  While Bose and Beats are trendy and well marketed, they are not aimed at the audiophile audience and cannot come close to the quality of some other brands like Sennhesier, Shure, Cardas and Grado (my favorites).I give this Bose SoundTrue 5 stars because I couldn't find another headphone under $150 that I would want to own.  If Bose produces a better sounding driver and packages in the same style of fit as these, I wouldn't hesitate to buy them even if they were 2-3x the price... sound cancellation models excluded.

VThe Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones are completely unacceptable! With my iPad Air-2\u2019s volume set at 50% the music was clearly audible to my wife sitting eight feet away. Using these would be selfish and rude to the passenger seated next to me on a plane.The \u201cStayHear technology\u201d yields a fit that is just as poor to slightly better than traditional in-ear buds and does not prevent them from coming free as advertised. Keeping them in place requires readjustment every few minutes just like other earphones.Tonal quality is very good at volume levels high enough to properly drive the speakers but the minimum volume level required for quality output makes them audible to people around you.I returned these the same day they were delivered.

VGreat sounding but no isolation from outside noise.
p3937
sg5
VAs others have said, these ear phones allow way too much outside noise to enter the ears unless listening to music turned up on loudest settings with my Ipod.Unlike those earbuds that you can actually insert into the ear hole and into the ear canal a little ways, these Bose rest at the entrance, or the beginning of, the ear hole and just don't create a seal to keep any noise out. If you're in the gym or walking on the street you will here EVERYTHING unless the volume is turned up all the way. In fact, they are about the worst at letting in noise than any other in-ear headphones I've ever used. The only way to drown out the noise is to literally turn the music all the way up. That hurts my ears too much to do that. However, they do stay in my  ears while working out and don't fall out like the Apple earbuds do.Now, if you're in a completely quiet location and listening to music (like I'm doing right now as I type this) these headphones are outstanding. The sound quality is superb.If you're going to use headphones in a noisy environment (like a gym) I would absolutely not get these SoundTrue In-Ear headphones knowing what I know now.Still 4 stars worthy.

p4011
sg5
VThese are the worst headphones I have ever purchased. The description and marketing pictures make it seem like these headphones are made for someone with an active lifestyle, but unless your idea of an "active" lifestyle is sitting in a quiet room these headphones are not for you.I wore them to the gym and could hear every noise in there over the sound of the music. I could literally hear the guy breathing on the bench next to me over the music coming from these headphones. I had the volume up to almost full blast too and could hear the music from the gym's speaker system clearer than I could hear my own.Maybe they have great quality sound but I wouldn't know because they obviously didn't factor in background noise when making this product. So if you plan on sitting in quiet room maybe these are great for you. But if you plan on doing anything remotely active then don't waste your money on these.

VFreestyle vs Soundtrue Earbuds
p4047
sg5
VThis is the second pair of Freestyles that I have purchased. My wife ended up with my last pair on a loan, and never gave them back. (Can't blame her) I am writing this review, because I first bought the Soundtrue earbuds but have to say that although they are not a bad sounding pair of buds they aren't as good as the freestyle. The Soundtrue seem a bit muddled compared to the freestyle buds. If you are stuck on which pair to get I would go with the freestyle. I also have taken many others' advice and purchased a pair of the stayhear plus tips. These tips are different from the ones that come with the soundtrue or freestyle buds and are usually packed with the Bose noise cancelling buds. The stayhear plus tips make a significant difference with the sound performance of both buds.

VMediocre Sound with ER Levels of Bleeding
p4129
sg5
VI've been using these headphones for a few days after around 24 hours of burn-in time. So far my impressions are that the sound is "okay," or maybe just a bit above average. For $100 it's probably middle of the road sound quality in comparison to similarly priced headphones. The mids in these are pretty pronounced, but in a lot of music (I tend to lean into the rock, hip-hop genres) the vocals/mids get completely washed out by the bass and highs. 3.5/5 on sound quality.I think my largest complaint about these headphones is the BLEED. I recently was in my study listening to some music on about 60-75% volume level on my computer. My wife walked by to go into the bathroom to get ready, and she noted that she could hear the music I was listening to relatively clearly from across the hall over the bathroom fan. That's pretty bad. I'm used to iPhone headphone bleed being common place in the world, but from a $100 pair of headphones, I really wouldn't expect that much air to escape from so-called "in ear" headphones. 1/5 on isolation and feel.I'm going to give the headphones a little more time to see if the problem is as pronounced as I'm worried it may be. If the bleed continues to annoy me, I will have to return these and hope to find something a little more isolating...

The MSIE held up great but the wear and tear was visible and they didnt have the functionality that these Bose SoundTrue have. I have only been using them for half a day so far but they are wicked. Great sound quality, really fresh good tops, mids and decent bass. The controls are simple to work with, they are very comfortable in-ear. Sound quality in calls is very good. I would recommend!

Vbut I love these earbuds
p4183
sg5
VI almost never rate a product five stars, but I love these earbuds. My wife, a "phonophobe", got them first. She only listens to music if she's focused on it, or now in noisy situations (airplanes, etc.) so she can use these earbuds. They do as good a job of blocking out the noise as the large, over-ear headphones, and they're as comfortable, but they're a small fraction of the size. She loved hers so much that I got a pair for Father's Day.We've let several friends use them. The test is, "Put the earbuds in. OK, got it? They block out some of my voice just physically, right? So now I'll keep" (flip the switch to noise reduction mode) "talking and you'll hear the...." The look of surprise and awe is so much fun. Bose should give us a commission for all the pairs we've sold.We were both concerned about comfort, but the different size rubber bits make that pretty easy. The earbuds do start to hurt after 4 or 5 hours, but probably anything would.

VI got these primarily to try out their sound and fit before I buy the noise cancellation buds, plus the current price was within my budget to try out a Bose brand earphones. I do enjoy the clarity that these earbuds give out, but I was expecting a richer sound based on the BOSE brand. It is good for my intended purpose, which is to prevent listener's fatigue where my ears would start to ache within an hour of listening to music with my boomy Seinheiser 3.0s earphones. The Freestyle is great while listening to instrumental, pop, and vocals, but it definitely has a muffled effect with it comes to more heavy bass music. As mentioned by the other reviewers, these are not noise isolating, and I can definitely hear my surrounding. These work well in a quiet environment, and they are comfortable to wear. I actually fell asleep having these on, and it didn't bother me a bit.For noisier environments, I'd probably stick with my Seinheiser's, but I can see myself using the Bose on a regular basis, since I like how my ears feel during and after having these on.  In my opinion, my Seinheiser's slightly outperforms the Freestyles for the range of frequency it can handle, and provides a centered and well balanced reception.  I'd wouldn't want to spend over $100 for the Freestyles, but for the current price of $77.99, it is right for what I wanted them to do as earphones.

The bass was nonexistent and outside sounds forced me to turn the volume all the way up.  However, there is a solution. You can Google how to modify the ear tips yourself or spend the extra $10 and buy the stayhear plus replacement tips with your purchase and you will get the expected Bose sound with deep bass and crisp clear mods and highs.

p4266
sg5
VI came from Sony MDR-EX650AP and seeing how highly the TrueSound's got rated, I was expecting a better caliber of headphone than this. First off, these headphones are not very loud. Since these are designed differently than traditional in-ear headphones they don't isolate sound very well. I used these headphones for daily commuting on the bus and subway, and these are quite terrible unless I max out my volume, which I did not have to do with my Sony MDR-EX650APs. Also, these headphones are not as comfortable as reviews make them out to be. My left ear is in minor pain after 1-2 hours of use and it feels loose in my right ear, but this issue is probably more due to the way my ears are shaped.Overall, I tried to like these headphones and even used them for a couple of days, but in the end it doesn't match with my idea of a "good" pair of headphones. I will be returning these and getting another pair, most likely sticking with the MDR-EX650APs. Taking 2 stars away for the two mentioned issues and a third because I wouldn't recommend these to others.

Vand they are strikingly good in several ways
p4272
sg5
VKeep in mind, I'm not an audiophile.I'v ebeen using these headphones for a few months now, and they are strikingly good in several ways. First and foremost, I got sick of noise cancelling headphones, as much of the high quality portable headphones you find these days are noise canceling, which makes walking down the street with them seem a little bit unsafe. While these headphones are not noise canceling, they can easily handle volumes that might as well be. These things blast and reproduce the full range of sound much better than any skull candy or sony pair that I've ever had, noise canceling or not. These definitely outperform my gaming headset as well. I use these any time I'm on the road or want headphones first, microphone second.That said, the microphone isn't great. It's to be expected, as the microphone will hang well below your mouth when you're walking. Most people can hear me pretty well, but I frequently get issues with being drowned out by background noise. I didn't buy these for the microphone, predominantly, so I'm okay with that but ymmv.If you're looking for headphones first, and a mic second, these definitely seem like an excellent choice. They have amazing sound at all ends of the spectrum (for portable headphones) and I don't know that I could find something as high quality for this price.

VExcellent Sound and Comfortable
p4284
sg5
VExcellent sound and comfortable.  My experience with other "in-the-ear" headphones has been very disappointing.  They never stayed in my ears!  They were also designed to block out all other sounds--a safety concern for me.  The Bose phones stay put because of comfortable little flexible "things" (I don't know exactly what to call them) that fit into the outer ears above the ear openings.  These are more comfortable than "things" that fit OVER the ear.  My only concern is the fact that Bose did not use a right-angle plug, which, judging only from my experience, is less likely to fail.  I use phones with a Transcend mp3 player; and, when not in use, I liked to wind the phone cord around it with the plug still in place.  Unlike other straight plugs with other phones I've used, the phones that came with the mp3 player used a right-angle plug that never failed, even after several years of daily use.  I recommend disconnecting the Bose phones after each use and perhaps even stowing them in the case that comes with them.  Five stars without that one concern (trivial to most people, I suppose).

VSo I was taking a trip to see my girlfriend and unfortunately I forgot my headphones, and it was a red eye flight. I sat next to the loudest 2 loudest woman and couldn't sleep. Lesson learned. I went straight to buy headphones at my next layover and pulled the trigger on these.It was a huge risk because I have never spend this much on earbuds and I have always had issues with buds staying in my ear. Because of that, I've always stuck with the hoop ear buds (around the ear). But after reading good reviews, I decided to try these out.I got to say that I am very happy so far with my purchase. Not the best sounding headphones, but definitely great! And the best part is they actually stay in my ear and are incredibly light. The rubber hook really helps stabilize and prevents the headphones from falling out. I havnt tried running with them yet but I could tell that they will stay in just by jumping around.Overall, great headphones even though they are a bit pricey. Now I can sleep peacefully on the plane.

VGood product - bad plug design
p4483
sg5
VI have to start this review with the fact that I like the fit in the ear and the sound and I suppose those are the most important things. However, there are a couple of small things I don't like about these headphones. One is the fact that they changed the rubber in them. My old ones that I've had for a couple of years have a very soft, pliable, rubber in the cord. The new ones have a stiffer slicker cord. I suppose it's asthetics but I don't like the way they feel. They probably changed the rubber in the cord because people were complaining about the cord breaking or peeling or something. The second thing and more important is I don't like the plug. The old plug was at right angles. In other words, the cord angled out to the side, it was really nice and kept the plug end from getting caught on everything. The new headphones have a straight plug that sticks out over an inch and I'm afraid I'm going to break off the plug if I catch it on something or damage my phone. All in all, it's a good solid product but they have tweaked them in the wrong direction. The price has gone down $10 from when I bought them a couple of years ago and I was happy about that but I'd gladly give them the $10 back for a better design.

p4559
sg5
VI am pretty picky with my audio, but I'm absolutely no audiophile. I bought these to replace my old Klipsch earbuds and the difference is quite noticeable. These produce a much more equally distributed sound, while my Klipsch buds produced richer bass and worked at higher volumes, which is sometimes what I need as a student. Plus, the Klipsch were significantly better at keeping our external noise. However, these stay in my ear better, and produce a healthier, more natural playback.

VThe Perfect Headphones for Work
p4565
sg5
VI equate these headphones to having tiny little angels holding speakers up gently in the middle of your ear canal. They're so comfortable that you can barely feel them in your ears, and they allow the sound around you to get through easily.I recommend these for two purposes.1. Work headphones. Amazing for work. They allow you to enjoy some crisp, crystal clear music while still being able to hear your co-workers, and not having to worry about having awkward moments when you miss someone asking you a question. You can now listen to music at work without having to worry about needing to take one earbud out for fear of not being able to hear.2. I'd also recommend these for things like biking or running for the same purpose. Great sound, but you'll still be able to hear cars honking at you to get your bike out of the middle of the road.The sound is great for the price. Not quite as crisp as some more expensive headphones I have, but everything is very clear and I really enjoy the levels. Plenty of strong bass.They also look great.

VI have been wanting to purchase these for the longest time and I'm so glad I took the plunge. I wanted to go with the SoundTrue since I was mostly going to be using these at home or for walking and not any heavy exercising in which case I would have picked the SoundSport ones. From what I hear, the quality of sound is identical and the only difference is that the Sport version are sweat resistant. I love the color Black and these look and feel quite sturdy. The sound quality truly is amazing and I totally get the hype about Bose. It comes with 3 pairs of ear buds and the medium were the perfect fit for me. They initially felt like they would fall out but that is just how they fit and the reason they felt so comfortable. These came with a grey case and the ear phones fit perfectly in it and is very travel friendly. The Microphone is quite clear and crisp and you can also control the music with it. Love these and highly recommend them!

VAs a college student, these pair of headphones are amazing and comfortable. Although with  the earbuds provides they don't provide enough noise isolation so I buy the stayhear plus ear pieces after I tested out which regular ear piece I fit. The stayhear plus are used for the higher end models but you can grab a set of two for 10 dollars on Amazon. Trust me! When you combine the two these headphones are perfect. I'm very happy with my purchase and this is my second pair after I lost my first pair. From the pictures the wire may look weak but the freestyle update make these pair of headphones the most durabil, comfortable , and cost efficient headphones I have own compared to sennheneiser and audio technica.

VGreat sound but remote went crazy
p4695
sg5
VI bought these headphones April 4, 2015, they worked fine and sounded amazing. Was using them for awhile I was running on the elliptical with no problem. Then one they went crazy on me and the remote started turning the volume down by itself. I finished my work out and thought it was a one time thing, but then the following day I used them again and the same remote problem. I got so upset with the headphones because I had just started my work out that I threw them down so I could finished my workout listening to the gym music. Needless to say the headphones got caught on the machine and broke. I was pissed and bought the next model up because I needed a working pair of headphones.

VGot these last weekend and can't stop listening. I have had MANY earphones and headphones over the year and current at just 3 sets, but these are the new favorites.Took a while to get the right tips configuration, but now things are great. Comfortable, stay where they should and sound great. I have come to the conclusion that these are like a Open over the head style as opposed to my other in-ear monitors which sound great but are more on the closed style. Hope that makes sense.They also sound great during phone calls.  I also tried a really good amp to go with them, but it did not make that much of a difference, so it went back. But not these babies, carry with me everywhere.

VI bought these at Best Buy for my Galaxy S5. I went with the idea of just spending a max of $80 but when I was there I pulled up the Amazon reviews and figured it would be worth the extra money.  No exaggeration, if you have an iPhone headset it's better than these.  The have zero bass.  The sound is very clear but it should be because again, there's no bass to distort the sound.  These was a bad buy.  Save your money.  Half of these reviews are all BS from people that got it for free so they write long winded 4 and 5 star reviews.  Don't fall for the hype like I did.

The bass quality is superb and I feel connected to my music without feeling like I have to fiddle with the earbuds constantly. I am always trying to find the right pair of earbuds because I hate the ones you have to push into your ear canal. This will be my second pair of clip in earbuds so to speak and I am much happier with this over another similar product.Absolutely wonderful.While I was suppose to receive them yesterday but I was called into work and couldn't be there to sign for them, they delivered today, on a Sunday. I don't think I've ever been more happy with delivery time.Perfect product. Perfect service.

So the left side of my face is like "this sounds awesome!!" and the right side is like "WHAT, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING!!??!"For the quality of these things, just go with something cheaper since they are no worth the price tag at all.

Really annoying - these are/were my go-to running headphones but the connector at the end seems to be a product defect per other one star reviews. Very suprising that these can't be sent back for replacement. If this was in the EU, this will be an automatic defect for $130 headphones.Get used to being super frustrated with the end connector.

I'm so happy about this purchase.So, I go to the gym about five times a week and like to listen to music when using the elliptical machine and the treadmill.  I found other types of headphones would either: 1) fall out, 2) get wacky because of sweat or 3) hurt the backs of my earsThe Bose Freestyle solves all of my issues.  They stay nicely and securely in my ears without causing pain or pressure.  The volume is consistent, despite my aggressive sweating and they stay put and allow me to focus on the run, not on my headphones.

VComfort- It doesnt matter how good headphones sound if you can't keep them in your ...
p4974
sg5
VI have been through so many different headphones in the last few years that I probably dont remember half of them. The most expensive pair I have ever purchased before these were around $40. I've never owned a pair of Bose before, but I am always hearing the brand and it has a well established high reputation in the audio industry. After reading the reassuring reviews, I decided it was time to spend some extra $$$ and buy a pair that I would not lose (due to the price). I paid an extra $30 for the call/control option for my Galaxy Note, simply because I am used to this feature as many headphones come standard with. Here is what I think of the product in order of importance in my perspective:Comfort- It doesnt matter how good headphones sound if you can't keep them in your ear right? These are the most comfortable in-ear headphones I have ever tried on. They come with 3 sizes, (SM MED LRG). The large fit my ears perfectly, and never fall out. I give them a 10 for comfort.Sound- These headphones sound good and clear, but I feel there are better sounding headphones for the price. The bass is a little bit low for me, as I like to listen to rap music often. I guess if you dont care for much bass, then they would be great for you. Also, they do not have noise-cancelling feautures, but do still block out a small amount of noise. On a scale of 1-10, with the Iphone and Galaxy headphones being a 5, these would be a 7.5.Conclusion- If you like having your headphones in your ears for long periods of time, and arent a bass fanatic, these headphones are worth it. The comfort is unmatched, but is slightly inferior in sound compared to others at this price. Also, the additional $30 for the mic seems pretty steep (30% increase), and I would most likely not purchase these headphones again in respect to the price/value ratio.

VThese are the best headphones that I have found....finally!!I have tried several type of in-ear headphones trying to find the balance between great sound & comfortable fit.  I also want them to be reasonably quick to put on.  I don't know if I have odd shaped ears or what but I have not found a pair that I can consistently get the seal quickly or they fall out often.  I listen to music a lot but also take classes with frequent video lectures - I'd be cool with switching headphones to accomplish both if necessary.These sound really good, pop right in and I don't even feel them in my ears...I'm really happy.  I just received them today - I will update with details about how they handle wear & tear.

VHigh-Quality Earphones With Impressive Sound
p5034
sg5
VI've had these for about a day now, so far they're amazing. The sound quality is the best I've heard in any set of earphones. Music is now 10x more enjoyable to listen to with these. Below are some pros and cons of these earphones.PRO'S+Incredible sound dynamics, you won't be disappointed.+Secure design, the earphones won't fall out of your ears.+Comes with a nice carrying box.+Look great.CON'S-Not much noise cancelling. Compared to "earbuds" with the cushion tips, these don't really seal up your ear canal and hence let sound through.-Relatively thin wire, we'll see how well the durability is.-Odd design, but it gets easier to put these earphones on the more you use them.Last updated: 7/24/15

VSounds so good!  Just recently bought Bose Soundlink Bluetooth over ear headphones and I love them, but these In-Ear headphones blow them out of the water - no comparison.  I had avoided in-ear in the past because the buds never stayed in my ears, but these fit just fine.  I can't stop listening.  So good.  iOS controls work great.

VBought these for my wife as a present, she always has problems with air buds being to large for her small ears, such as apple's standard size that comes with their phones and other products. These have three sizes of soft inserts, the smallest fit her perfectly and she is very impressed by the clarity of the sound they produce, when I asked her what she thought she said she loved them. A piece of foam over the microphone would be a good way to keep wind noise down, this is common to most ear buds of this style.

VGreat In-Ear Headphones, Very Little Discomfort.
p5063
sg5
VI really enjoy Bose headphones and I decided to get these In-Ear headphones because I don't like ear buds and I only use my Bose QuietComfort 25 and QuietComfort 15 when I'm at home. I use these at school in between classes (3 hour wait time) and I don't want to get sweat all over my ears.The sound is great, they're comfortable to wear, and they look beautiful. Having them go in my ear wasn't as unpleasant as I thought. The sound quality isn't as great as on-ear or cover-ear headphones, but it is WAY better than ear buds. The sound quality is fantastic and the rubber tips do a good job of holding the headphones in place and keep the music from bleeding out.If you're familiar with the Sony Psyc headphones then you know those headphones were one of the greatest headphones of all time. Fantastic sound quality, light, comfortable feel, and a great looking product. These headphones are at the top of the list when it comes to headphones, although they'd be in a different category because of their design.For In-Ear headphones, Bose, right now is the best you can get.

VI kept going through headphones like crazy. Sometimes I'd lose them but usually one ear bud would quit working or send static shocks to my inner ear. At the recommendation of a coworker, I bought Bose headphones and now I'll never buy anything else. They fit perfectly in my odd shaped ears, they don't block out the sounds of the street so I can walk around comfortably in them and even order coffee without taking them off. They produce great sound from my phone and the buttons on the cord are so handy. I'm done with cheap skull candy (or similar) headphones. I don't know how long these will last but they've already outlived any other headphones I've bought so I'm pretty pleased!

VGreat headphones, although not as loud as I would've expected.  The medium sized generally fit well, but I also run/ride motorcycle when listening to these, and to prevent the phones from falling out, I bumped up to using the Large buds.  The large isn't as comfortable, and I think are a little big for my ear, but they stay put better than the mediums.  So far, great sound quality and pretty comfortable, but they are on the expensive side.  How they stand the test of time will determine if they're worth the price or not, but so far I am pleased.

VThe answer to keeping In-Ear Headphones . . . in the ear!
p5145
sg5
VI am not a big fan of In-Ear Headphones. I have struggled to find any that will stay in place under even the most basic of activities. That doesn't even mention the sound. Most that I have tried require very precise fitting to get a decent tone. Move just slightly and they sound weak or loose a significant tonal range. I have nice pair of Shure's that sound good when held in the ear "just right". However, no matter what I try, I can't keep them in just that right position. That's just no good for me. A friend of mine suggested I try these Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones. The extra ear piece really does help keep them in position, even under moderate activity (I haven't really tried them under extreme activity). They other major factor they have in their favor is that they designed to provide good tone/sound resting at the ear canal, not inserted firmly in the canal. This makes them more comfortable and takes away the problem of them loosing their tone response if they shift around in the ear. The only disadvantage to this is that they do not provide any isolation from other noise interference. For me, that is not critical for my application. The sound quality is very good. They do not have the strongest bass response, but the bass tone is still very good. I hate over-emphasized bass response, so the more natural response that these provide is welcome. If you're looking for sub-woofer tone stuck in your ears you better look elsewhere. The rest of the tonal range is very good. I can't imagine getting much better response short of switching to a good set of over the ear headphones. I am not necessarily a big fan of Bose as some of there products are bit artificial when it comes to their approach to sound reproduction. That being said, I think they pretty much nailed it with these in-ears. Very nice.

VVery clear and precise sound, especially towards the higher end. Bass performance is anemic, and the the overall result is often tinny. It really hinges on what you run through them; they're fine for vocals (Simon & Bullwinkle, er, Garfunkel), passable for rock and pop, but cheesy for things like metal (Operation:Mindcrime was way way WAAAY off).  I tried three different headphones on each session, and these didn't have any significant pros or cons over much cheaper models.You will, in no uncertain terms, need some sort of headphone amplifier with these, which is also rather disappointing for something which seems to be aimed at jogger types. Even the small one on my PC was barely adequate.The ear thingies are interesting, and snug. They are comfortable overall, but then again, earbuds typically are.  Good presentation with the box an all, but I'd rather get them in a plastic clamshell and save $5 or so. Ditto for the officially-licensed-"Bose"-carrying case. I tossed both in the trash, as neither appeared to affect the sound quality one whit.Overall, I think you're paying for an gen-u-ine Lexus seat cover here, not a Lexus.

VThese are the best set of headphones I have ever owned. I bought a similar set many years ago that finally died in one ear so these are a replacement set. Bose must have updated the technology because these actually sound better than that original pair. These headphones are extremely comfortable to wear. They come with 3 sizes of tips for the ear so there is a size to fit any ear. Sometimes I almost forget they are in my ear they are so comfortable. I have never had them fall out. I've worn them to the gym as well as outdoors for a run. The sound quality is amazing with zero slippage. I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone.

VI've bought two pari of the IE2 and they worked great, each, for at least a year before the rubber coming apart. I bought these and before one month returned them because the volume controls did not work. The replacements are the same, not working after a couple weeks and now interfere with my iPhone from acting normal while providing terrible sound (crackling). As a previous satisfied customer of BOSE, do not order these headphones, big waste of money.

VThese are the best fitting, most superior audio ear buds I have ever used. BUT, this is the second set of 2 that has started to wear through to the wire after all but light use. Bose only offers 50% off of a replacement at best. This is all over chat forums, we just hoped that the replacements would be different. Not so. We have better success for durability with cheap earbuds. Don't waste your money.

For some reason these new ones (even though I'm decently confident they're using the same drivers) are lacking in bass and the lower frequencies.  Still better than many headphones out there, but I was disappointed.  Products should get better with new iterations.

VGreat Sound, construction could be a bit better.
p5370

VSimply put, these jokers stay in your ear. Shake your head, run, headbob, whatever. They stay in. They don't nestle into your ear very far enough to seal off more outside noise. However, that is by design and many people prefer that as they can hear more of what goes on around them.Great sound quality and comfortable. One downside is that the rubber used for the cord is kind of "sticky" and seems like it's super easy to snag going in our out of a pocket. I'm pretty careful with items like this and I use the case that comes with it, so this has not been a problem for me. But, if you're the jam-them-in-my-pocket-quickly type, beware. You're probably going to rip the cord and be really annoyed.

VI bought these headphones to replace my Apple Earpods, which just wouldn't stay in my ears.  Much to my delight, these Bose headphones are worth every penny!  They look, feel, and sound great.  It is important to note that these headphones do not plug your ear canal.  Instead, the silicone allows it to sit comfortably and securely, directing sound into the ear.  With the volume low, you can hear the ambient noises around you, which I really appreciate as that means I don't have to keep taking them off and putting them back on.

VGreat In-Ear Headphones
p5411
sg5
VI bought these headphones to use at work, where I will be spending significant time listening to music while I work. I have had these headphones for 3 days now and I am blown away by these headphones. I previously used the standard iPhone headphones and the difference in comfort and sound quality is substantial. I can now comfortably wear these headphones for 8 hours without my ear becoming bothered which is the best feature of these headphones in my opinion. The sound quality is also very good comparatively. The bass is more prominent and there is an overall crispness to the sound. I noticed background parts to some of my music that i had never heard before.The only minor complaint i have is the size of the headphone jack casing. It is about twice the size of the standard iPhone earbuds. No problems yet, but the shear size of the casing makes me feel as if i could break it easily while it is connected to my phone in my pocket.I will update my review if anything changes!

p5517
sg5
VI had the previous version of these for a couple years and I loved them, but they were stolen and I was forced to buy another set of headphones. Because I liked these, I bought them again. But somehow, they have updated the design and it's even better. My old pair was black and white braided, but these are a bit more gray, which I think will allow them to hide wear and grime much better. The cord material seems improved as well, as are the miniplug and control buttons.But what really blew me away was the sound. I mean, I use these more for talking than music - for music I would never think earbuds could come anywhere near a good set of can like my Grado Labs, but these Bose are quite surprisingly passable. Far and away the most natural sounding earbuds I've tried. No exaggerated bass and distortion like the Beats or Skullcandy, and ridiculously better and crisper high tones than the Beyerdynamic and Sure buds.Given the portability, the ingenious way it sits in your ear cycling or running with no problem, and the mic - I don't think you're going to find better.

After months of use, I can say they didn't disappoint.However, beware that these offer ZERO sound isolation. Forget using these when there is a car passing in the street or when you are in the subway. In quieter environments, they offer a pretty good sound quality with decent bass.

VI've owned multiple pairs of these headphones over the years and am always impressed with them. For one, it's always extremely difficult to find a pair of headphones that stays in my ears. Most ear bud style headphones just want to pop out five minutes after I put them in my ears. Bose has had the "wings" on their ear buds for at least five years now and they help in always keeping the ear bud in place.I understand that some users are disappointed that these headphones don't cancel out the mouse, but they aren't advertised to... I like That they don't because I typically use these headphones when I'm walking the dog, in a waiting room or just lounging around the house. It's my understanding that if you want the mouse canceling feature on these headphones, you can buy the tips here on amazon that actually stick into your ears and block out some of the sound around you.All in all, these headphones are a great fit, cheaper than some of the other "premium" brands out there and have a typical Bose sound. Can't go wrong as long as you aren't looking for complete noise cancellation.

I wear them at work, when doing computer work and they are great at blocking out unwanted noise as well. Would recommend these in a heart beat! :)

p5711
sg5
VI received these yesterday and immediately used them for a 2-hour conference call. They are incredibly comfortable and they don't fall out (like the iPhone OEM buds do)! I received no sound quality complaints for the mic, but I have yet to ask some discerning ears for their opinions.I haven't spent too much time listening to music yet, but I did give them a test with several different musical styles. I'm no audiophile, but I can tell crappy phones from decent ones and these are definitely decent.One thing I wondered about when I ordered these was what the inside of the included case looks like. I couldn't find that anywhere, so I'm attaching a photo. The case is very lightweight and not as brick-like as the pictures make it appear.Finally, if you're interested in a 4-pole extension cable and are considering the SoundTrues, you should probably prefer the Bose SoundSports instead. Basically the same thing as these, but (supposedly) water/sweat-proof AND includes the extension cable, making the cost difference well worth it.

VArrived in new packaging, great sound on the audiophile level, only drawback is the fit.I have extensive cauliflower ear in my left ear from wresting, grappling, and competing. Why does this matter? It interferes with the way the inner ear portion fits (thus 4 out of 5 stars rating). Ended up using the small fitting (left) large fitting (right) and the buds work without too much slippage... although require regular adjustment through your workouts.If you have normal ears, buy away! If not, sucks to be you.Either way, I highly recommend getting yourself a set of these if you are anal about high quality sound.

VThe sound. The sound quality of these earphones are amazing. They are not studio quality so do not expect to hear every little tick and snap in a song. These are not the standard stock earphone quality either. It has a high quality that is just right for the musically-inclined person.The durability. I have been using these to jog every day, and I bounce a lot, so does this. I have not observed any tears at all in the cable, and they do not slip off my ears even with my hyperactive body.The verdict. This is a great-sounding, durable earphones that you can use for some hard workouts without worrying about its durability or if it would fall off.

VI LOVE these headphones. Seriously, I cannot sing their praises enough. I've been searching high and low for a comfortable pair of headphones to wear while rehearsing for dance performances, and these fit the bill. With so many turns and head whips in dance, I needed a pair that stayed put, and I first tried all those headphones that wrap around your ears and/or head. While they stayed in place, they were incredibly uncomfortable after an hour. These headphones never hurt, and they never fall out! Additionally, they're sweat-proof, and they have certainly stood up to the test. I recommend these to all my dancer friends!

VExcellent ear buds. I must have deformed ears because regular ear buds never stay put in my ears -- especially not when I'm running or working out. These are awesome though. They never fall out yet are wicked comfortable. They also still let enough ambient sounds through so that I can hear cars approaching or people talking to me (as long as my music is playing quietly enough). The wires are thinner than I'd like -- I have a hunch they won't last long. (These are my second of Bose ear buds ... the first set had to be replaced because the wire insulation -- which are thicker than on these -- hardened and cracked, though they still work well ... I use them for yard work now. Oh, and the original set is something like 5 years old, so they did last plenty long to be happy with them.) Sound quality, of course, is exceptional. Well worth the premium price ... though that's the only reason I knocked off one star: I suspect they could be about $20 cheaper. In fact, Bose would probably sell a whole lot more at that price.

Would definitely purchase these again if needed.  I can answer my phone without having to take it out of my banjee and adjust the sound as well.  Very, very happy with my purchase.

VI just got them and I do love them.. BUT:: I wish they had a button to skip sings.. Thats why I only gave it 4 stars.. Bose is a good company and why wouldn't they have this on the control piece.. And also the control piece feels cheap.. But all in all the sound is great.. Just wish they fix these things.. I'll keep them because most earphones hurt my ears but are very comfortable..

p5829

VI had high expectations when ordering the Bose Freestyle Earbuds but they didn't live up to the hype. The headphones fit very well since there are different sizes of the earpiece that fits all sizes of ears. The problem that I have with the headphone is that the midrange of the headphones is terrible. I have a really hard time hearing the vocals of the singers and it just comes out muddy. I feel as if the treble is wayy too overpowering and just drowns out the midrange. Maybe I have a defective headset or something but the vocals are not clear.

p5835
sg5
VAlthough I don't use earbuds often is because of discomfort after awhile, so I usually use on or over ear headphones when not using the floor/shelf speakers. When I do use buds it's generally for radio/laptop, save the headphones for my stereo systems.As far a buds go, I have over a half dozen for the occasional use - today my youngest kid got me these for a gift (fathers day) he bought from Amazon.Although none of my others buds are high end, I'll say listening to one of my radios (RS DX-398) for a few hours I find these are comfortable and have decent sound for buds.

VBeing a fan of Bose for it's quality of sound (and owner of the QC20 cancelling noise earbuds when I travel), I bought these ones for normal exercise.They are definitely better than the apple earbuds that come with the iphone, however, it's essential to get the appropriate eartip size for your ear.These earphones come with Small, Med and Large tips for your convenience. I got the best results with the small, and although there is no noise cancelling feature it does block more external sound than others.

p5845
sg5
VThe sound quality of these are good. Definitely within the price range and deliver the kind of Base you expect from Bose. My only grievance is the large amount of sound leakage. The plastic ear pieces do not have buds on the end to trap sound in the ear, so I found myself having to turn up the volume and getting looks from people around me since they could all hear my music. I had to buy a pair of plastic tips with buds from Bose for $10 (they normally come with the sound canceling models) which helped a lot with this issue.

VThese earbuds work as claim. They fit into the ears  and will not come out unless you pull on them hard.  The quality of the sound is superb. The only changes I would make to these earbuds would be to shorten the cord. I am a triathlete and find that the extra cord gets in the way.  I'd like to clip my shuffle to my visor so all I would need would be may be a foot of cord.  Maybe sell a shorter version of the same earbuds would be awesome.

VBose is just the bomb!!! Tried many other earphones and can't believe the sound that comes from these little plastic buds. It absolutely is like the music is inside the middle of your head. The base may be in your right ear and the piano in your other while the vocal is coming from somewhere else IN YOUR HEAD. I bought a cheaper wireless headphone and believe me the extra money is worth it. The Bose are so comfortable and the wires so light you forget you have them on. I learned with purchasing wireless speakers that Bose is so superior to whatever is out there that paying the extra is worth it. This (American !Yay!) company deserves respect for enhancing people's lives with such high-quality, innovative products.I also love that I could choose a color beside black or white as the red makes it so easy to spot among all my black and white devices and charging cords.

p5905

VThese headphones are good IF you are comfortable with hearing a lot of background noise. I thought the ear tips were going to be deeper in to justify the "noise isolation" that everyone refers to. Unfortunately, these ear tips are not deep enough for me. If the ear tips were deeper, I guarantee that the sound quality will be of a much higher quality headphones. So instead, I bought a triple flange ear tip and just replaced it with the original ear tips. With the triple flange ear tips, everything is much clearer and doesn't affect the sportiness of the earbuds much. I was expecting more for $100 but it is what it is. It's not as great as expected.

Yesterday I left my headphones in the pocket of some shorts I washed. I also put those shorts in the dryer for an hour. This morning I remembered where they were and got worried. I plugged them into my phone and tested them out. They sound the exact same as when they were brand new.

VBest Wired Sports Earbuds under $200
p5964
sg5
VThis review is for the Bose Freestyles:I did a lot of research in finding the best pair of earbuds that were sporty, wired, and had great sound quality, and these were the earbuds that became my choice.One thing to do right after you buy these earbuds is to get the Bose StayHear PLUS tips. These will provide a lot more noise canceling and will deepen the bass and mid quality.Build quality:The actual driver casings are probably made out of the nicest that plastics that you could get. The wires are a perfect thickness and length and the remote is bulky but not too much, with easily distinguisable buttons. No fraying or tears yet.Sound quality:I always equalize my music before listening to it, and so should you, to get the best use out of these earbuds. First I will talk about the quality with the provided earbud tips:By the way the Freestyles, SoundSports, and the SoundTrues have the same drivers and sound quality. These drivers have pretty good clarity overall, with lows controlled and represented well, mids present but not overdone, and highs nice and crisp for most music genres.With the Bose StayHear Plus tips, you can expect a lot more noise isolation (20-30% without and 60-90% with). I could use these just fine while mowing lawns and using a really loud edger, I would just have to turn up the volume a bit more. The tips let the bass become more full and deep, while keeping the highs nice and clear for most genres. Get these tips, because they are only around $10 on Amazon.Summary:These are the best Wired Sports Earbuds with great sound under $200, with great color options and portability.

VLOVED these but I returned them to upgrade to the QC20. After using QC20 I realized that it doesn't feel nearly as comfortable as these, and I regret returning them. Can't feel any bass at all, but theres essentially not seal with these, so that makes sense. Its not meant to be sound isolating, but coming from the apple earpods I was VERY happy with this purchase. I really like the carrying case as well, had a nice premium feel. The stay hear tips are my favorite among earbuds now.Should not for those who don't know, this doesn't really go IN your ear. It sits on the outside, so your ears don't feel plugged, or hot (maybe thats just me). Its honestly the most comfortable earbuds I've ever used.I'm not an audiophile but I really like the sound, it was the first time I really heard a really neutral sound, but I really do miss the bass that comes with sealed in ears. For me this meant that these were terrible for the gym. My housemate amps up the bass, but it just sounds really muddled then. He added the tips from the qc20 which seal your ears in, which does allow for more bass and sound isolation, but you lose the comfort. Might be my imagination, but the both of us felt it didn't sound as great with the qc20 stay hear tips on this.Overall: I LURFFFFF these :)

VI bought these from Best Buy and I really like them. The sound quality is very good and with the right size rubber inserts they do not ever fall out of my ears, even while working out or doing cross training, which is what I was hoping for!The true test is always how long they hold up. My headphones usually last 1-2 months before they short, but I usually buy much cheaper ones. I have only had these for a few weeks but I am glad I bought them. I have very large inner ear canals and headphones that fall out have been a chronic problem in the past. So far it is not an issue with these.

VI wanted to like these ear buds, bud no matter what adapter I used they did not sit fully in my ear, so A LOT of outside noise entered and at a point I could barely hear the music anymore. I have smaller ears and a small ear canal. If sitting in a very quiet environment or pressing them into my ears more the sound was very good, but not $100 good IMO. I sent them back after 3 uses and am still searching...

VGreat Fit - no fatigue can be worn for days
p6082
sg5
VI did not purchase these from Amazon - but frequent the site and the reviews so I thought I would add mine here.  I bought mine from BestBuy a week ago.Now one to the quality of the headphones.  I must say I am usually skeptical of BOSE products as I have never been too impressed with standard BOSE speakers for home and such.  But since they released the Sound True line of headphones I have been interested.  I really like the sound of the bluetooth over the ear headphones but can't justify $250.  I am a bit of a headphone nerd, I have several different pairs of Berdynamics, Sennhiser, and Klipsch.  As far as earbuds they are now the best sounding and MOST comfy buds I own.  The comfort level of these things is really what makes me like them the most.  I wear headphones most of the day at work, I was recently using my ON-Ear units but the company wants us to use ear buds.  I can't stand to have ear buds jammed in my ear canal for long periods of time, so these are perfect.  Even though they dont have the "seal" like the others, they still have awesome sound.  Now, with that said they do loose some sounds because of that seal.  But for the design and comfort of these, I feel like it's justified sound quality.  I have not found any other headphones with this style of fit that sounds this good, and even to compare it to my ear buds that do "seal", they come out on top.  I just know these would sound even better if they did have the "seal" design.  But I would not own them if they did have that design because these are BY FAR the most comfortable set of ear buds I have had in my ears.The build quality is also top notch, they have some weight to them.  They feel very sturdy.  I feel the sound is also improving more and more as they "break-in".  I have not ran a straight burn in test, I like to let my headphones burn in naturally with using the product, even if they didn't improve any more at all I am perfectly happy with the sound they provide now.  Great set of buds!

p6087
sg5
VEDIT: Had to reduce my 5-star rating after some use, because they started to have a clicking sound when I walk, as if there's a "tap" with every step I take. I can't figure out if the noise is originating from the wires, or inside the earbuds themselves, or what.Previous review (still all true except for the current clicking problem):Excellent sound quality, including bass. They don't get very loud, and are not noise-cancelling so you still hear outside noise with them on. This makes them perfect for walking, running, biking, etc., since you still want to be aware of your surroundings while moving. They stay nicely in your ears with the design, and there's a clip where you can clip the wire to your shirt to keep the weight of the wire from tugging on the earbuds.

Vdont do it, luxury brand price, knock off quality - I'm disappointed in this company
p6093
sg5
VI purchased these headphones for over $130 and after only a few months the rubber on the cord is fraying/cracking in 11 different locations on the wire. Near the controller, both ear buds, the plug and in between. I have electrical tape up and down the wires just to make sure I don't short these out! I'm SUPER disappointed in the overall quality of the product as the sound is good but not $100 better than the next brand.  Another brand I purchased for $30 is as good as the Bose and the overall quality of the materials used is much better. You're paying for a hi-line brand with these and getting a cheap knock off quality product. VERY DISAPPONTING and makes me not want to buy any other BOSE products because of my concern of their lack of overall quality relative to the price.

VAmazing head phone! Very good sound quality, good bass. Also perfect for runners; I have very small ears and the clear part fit into my ears perfectly. They stay in while I run and combined with the little clip it makes it so the cord doesn't bounce so you don't have that annoying sounds in your ears!

VThey won't fall out when running
p6122

VI am usually a fan of in-canal earphones because the earbud type hurt my ears, and usually don't have great bass. I have been running pretty seriously for the past 6 months and have gone through several sets of canal phones - Sony, JVC, Skullcandy, etc. They all seem to jiggle loose while I run, especially when I get hot and sweaty. In particular I had one set with the in-line mic and controls that made the problem worse; the weight of the switch bouncing around while I run tugged the cord and pulled the left side out every time.I decided to indulge in the Bose and it was worth the cost. They way the earpiece is designed makes them hook into your ears very securely. I can give the cord a good tug and they will not come out; if anything that hooks them in tighter. Add the cord clip which you can clip to you shirt and these are not going anywhere. The length of the cord is just right - long enough to reach a device in my shorts pocket or my armband without excessive length flopping everywhere where I have to coil it up. They come with 3 different sizes of earpieces so they should fit pretty much anyone.The sound quality is what you would expect from Bose, which is phenomenal, accurate sound. I'll note that even though they go into the ear canal a bit, because of they way they are designed they still allow outside sound in to a certain degree; enough to keep you aware of your surroundings but not enough to interfere with the quality. If you are looking for strictly in-canal phones in the same price range you might check out Shure.I got the ones without the cell phone controls because I mainly use these for running with an MP3 player, and have no use for that feature, plus I didn't want the mass of the switch tugging on the cord while I run. Although, these stay in well enough that it might not be an issue.Add in the nice case and these are a great set of headphones for running and other sports. I just wore them for a 10k race and had no problems, just great Bose sound.UPDATE: The other day I left them in the pocket of my shorts and discovered them after they had gone through the washer and dryer. I was about to be bummed that I had to buy a new pair, but I plugged them in and they still sound glorious! They felt silky smooth from the fabric softener too!

VI was looking for headphones that wouldn't hurt my ears. The rubber that holds the buds in your ears is very comfortable. I can wear them for a few hours without discomfort. They also have great sound. It is crisp like other Bose products I own. I have also used the microphone to make hands free calls and it is working great (no distortion and the sound is clear). I highly recommend these headphones. I also like the red color.

p6151

VThese are some of the worst headphones I've ever had. I had a pair of Bose earbuds that were about six years old. I use them almost every day and absolutely loved them. I finally wanted a earbud with a remote control microphone and control. So I decided on the newer model of the same one I have now.  However, I was absolutely dissatisfied with the new Bose model. The new model is much heavier in the year and has a few other annoyances. I am returning these and buying a new pair of the old version from eBay. Hopefully Bose can redeem themselves in the future, but these are going back.

VWish they had made more significant advancements since the last generation. I used to own the IE2s and I cannot hear a difference at all. I wasn't expecting much but I don't think they made any improvements since the creation of this line of headphones.It's the same price as the old ones so at least they didn't make it a worse deal. They sound pretty good, but if you're thinking about upgrading from your MIE2s/IE2s don't bother.On my Droid DNA the buttons change the song or pause, no volume control.

VMy whole family uses and loves these ear buds. I've had mine for 3 years. Ear buds stay in while doing physical activity, which is important. Sound quality is amazing. Bose also has an excellent warranty. They replaced my old set when the plastic got frayed. When my cat chewed up a pair, they sold me a second pair for half price, which I thought was very generous.

VFits pretty well and stays in. When originally purchasing, I thought the cable was completely black and was surprised to see two-tone cables (black and gray) when I opened the box. I looked back at the pictures and it was there, so that one's on me. I thought these would be in-ear sealed headphones from the pictures, but they aren't. They sit in the ear canal but do not seal it so the lows are not that loud and for me too much outside noise gets through. If you're looking for that, this is the pair for you. On a plane, I couldn't really hear any of the music except for the highs. In a quieter environment, the sound quality is ok, but I was looking for better for > $75 headphones.

VBose is obviously known for it's great speakers, and these headphones are designed to fit securely in your ear.  However, among the many headphones that I've tried, this is among the most uncomfortable pair.  This is very subjective, but none of the 3 sets of earpieces included in the package fit me well enough.  The best set of earpieces felt fine for about 10-20 minutes, but beyond that time it became very uncomfortable to wear the headphones.  This is to the extent that I will not wear them any longer, which kills me that I spent $100 for that, and I will gladly go back to my panasonic rphje120k headphones.  Honestly, the sound quality is almost comparable, they are surprisingly comfortable and I can wear them indefinitely without actually feeling them, they have passive noise cancellation just because of the way they fit inside your ear, and they are less than 1/10 the cost of these headphones.The greatest sound quality in the world is meaningless if you don't want to even wear the headphones after 20 minutes.

VAs most, I find these to be very good buds. The bass isn't a thumping bass but very clear.I attended the 2015 Rolex 24 at Daytona and as an alternative to using a over-the-ear headset for my scanner, I instead used these. They were great noise muffing, not complete cancellation and provided very good volume and clarity.
