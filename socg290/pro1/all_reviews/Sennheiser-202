VSennheiser is known for professional grade headphones and even one of their cheapest models stands up to whatever music you throw at it. Bass and mid tones sound excellent while not becoming too muddled. I've tested these headphones with rock/pop (Arcade Fire, Broken Bells) and rap/hip-hop (Kanye West - My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy) with great results. As long as you have high quality files there is no hiss (I mainly have 256-320 kbps files with some 192 kbps files). Sound leak was not evident because these are closed headphones (as opposed to the Sennheiser  HD555's which are open). I have a medium size head and these headphones fit me perfectly. They have a slight warming effect on the ears which is not bothersome at all. Just to clarify, these headphones (HD 202 MK II) are the same as the original HD 202, with different packaging. These will work out of the package with any iPod, laptop, desktop and include an larger adapter for other uses. If you are still using the standard Apple earbuds or cheap earbuds (Joby, Skullcandy, etc.) and have never experienced the sound of a over-the-ear headphone, buy these for an inexpensive (but not "cheap") intro into an audiophiles world.EDIT: For those who are having problems with the cord length - use the included cord take-up. There is a notch on each side to clip the cord into. The cord looks like it won't fit but it will if you position the cord sideways and insert it.

VI basically just want to echo the review from "DeafInOneEar," who was writing about the HD203s. I owned two pairs of those headphones and have had four pairs of these HD 202s. As far as I can tell they are almost identical...especially in that all of them have eventually lost sound in one ear.I keep buying them because the sound is really great, as many reviews have explained. And they are cheap. And the extra long cord is wonderful for my purposes. I have earbuds for walking around and a pair of the HD 428s for when I don't need a long cord and/or want more oomph in the bass.But to reiterate....all SIX pairs of this style Sennheiser headphones have died on me in one ear, sometimes left and sometimes right. I don't yank them or mistreat them. There is no inciting event...one time a pair died while I was sitting at my desk, I just moved to grab the remote and it cut out. Two or three pairs have died while I was walking around outside in the winter...I live in Maine, and I'm guessing the cold makes the copper very brittle.The point is that the cords are thin and cheap, so don't expect these to last longer than six months.There are two excellent things about these headphones...they sound great for the money, and they have a TWO YEAR WARRANTY.I just figured this out last week, and I feel like an idiot. I could have saved like $100, though the inconvenience of warranty returns is considerable.So buy them, by all means, but print out your receipt and print out the Sennheiser service request form, staple them together and tuck them away. You're going to need them.

VSennheiser is a great company that manufactures headphones that even Santa Claus sometimes drops these off into chimneys during Christmas Eve. Note the word, "sometimes." While these headphones produce a favorable quality of music, the comfort level is low. After about 45~ minutes of usage, my ears began to hurt and I had to take it off to cool off my ears for a bit. Let me review the pros and cons of this set:PROs:-Cheap. You won't be able to find most headphones that can produce quality music at this price range ($30~).-Durable; when you hold it in your hands, it feels it can last quite a while. The build is strong, unlike Bose.-Quality; if you've been listening to your sub-$10 earphones or your Apple iPod earbuds, then this set of headphones will seem almost too good to be true.-Cord length. The cord length stretches around six+ feet.-Portable; you can hang it around your neck, stuff it (carefully) into your backpack/purse (i've never had purses, mind you), etc. Just have common sense not to place it in unfavorable places.-Hear outside noises; you can partially hear outside noises. This characteristic can be useful to you if you set a timer on stove and need to hear the alarm, if you have sleeping babies in the other room, or in case you hear thieves break into your house.CONs:-Quality; if you've owned above average headphones such as Bose or the more advanced Sennheiser, then this pair will sound absolute trash to you. You will immediately notice that these lack clear sounds and tend to "mix up" the sounds.-Comfort; as I mentioned, the comfort level can become frustrating after half an hour of continuous use. If you have medium-large ears, then look for something else. If you have small ears, get these at your will.-Barely any noise-isolation; if you wish to focus on the music, movie, or games without noises to interfere your experience, these will disappoint.Here are some alternatives (better alternatives, I say):*Panasonic RP-HTX7*JVC HA-S700If you can dish in some extra cash...*Audio-Technica ATH-M30*Beyerdynamic DT235

VA review from the Older Generation
p26
sg5
VIm a 58 year young guy whose favorite music is music of the 60's,70's, 80'a with a little Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Elvis built in for good measures on occasion. I like the old music.  I could afford a pair of $200 headphones, but I decided to give these a shot for $14.99 special on Amazon.  A great deal I just had to try.  I have tested these on a MacBook Pro, a 4th generation iPod, and a Motorola Droid X.  ABBA, Queen, Traveling Wilbury,  heard notes I have not heard before. I must also mention that I am starting to get a wee bit hard of hearing and when my equalizer is properly set, these phones are awesome.  For comfort they are ok not great, you certainly know they are on. I have to fiddle with them every so often as they seem to warm my ears a little.  The cord IS long and a bit thin, but if you are careful it should be fine. I would definately recommend these if you are just starting with headphones and want a good deal for the money which I dont think can be beat.

VGreat Headphones, at a Great Price!
p32
sg5
VI am a casual music listener with a varied taste in music. I most commonly listen to classical, jazz, or movie scores while I'm studying, but I have a large library of classic rock and pop music that is on quite frequently.I bought these headphones because I was sick of wearing my earbuds for long periods of time. It was irritating to have to stop listening to my music every couple hours because of the discomfort in my ears. I searched the internet thoroughly to find a pair of cups that would fit my needs on a college student's budget, and these seemed to fit the bill.I'm no expert on headphones, but these are great! I immediately noticed a HUGE difference in quality from my earbuds - the bass sound is fantastic, giving every genre of music a fuller, more robust sound. I can hear so many more details in my music that I didn't notice with just my earbuds. I don't know how they compare to higher-priced headphones, since I haven't tried any, but for my use, they're perfect. They are extremely comfortable. They are fully adjustable, and fit on a wide range of heads - my Dad tried them on, and he didn't even have to use the largest size to make them fit (he normally has trouble buying hats unless they're custom-made because of his big noggin). I wear them on and off for the majority of the day, and they haven't yet gotten uncomfortable. I think the longest stretch I've ever gone with them on is about 5 hours.Bottom line: Comfortable, affordable headphones that bring up the quality of any genre of music you prefer. I highly recommend them!

VBEWARE! Amazon sends the older HD202 when you order the newer HD202MKII (at the higher price)
p38
sg5
VJust received these Sennheiser HD202 headphones from Amazon.com.  Sound quality is good, with a rich bass, slightly brittle treble, but pleasant mid-range (presence) for classical music.  Too soon to tell if there will be wearer fatigue or excess ambient noise in the closed headphones, but seems a good value for the price.  However, do not bother paying extra for the newer HD202MKII version -- Amazon ships the older version even if you pay the higher price ($26.88 vs $31.48), which I did. I saw this warning before in these reviews but did not heed it.  I assumed Amazon had corrected the problem by now.  Unfortunately the return postage will eat up the difference in price. Caveat emptor!

VI'm sorry that I didn't try these as soon as I received them, because I would definitely have returned them.  I needed to replace an older Sennheiser (the HD201).  Seeing that there was now a model HD202, and that it had good reviews, I bought one HD201, and also the HD202 as a spare.  I wish that I had simply purchased two of the HD201's.  As some other reviewers have written, these are too tight!  I'm a female with a small head, but cannot wear these for more than about five minutes.  No matter how I adjust them or try to stretch them, they hurt!  I do feel that the sound is a step up from the HD201, but what good are headphones if they're not wearable?  If you decide to purchase them anyway, I strongly suggest that you test them out during the return period.

VGreat bass, terrible cable
p54
sg5
VThese cans provide good noise isolation and are perfect entry level headphones for club use, but the cable quality is terrible. The connections at the earcups tend to fray and break, even with intermediate usage. I went through three pairs before I realised that the problem wasn't me, but the quality of the connection. If you're a DJ just starting out, you're better off getting the HD212 Pro's (also by Sennheiser). They cost a little more, but the better build means that you won't have to replace them nearly as often

VGreat Entry Level Headphones!
p65
sg5
VI ordered these headphones because I wanted a good pair of reliable sturdy and affordable headphones. As a college student, I cant really invest in 200-300 dollar headphones (although the quality is worth the price) but these headphones turned out to be a great alternative. First of all, they are Sennheisers. The difference from using regular apple ipod white headphones to these headphones is like comparing laptop speakers to full sound surround sound. The bass has great response although it could be better. I am writing this review on the basis of its low price. For ~$20 they deliver great quality. The mid tones are clear and crisp and the bass is rich. The bass could be better but again, these speakers do not have an independent power source. The audio cable jack is extremely long. I believe its about 15 feet. They come included with a cable reducer though, which sometimes is a hassle but not too much. The one and only complaint I have with them is that after ~45 minutes of use, your ears become hot. They are not uncomfortable but sometimes they can get too hot. They are quite comfortable though. There is padding on the upper side of the headphones and the construction of the headphones feel like 100 dollar headphones. For the price, the quality is amazing. I would recommend this product for someone who wants to have the headphone experience but not if you want professional sound. Great product

VHigh quality sound and design
p71
sg5
VThese are easily the best headphones I've ever owned. I wanted something higher quality than ear buds that could reduce outside noise without having to spend a ton on expensive noise cancelling headphones. I also was looking for headphones that would be comfortable to wear for very long periods of time (like all day long) and had a longer than average cord so I wasn't tied really closely to my computer. I was expecting to pay around $100, but I'm glad I didn't because these are an amazing value.Sound quality:Their sound is all around amazing, I'm not an audiophile but I do notice the amazing quality from these headphones. I never knew what I was missing from my music and games until I put these on. The first difference I noticed that set these apart from any headphones I've had before was the bass. They actually have really good bass, but the mid and high tones are equally as impressive. There isn't any sacrifice in any area of sound quality.Build quality:I don't doubt these will last me for years to come due to their durable design. I've owned headphones in the past that wore out from plastic fatigue where they had to bend a lot, not going to be a problem with the 202 MK II. These headphones are designed in such a way that there is no major stress point to fatigue and weaken.Smart design:There are a couple of design features that I really love about these particular headphones. First of all, it is simply 3 pieces: two earphones and the piece that goes over your head. The earphones adjust on the headpiece in such a way that my hair doesn't get caught and pulled like many headphones tend to do. The pair I got are also exactly as pictured, the ear pieces do not touch when I'm not wearing them, so I don't have to pry them apart a long way to get them over my head, which means they don't squeeze and hurt my head like some other headphones. The cord is also very long, like over 5 feet, but the headphones come with a nice spool you can wind the cord up on and it has notches cut out so you can stick the ends of the cord though and it won't unravel. The spool also has a clip so you can hook it to your belt or clothes.Comfort:I'm a male with an average sized head. Unlike other headphones I've owned, these can be worn for several hours without even noticing them. The earphones and headpiece are all padded with a very light and airy padding that does not cause me to sweat. The padding does not have memory, meaning the foam returns to its original shape and doesn't become squished down and less effective. The only complaint that I have is I would like there to be a little more padding around the earpieces because they don't quite hold themselves off my ear lobes. If I don't have them positioned correctly they can hurt my lobes after a while. However, once I took some time to get used to them, I learned to position them correctly and now can wear these all day without any discomfort at all.Best use:These are great for people who want great sound while sitting for long periods of time. Movie buffs, gamers, or music fans will not be disappointed. I would not recommend these headphones for active people, as they are large (obviously since they are over-ear headphones) and the very long cord+cord spool may be inconvenient for walking or jogging around.

VThese headphones were a complete bargain at < $40, and I would recommend anyone on a budget to grab a pair and enjoy. My music collection includes jazz, afrobeat, hip hop, soul, punk, ska, reggae, and country, and there isn't a genre in which these headphones didn't perform well. The bass response is strong (but not so strong it drowns out other frequencies), and the mids and highs sound great too. I never would have thought music could sound this good in sub-$50 cans. I am listening to Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On album in them as I type this and it sounds perfect. The sound is spaced out nicely and every frequency is clear and well-represented. Every instrument in the mix shines like it should and the headphones grasp all of that warm analog goodness of the amplifiers and recording equipment used when Marvin made the album. Buy these headphones and love them. They sound great and they are ridiculously durable. I am a graduate student and these phones go everywhere in my messenger bag and get at least eight hours of burn every day.

VSennheiser 201 v 202.  tested on my PC with using mediamonkey***Get the 201***I already had the 201's, but my g/f keeps stealing them, so I thought I would try the 202s, more of a good thing right?!Cup size:201: the opening for the ear is a 1/3 larger than the 202s. fit nicely around the ear.202: are almost on-the-ear style, although they are still comfortable. (no I don't have floppy dumbo ears :p )Volume:201: 50% is 202s. in others words, you have to double the volume on the 201s, to get about the same sound output as you just had with the 202s.202:  200% of 201. they are very sensitive.Sound Quality:  I am a layman so bear with me.201: balanced, natural sounding. Good imaging. You can close your eyes and almost see the band, picking out subtle sounds.202: strong bass & highs. At a volume where you can hear the vocals & mids clearly, the bass & highs become painful pretty quickly. It has to be loud for clarity.Other thoughts:Many people complain of the 202s being uncomfortable. My belief is they are actually experiencing fatigue from the sound pressure of the bass which is required to hear the vocals and mids clearly.These two headphones are dirt cheap, yet one is clearly (201) better sounding than the other. I wonder which moderately priced (@$40-70)set might have far better imaging, balance, allow you to hear subtle sounds while still having full, rich bass, etc..?  A few in that price range are: Sony MDR-V6, Audio-Technica ATH-M30, JVC HA-RX900? I would love your comments. I am older so a quality set where I don't need to turn it up as loud would be wise.

VAt $24.22 for Prime members, these headphones blow away the competition. When I first heard about Sennheiser and how amazing their headphone technology was, I started looking at sampling-quality headphones just to play from my computer and android. The prices were high, but the reviews for sound quality were unmatched. As I started looking into the cheaper headphones, I did not see a drop in quality among the reviewers. I had been using -cheap- Sony on-ears, listened to some Bose AE-2s, and Bose QC15s to see where I wanted to throw my money and how much to throw. I came across these and could not be happier. After two solid weeks of having these headphones at my office, I would like to share my own, personal, consumer review.Sound = 5These headphones produce some of the best, crispest, fullest sounds that I have ever listened to. The vocals are high and clear, while the bass is low and deep. I have listened to everything from opera to house, and each song -sounds- more detailed than ever before. They officially range from 18 to 18,000 Hz with a 32 ' nominal impedance and a 115 dB sound pressure level. All of the tech-specs aside, these headphones will provide you some of the best sound available without hurting your wallet. Also because they are closed cups, they will naturally filter out some outside noise. Read: they are -not- noise-cancelling headphones, but they do filter out noise as much as cupping your hands over your ears.Build = 4The HD 202 IIs look great to me, but may not look great to everyone. I like the design that employs the adjustable earcups, rather than a retractable wire that recedes into the headband. The earcups have a good range of rotation as well, allowing the cups to find their places over your ears. The headband angle is the only truly awkward part of the headphones: they are set at an angle so that the front of the band is closer to your head than the back of the band. The preview picture is a little misleading, because it shows the band at a flat angle. In fact, it is slightly beveled to the front of the head. Again, this is fine with me, but others may not be as on-board.Comfort = 4I have worn the HD 202 IIs for a few different durations: 30 minutes, 2 hours, and 8 hours. These headphones are 100% comfortable for 30 minutes and even 2 hours. However at about 5 or 6 straight hours of wear, they do tend to get uncomfortable. For myself, the padding on the headband is a little stiff. This can be remedied, however, by squeezing and releasing it for a few minutes. The headphones also grip the head a little hard. This can also be fixed for a while by removing the headphones and bending the headband flat for a few minutes. Both of these remedies are quick fixes that will last throughout an 8-hour listen-fest. The only thing that is more difficult to remedy are the cups pressing against my ears. My head and ears (which are both larger than most people's) become sore after long (greater than 3 hours) of listening.The Sennheiser HD 202 IIs are by far some of the best headphones I have ever listened to. For those people looking for a pair of headphones that are top-notch quality without taking a punch in the wallet, the Sennheiser HD 202 IIs are the headphones for you.

VPro Quality Sound At Bargain Price - Comfort A Problem
p94
sg5
VBottom Line:  Sound quality that compares well with $100 and $200 headphones...for under 30 bucks...an amazing bargain for people who like "around the ear" headphones.I have never owned the PERFECT headphone.  Some were too heavy...some too flimsy...some had too much bass or thin treble.  The Sennheiser HD 202 MK II headphones are amazingly good headphones at a bargain price.  Although advertised as "on ear" headphones, the pads fit entirely around my ears and rest against my head, not on my ears.No headphone is comfortable for two or three hours of listening, but I find the "around the ear" design to work best for me, as they don't press my ears against my eyeglasses frame.  And, the "around the ear" type does a good job of sealing the headphone to the head, providing the clearest bass and blocking out extraneous noise.The Sennheiser HD 202 is adjustable, by sliding each earpiece up or down.  Even when adjusted for the least pressure, I find they feel too tight after an hour or so.I want headphones that reproduce voices in a natural way, whether a male baritone, or a female soprano.  The HD 202 does a very good job with voices...they sound natural without the false added warmth some headphones provide.  The unique characteristics of a singer's voice is created by how the singer produces a fundamental of a note, and the harmonics of the note.With the HD 202, the voice fundamental is very natural and accurate, but the harmonics seem slightly muted...likely due to a combination of my own treble hearing loss, and the HD 202's lack of an artificial boost in the treble region.The HD 202 produces bass with accuracy and control.  Many headphones produce a heavy, loud bass, but every note sounds much the same.  When listening to Paul McCartney's bass playing, it should be obvious that his bass line often is an inventive variation of the melody of the song...not a soggy series of "thump...thump...thump..." The HD 202 has bass clarity and accuracy that is superior to headphones selling for much higher prices, including some of the mega-expensive headphones.A lot of folks will be irritated by the TEN FOOT long cord of the HD 202.  This long cord is designed to let you plug into the computer at work and walk around the office, or plug into the TV at home and sit on the sofa ten feet away.  But, if you are going for a walk, you need to wind up the extra eight feet of cord and stuff it in your pocket.  I wish it came with two cords, a short cord and the long cord.The package included no instructions and no information about the Sennheiser two year warranty.  Although that information is available on-line, it would have been nice to have a warranty certificate in the package, along with a toll free number for getting information or arranging for service.If you like "around the ear" headphones, and accurate sound, not phony "rocked up" sound with boosted bass and "brightened" treble, you will like the HD 202...and you would struggle to find a significantly more accurate sounding headphone at five times the price.

VI've had these headphones for a little over 2 years and they are very comfortable and pretty good sound. Unfortunately one of the cords has separated from the ear piece and is not repairable. I cant say if this is due to rough usage (i am pretty careful with my things) or due to the cord being too flimsy. Either way, i am purchasing the same model to replace it because you cant beat the quality for the price.

VWell I will be returning these to get a different pair of headphones.  I thought these would fit my ears perfectly, but I guess not.  I don't have very large ears, so I figured these would work fine... guess not.Right when I put them on, I knew this wasn't going to be good.  First of all, they were VERY tight around my head, even after adjusting.  My ears didn't fit in the headphones at all.  I'd say the size of these phones are about 20MM compared to a lot of gaming headset's 40MM.  Very tiny.  I wanted to replace my Sony MDR-V150's, but these fit just like the Sony's, but are much tighter.So all in all, I just want to warn you, if your ears are SOMEWHAT big (around 2 1/2ish inches), do not buy these.

VI've been using these headphones for about six months now. I mostly have these connected to my computer for watching videos, listening to music, or playing a game. They've been great for everything I've used them for.PROS: They're comfortable to wear due to the simple but nice cushions on the ear pads and on the plastic connector that wraps around the top of your head. They come with an adapter to connect to stereo systems too, which is nice. They also do a decent job of drowning out external noise; I live in a busy area, and these headphones do a nice job of drowning out sounds like my computer fans. They seem fairly durable, not easily breakable and I'm confident they will last for a few years. The cord is about 10ft. long, which is good (I'd rather have too much than not enough). I'm not sure how to word this, but I've had other headphones where, if you so much as touch the cord, you instantly feel/hear it in the earphones, like tapping the cord with your finger causes a bass-kind of sound to come out in the earphones; but with these headphones, that does NOT happen, so you simply hear what you want to hear. For only $30, they are a very good value IMO.CONS: (really these are just things to note, not necessarily cons)-The volume can be VERY loud if you don't turn volume down on your computer. Basically, if I want to play a video game or watch a video, I have to turn the volume in Windows down to somewhere between 10% and 50% depending on what I'm listening to. That's not a big deal for me since I can quickly do it with my keyboard, but it's still worth noting.-(this one may not apply to you) If I use them for an extended period of time (more than an hour), my right ear starts getting somewhat irritated. However, this is because my right ear is weirdly shaped and sticks out a bit more than my left ear does (you wouldn't know it to look at me, but w/e). This happens no matter what headphones I use, so don't look at this point as a con, it's just worth noting if you have semi-unusual ears like me.

VJudge Not a Pair of Headphones By its Price
p117
sg5
VWhen my Sennheiser HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channeling arrived a few weeks ago my expectations were set to hear a higher quality sound than the Sennheiser EH150's that I was currently using (plus I simply just needed a second pair of headphones). The HD555's are middle of the road expensive (about 100 bucks list price more expensive than the HD202's) so they must be better than the HD202's right? Wrong!Sometimes I use headphones with my Onkyo Home Theater Receiver when I want "loud sound" after the family has gone to bed. But I mostly use headphones to play along to my favorite, mostly hard rock music on my Ludwigs. I tried the Sennheiser HD555's with the receiver and with my drums and it turns out that they're great for home theater, but for playing music at high volumes...not so much.A few months ago I tried the Sennheiser EH150's. They worked for what I was looking for: loud volume for use while playing drums. But they're certainly not the Ultimate Ears in-ear headphones that I use when I want real quality sound. It's just that the Ultimate Ears are actually too good for practicing drums at home with, because they sometimes are so noise reducing that I can't hear myself play unless I turn the volume down low...and who wants to play an Iron Maiden tune on the drums with the volume low?!? The EH150's were working fine, but the HD555's looked like a major upgrade. Ultimately, they are an upgrade if I weigh their performance against the EH150's performance with my home theater, but the HD555's are not meant for continuous, really high volume; they actually distort the sound and vibrate with loud music. But with my home theater the sound that the HD555's produce is more rich than the EH150's. So if you want a set of head phones for loud music, you'd do better with the newest version of the EH150's which are right here on this page with the Sennheiser HD 202 MK II Headphones.While the HD555's might be the most comfortable headphones that I've ever worn, they're just not designed for a loud environment...meaning that they are "open" headphones that let a lot of outside of the headphone sound in. In other words, if you're listening to your home theater and someone walks into the room they can pretty much still hear audio pretty clearly coming from your headphones and if someone talks to you you can hear them. The HD202's are "closed" meaning just the opposite; with the HD202's it's hard for anyone to hear what you're listening to and you hear virtually only what's being pumped into the headphone unless the volume's down really low. The HD202's have nice spongey cups with a soft leather cover that almost fit around your entire ear; I wouldn't have minded a bigger cup to actually fit around the ear (like the HD555's do), but it's certainly not a major drawback. The headband is adjustable and holds in place to your adjustments for a nice tight fit. The cord is nice and long, and has the smaller 3.5 iPod size connection jack, but it comes with a 6.3 adapter if you want to plug it into a receiver.You want loud? Turn it up! Go with these HD202's (and save a few bucks!). If you want something exclusively for listening to home theater?...The Sennheiser HD555's fit that gig a bit better.

VI am not an audiophile!  I'm just an average everyday user that really wanted a pair of Bose headphones that I could not afford.  While these are not technically noise cancelling, they do a great job of blocking out surrounding noise and immersing me in the music.  I purchased these for an upcoming flight that will take most of a day.  After spending several hours at home listening to music, I noticed the following:-with the volume at a normal, not blasting level, the songs were very rich.  Most of mp3 collection was ripped at a lower quality but the music was still exceptional.  I certainly heard aspects of the songs that I never heard before on my home system or in my car.-my dogs starting barking and I had to take the headphones off to figure out what the very muted sound was.-I fell asleep wearing these.  They are that comfortable.No regrets!

Another coworker let be borrow his pair of these headphones for a day and it was a game changer! For only $25 I am able to completely tune out the ramblings of this emotionally unstable soccer mom. No longer do I have to hear her talk about how unorganized her closets are. No longer must I suffer through her outbursts of frustrations because she "can't think" (her words, not mine). I was going to buy a fancy $100 pair of headphones but decided to go with these instead.. they sounds pretty good, do a great job of blocking outside noise, and are one of the more comfortable headphones I've tried.

VI bought this headset a couple weeks ago and I listen to a lot of high quality music but couldn't afford a better set of headphones at the time.The bass is very good and the sound quality seems quite crisp. However I found it very difficult to keep them on for longer then 5 minutes. It's not very flexible and my average sized ears felt cramped and constantly pressurized.I recommend you go safe and get some headphones that are quite big as these don't fit ears properly. My friends have tested it out and they've reported a similar feeling.Just my two cents. Sound is solid. Fit is not that great.

VI am not a audiophile, so all I really need out of my headphones is for it to sound reasonably good, be comfortable to wear, and work consistently.  The Senheiser HD 202 headphones have two out of three of those traits.  The volume and clarity of sound is strong, and the headphones are very comfortable over the ears.  Unfortunately, the sound in one (or both) of the ears died after three months.  I've bought this same pair of headphones four times, thinking I must have mistreated them previously.  This last time I was more careful than ever, using the cord wrap that comes with it.  The headphones lasted a little over two months.  Even for the money these headphones are bad, simply because they are fragile.  If a little extra money means better headphones, then spend it.

p150

VI don't understand how these got 5 stars. The sound is muddy; more accurately, it sounds like a pillow over a speaker. Highs are muffled. Bass sounds like it is achieved by muffling the mids and highs. I have a set of Skull Candy earbuds 11mm cable that sound waaaay better than these. The only reason I'm not sending them back is because I only paid 23 bucks and I have a combination headset/ear warmer as I wait for the train to go to work.On the positive side, they fit well and I have a big head and wear glasses. I love the 10ft cable and it comes with a spool to wind it up so it's not untidy. They fit comfortably and feel lightweight.If you want to really enjoy your music, don't get these. If you simply don't like earbuds and don't want to spend a lot of money on headphones, then these are worth a shot.****UPDATE 12/27/2011*******After using these headphones for a few weeks I'm upgrading my review from 1 star to 3 stars. The same basic things are still true but after tweaking my device's settings (Samsung Galaxy S II Epic Touch 4G) it's enjoyable. I set the EQ to ROCK and the sound effect to MUSIC CLARITY. Setting the sound effect was the biggest change as I was already using the Rock EQ setting. Setting the sound effect to MUSIC CLARITY cleaned up the muddy sound and allows the highs to be a bit crisper.Another thing I discovered is that listening at very low volumes in a quiet setting also provides a good listening experience even with the sound effect on NORMAL. If you ride the train or bus, expect anyone sitting around you to hear your music as the sound bleeds thru easily and that's with the volume on 4 or 5.I would put these second on a shopping list. Try out some others first. But these won't be too bad if you chose them.

p156
sg5
VPlease don't think about buying these if you want budget metal headphones. I've been using the HD 201 headphones for a number of years and figured the HD 202 IIs would be an upgrade. They are newer, slightly more expensive and have pretty excellent reviews.It's seriously a trap. The HD 202 IIs have some of the worst sound quality I've ever experienced in any headphones. I've been using various Sennheiser headphones for over 10 years and this is the first time where I've questioned their brand's quality.The bass on these headphones are cranked up to a point that's completely unreasonable. The highs honestly sound broken. They are extremely condensed and unnatural sounding. Mids are non-existent and are completely drowned out.Compared to the HD 201s the same song sounds completely different. There are many notes I can distinctly hear on the 201s that are not present with the HD 202 IIs.The ear cups are also extremely small and uncomfortable. I was able to feel my heart's pulse in my temple due to them squeezing my head so tight and my head isn't big at all. The HD 201s on the other hand fit perfect on day 1.This is about the 2nd or 3rd review I've ever left in my life. These headphones are so bad that I felt like I might be causing people to waste money on them if I didn't post a review because it's easy to assume these are good based on the reviews.

VGood bang for the buck, but....
p177
sg5
VFirst off let me state that you are just not going to do better than these headphones for the current price of $20. They're practically free. :DIf you're looking for an intro to the world of sound quality higher than earbuds or ultra-cheap over ears, here you have it. These are *NOT* audiophile quality, but they're the bargain basement cheapest way to experience music without being ruined by crappy delivery. Given the low price point, they're perfect for bang around headphones for travel, the gym, etc....So, with all the bang for the buck cred out of the way, why the "but" in my review title? It's simple, these headphones are fairly bass biased. That means if you're listening to hip-hop or rock you'll be pleased. If you're listening to classical, folk, acoustic rock or anything else that needs the mids and highs to shine then you might be left wanting a little.Yes, you can fix this with an equalizer. But the point is the headphones *WILL* color the music in the favor of low end.The other con is the construction is a little cheap. The adjustment isn't easy and comfort wise you might not be happy depending on your head size/shape.Go in knowing the cons, and again I don't think you're gonna come anywhere close to the sound for what you pay.

As the most popular review stated- these 'muddle up' the sound in a weird way.  They are anything but clear.Comfort: 0/10- painful after only a few minutes, with ears of all sizes.Sound: 5/10- good bass, but the sound is muddled and unclearBuild: 5/10- The pads are essentially black garbage bag with very, very little padding.  The cord is 10ft long- that means that when you roll up the wire, you have something that is actually pretty heavy pulling on your head.  The sound leak isn't too bad for cheapo headphones.I wasn't expecting great quality, but I really hate these things.  A bit more cheap padding could have fixed the comfort issue.

VThis is a great budget headphone it gives a nice clean sound and clear bass. it immerses you in the music without having to turn up the volume really loud. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for one major problem, pain. You can't wear these headphones for a longtime if you do your ears will start to hurt.there is no way to adjust these so they fit tight on your head and this causes your ears to get squeezed.  I read the reviews that complained about this issue but I thought it couldn't be as bad as they made it out to be but it is. I still like the head phones though.Edit: after using these for some time now the fit of the headphone have improved some and the pain is not as bad as when I first got them. for me,the problem with these is the foam on the headphones are too thin. This causes the hard headphone drivers to push on parts of my ears. I have to keep adjusting them to stop it from hurting. I really like these too bad for this 1 issue. If your head and ears are small you might have a better fit.

VI love these headphones. They are so great I ordered them twice. Why did I order them twice? Because the left ear stopped working on the first pair after about two years. 'That's okay,' I'm thinking, they're still worth the price. Really.. I'm not complaining much. This happens, right? Sennheiser makes a good product: the sound is clear and loud (very important) and the bass thumps like it should (you can hear it but it doesn't overpower). The earpieces are also comfortable and fit right over my average male ears and the cord is like 10 feet long (great of you also occasionally record music). I do a lot of listening to music on a crappy laptop and an iPod shuffle (technology lag) and these things make the tone of the tunes sound way better than it has any chance of being otherwise. If this pair lasts another 2 or 3 years for twenty bucks -- that's worth it. Rock on.

VSeveral things about this set of headphones have proved disappointing to me. First of all, the cord is excessively long, so long that it is constantly getting in the way of what I am doing. True, a gadget came with the headphones for the purpose of winding extra cord on but it is quite bulky and gets in the way too.I have a very small head and small ears but these headphones are so tight that they pinch my ears and are very uncomfortable if worn for any length of time at all. A person with a larger head and/or larger ears would be in even more discomfort. I read other reviews that mentioned that they were small and pinched people's ears but I figured my smaller ears would not be a problem - not so, unfortunately.The quality seems to be good and they seem to be quite sturdy. Sound is pretty good although I wish that I had paid more attention and purchased a set with built-in volume control. I deliberated for quite a while before purchasing this set of headphones and only wish I had made a different decision. I will be looking to replace them in the very near future.

V1. Comfort - The fit is a little tighter than I expected, but overall it's not bad.  The ear pads do fit around my ears nicely, although after wearing them for an extended period of time (~3 hours), my ears can get slightly sore.2. Sound isolation - Really good.  Surprisingly good.  They almost seem like noise cancelling headphones.  This is probably a result of the tight fit.3. Sound quality - Sounds good to me.4. Misc - The cable is really long.  I don't know why Sennheiser does this with all their consumer headphones.  They do provide you with a plastic thing to wrap the cable in, but it's kind of bulky.5. Price - This is typically priced similarly or cheaper than the Sennheiser HD 201 headphones on Amazon.  I like these better than those (I owned a pair of them - they're fine, just a little loose feeling).Overall, this is probably about as good as this kind of headphone (small over-the-ear wired headphones) can get.Tangent - There's a lot of psuedo-science and wonky terminology going around sound descriptions from audiophile types.  Stuff like "warm", "tendency to mix-up sounds", "aggressive", "energetic", "richness". "thinness", "brightness".  These are all useless, ill-defined terms.  The thing that irks me about this is that the headphones job should be to deliver the soundwith a flat frequency response and a good SNR.  Neither of which should be particularly difficult to do.  But the whole industry is screwed up by people's preferences to modify the signal before it hits your ears.  Ex. Beats headphones are notorious for over-emphasizing bass.  But, building that into the headphone is just silly. Any signal modifications (which tend to give rise to those silly descriptions) means the headphones are simply worse.  Personal preferences towards particular frequency response (i.e. if you like a bass heavy sound) ought to be handled by the equalizer (most audio software & operating systems have a built in software equalizer these days).

I just wanted something I could use now and then that was padded, comfortable, and sounded good.  If I was listening to a ton of music I might want a better sound quality and be willing to spend the money, but for occasional use of watching TV/Movies as the main use, and listening to my iPod now and then, these are great.

Listening to NOW as I write this, using my Philips MP3 player.Compared to the others mentioned above there is no contest. They all perform significantlybetter than these. the weakness here (to me) is in the midrange mostly. While the overallbalance is good, the mids seem a bit depressed. HOWEVER that all said, these still makeFINE phones for general purpose listening, or even the lower hi-fi range. These are MUCHbetter than other phones I have heard in the budget range. Sennheiser has nothing tobe ashamed of here.Comfort: I see many people have commented on the tightness. I am male and wear 7-1/4 hatso my head is not large, nor small. I do not find them too tight. I appreciate that I can move myhead around and not have them fall off or shift. Since I use these mainly with my MP3 playerwhile walking around and working, this is much appreciated. I can wear them for several hours(although I rarely wear ANY for more than 2) and I still feel comfortable. Not overly hot insdiethe cup either. The cups ARE rather small, and fit ON the ear rather than over.The WIRES bug me a bit. They ARE long. I prefer a single wire solution, but have learnedto live with the split wire. The wire is a bit fragile feeling, so you DO have to treat them withsome care. I wrapped up most of the length and tied it with a bread tie. The junction belowthe ear cup where the wires join can easily get snarled around the main wire. Having thebulk of the wire bundled helps alleviate that.I feel confident recommending these for over all performance for the small money.You'd be hard pressed to find anything better in this range. Probably more "Beats" likethan other Senn's. Another excellent set for the money are the JVC HARX models 300and 500. These are larger but more comfortable and have excellent sound.The 202's are VERY efficient and will work well with any MP3 player and have plentyof bass.Four stars for overall performance vs. price.Looking to step up?Try the AKG 240 which as I write this is on Amazon for about $50.These are larger, but definitely in the hi-fi zone, competing admirably with thebetter Sennheiser, both the 380 and 650. I will be doing reviews of the AKG andthe Senn380's soon.

VIf you're looking for a short review, keep scrolling.I recently ordered the Sennheiser HD 202 II Pro, Panasonic RP-HTF600-S, MEElectronics HT-21, Monoprice Premium Hi-Fi DJ Style Over-the-Ear Pro, Sony MDRZX200 Outdoor & the Sennheiser HD 201 Lightweight headphones, and just for kicks the Monoprice Enhanced Bass HiFi Earphones. The headphones are all in the $18-$30 range. But first, a little about myself. I'm a college student and received the Bose AE2's for Christmas last year. I tested all these headphones on both my MacBookPro & iPhone 5 (I also did some tests with the new Apple EarPods).All numbers are on a 1 to 5 scale, 5 being the best.First up was unboxing all the headphones. The hardest to get open were the Sennheisers HD 202's {1} due to it's clamshell plastic packaging, but surprisingly the HD 201's {5} were simple to open and came in a simple cardboard box. The Monoprice HiFi DJ headphones were like the 201's, they came in a simple box with a very classy inside {5}. The Ht-21's were nicely packaged and moderately easy to get out {3.5}. The Sony's came with it's plastic front glued to a thin cardboard backing, I wasn't impressed but it got the job done and was moderately easy to open but a pain to package back up {2.5}. Finally the Panasonics came in very nice packaing (clear plastic box) that was easy to open up {4.5}. The Monoprice Earphones came in a plastic bag with no labeling and a simple twist tie, not a good sign.To get the earbuds out of the way, simply put, they were terrible. I was expecting a little more after Monoprice had gotten rave reviews on the OverTheEar headphones. The cord seemed like high quality and the design of the buds seemed nice and practical but the headphone casing felt plasticy. The sound quality was not only below Apple's free new EarPods but below their second-generation as well. Quickly packaged it up for return to Amazon. {Rating: 1}Next to go back in the box was the HT-21's. Once again, even the free Earpods beet the sound quality. The headphones were of pretty cheap build. It's nice that they fold up, but what's it matter if they have crappy sound quality. I was some what surprised because they were one of the more expensive of the bunch. {Rating: 2}The HD 202's were next to be returned. I couldn't get a comfortable fit on my ear. Part of the headphones sat on my ear and another covered it. The plastic curved band also seemed cheap. Finally the advertised bass was no where to be found. Sound quality was moderate, but nothing to write home about. {Rating: 3}It's really hard for me to put the HD 201's above or below the Sony's. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the Sony's but vocals weren't as distinct as I'd hoped. The 201's were well balanced but sounded a tad hollow. I would still recommend these models as they are only $18 & $22. Which one? Well it depends if you're looking for around ear over on ear. I personally am a fan of around ear, but that's up to you. {Both get a rating of 4}That means it comes down to the Panasonics & the Monoprice OverTheEars. I was really looking forwarded to the Monoprice's as they were rated highly on CNet's best budget headphones list. And I have to say the sound quality was nice. However the headphones made my head look three times as wide. I'm not into Fashion at all but these are worse than wearing Grado's (which have excellent sound quality if you can get over the looks and everyone else hearing your music due to their open backs. Completely worth the money if you're up for those two drawbacks). The main reason I quickly repackaged these was the top part of the headband. They have three "cushions" that just put the whole weight of the headphones on a small area on the top of your head. Although it's nice that the headphones swivel around in all directions, they have a little too much freedom. These would be GREAT headphones for DJ's only using mono sound. However these certainly aren't for anyone listening to music for more than 15 minutes.And then there was one: The Panasonic RP-HTF600 went up against the headphones I'd been using for almost a year: the Bose AE2. I wasn't expecting much out of the Panasonic's, I was really expecting the Sennheiser's to take the lead, or the monoprice's after reading reviews. But the Panasonic's were the last one standing. The headphones had impressive sound, well balanced with a hint of bass. However their strong suit was the illusion of space. The sound seemed to have incredible depth and had a hint of reverb. Vocals were well mixed with the rest of the music.But sadly I decided to return them all. The Panasonics gave my Bose AE2's a good run for their money. The sound depth was attractive, but after all there is a $120 price difference between the two models. Had I known about the the RP-HTF600's, I probably would have gone for them over the Bose. However the Bose's comfort is impossible to match, it's easy forget you're wearing them they're so comfortable and light. Although the resonance in the Panasonic's are a nice leg up on the Bose, it's not worth $30. I wasn't looking for another pair of headphones, I was looking for a better pair. Perhaps I was asking for too much by looking in the $30 range for a pair better than a $150 set, but I was not disappointed by the Panasonic's. They were in no way uncomfortable, they just can't top the Bose. I'd give the RP-HTF600's a 5 on my rating scale and the Bose AE2's a 5.5

VI've noticed that a lot of people seem to be trashing these headphone for "not being top of the line." Well, my response inevitably is that you get what you pay for.Here's the thing: If you are looking to spend an outrageous amount of money on headphones, then you probably need to look somewhere else. If, however, you're looking for an affordable option with a whole lot of upside, then these are definitely the headphones for you.I know many have claimed that they are not "noise-cancelling". That's debatable. I had a pair for over four years before I broke them (notice I said I....there was no problem with the way they were manufactured). I used them for a variety of different things, including gaming (plugging them into the back of my TV whenever my roommate was asleep), watching movies/TV/videos on my laptop or PC, and with my iPod whenever I didn't want to bother with earbuds or wasn't going to be moving around a lot. They not only sounded great in all instances, but I was not able to hear any sounds around me made at a normal volume. If a brass band comes marching by, you're probably going to hear it with these things. Will another, more expensive option alleviate that problem? Who knows, but these certainly do the trick for the everyday user.I also used them as pseudo-monitors for my electric guitar playing, using them both in a USB-guitar interface and with my regular amp. They served great in both instances. The first set I got came with an adapter, so I didn't have to go find another, which was great. While more expensive headphones might have performed a bit better, these were perfect for this use, as well.If I had a complaint about these headphones it would probably be that the cord is too long. I never needed to extend the cord past a few feet, which meant that the majority of the length (10') went unused. They do come with a spool and built-in belt clip to alleviate this problem, but the clip sometimes loses its grip on the cord, which means you have to take the time to roll them back up again. As is such, I would be cautious in handing them to a young kid (toddlers).As I said before, I owned one set of these things for over four years before I accidentally broke them. I think it says a lot that I am going back to these headphones despite the fact that I could look towards other brands out there. There is just too much upside to them not to come back. They're affordable, they're lightweight, they sound FANTASTIC, they're durable, and they come with a 2 year warranty from an established company. What more can you ask for if you're looking for a great set of affordable headphones?

VI bought these headphones as an affordable step up from my ipod earbuds and they are definitely MUCH better than those. The overall clarity of sound is much better. I can hear the treble much more clearly and the bass is powerful. These headphones also fit on my head very well. I can wear them for several hours at a time with little discomfort. The only complaint I have is that the cord is really really long. Like almost five feet long. When I read the reviews before I bought these, people commented on this feature, but I was just thinking it would be a little extra slack. Nope. The length of the cord is actually kind of ridiculous. The headphones come with a plastic belt clip sort of thing that I guess you're supposed to wrap the cord around, but it took quite a bit of fiddling to make it work. This is the only reason I'm giving these less than 5 stars.Final opinion: These are great headphones for the price and are worth the money if you're just going to be listening to music around the house. Don't buy these if you want to use them while working out or something of that nature.

VDecent low-price headphones but not the trademark Sennheiser sound quality
p281
sg5
VThese HD 202 II's convinced me I need to just bite the bullet and but some decent headphones. These are not terrible and have decent range, but the bass response is anemic. But one shouldn't be surprised given the price point.Beyond that they are just plastic headphones. I have a large head (size 7.5) and these are somewhat tight. I've bent them and that helped, but know that the headpiece is solid. The ear cups do adjust but that doesn't address the circumference issue. I'm sure if you have a normal head these are fine.The cord that comes on these is really long - 10 feet. I think most people will find that beyond useful, but if you're looking for a long cord, these are your cans. UPDATE: This 10-foot cord is a real pain in the @ss if you use these on the move. Even tying up the excess length is annoying - and then what do you do with it?Next stop - Beats or Bose.

VI typically like to try out items like this before I make a purchase, however I took a chance since the price was right and must say I am very happy!They have good cord length and come with a handy cord clip so you have the option of shorting the length if you choose to do so. I have tried just about every genre of music I can tolerate with these headphones and have to say that it sounds really good!I read some cons about the poor quality feel and how uncomfortable these headphones are and although they initially feel cheap the light weight design feels comfortable and after having these headphones on for a couple hours at a time I have found them to be very comfortable on MY dome! I know that there are MUCH better headphones out there but if you are like me and don't want to spend the big bucks but still want something with good sound then I recommend getting these headphones.

p293
sg5
VIf you listen to music that has a good amount of bass to it, these are an excellent value. They are better than anything you can find in this price range.  Straight out the gate I really liked the bass response, but realized I had lost some of the mid range compared to my good quality earbuds.  But after a while your ears will adjust and you'll find the trade off well worth it.  After about a week of use, they are worn in and the bass just jumps out at you. I want to see how well the cord holds up, but definitely would buy another pair.  I also found these to be very comfortable, with nice soft cushions***EDIT*** I had been listening to these on my stereo receiver only since I bought them..turns out that if you tweak the EQ on whatever you play your music on, you can get these to sound great. I suggest lowering your mid (~250hz) slightly

VGood...1) They sound great... bass is full, barely (if any) hiss during silence.2) The cord is long enough to not feel like you are on a leash. Comes with a cord wrap with clip, to keep it under control.Minor Annoyances...1) Minor sound bleed if you have the volume up. Very, very minor.2) When I use these at my desk (the majority of the time), the cord becomes a mild chore to deal with, even with the wrap.Simply the best headphones I've ever had. I've had $200 over the ear headphones, admittedly many years ago, but these beat anything I've tested, owned, or borrowed.For the price, you can't beat them. The next set I buy will be Sennheiser.Perhaps I will try wireless.

VI already had a set of the HD202 headphones and was buying these for my wife. I do love the sound and fit of the HD202s.  After reading some of the reviews, I noticed that some people were not receiving the newer MKII model but were instead getting the older HD202s.  The HD202MKIIs were only 50 cents more so I thought I would take a chance.  Sure enough, I received the older HD202s. In fact, someone had taped a piece of paper with a bar code labeled HD202MKII over the bar code on the original package.  This is the first complaint I've ever had with any purchase I've made at Amazon, and I've made a lot of them, but I feel scammed after this purchase. Love the headphones, but don't expect the MKIIs if you order them from Amazon.

I give 4 stars because this headphones are not very comfortable but I bought an replacement earpads for Bose QC 15 and I put them and now I have a comfortable headphones and have better isolating noise than before.

Bonus: you can plug them into whatever your device you're using, set the device on a desk or table, and then walk around an entire city block and still have slack in the cord.

VAverage ~$20 headphones with very good bass
p333
sg5
VIn writing this review, keep in mind that I'm comparing this set of headphones to 6 other ones: Sennheiser HD 280, Sony MDR-7506, Sony MDR-V6, Sennheiser HD HD201, Monoprice MEP-839, and JVC HA-RX500. The first 3 can usually be purchased for $60-$90 (depending on which headphone and if you can find it on sale) and are used by many as studio monitors. The latter 3 are all ~$20 headphones and sit in the same category as the Sennheiser HD202.Of course, as we all know, whether you like a particular pair of headphones depends on what you plan on doing with them and what you listen to. Personally, I listen to a mix of music ranging from classical to pop to dance. I'm not what one would deem a "bass head" - I like my headphones to faithfully reproduce the entire audio spectrum. Knowing my requirements, the way I would rate my headphones would be Sony 7506 = Sony V6 > Sennheiser HD 280 > Sennheiser HD 201 > Monoprice MEP-839 > JVC HA-RX500 = Sennheiser HD 202.In my comments below I make deliberate use of my adjectives (i.e. excellent > very good > good > average).Not surprisingly, the more expensive headphones sound the best. The Sony 7506/V6 have very good bass and excellent mids and treble frequencies which help bring out vocals. The Sennheiser HD 280's have excellent bass (better than the Sony's) and very good mids and treble (but not as good as the Sony's).Of the ~$20 headphones, the Sennheiser HD 201 has the best overall balance with very good bass, mids, and treble - its main deficiency is that it needs more power to drive; they are noticeably quieter than the other headphones at the same volume setting. However, once you turn up the volume, I feel they are the most balanced of the $20 headphones.The Monoprice MEP-839 falls next in terms of audio balance. It has very good bass and good mids and treble. It doesn't bring out mids and treble as well as the HD 201, but it is superior to the JVC HA-RX500 and Sennheiser HD 202. When compared to the 7506, V6, and HD280 I feel the bass is a slight bit muddier - with the more expensive headphones, the bass seems cleaner and has more of a punch. That said, the MEP-839 low frequencies extend as deep as the HD 280 and more than the 7506/V6. The reason I rate the MEP-839 bass as very good, instead of excellent, has to do with the fact it sounds a bit "muddy". The MEP-839's are relatively easy to drive and don't require the volume to be cranked up.Finally, there are the JVC HA-RX500 and Sennheiser HD 202. I feel these 2 are pretty similar in audio quality. They both have very good bass with average mids and treble. The HA-RX500 is more comfortable than the HD 202, primarily because they are circumaural and sit around your ears instead of the supra-aural HD 202 which actually rests on your ear. I can see why bass heads would like the HA-RX500 and HD202 - they emphasize bass over the mids/treble. That being said, I prefer my headphones to be balanced.

VI really didn't want to spend a couple weeks pay on a decent set of headphones, but I'd've coughed it up if that were the only way to get the theatre surround sound experience I need without waking the neighbors (I'm so lying to myself, I like food too much).  Luckily, there are more things to consider than just my outlandish desires to be taken away into the aether by perfect sound.  The last pair I bought was Skull Candy.  Blew $50ish on them and I didn't feel $50ish impressed at all.  And they fell apart after a few months.In an effort to be reasonable in my concerns for quality, I boiled down what I was after to 3 things: comfort, clarity, and bass.  Obvious?  Basically, I quit fantasizing about $1500 headphones.  Comfort means around-ear to me.  The less they press on my cartilage, the better.  Let something press on your ear for an hour and you'll beg for mercy.  Clarity is self explanatory, yes?  Clear sound with no hisses, pops, or other disturbing sounds not present in the recorded media.  And finally, bass.  I wanted headphones that would not leave me in want of a sub-woofer.My roommate had a pair of Sennheiser 201s.  He'd had them for years and only recently did the band break.  He talked up the brand and, from what I could find, the internet agreed.  I thought that his certainly weren't bad for their age, but I couldn't just get the same model.  There had to be something better in my price range.  Turns out the next model up appeared to fit all my criteria.  I did have my reservations about buying headphones I couldn't try first (toiled over the decision for days), but I felt better having tried a lesser model and finding them suitable.I've had them for a while now and still quite happy with them.  More comfortable and better sound than the 201s.  I can wear them without discomfort for much much longer than any of the other headphones I've owned in the history of ever.When fooling around in FL Studio, you need to be able to hear a goodly range or you could get something awful in your final product that you only hear when you try to impress your friends in a vehicle with a serious sound system, and that's embarrassing.  There are better headphones for making music, I'm sure, but these will give you a fighting chance on a budget.  The bass is by no means overwhelming, but it's clear and quite audible.I guess that wraps it up.  They aren't the be all end all, but if I had paid $50 instead of $25, I would still be as impressed.

VAmazing headphones!

V***Update 2 (1/3/2013): It appears that I've had these for over a year now.  The headphones are still working as well as the day I first tried them.  I have honestly never owned a really nice pair of earphones or headphones (hundreds of dollars, etc.) but these come very close to it.  The headphones do not hurt my ears at all at this point.  I think part of it was getting use to them/breaking the headphones in.  I'm not sure what caused the slight cramping to begin with but if you can just break them in over a few months, you will adjust to them and they will likely fit comfortably.  I'm using them right now and the bass and sound are just as good as ever, if not better.  I purchased these for around $20 free shipping from Amazon and I do not regret my purchase one bit.  If these ever break, I plan on purchases a replacement without hesitation.******UPDATE (9/4/2012): Well, it's been about 9 months now and these headphones are still working as if it were the first day that I received them in the mail from Amazon!  I have to say that I did notice a bit of ear cramping but I got used to it after a while and I no longer get any cramping from using the headphones.  The sound quality is great for such a cheap price and the bass is very boomy.  Nothing sounds tinny at all.  I would likely pay $40+ for these.  I highly recommend them.***First off, I've had these headphones for about 2 months now and I think they are great!  The sound, the bass, the vocals...everything seems to be more clear and vibrant than anything I've ever heard before!  Now, I am no audiophile and I went to these from listening with Apple ear phones.  What an huge difference!  I feel like these headphones should have cost me at least $75!  Such great audio quality for the price!As with any product, there is the tendency for consumers to find flaws in products and I did find a minor one.  Sometimes when I am wearing the headphones for an extended period of time, my ears will begin to get sore.  I'm not sure why exactly this is but to me it is only a minor inconvenience, especially at this price range.  Anyone buying headphones for this price should not expect it to be quite on par with comfort of the $200+ products.All in all, these are very nice headphones.  Listening with anything else now seems to make things sound worse (i.e., cheap earphones)!  I may not currently be an audiophile but these may cause me to look into getting a pair of even better head phones once I get out of college and begin earning a stable income.  Cheers everyone!

VExcessive Bass
p350
sg5
VThe audio response curve on these headphones is, to put it mildly, disappointing.  I wasn't expecting too much for $25, so I don't exactly feel cheated, but it still could be much better.  Basically, what they did is over-emphasize the bass without maintaining clarity at lower frequencies.  Most people associate louder bass with higher quality (since bass is usually harder to produce with any fidelity), which is probably why Sennheiser made this design decision.  Unfortunately, the result is an extremely muddy bass which is exaggerated at the expense of the low-mids.  The best reproduction appears to be in the high end, which is very clear and well-balanced.Again, these were $25 headphones, so I wouldn't expect the same quality that you can get from a $500 pair of studio headphones.  However, if you're buying these as an audiophile, be ready for disappointment.

VThese head phones are OK except that the sound is only fair and the durability is terrible.  The wires don't stand up to much in the way of tugging and there seems to be no way to fix them once they crap out.  It wouldn't be hard to make them durable, so I guess it is not a priority for them.

VSounds boring, right?Well, I was expecting to hear clear high end, clear voice - and in that respect I was correct. Those are both there, in abundance.Now, having come from a set of HD215s, I was expecting the bass to follow suit. Clear, but a little plastic, to go with the look of these units.How wrong I was. I first fired up a couple of tracks that I couldn't hear the lower bass notes on the 215s that I knew were there and oh my goodness did I get a surprise!That however, wasn't good enough so I put on a couple of other tracks that I know have a solid bass track, and yes, same result - fantastic!At this stage I got all "OK, bring it little headphones!"So I logged onto Youtube and searched for some "Bass Test" tracks, you know - the ones that come with the "THESE MAY DAMAGE YOUR SPEAKERS" warnings.This is where things got a little weird between 202 and I (I've been granted permission to call them by their nickname now, such is the experience we had...)First track in, all good, yep there's some bass. For the first minute.THEN ALL HOLY HECK BREAKS LOOSE, AND I SWEAR ON MY LIFE MY EYEBALLS WERE VIBRATING!!I'm not kidding, my eardrums were screaming out for dear mercy and my vision was still blurry when I gave my eardrums a reprieve!Moral of the story? These are fantastic headphones - especially for the price, but do yourself a favor and keep both the bass and the volume levels down or you'll wind up like me, very happy with your purchase, but completely deaf and suffering from blurry vision.#Totally worth it.

VWhat can I say? These are amazing headphones, and I could not approve more of the price ($20 if you shop around good).This is my second pair. The first pair got run over in a lawn mover. Very sad :(I love the audio out of these. Very comfortable (see note below). Very solidly built, although not lawnmower proof.Heads up: the cable on these is something like 10 feet long. Not really for on the go use. (Although it does come with a belt clip that you can wind your cable around. I have never used it.)I would like to note though that if you wear headphones a lot (more than 3 or 4 hours a day) you will want to buy a more expensive pair. These irritate my ears after very large lengths of time (12-14 hours). The edge of my ear feels like it is bruised sometimes after an extended listening period (I also have large ears).I have read a lot of arguments about these headphones and the technical audio aspects. All I really want to say is that you will most likely find these very crisp, clear, and powerful. The bass is warm and clear, without sacrificing great quality elsewhere. I find that when I am listening to my music collection I notice things that I never have before. Subtle accents and even people talking in the background. These have awesome audio.Overall (especially considering the price), I would recommend these to anyone. I have gifted them before. I have recommended them to a lot of people. Everyone seems to enjoy them.

VThe pair I ordered (received about 2 wks ago) is actually a replacement pair I had gotten as hand me downs. I've got a few years experience with these headphones. Best headphones I've had for under $200. I went a few wks/months without headphones before I ordered these because when I do have them, I suffer from the tendency to choose my music over people on a fairly regular basis.People forget that sound, while headphones are important, also has a lot to do with file quality. Get good files and enjoy deep, satisfying sound with these. Poor quality files will still sound good, but the experience is beyond remarkable when the file is right.These headphones are large and solid enough to cover the typical and larger ear, cancel outside noises well enough (though probably not at a construction site or something) are sturdy and have convenient little extras like detachable earpieces and cord holder. The bass is better than you probably think from reading the range. The only thing I would change is the cord thickness/connections. I like headphones that have very difficult to damage cords. On a 1-10, these rank about 7 for cord sturdiness. I'm hard on most everything I own, and my original pair held up to a few years of my abuse (drops, pulls, living in backpacks and and under heavy things and they were used when I got them.I have found no headphones like this available below professional or super-expensive grade that are this awesome.

VVery poor quality wiring.
p391
sg5
VSound is very good, comfort level is nice and light. But longevity of the wires is POOR! Now that I am attempting to repair where the right side wire exits the right headpiece, I see that the "strain relief" is so stiff it really is more of a "strain transfer" so that the feeble wire leaving the phones reefs against the strain relief and breaks easily.And the wire isn't a nice honest coax wire. Both the Signal and Return are made of a few measley strands of magnet wire (very thin wire coated in epoxy and used to wind small motors and transformers) wrapped around a thread matrix. What this means is you can't simply solder them back together because of the epoxy coating. You have to delicately separate them with an X-acto knife and scrape off some of the epoxy, then solder in a bit of wire (i recommend wirewrap 28-30 AWG) to connect the ends, making sure to use heat shrink or tape to separate Signal and Return. I have no idea if they did this to be cheap or to make the wires extra flexible. I blame Apple for being the first to use magnet wire for transferring audio signals in headphones. That's not what magnet wire is made for! It's supposed to be wound on a core or a guitar pickup or somewhere where it will never flex again. /end rant.Buy something more expensive unless you want your headphones to be disposable.

VI've owned a pair of these headphones and used them for about a year and eight months. The right-side headphone has stopped producing sound.They were okay until then--they would get uncomfortable after a short period, because they'd start pressing on my ears. Their adjustability was kind of odd and inconvenient. I thought they were good for the price, and now I realize that I really got what I paid for. I think I dropped them a handful of times, and never from very large heights. Maybe that's what did them in.I intend to buy a new pair of headphones, probably more expensive, and definitely not from Sennheiser.

VBest Entry Level Headphones Period
p401
sg5
VPurchased these headphone based on the previous reviews.The audio that comes from these headphones is loud and clear. The bass was a bit overwhelming at first since I am used to the ol "white ear buds". I had to actually reduce the lower frequency levels in my audio players EQ settings.I had my wife wear these and she played some Metallica at a fairly high volume level. I sat about 5 feet away from her, and I couldn't hear what she was listening to. Some $100+ headphones with "fancy" names can't do that.These are very good at blocking out noise from the environment. Hopefully I can use these to replace my hearing protection muffs and buds while I am moving and or weed-eating.The cord is very long and comes with a handy keeper to maintain all that cord.After hearing the sound quality on these phones I am convinced that I will never use my buds again. I was able to turn the volume up to a level that was uncomfortable and they did not loose any sound quality.The headphones fit over my ear completely, and I listened to them for about an hour with minimal discomfort.Highly recommended for anyone considering those other higher priced headphones (beats etc..) as their first set.

VPros:1) Very, very comfortable. This is important, because I like white noise at night and husband emphatically does not.2) The long cord is great for listening while moving around, without disturbing anyone else. It also has an in-line whachamacallit so the cord can be wound up and secured when a shorter cord is called for. (That way I don't trip or, worse, strangle myself... <g>)3) Sound quality is very good to excellent. Really excellent clarity - no need to turn the volume up for audiobooks.4) Works great for audiobooks on the Kindle. It comes with a larger adapter plug but I haven't needed that.5) I have a Sennheiser wireless headphone that I like, too, for use with the computer but this one is actually better for me for everything else - it never has to recharge.Con: It would be nice if they had their own volume control. Otherwise they are perfect.Edited to add:  The headphones just completely and unexpectedly fell apart one day. They worked well for a year and a half, with steady but gentle use. The price reflects the quality, I guess. I'm down-grading the rating from 5 to 3 stars, even though the price-to-value ratio is pretty good. I won't be re-ordering this item.

VI was hung up between these headphones and those of another well-known brand, and decided to try these because of the company's generally good reputation and the good reviews here. I am more than pleased with them. As one of the reviews I read noted, this high-end company puts the same effort and quality into their lower priced headphones as they do their premium. Sound is clear and detailed with true low and high ends. I listen to many different genres of music and these work for pop, classical, world or whatever.Some people noted they seem tight, as if made for someone with a small,head. I see what they mean. i have a small head and was always troubled by headphones that always seemed too loose. i was always pressing the headphones to my ears like you see people in recording booths do. These seemed a bit tight even on my head at first but after a few uses they seemed to adjust so that now they are just right. I would imagine that they would adjust for most people and are only super tight on the first few uses.I tend to either lose or break headphones so after a couple losses I no longer want high end, expensive ones. These work amazingly well for the low cost.

VThe headphones while good/great are not professional...Then again, are you really thinking you are going to find professional headphones for around 20 bucks? C'mon NOW!They borderline on being great I think personally, however I am far from a true audiophile.I enjoy music more than most but know these have some shortcomings in order to be taken to a professional level.Here is what I find to be issues with these headphones:1. The open area within the headphone itself is small, if you have medium sized ears (I know that reads funny but...) you will have a bit of an issue with covering your ears to make a decent sound environment2. Heat issues within the listing area after a while, you can lose yourself to the music and what you are doing and before you know it, it's been an hour or maybe two and the you notice that your ears are hot, a bit sweaty and hurt a tad from being cramped in the small headphone areaThose are my two issues with the headphones.If those are my only two issues for 23 bucks I paid...they are fantastic headphones.Buy them, you'll like them.

VLike most people I chose these based on the price and great reviews but once again I am disappointed in the quality. The left ear just stopped working after just 6 months of medium use. The cord was super long and the little tool they give you to wind the excess cord around never worked completely, the cord would come unwound with any movement. I often had to retrace my steps while walking my dog to figure out where I lost it. The sound quality to me was just okay...I actually think my Sony MDR-ZX100's sounds better. I have had beats by Dre Solo's that fell apart after a year 6 days, cords went bad then eventually the headset literally just fell apart. They were the most expensive headphones I had ever purchased.  Radio shack wouldn't honor the extended warranty I purchased so I was just out of luck and these are just not worth even attempting to fix or replace. It's really a shame that you can't get decent headphones, that will last and don't cost an arm and a leg...and even when you do spend that arm they rarely last more than a year.

VBelieve all the negative reviews regarding the flimsy wiring with these headphones.  The sound is quite good through these especially for the money.  Unfortunately the wiring that connects to the cups is thin and cheap.  The housing to the right cup has cracked on mine and I no longer have sound out of the right side.  Major quality issue since I've only had these for 9 months.  By comparison I have a couple pair of AKG's which have lasted for years but they have a single side wire.  I used the Sennheisers a lot so if any of you people plan on using these phones quite a bit you may want to think twice.  There is a good possibility they will fail.  I treat all my equipment well.  I didn't step on them, etc, the flimsy cable simply broke.  Again, this is unfortunate because the sound is well on par with my more expensive AKG phones.  But for headphones that only lasted 9 months I can only give them 1 star.  I'll try and get Sennheiser to send a replacement.  Either way I will update my experience with them here.

VI purchased these headphones mainly to connect to my computer to listen to music and check its sound quality for simple audio editing without connecting the computer to my main stereo.  I am also using them to connect to my ipad for music/video entertainment.  That said, my audio quality testing was performed while connected to my stereo system.AUDIO QUALITY: The bass is more than sufficient.  The midrange and treble seem to be to weak points.  The sound is almost "muffled" a bit and clearly lacks detail.FIT & BUILD:  The headphones are light and the ear pieces fit well.  Everything about the headphones feels "cheap" though I believe they will work fine for me.  I'm fairly careful with my equipment so I don't think they'll break anytime soon.  You mileage may vary.BOTTOM LINE:  These are a solid headphones for the price.  If I wanted better, more audiophile sound quality, I would have looked elsewhere but these work well for my needs.

I have found a treasure! These headphones are not only affordable, but the sound quality is just mind blowing! I compared it to 2 other headphones I have, plus one of my sisters, and this blew all of them out of the water! Bass and tones are so clear and rich - I can't wait to travel with these and just block everything out. Also, this fits snuggly over my ear, and is so comfortable, after a while I forget that I have them on. The design keeps music in, and unwanted noise out. Sometimes I don't even listen to music - I just use them to shut out noise when I want to read in peace. What a bargain! Sennheiser hooked me!

For less than $25 you getting way more in return than what you are actually paying for. For a price like that these are the most impressive headphones I have ever bought in my life.Stop looking at the negative reviews, if you usually owe apple headphones or other cheap headphones. These people are being way to picky not considering how much they are paying. Try to get $15 headphones from a store near you and you will know exactly what I'm talking about. Other negative reviews can be its broken or it came dirty in a box but that can be resolved. If your reading this, and you want good quality headphones but your on a budget I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO GET THESE!!!

VSIZE REALLY DOES MATTER!I have no idea how these headphones have such a high rating unless everyone else in the world has tiny ears. These headphones are entirely to small for anyone with normal sized ears and will crush them, leaving you in pain after only 15 minutes of use. They will not fit over your ears but on top of them. I just measured my earlobe size which is 2.5" by 1.5" so if your ears are the same size or bigger look elsewhere for comfortable headphones.They do sound good for the price you pay, but being in pain is not worth it.I did try to stretched them out over several books for a week and then tried again for another week after the first attempt didn't work, but they just keep going back to the same size. So, there is no way to make them comfortable.Final thoughts: Avoid these headphones unless your ears will fit into them and not under them.

VFor the price the sound quality is very sharp. I've been able to pick up little sounds and noises in my shows and music that I haven't noticed before. I'm not an audiophile so I can't go too far into how they differ compared to more expensive headphones, but for normal everyday use these are hard to beat for such a low price. The cord is very long but the included holder makes that a relative non-issue. The holder can be slightly cumbersome at times though. I don't mind, but something to be aware of. Oh, one last note about the holder, the ends are a bit too small/sharp. I used the file on a pair of finger nail clippers to smooth and enlarge all four pinch points on the holder. Not enough so the cord will just fall out completely, but enough that I don't have to worry about it shearing off the wire coating - which it started to do the first time I put the wire in.

VI had a pair of "pro" closed headphones that served well for many years and finally quit. These seemed like the close replacement for what I missed and indeed they fulfilled my (somewhat inflated) expectations for quality and performance. Decent quality (very good, for the price), good bass, well padded ear cups And headband, a ten foot cord and brand name reliability.Only negatives: the headphones seemed to chew on my ears as the hours added up (but basically comfortable for normal use). And, the "cord winder" is a simple piece of plastic. You wind the cord around and tuck it in to little cuts on the edge to make "secure". Not very farfignuggen or however it's spelled in Stuttgart. I couldn't use it, anyway.Overall, well satisfied with the performance and price at ~$20 for Sennheiser, is a bargain.

The bass is full and the treble is crisp. It's as if someone has added all new parts to the music I love! I greatly enjoy sitting back with anything from super delicate beach sounds to soul shakin' bass fueled vibrations, and these headphones were able to deliver on all levels. The plastic housing is flexible yet sturdy, they definitely don't feel like they're going to fall apart any time soon. And the removable ear piece is a quality feature. The cord is also more robust than your basic budget option. To sum it up; quality sound, super comfy cushion action, and an awesome price make these headphones a great buy.

At one time I would have said Sony had the best, but I simply don't see how any headphone could be better without literally blowing your mind (well, my mind), and at $21 the price is absurdly low. The bass is simply phenomenal and the rest of the frequencies, they seem nice and flat (the graph), although without proper gear I am only saying what I feel and hear. The chord is crazy long and the spool is nice to have, as without it the chord would be all over the place.

VBest 22 dollar headset around. The sound is above average for this price range, not as good or as well crafted as my hd280's but for the price they are great. They fit much better with less clamping than my 280's. They do a much better job at keeping sound in and out as well. The 280s keep the sound in but also bleed a lot of environmental sound in while these do not. I do have concerns about the build on the 202s they seem rather cheap and plasticky but for have a lot of features you wouldn't find in a sub 30 dollar headset. Plus they are lighter than my hd280s. Overall I bought these for listening to while doing chores and having a decent sound and they fit the bill well. It wontbreolace my nicer set but I love these for the price.

VThese work good.Honestly you won't find a 20 dollar pair of head phones that sound this good - ever.. but this is not the Senn. Quality I'm used to. I own some Lav's and a Microphone and those are awesome.. I say if you're doing professional audio - pony up the money and get some real Senn's.If you're doing cheap audio monitoring on a budget, these work great.The cord gets in the way for me also, it's way to long. Some people like that - but for me it's annoying. I shoot weddings and I don't need more than a few feet of headphone cord to monitor audio. They don't stay wrapped very well in the bundle accessory they provided either.

VWow. These headphones are better than expected. These are my 10th time buying headphones because the last headphones I got were had either a weak sound, uncomfortable, only working on the left ear, breakable, or all of the above. But these.. These are great! They're comfortable and GREAT sound. Way better than Sony, Skull Candy, Panasonic, Dre's Beats, or Apple headphones. The volume is at full extent.. Which is a great advantage because lowering it down won't be a problem and shutting the world off and being in your own space with no noise overpowering your music will exist with these headphones !! Definitely a great purchase. And the bass is amazing !!!!

p538

VI use these headphones to listen to audiobooks, and music as I walk in the park near my home. The headphones, which are on the ear, are pretty comfortable. My ears feel somewhat pinched after I've worn them for an hour. They block out a little environmental noise. They have a strong base response, and can produce very loud sound from my Sansa Clip MP3 player. Compared to an old higher end set of earphones I have, an AKG 340, the HD 202 music doesn't sound quite as clear and crisp, and the vocals sound a little muddy, but still the HD 202 produces a pleasant musical experience for me. The cord winder has worked well.All in all a good value for about $20.

VI Finally Found a Set I Can Live With
p550
sg5
VMy previous headphones gave out, and I was besieged by the long list of replacement options. This set had good reviews, and many of them. So I gave it a try. They are very substantial, noise canceling, and come with a neat plastic component that allows you to wrap and secure any extra cord so it doesn't flop around and get caught. The cord is long....good thing. So many headphone sets have very short cords, which requires that I go hunting in my electronics box for an extension. If these die down the road, I would purchase them again. The price is extremely reasonable for the high quality.

p556

VLike my title says, the sound quality is fine, but the fit didn't work for me for two reasons.  First, the ear cups were too small, so after 30 minutes the back of my ears began to feel pinched.  And secondly the head band is non-adjustable except for moving the cups up and down, so after 30 minutes I felt my head start to get squeezed.  After watching tv for about 45 minutes I ended up with a mild headache.  I returned them, and purchased a pair of Panasonic RP-HTF600-S Stereo Headphones for five bucks less.  They were much more comfortable and sound quality is comparable.

VThese headphones do not reproduce sounds accurately.  I got them to plug into a guitar amplifier so I can practice without bothering anyone with sound coming from the speaker...(when you plug headphones into the amp, the speaker/s turn off).First of all the sound quality is awful.  Different notes on the guitar sound identical on these headphones.  Actually they sound identically poor, not close to the actual note being played.  Saying the sound is muffled would be generous.  I cannot describe how poor the sound is through these headphones.  Distortion hardly describes the noise.I tried them on the computer for gaming, but the sound reproduction there is worse than my cheap computer speakers.As a final insult the ear cups themselves are sized for a child.  As an average sized adult the ear cups don't comfortably cover my ears.Junk.  I have used Sennheiser headphones before and been satisfied.  These are pitiful.From the Amazon description:"Ideal for DJ's and audio pros,Total harmonic distortion (THD): <0.5%Very clean, deep bass response,...for pro users"All lies.The "very clean, deep base response" is laughable.Don't waste your time and money on these.

VWire is flimsy and broke at the cup
p568
sg5
VThese headphones were great, WAY more than I expected for the $23 I paid for them.The problem is that the wire insulation came unattached from the left earcup, leaving the internal wires exposed. I covered it in electrical tape not wanting to send it in for service, but a few months later the speaker went dead.I sent them in for repair as they are still under warranty, and I am waiting to see what their decision is. I have never mistreated these headphones besides normal wear and tear, have never done anything to put excessive force on that cord. However, I know some companies will blame the customer for their own cheap construction.If these are repaired or replaced, I'll revise this review to 5 stars, as that's what I believe they'd earn perfectly constructed.ALSO, one minor complaint is that they are very loose on my head.  I find it surprising that people are saying they are too tight. They sound a billion times better when I press the cups tightly to my head with my hands. Again, I've never put any excessive force on the headband to stretch it out, just normal wear.I've owned these about 15 months, and use them on average about 2 hours a day.

I figured for $23.00, I'd take a chance. I am glad did! These are awesome!  While I agree with most of the reviewers about the fact that the Beats have slightly better bass,  I find that the Sennheisers separate the sound better than Beats.  Overall, the Sennheisers have adequate bass and  excellent sound clarity.  Take a chance on these!

I fixed this by using my already-owned portable amplifier. For some people this may or not be a bad thing. Overall, a great purchase that I'd do again given the opportunity.

VWell. I figured it was about time i wrote a review of these headphones because I just ordered my third pair... (I'll get to the reason for that later.) They are truly excellent headphones. I have never owned really fancy high end headphones, but when i compare with other similarly priced "cheap" headphones, these ones are far above the rest so for their low price, they're super worth it. I have big ears so when I wear these for a really long time, like 8 hours or so, the very tips of my ears sometimes start to hurt, but for most people it shouldn't be a problem. they're otherwise quite comfy, with squishy foam on the ear pads and the top of the headband. The sound quality compared with other brand is extremely good. And lastly, the cord is SUPER long, which I like because sometimes I will use a computer where the desktop tower is located inconveniently so I need a pretty long cord to reach it comfortably. It comes with a little round thing with a clip on that you can wrap the cord around for storage. It's nice.Only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because I am onto my third pair now for the last few years. That's because they wear out after a while. It seems like after I've had them for about two years, they always stop working, even though I take really good care of them, though disclaimer, I do use them very frequently, usually for many hours every day because I do a lot of work on computers and i listen to music during this. If you don't use them as heavily as me they'll last longer... But anyway, after a couple of years of heavy use, they always stop working in the same way--the sound will stop coming out of one side of the headphones because I guess the cord gets worn out. Then I use them a bit longer until I can't take it anymore, and then I throw them out and buy new ones. Honestly though, I'm not a headphone expert, and maybe two years of heavy use is a normal headphone lifespan. For headphones that cost less than $25 and have excellent sound quality and comfort, I can't really complain and that's why I just keep buying them over and over...

VGood Budget Headphones
p688
sg5
VI've had an opportunity to use these headphones for about 4 days, and at this point here is my review.Pros:1.  Cheap: these headphones are about ~$20.00-$25.00 brand new.  As such, the price has to be factored into how I rate these in terms of "bang for the buck."  You're getting quite a lot with the price.2.  Good, Not Great Sound: I'm not an audiophile, but they seem fine to me.  I use these mainly for listening to music and podcasts, and they perform those tasks without any issues.  I'm sure you can get headphones that eclipse the quality of these headphones...but  you'll probably spend several times what these cost.  Again, for the cost the sound is good.  One consideration also lies with what you are listening to.  If you are listening to a lot of lower quality music files (mp3, aac, etc.), there is only so much that your headphones can do for that lossy format.  Sure, higher quality headphones can really provide you with the best possible experience, but at a certain point you're getting diminishing returns.3.  Decent Build Quality: I thought that these headphones would be completely flimsy and prone to breaking if I looked at them wrong, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  Sure, they don't seem/feel like expensive headphones, but they are not shabbily constructed either.4.  Surprisingly Comfortable: I expected these to be a pain to wear, or to be difficult to adjust.  I've adjusted them exactly one time: when I got them.  They appear to have gotten "broken in" so that they easily slip onto my head when I put them on.  The padding on them isn't luxurious, but it isn't any different than I have seen on other non-premium headphones.  For ~$20.00 headphones, they are fine.Cons:1.  Cord Length: The other reviews aren't kidding.  The length of the cord on these is crazy.  I understand that some people will use these to plug into a stereo and then sit several feet away, but not everyone listens to music that way.  Frequently, people listen to music (at least nowadays) on their phone.  I don't have a need for several extra feet of cord, but I have to categorize this as a minor mark against this product.  They do include a plastic oval-thing that you can wrap the extra cord around and clip to your belt.  It's a bit unwieldy, but it works.  And it is nice to be able to walk away from your phone/computer if necessary and not have to unplug the headphones on the rare occasions where you might do that.2.  The Plug Is Fat: the 3.5mm plug/jack is relatively fat where it plugs into whatever device you are using it with.  If you have a case on your phone, you are either going to have to remove that case or get an adaptor that has a slim 3.5mm jack.  Again, this is not a huge gripe (especially if you are not going to use these with a phone that has a case), but with my cased iPhone it simply will not plug in and I'll have to buy an adaptor/extension cord.  It wasn't expensive, but I'm not sure whey they decided to go with such a fat plug.3.  Package Is Hard To Open: at least the one that I received (this was a gift).  It's one of those plastic packages that doesn't appear to have a seam with which you can easily open by hand.  You will have to use scissors and it will be a chore.  Again, this is a minor gripe.  They might have one type of package that is sold online and in stores, and I can understand making the package difficult to open in a store, but it is really difficult to open.Overall: Definitely worth considering if you are looking for cheap, functional and "good enough" headphones.  I recommend them.

VAn Overall Great Set of Headphones
p693
sg5
VI have gone through a lot of headphones in this price range. I bought these one day and haven't found anything that can compare.The Sound Quality: Like others have said, it's the best for the price range. I'm not in to the physics aspect of it; I just want to know if they sound good. These do. The trebles are clean and not buzzy, and the bass is clear and crisp, but not overbearing. I listen to a large variety of genres - pop, rock, electro-house, k-pop, classical, chiptune, dubstep, and others. They also sound consistently great.The Structural Quality: Sadly, I think Sennheiser has been progressively reducing the quality of these headphones. I've gone through four or five pairs in the past few years, but the time in between each purchase for me seems to be shorter. It is nice that the speakers pop out of the head brace, and the head brace is fine. No issues with that. But the part of the cord that exits the speaker has unraveled on me more than once. Granted, these do get a beating from me by being tossed and bounced around my backpack with heavy books. So it may just be an issue with me. But, nonetheless, having a sturdier cord would probably solve that problem. Maybe an ever-so-slightly increase in its thickness?The Comfort: Very comfortable, BUT: these make your ears HOT after only 20 or 30 minutes of use. 60+ minutes of continuous use of these and your ears will feel like they are cookies baking in an oven. So, they double as earmuffs too - if you live in a colder climate this should not be as much of an issue. I should also note that I have a HUGE head and BIG ears, and haven't had a problem with these fitting.The Other Notes: The cord length is crazy long - I wish there was a model available with a shorter cord for people who don't need the extra length. Each time I have purchased these they have come with a free 3.5mm to 1/4 inch adapter so you can plug your headphones into a 1/4 inch jack if needed (great for those that need it). It also comes with an oval-shaped chunk of plastic that you can wrap your cord around. I've never utilized that tool.Overall, these are great for the price. I would recommend this product, but would mention what I've written here in order to aid someone else's purchase.Blessings!

VI bought these headphones about a year and 3 months ago for a Europe trip. I wanted over the ear headphones so that they would cancel out some noise on planes and I didn't have a small fortune to spend on noise-cancelling ones. As soon as I opened the box I was impressed by the quality of the packaging. I was too excited to just sit there and examine the packaging. I opened them right up and plugged them into some bass tests songs I had. I was blown away by the way they handle them. I was used to the included crappy ipod earbuds as well but still these were fantastic! It was like listening to music for the first time all over again. I got a cheap pair of headphones because I wanted to shove these in my backpack during travel and not worry about if they get broken. Well after a month in Europe they were spotless. The cord is quite long but it is meant for a studio. So if you have them in your computer like I do you can get up and move around and have plenty of room too. The included cord wrap is great if you take some time to wrap the cord. sometimes the cord will come out of the notches in the wrap-up but it is not a big deal. One day I did pull these out of my backpack and one of the earphones had popped off the headband. Luckily it wasn't broken and just popped right back in.After about 6 months you could tell these were broken in and lost some quality but still sound great. I have more money now so I am in the market for some nicer Sennheiser's (Love the company) but I will still keep these as travel.Pros:Sound fantastic for Under 30 bucksDurable (headband hasn't shown any sign of cracking and cables and earphone padding still in great shapeI find them comfy. Wore these for 8 hours straight on the plane without taking them off. Although your ears might get a little warm.Block at least 50% of outside noise just by going over the earCons:Sometimes the headphone pops off of the headband if too much force is appliedThe adjusting notches of the headphones can wear down so the earphone part might adjust itselfLoses some aggressiveness after about 6 months of useAll cons put aside these are fantastic headphones from a fantastic company for a fantastic price! If you need some headphones that perform well and you are going to take them around or beat them up these are the ones! They are cheap as dirt too! Thanks for reading!

VI've owned the now discontinued HD 505 version of this phone, costed only a few bucks more, but sounded just the same (only silver instead of black). Had them for nearly 10 years, before I stupidly stood up from my desk with the cord tangled up underneath my seat, and one driver got disconnected (cable broke).they lasted me long time, and I never had complaints about them. I had many near cable break accidents with them, but the cords are very strong!These headphones are excellent for listening to modern music. Rap, Pop, Rock, R&B;, House, Techno, Drum and Bass, Break-beat, just about anything that has a modern pop groove, and some drums sound good through these phones!They are sounding nice crisp, with nice lowend. If I'm correct these headphones are 24ohms, which means they should sound lower in volume than 16 or 8ohms headphones, but because of their large drivers they sound just about as loud! They can be very loud indeed!I've compared them to the much more expensive Sony MDR-V700, which sound almost the same; except these phones are more crisp and lowend, and less mids than the sony's.For that reason I would not recommend these phones if you are an audiophile and request the best and only the best, for live performances, or jazz or classical music,as these phones won't be able to accentuate the mid frequency instruments as well as the Sony's can.However if you're a hobby musician, a regular music lover, or a person who knows something or very little of audio quality, you can save those extra $150 in your pocket by buying these, as they sound almost 98% the same as the much more expensive sony's!The build quality is sufficient, you don't have much flexibility in the ear caps,but they should fit comfortably on nearly all people's headsFinally, these phones are closed phones, meaning less noise will radiate from them, so less chance of disturbing travelers sitting next to you in the bus, and reverse, less noise disturbing your music while having them on, compared to 'open' headphones.Some people mention that these headphones may cause tiredness after listening to them for a while, but I never experienced that.

VI'll preface this by saying I am not an "audophile" - meaning I don't analyze the treble and bass, that to me "burn" means something is on fire, and mid-tones apply to color palettes. Okay, so you get that I'm not the most knowledgeable about music. What I DO know is when something sounds "right" or "off" to me.I just received these yesterday, and based on prior reviews (pro and con) I have been breaking them in continuously since I got them. I should note that I am a computer person; I work at my desk, so long-wear headphones that play well with computers are a must. I listen to a wide variety of music - R&B;, Rock, Jazz, Folk, etc., and have sampled varied selections just to see for myself. Everything sounded wonderful to my (admittedly untrained) ears. The bass was strong but did not drown out the softer notes, and I actually heard vocalists very clearly. I now hear nuances in music I didn't hear in my earlier, more expensive Skull Candy headphones. Pretty much every musical genre I've played has sounded "right". Of course, I can always tweak the equalizer settings on my machine if I really want to get things just right (doesn't everybody?).Regarding comfort, I've worn these a few hours in the evening, and pretty much all day at work (have them on as I'm typing this review). I didn't experience the heat others mentioned, though I would advise against wearing them outside on a warm day. I also found them comfortable (and I do not have a tiny head). The chord is long, but for me it is an advantage as I need to move around my desk freely. The provided clip works extremely well in managing the length. These babies plug into your computer headphone jack right out of the box, which is a big plus.I've read some prior complaints about the sound not being so good, etc. All things are relative. How many people have or can afford expensive, high-end headphones (or otherwise have nothing better to spend that money on)? I'll accept assertions that Bose, etc., sound better, but those are beyond my price range. Hey, if you can afford those pricey 'phones, then treat yourself, you deserve it! But, if you're like me, and money IS an object, you cannot go wrong with these headphones. As someone who tends to be frugal, I've tried plenty of cheap headphones in my day, so believe me when I say that, barring a "Black Friday" sales event, you will not find better for this price.

VI'm not much of an audiophile, I bought these to blot out the sound my family makes constantly in order to focus better on my stuff so I didn't really want to spend more than $20 but I wasn't expecting these to come out so good!I'm testing them with most of my music (since I listen to various genres from power metal, to heavy, to rock and aaaall the way down to some folk and celtic) and so far, nothing sounds bad to me, they fit my head like a hat and haven't experienced any discomfort (though I've only been using them for some 20 minutes).Oh! and the cord! So many people complain how long it is, well to me that is just great (be warned: it IS long though!) since my computer's front line ports don't workI have to connect them to the back of my desktop computer and the cord is long enough to go back there, so having a long cord is awesome to me, since it lets me stand and slide a few feet around my desk without taking them off. The only thing this would need to be a perfect 10 would be to have a volume control attached to the cord and I'm more than happy.The plastic I was expecting it to be flimsier as people mentioned, it sure doesn't seem to be a state of the art but it looks flexible and resistant enough and I'm hoping it will stand for a while (or maybe longer, since I always try to take good care of my stuff); and that would be all for now I might update if something comes up :)______________________________________________________UPDATEWell I've had them for a bit near 2 weeks and have experienced no problem or discomfort. After tweaking my sound settings a little I realize how loud they can be, I don't need to take the volume all the way up to bloat out any other noise (as I had to do before with a pair of really cheap headphones and even with all the volume they still didn't do the trick), but these babies sure do without problem; just by putting them on I notice the difference when people are talking near me, and once the music is playing that's all I can listen to, people have to poke me or I have to really turn down the volume to be able to listen to them.As for the cord I figured it's so long I might step on it by accident and ruin them so I shortened it by wrapping it around itself and making a loose knot with one of the little wires that came with the headphones, I only left enough to move around freely and that way I can just pull the cord and get more length easily without damaging it. So far the only thing I have noticed is they may get a bit warm after having them on all day (which I do), but it's not a big nuisance to me, I just take them off for a while, take a little break, walk around a little and then go back to wearing them again.

VI recently bought a guitar and a practice amp to play on.  Not wanting to be a jerk and force anyone else in the area to listen to my poor playing I picked up the HD 202 II's due to the respected name, the good reviews, and the outstanding price.Until now I have been using earbuds or sport-style headphones such as my Sennheiser  MX85 Sport Series II Twist to Fit Earbuds.  So keep in mind my experience is not with high-end over-the-ear headphones - I am a regular guy and couldn't even try to keep up with an audiophile on knowledge.  That said I have to admit I am pretty impressed at the quality.  Even though I don't know much about audio I do know what I like and that usually twenty or so dollars is very cheap for a decent set of over-the-ear headphones.These badboys are pretty light, almost deceptively light.  I half-expected them to break removing them from their package.  Whatever they're made out of is pretty tough however as they don't feel cheap and flimsy in spite of their light weight.  The padding is ample without feeling too bulky, and they don't make my ears feel hot even after over an hour of constant use.  I haven't had a chance to plug them into the amp yet but I have been listening to them (even as I write this) to music and they sound great.  Pretty good noise isolation but keep in mind I work in an office, so they may nor may ot drown out a jackhammer fifty feet away.Their light weight plus the nice padding makes for comfortable wear, and they have sounded great across the multiple music genres I listen to.  Sound is very rich with strong bass and clear treble with no "bleeding" as distortion and tempo picks up.  I am sure there are much nicer sets out there but for a regular person who cannot or will not spend significant amounts of money on audio these are highly recommended.

VThis is an astonishing pair of headphones for $25!  I have owned Sennheiser phones for years (the others so old I could not provide the model numbers without substantial research) so, I know they are excellent hadphones.  I bought these to replace a cheap, cheap pair ($5 panasonics) which I bought for when I am listening to my mP3 player outside.  mI bought those because I live in an environment which just chews up electronics: the Windward side of Oahu, where we typically have 99% humidity (or worse, it rains more often than not), salt air, sulpher (from the volcano)... nothing lasts here :( so I bought some headphones I would not have to worry about for when I am doing yard work or in my semi-enclosed studio.  We also have a pretty substantial amount of ambient noise for a rural area: fighter planes from the nearby Marine base, weed whackers, highway noise...so I usually have a pair of head phones on when I am outside.  I had thought my cheesy phones "OK," i.e. better than I would have thought a $5 pair of headphones would be (and better than the earbus which came with my shuffle, or zen, or zune, or Archos).  I stumbled on these for 422 last week and decided to order a pair, and WOW! what a difference.  I didn't know MP3s could sound this good!  These phones are also good at blocking out ambient noise; a dramatically better listening experience.  I had qualms, not having ever seen a pair of Senheisers in this price range, but just a few seconds put those doubts to rest.  The sound is excellent, and while I can not compare it directly to my other Sennheisers (as I will not take those outside, use them with the same player, or in the same environment) these provide the best sound of anything I have used with any of my MP3 players, including speakers.  The sound is clear and rich, very life-like.  i will echo what I read in another review: they are not very comfortable with eyeglasses (or sunglasses, or other protective eyewear).  It is a tight fit, but, that is where the noise reduction comes in.  these have completely, completely blocked out the noises which leave me feeling stressed and irritated at the end of the day; astonishing! )blocking out fighter planes just overhead!)  There is no question but that the open-air phones are more comfortable... or that, for me, they would not be especially good in this particular environment.  I am guessing that if I wore them without eyewear they would be a good deal more comfortable (but, that would not be particularly wise, for me, when I am working ;)  they are not so uncomfortable that I would even consider going back to what I was using before (any of my other phone, plugs, earbuds...) in fact, I am thinking about ordering a second pair in case these are discontinued, or mine disintegrate from the salt-air, or my kids run off with them ;)  If you do not like a tight fit, look at the open air phones, but you are not likely to find them in this price range.  What you get for $25 is just fantastic!  if you are willing to spend $300; well, these may not compare favorably, but I would be very very surprised if there is anything else you can get for $25 which sound half as good.  I know there are numerous more detailed reviews of these phones.  I added my 2 cents because i am so happy with these, and so surprised at the sound quality in a pair of $25 head phones!Edited 12/4/2011 to note that after living with these for a year or so (almost daily use) I wonder 1) why they have such a long cord? (really unnecessarily so) and 2) While the take up reel (to contain the ridiculously long cord) was a good idea, it is very badly implemented.  It crimps/ compromises the cord some without providing a secure catch.  It frequently pops out/ come unwound creating an awkward (and for me sometimes dangerous) situation.  Most people will not have the exact same issue (as I wear these while sitting over a 2000 degree torch, and so distractions... are a very bad thing).  But, I can not imagine many people would opt for a 10-15 foot cord.  I guess it is a plus if you need to be across the room from your equipment, but.... even when I was on the air there was never a time I needed a cord of this length.  Consider getting a velcro tie up Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties, 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long, Black, 100 Ties per Pack (91140) for the cord to contain it.  Other than that, it is hard to complain about such good sound for so little $$.I vacillated over giving these 4 or 5 stars: took one off because they are not as comfortable as other Sennheisers, but then put it back on because the sound is so good, and the value:amazing!--------------------update----------------------------------I came back to revise this review to lend some perspective.  I did not mean to in any way imply that these are audiophile phones. They are not, and do not touch the sound quality of my Sennheiser wireless, open air, or 460s (I could go on ;) )  I bought a pair for my  daughter as her first headphones. My husband wears his when he walks the dog (often in the rain)and doesn't want to ruin his Grados, and I wear mine in my outdoor studio.  We all have better headphones, but use these when we are in an environment which might damage the others (or, even these).  I have had mine for 3 years now, which is a lot of milage from a $25 set of headphones, and that is the context for this review.  These are pretty great for $25! For a little more you can get better headphones: Sennheiser HD 429 Headphones Black or Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Studio Monitor Closed-back Dynamic Stereo Headphones e.g. BUT for inexpensive headphones, these are pretty great, if you can deal with the ridiculous cord.Because of the insanely low price I even purchased a few extra sets as back-ups, but these have held up remarkably well and my back-ups are still in their boxes.

VModel:  Sennheiser HD202  (no MkII mentioned anywhere on box/product)Seller:  AmazonPurchased:  2011-05-04Review updated:  2013-02-27Pros:+  Sounds good for the price+  Loud enough for mobile devices (relatively low impedance)+  Long cable with winder is benefit to me (other reviewers disagree)Cons:-  Not truly around-the-ear, but not fully on-the-ear either.  5/10 in comfort.-  Bass is too boomy and unnatural for studio work or critical listening.-  Lack of noise floor sounds odd and makes me suspect highs are rolled off.---  Dual cable is annoying (splits to both ears) and thin (will probably fail eventually).  [2013-02-22 update]  Left cable failed at earpiece entry with careful, non-portable use.Details:I needed an affordable set of headphones for use with live performance mixing at a church, but I initially tested them in my home and this review is based around home stereo listening.  I wanted to test drive these cans before buying a pair for myself.  I purchased the HD202's directly from Amazon using supersaver shipping and received them in the usual time.  The product page claims they are the MkII version, but neither the box nor the headphones said anything at all about these being the MkII model.  Other people have reported the same issue when buying directly from Amazon.  However, this matters little to me as I am not aware of any major difference in either design or sound quality.Build quality is merely okay for the price.  Everything is plastic, but I expected that.  Though I doubt these headphones would survive punishment, they will be fine for me.  The plastic headband cannot be bent to alter the clamping pressure, but I found that the pressure was about right for my rather average head.  The cabling is very thin and splits near the headphones to supply each ear piece.  I don't like the thin cable as it may eventually fail and other reviewers have mentioned just such a problem, but I tend to take care of my equipment so perhaps this will be fine.  The Y-split in the cable is more of an issue for me as I don't like having cord go to each side.  However, this design does avoid cable failure inside the headband, which has happened with other earphones I've owned.  In theory, the Y-split cheaper to manufacture and avoids complex cable routing that can short out.  In reality, you'll find a handful of other reviewers that had the cable fail where it enters the ear cups.The 202's are not tight or uncomfortable on my head as some reviewers have reported.  I was expecting the worst and was relieved to find that I could wear these headphones for quite some time without discomfort.  They do eventually hurt my ears after hours of listening, though.  Other reviewers are correct when they criticize the headphones for being smaller than expected.  The ear cups are not large enough to fully surround most ears, yet they don't necessarily sit on top of the ears, either.  I imagine that this fit depends greatly upon the user's head and ears.  I find that the padded cups just barely fit around the top and sides of my ears, but sit on the earlobes around the bottom.  People with larger ears may not like the fit.  Another reviewer found that the inner surface of the earphones tended to touch his ears and after hours of wearing them I found this to be true.  The cups simply need to be larger and deeper to be truly around-the-ear.Sound quality is good, but not superb.  I am accustomed to neutral-sounding, open-backed (i.e. more expensive) headphones and was initially rather shocked at the exaggerated bass of these cans.  This "extra" bass is marketed as a feature of this model, so I shouldn't have been surprised.  At first the sound reminded me a bit of some of the Sony headphones I've tried; like muddy water.  However, the HD202's aren't quite that bad and most people will probably find the bass response a benefit.  I adapted to the sound and don't hate it, but it's not quite "right" to me.  I'll admit, however, that they sound good for a low-priced headphone and I'm not sure of anything that will beat them at this price.  Music that already has a lot of bass sounds boomy and muffled in these cans, but perhaps that's somewhat inevitable with a closed-back design.  Music with less bass sounds more filled out, though, so it's hit or miss.  It's rather surprising how much the exaggerated bass ruins certain tracks, yet seems neutral or even compliments other tracks even of the same genre.  I never have this problem with more neutral sounding headphones or speakers, so these Sennheiser's certainly impart their own personality to the sound.  That personality is usually annoying, but hip-hop lovers will probably like the effect.There is another sound issue that I can't quite get used to; the lack of a noise floor.  I highly suspect that my shorted-out old headphones ruined my listening skills as they were quite noisy, but by comparison the HD202's seem unnaturally quiet to me.  I cannot hear my antique integrated amp's fairly substantial noise floor through these cans and that bothers me.  It's not helpful to simply crank up the highs in the EQ, however, as the sound quickly gets harsh.  Cymbals sound fairly muffled or gated in these cans; they are plenty loud enough, but seem to fade quickly.  Music generally sounds so clean that it becomes sterile somehow.  If you take away the exaggerated bass response, these cans sound flat and uninteresting with no musical warmth whatsoever.  But, hey, they cost thirty bucks.  Let's face it; at this price most headphones are crap and designed primarily to makes bass-heavy music sound good.  The HD202's are aimed squarely at that market, but they usually don't allow the bass to ruin everything else.  I suspect you can't do much better for the money.  I'm passing on them, however.  My pair will be going into service in sound reinforcement mixing (neutrality not a priority) and 'll be saving up some more cash so I can get a better pair of headphones.  Basically, I tried living with affordable earphones and failed.  Each time I put these cans on my head I am annoyed that they exaggerate the bass.  On the other hand, they are great for watching movies without disturbing anyone.[Edited 2013-02-22]  Just a note that the Left cable shorted out after a year and a half of careful use.  The failure occurred at the point where the cable enters the earpiece, just as some other reviewers have reported.  Contrary to my earlier review, these headphones ended up being used solely in my home and never for portable listening.  My HD202's have certainly not been abused and the cable has not been wound up or bent sharply in any way, yet the cable failed after about 20 months.  The headphones are otherwise in great shape, but I must rate cable durability as extremely poor when I consider how many other reviewers have reported a similar failure mode.

VI got these years ago with leftover hotel points; I didn't know anything about them except that Sennheiser is a well-respected brand.  Turns out they're very well regarded for this price point (lots of positive reviews on here) and I have been extremely satisfied with them.Pros:--very good, open sound quality; they reproduce a very wide frequency range and allow you to hear details that you completely miss on lesser earbuds, car stereos, etc.--nice soft but durable material on the pads; very comfortable--extra long cord, which is great as I can plug them into our A/v receiver and sit in the chair on the other side of the room--the adjusters for each ear piece have sturdy-enough detents that they never slip out of adjustment when I'm wearing them--they're made to be serviced if you ever need/want to (i.e., the earpieces snap off the frame and then disassemble with screws)--they're durable - more than once, I've left them plugged into the A/V receiver and found my wife on the couch watching TV with the volume cranked loud enough for her to hear the sound from the phones, which were sitting across the room next to the TV.  This of course you would never do intentionally, and makes me quite angry, but luckily there seems to be no damage to the headphones (probably helps to have a strong enough amp so that there's no clipping).Cons:--The padding doesn't breathe overly well, and can make you sweat if, for example, you're outside and it's hot--while the long cord comes in handy, it can be a pain when you don't need the length (although you can wrap it around the cord holder, which has a handy clip on it)--that's about it

VBest for smaller ears... Great value
p749
sg5
VI purchased these headphones mainly for my wife to use with her Yamaha PSR E333 keyboard, but of course I have been using them lately, and I will say they are a great value. My wife an I both have "smallish" ears, and these lightweight headphones fit perfectly. I think for anyone who has large or long ears may not find these to be comfortable.The ear cups adjust by sliding up or down at the point of connection. That connection also swivels a bit to allow for a nice custom feel. All the padding is super soft, but I could see it getting ripped if one were not careful. The cord seems well connected into the headphones and is at least 8 ft long. The little cord keeper that is included is just OK, but it functions. These headphones "seal" really well around my ears, so I have to be really careful to make sure and have my volume down before I put the headphones on, or they will really blast my eardrums. The sound......... These things sound amazing for a $25 pair of entry level headphones. When I first plugged them into my laptop and headed to YouTube, they seemed a bit muffled, so I pulled up my laptop's equalizer and was able to really get the headphones dialed in. I was able to get warm rich tones, high highs, and clear bass notes. They also do an excellent job of keeping the audio in the ear cups as my wife can't hear anything from four feet away. She loves them with the Yamaha keyboard. The included larger size adapter fit in the keyboard perfectly. The only con I can come up with is I didn't purchase them sooner. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks.SPO

VI'm not an audiophile, so if you're looking for a professional review keep moving. I have owned many pairs of headphones in my time though. Brands I've had int he past include JVC, Coby, Sony and Koss. These Sennheisers blow them all out of the water.I find the earbud style to be very uncomfortable. So this over the ear style is the way to go for me. These ones fit snug over my ears, which are of average size (I think). If you have larger ears you might have some trouble. My head is another story as it is a little larger than average. Not much of a problem here though, as the Sennheisers seem to accommodate nicely. Hat size is about 7 5/8ths for reference.The sound quality is outstanding. Again, I'm not an audiophile. Also keep in mind that I bought these for under $25. But I truly could not be happier with the sound. The packaging promotes the bass and with good reason. It isn't so heavy that it makes your ears vibrate. Instead it fills your ears with deep rich sound. The highs are clear and ambient sounds come through beautifully as well.I want to share with you what I am using these with just for reference. I bought them to go with a new MP3 player I purchased. The Sony Walkman NWZS545RED 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Red, a model which has been praised for its sound quality. I will review that later. Great pairing!So to recap, the price was great, the fit was good and the performance met and shattered my expectations. Hopefully I'll have an update down the line to speak to their staying power. But for now, I highly recommend these headphones!

VI don't know if the other negative reviewers are on something, but these headphones for only 20$ are among the best I've ever used. The sound quality is superb (well at least on my Ipod Classic), and the balance between treble and bass is evenly layered out so it doesn't sound bleak. I got these buggers 4 months ago and I still use them for daily use. The noise isolation is very good, well at least for me because I have small so ears so the suction cups wrap around my ears completely and provide ultimate isolation. On top of this, these headphones are loud, and that gives it a major plus. However, there's a slight chance you may have to get the KOSS inline volume control, because when I say loud, they are LOUD. Even on 1% volume with my Classic the music is still rather opening, but use of the inline volume control the sound becomes a lot quieter.There's only one minor fault with these headphones, and that is the cord is outrageously long. And to add onto the inline volume control, the cord extends nearly 2-2 1/2 feet. It's not really a bad thing, but it does occasionally get in the way of things.But to conclude, these headphones are probably the best 20$ I've ever spent. I get top of the notch quality with these things, and then more. I would strongly reccomend these cans, and this is coming from an Audiophile. (Well sort of lol)PROS:Might be the fact i'm using my Ipod Classic, but the Noise Isolation is very,very good.Sound QualityDurableBuilt strongCONS:Cord LengthGET THESE HEADPHONES!!!

VI received the product today.  Despite the warnings in other reviews about the sharp plastic edges after opening the package, I managed to cut myself on the package.  And that was me being careful, I thought.I was expecting the sound to be weak based on other reviews, and while these headphones required a higher level on my volume control than my previous Sony low end (MDR V150) headphones, there was more than enough power from my tiny pocket radio to power them.  I do think the cord is quite thin - especially compared to my previous headphones.  The plastic holding one of the earpieces to the headband broke on the Sony unit which is why I got these.  The headphones before the Sony had a thin cord (like these HD 202's) and that cord had issues with sound cutting in and out.  The plastic winder supplied for the excess cord is WAY bigger than I expected.  It is much too bulky to use when on the go.  But using the ties that come with the cord when shipped should do a good job of containing the cord (that is what I have done with previous units).  The ear units on the 202's are a little larger than the Sony's and the padding is significantly thicker.  After limited use, I am very pleased with the sound, volume and fit.  I seldom wear them for more than an hour at a time so hope I do not experience any of the issues others report after longer wearing.  My biggest concern is the thin wire and whether it will stand up with repeated use.I will update this review if I have problems.

VWhen I ordered these headphones, I was slightly apprehensive (though hopeful after reading the product reviews given on here) due to a purchase of the Sennheiser HD201 Headphones a few months ago...that I returned the very next day. The HD201 model leaked a lot of sound. An outsider could hear pretty much everything at 75% volume.The HD202 model is much better. It does leak some sound at 100%, but at about 75% it still holds up. Sound leakage is a big deal for me, because I'm a student that does school work in quiet computer labs or just around people in general. They aren't perfect, but they work better than anything else I've had.The sound quality itself is pretty decent. I'm not used to good headphones, so I have nothing better to compare them to. I had a cheap pair of SkullCandy earbuds before these and I hated them.It does not do a very good job at noise cancellation. At 50% volume I can still hear voices and movements sometimes (depending on what I'm listening to).Comfort wise, its nice! The ear phones swivel a bit, and the cushion at the top is nice. If you wear glasses though, it might start to bug you after about an hour or two.The cord is very long...but they give you a nice cord wrap.Overall, I'm happy with these, especially for the price I paid. They do the job that I got them for! And thats what matters.

VA little over five years ago I bought these same headphones and have been very happy with them - primarily because they are inexpensive, sound good, and are more durable than I expected.  I have accidentally stepped on them and tripped over the cord, ripping the plug out of the jack, many many times in the past five years - and they continue to work!  The foam ear surrounds were covered in a thin plastic material and those coverings have deteriorated, but other than that my old headphones are still holding up.  The ones I just bought are the same model number and they look the same.  They are MUCH tighter, so not as comfortable to wear for longer periods.  That may be because my old pair got "stretched" from use; maybe that will happen with this pair too.  But the main difference is the sound; these new phones have WAY less high end than my originals.  They sound positively muffled, and I'm older and already have significant hearing loss at higher frequencies.  The difference is dramatic - I compared by immediately switching between them, plugging into the same source.  Is this because the "kids today" just love bass?  IOW, did Sennheiser marketing make the call here?  For what these cost it's not worth my trouble to return, so this brand new pair will be my backup until my originals just disintegrate.  One other thing: you'll need the jaws of life to open the packaging!

VI bought these headphones from another retailer but figured I would put in my two cents here.Pros:For the price, I personally feel the sound is phenomenal. I have another set of fancy gaming headphones I use at home that were 5 times the price of these, and I honestly cannot tell the difference in quality between the two. I love bass and these certainly deliver.They have an extra long cord and come with a plastic cord-wrappy thing. Very handy for me, as I use these at a desk and would otherwise be rolling over the cord with my office chair.Cons:Comfort. I bought these specifically  because they are cheap, heavily padded, and around-the-ear style. I use these for my job so I wear them 8+ hours a day; any pressure on my ears gives me a headache after a short while. I thought all the padding would mean these would be super comfortable. Wrong. The ear cups on these are TINY. Like, miniscule. I am not a large person (5'1") and my ears barely fit. So yes, they get hot. Secondly, the cups are not very deep. Even though they are padded, the cups are so shallow the interior speakers actually press on the shell of my ears. By the end of the day I have painful red marks from the pressure on the folds of my ears.In sum, great sound, but too painful to wear for long periods of time. I will be replacing them.

VTldr: Sound is great, durability not so, but Sennheiser will fix them for you so overall a great deal
p802
sg5
VThis is an updated review after using four pairs of these headphones over a number of years.First off, the bad: the durability is so-so. The audio wires have 3 weak points where they connect to the ear cups and to the audio jack, and most likely they will eventually break at one of these points. In fact, for two of the pairs I have (did not try with the other two) right out of the box the sound cuts off if the wire is gently pressed where it connects to the audio jack. So I'd say only get these headphones if you plan on using them while standing still. They are definitely not jogging material and probably not even walking around material.Now the good: Sennheiser will fix them for free if they break during the TWO YEAR warranty. I've had to send 2 pairs in, one was repaired, the second they replaced with a brand new pair in an unopened box! How nice is that. :) The whole process is done on the Sennheiser website and is fairly painless, they even provide a shipping label. And it's possible to download the proof of purchase off your Amazon account, so it's not necessary to have the original paper receipt lying around.Why I keep buying them: Because for $23 and at least 2 years of use, these sound amazing! Factoring in the sound, price, durability and occasional inconvenience of having to drop off a pair for repairs these headphones are a great deal.

VBought this set of headphones for my daughter.  She is a smaller 15 year old so the fit wasn't as snug as she would have liked.  However, she wanted to keep them because the sound was so good.  She said the sound was better than earphones.  This was just what she was looking for.  They are comfortable and unless she has the volume really cranked and I'm not aware of it, she claims she hears no outside interference.  For the money, these seem to be just right.Honestly, I'm not knowledgeable about this sort of equipment and never heard the name of this brand before.  I was actually looking for the standard household name brand, like Sony or Bose.  But Jeez...Bose is $$$!  Especially for a girl who is rough on her "toys".  My daughter has gone through 3 pairs of earphones in a year!  I needed something more durable for her ITough use.  It was the reviews sold me on trying this brand and then this particular pair out.  That is why I try to give reviews because they really help me decide.  Although I must admit, I hate writing crappy reviews unless the product is just horrible.  Then I will rip the product right up.  It's just easier to write about products that deserve it!  If it's not worth recommending to others, I won't usually bother writing a review.  I don't really have the time!  Hope this helps someone!

VUpdate Dec 2013: Some reviews have claimed that these headphones don't last, and I just wanted to update and say that I've had no problems since buying these in fall 2011. Still working as good as new!I love music and listen to it all the time, but I'm not the kind of audiophile who can hear a difference between MP3s, CDs, and LPs.  That being said, these headphones have been a real pleasure to use.  I use mine with a Sansa Clip+ most of the time, and occasionally I'll plug them into my computer.  I wear them with the Clip+ for 8 hours a day at work to block out chatter while I concentrate.  Occasionally, I am tasked with loud assignments like industrial paper shredding; they keep the shrill mechanical noise out well.  The soft ear cups block out everything once a little music is going, and they are light and comfortable enough to wear all day.  The plastic is light, but I don't feel like it is fragile.  The cord is really long--maybe about 6 ft--which is much more than I need, but Sennheiser included a spool for the excess to be wound around.  I think they have a nice depth of sound, but again I don't make a living by being able to tell the subtle differences in music.  If you don't either, I'd highly recommend these headphones.

Vas far as sound goes i don't think it can get much better than this for $20. they sound fine and have some decent bass compared to my sony mdrzx100's that i paid $20 for a couple years ago. the highs are definitely not as crisp as you'd find with more expensive headphones but are still pretty decent. i'm completely satisfied as these will suit my purposes for them. i bought them to fill in a gap in my headphone arsenal. i needed some lower level headphone options for mixing songs with and for that they are great! they make for a good bass and mid freq reference. the only issue i have (and its a minor one at that...) is that i have a rather large and bulbous cranium:^/ and these don't quite wrap around my head the way i'd like them too. perhaps over time the headband will ease up but only time will tell. until then i will make good use of these as they are.Update: 9-15-14: these are really great headphones! they sound really good for the price the ONLY problem for me is that they are not adjustable to wrap properly around my rather large and bulbous cranium;^( but they have been very useful to me in highlighting inconsistencies in my mixes and helping me to achieve a pleasing sound;^) i use these against my Shure840's for reference.

VSound Quality, Comfort, and Portability, at a Great Price
p844
sg5
VLet me start by saying that these are some of my favorite headphones I've ever owned. I've owned a pair for casual listening and travel for several years and just recently purchased a pair as a gift.First things first, the sound quality. The drivers produce clarity and quality very comparable to cans 3-5 times their price. The bass is punchy enough without being overwhelming and highs are bright enough, especially or $20 phones.Comfort is a bit subjective obviously, but I can wear these things longer than any on-ear set I've ever used. I have quite a big head, but never have I felt like I'm being squeezed to hard or rubbing my ears wrong with these. I think this has a lot to do with the way the phones actually pivot on the headband.The cable is incredibly, possibly annoyingly long at a honestly ridiculous 10 feet. It does come with a competent cable winder, but it really is perplexing as to why they put it on there. Its also worth noting that with the Y style cable, one going directly to each phone, it is possible to break the cups away from the band which is perfect for travel.All in all, these are really great headphones and a value juggernaut as far as I'm concerned.

VI bought these and a few other pairs of over-ears to experiment with. I've been using in-ears for most of my life but over-ears were recommended to me by a friend so I thought I should experiment.My favorites among those I bought where these and the Behringer HPS3000 Studio Headphones. They are both really good, but these are the compact version where the Behringers have a little more weight to them.Pros:-Compact, light, easy to carry, light on the head-Long cord (you can adjust how much you want with the cable wrap that comes with it)-Great sound quality -- I use these for gaming and I can hear every enemy footstep behind me, great surround soundCons:-Two cords (if this doesn't matter to you, no bigs. I had really wanted one)-These are a little smaller so they do feel a little tighter on the head than the Behringers. But they are good if you need something lighter.-Long cord (but it has a cable wrap, so this is okay)Overall: great headphones for a great price if you're looking for something to introduce you to the over-ear world. I would also recommend the Behringer HPS3000 Studio Headphones as an alternative if you don't like these.

p856

VI got these to replace my now broken Sennheiser HD 201 Lightweight Over Ear Headphones and I can't be any more happy with these headphones. Now they are smaller and tighter on the head than the 201s, which is the only complaint I have with these headphones for the time being; I've only had them for 2 days so that's not nearly enough time to get accustomed to them. In a way I sort of disliked how loose the 201s got after heavy use, so these headphones being tighter on the head is sort of a good thing. The ear cups are also smaller than the 201s and in my case actually more so go onto my ears. This does make my ears a bit sore after extended use.Now sound wise, these are louder than the 201s for sure; and the bass is definitely more powerful. Though I would say the bass on the 201s were cleaner. They're both great for the price point, but I would say I favor these more.I also really appreciate the cable winder that came with these headphones too, the 201s didn't come with one; and those basically have the same exact cable. The clip on the winder is also handy for on the go listening.So all in all, for the price point you can't beat the power and sound that these headphones have to offer.

p868

VThough a break in was required, the Sennheiser HD 202 sound is impressive for the price. I have owned my pair for a little over a year.The bass is not very punchy, but is pretty well defined. The mids and highs do not hurt your ears. They come out sounding fairly warm, and none of the voices or instruments sound muddy. From the various pairs of headphones I own ranging from $20-$500. I can say this is my favorite pair to use when in public. They do not attract unwanted attention, and they can easily be replaced if stolen, lost, or broken.For comparison to similar headphones in the $20 range, I own the Sennheiser HD 205 and Behringer HPX2000. The 205's sound close to the 202's, but fall short of the 202's bass response. They do feel better constructed and look a bit more stylish, but I would still buy the 202's over the 205's because of the sound quality. The Behringer's are pretty comfortable headphones, but do not have any bass whatsoever.On a side note, I want to disclose that my music player is either an Ipod Touch 4Gen on EQ Rock or Hip Hop. When played on my cellular phone, it is a Nokia Music Express capable phone with custom EQ settings. I hope this helps the readers a bit more.

VSennheiser HD 202 MK 2 are wonderful. Comfortable, better than Bose. I like to watch netflix on my spiffy laptop. With the headphones when sounds such as the shootout in front of the bank in Heat the quality is amazing. 12 gauge shotgun slugs, and 9mm smashing glass are realistic. The first movie I remember watching and of course listening to was Rampage. The antagonist in full heavy armor is walking down the street firing an AK-47 indiscriminately. Bose "You aint even in the running". Sennheiser is in a class by itself. I listen to classical music like MONTEVERDI (1567-1643): Vespers of the Blessed VirginMonteverdi ChoirEnglish Baroque SoloistsJohn Eliot Gardiner, conductorand the incredible sounds are like actually being seated in one of the worlds great Basilicas listening live as the great music is performed. It is easy to forget you are listening and to feel like you are at the original performance. When your new headphones arrive and you open the packaging, you are opening a window to a new and wonderful world where only imagination can limit you. Be sure to listen to a little classical music, even if you never have before. You will be glad you did. Enjoy the moment, life is fleeting.

VI recently received the Sennheiser HD 202 from Amazon. I had been looking for quality headphones for some time and saw that several major artists use Sennheiser, and I saw this one on one of the favorite dubstep artists. Ironicly enough, I was listening to a song by that artist when my headphones blew out during a bass drop! Sad! My first instinct was to get Sennheiser HD 202, and they meet and surpass any expectations. It's like hearing a totally new, better, song. A totally new music experience. Well you may say to yourself, I don't listen to dubstep. I personally listen from everything from dubstep to pop, to rock and roll, and to jazz. I must say the Sennheiser HD 202 have impressed me on ALL levels. The bass brings out the rich tones of the instruments and you can actually hear extremely small twinkles in songs that you probably NEVER knew were there. They sound equally amazing with the volume at any level. They are also extremely comfortable, cover ears completely in a dice music done, and fit comfortably for a long time even with glasses. If you want durable, amazing, comfortable, inexpensive, quality headphones Sennheiser HS 202s are for you! Don't spend it elsewhere. Great investment.

VThese Sennheiser HD 202 headphones have good sound, but unless you have a head the size of a kids', you won't be able to wear them very long. I read several reviews where other people were saying that but, measured the intended head, determined it is fairly small, and decided maybe the peopple complaining had larger heads. I should have believed the reviews. These headphones are comfortable for my thin, 12 year old grandaughter, but she's the only one. I've had several people check them out and all say the same thing. Too tightly uncomfortable to wear for more than  half hour or so.Since I like to listen to music while catching up on things at night after hubby has gone to bed, these will not work for me. Will look into returnng them. Does anyone know of any low cost Senn's that have a little more rooom for an adult head? I wear a size small hat, so it's not my head.I already own the HD130 & HD 140, which are fairly comfortable to wear for long periods, and just need a lower end set for occaisional use on another computer without having to disconnect them off my desktop.As I said, the sound is pretty good for low end hedphones, just wish they were comfortable.

VMy old iPod headphones broke so i went on a search for some decent headphones. I wanted some good headphones for watching movies on my iPad with minimal outside noise interference but I know I don't want to pay $200-300. During my research i eliminated beats by dre because I tried them out watching zombieland and they were so tight it gave me a headache. I came upon these and I like the price so I read the reviews here and went to YouTube checked out more reviews and I made the purchase. I'm glad I did. First movie i tried them with was The Dark Knight and i can say they gave excellent sound canceled all the noise around me I was in the movie I forgot I was laying in bed around me was my kids laughing and talking and my wife talking on the phone and I was happy that I can only hear the movie only when the scenes in the movie were real quiet can I hear a little outside noise but nothing that distracted me from the movie oh and yes they are comfortable on the ears. For the $20 I Paid for I can't ask for more but I did take some reviewers advice and registered the headphones they have a two year warranty if anything goes wrong. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase

VFor the price, I think they're great.  The sound is pretty clear, not muddled, and the high end is high enough and quite crisp (again, relative to the price point).  If you're looking for big bass, however, look to something larger.  They pass the Nine Inch Nails test and the Itzhak Perlman test, but not the 2pac test.  The sound was not as clean as my old pair which was basically an open-ear version of these.  But I needed a closed-ear/sealed pair for my office so I could play music loudly without disturbing my coworkers.  In this respect, they are great.  I seem to be able to play my music as loud as I want - loud, Nine Inch Nails sort of things - and my coworkers say they can't here it at all.  They aren't sealed enough to cut out noise from my end, i.e. I can hear people talking fairly clearly if they are on and my music isn't cranked up.  As for comfort, I find them to be a little tight, and they aren't big enough to fit around my entire ear so there is pressure on the ear, not just the head.  At first I was somewhat unhappy, but I adjusted (or perhaps they loosened up a bit).  I can't wear them for more than a couple hours at a time, for this reason.

VI have a pair of Sennheiser HD570's that I love, and another pair of Sennhesier headphones that are over 20 years old and still sounds great and work wonderfully.  So I had some expectations of the HD202 when I bought two pairs last Christmas for my kids (middle school aged).Well...the product just has not performed well.  The ear pieces on headphones are somewhat small, which worked fined for the kids, but are not comfortable for me.  The sound is not as rich or warm as my HD570's (okay, to be honest, I did not expect these to perform at that level), but it still was not as full as I would expect.  Again, for my kids, it was fine.  The biggest issue -- it is less than a year later and both pairs have had one ear piece stop working.  Neither pair has been abused or used in any type of extreme condition.  Mostly used to listen iPods and portable video games around the house or the summer road trip. If both pairs were still working, I would consider this about a 3.5/5 product, but the failure of both is unacceptable.This year I will spend a little more and find something that has a chance of lasting for a few years.

VQuality Assessment:- Sound is very balanced and crisp.- Good bass.- Good highs.- Excellent mids.- Very good quality sound.- Blocks out outer sounds very well.Summary:The Sennheiser HD205 II are great and a fantastic buy on Amazon!Detail:I've historically used Sony Headphones (I'm a fan of Sony) at the $50 - $60 price point and these headphones @ full retail sit at the same price point. The difference between the two are like day and night. I've produced 2 studio albums with my last set of Sony Headphones (in the aforementioned price bracket) and when I put on the Sennheiser HD205 II, I was able to hear detail and clarity in music that I was previously unable to notice headphones at the same retail price level in the Sony's offering.To make the deal even sweeter, I only paid $17 for these (found them on sale on Amazon, they're normally not less than $50 full retail). These are literally the best quality earphones that I've owned to date and I paid less for them than for any other decent headphones I've used in production work.Buy them!

p926

VThese headphones are Ok considering the cheap price, but there are certainly some cons to consider as has been mentioned by others as well.If you want quality, comfortable headphones this one isn't quite there.Pro'sThey are fairly efficient with decent volume and bass response.But I wouldn't get them again.Cons:The 10ft long cord gets in the way sometimes and it's very thin so longevity can't be expected.They have soft padding but I can only wear them about half an hour before they start to hurt since they only fit over fairly small ears.The small 1 1/4" x 2" inside opening is too small to fit over an average person's ear's so it ends up pressing right on the edge of your ears.The "Y cord" is not a good feature, basically there's a thin wire coming out from both sides so the wire ends up under your chin where the 2 ends joins back together.It's a lot more convenient to have the wire exit from ONE side only.  This has 2 cords to keep track of.It's too late now since I didn't catch some of the detail in time.

VI purchased these headphones because I just needed something for the office. I'm not an audiophile or headphone connoisseur. I have a desk job at an ad agency that requires long hours of sitting and it's nice to play music or listen to something while I work. As I've done marketing work for Sennheiser in the past this may seem biased since they were a former client, but I chose these because I knew it was a brand name that has great quality regardless of price point.These headphones confirm that belief. The sound quality is good for the price. I'm not overly impressed but not left feeling anything is lacking. They are perfect for what I need.I have been using them for about 2 weeks now, for about 2-4 hrs a day. They come with a nice 10 ft cord that you may find too much for your needs if you're like me and just using them at work, but it's nice to know that if I need that range, it's there. They also incluse a handy spool that you can wind the access cord not being used around to keep things neat and tidy.Honestly, the only real negative about these headphones is that they are uncomfortable when used in long periods. Anything over an hr and my ears start to get a little soar. But for the price, I can't really complain.If you just want a reliable good quality headphone that you'll only need for short increments, I'd recommend these.

VEXCELLENT RELIABLE QUALITY HEADPHONES--great sound, great base, great quality
p938
sg5
VEXCELLENT EXCELLENT head-phones. I had to to through three different headphones (from different companies and different brands) to finally find head phones that are priced well and actually demonstrate quality---these headphones are made with great material, reliable material, offers great sound, even has base, super long cord--some may not like a super long cord, but use a twist tie to bunch it together if necessary. The long cord offers immense flexibly and moveably, but the important thing is that these are QUALITY headphones.They don't break easily, I carry them everywhere, in my backpack, to the gym, in my purse, i mean i take them everywhere and they hold up VERY VERY well. I am telling you A GREAT BUY for someone who needs headphones often. I use these heads every single day.  Keep in mind, if they are a little snug when you first get them, they WILL loosen up with time and little use. Please don't be discouraged if at first they are a little snug--it gets better. For the price its difficult to complain. Worth the purchase, Go for it!

VI bought both these and the Sony MDR-ZX100 ZX Series Headphones (White).  I listen to music all day at work, so I bought one for work and one for my home office.  While the Sony's have a sleeker look and are cheaper, I'd purchase these over the Sony's without hesitation.Sound QualityThe sound quality is similar to me.  The Sony's are rated for a wider range, but to me they sounds about the same.ComfortSome reviewers say that these are uncomfortable, but I don't mind them.  Compared to the Sony's, these are much more comfortable.  The band over the top of the head is tighter with the Sony's, also it is not padded (as it is with these).  The other thing is that the padding around the ears greater with these than the Sony's - you can see that just by looking at the pictures.So if you're looking for headphones and comparing these against the Sony MDR-ZX100 ZX Series Headphones (White) which are in the same price range, I'd buy these if you need the comfort, buy the Sony's if you are more concerned with the sleeker look.

VI bought these to use instead of ear buds with my iPod in a noisy work environment. I mostly listen to podcasts so noise reduction was my main goal and these have more than fulfilled that purpose. Sound quality is great and I can turn the volume down and still hear spoken word. The ears cups are pretty soft and almost cover my entire ear but I have large ears so I knew going in that might be an issue. More importantly I was concerned about the headset being uncomfortably tight on my big head. From reviews here on Amazon it seemed that they would be comfortable and they are. I usually wear them for up to 8 hours at a time and have had no issue with comfort. The cord is extra long too which was a bonus compared to the ear buds. It comes with a cord winder for the slack and sometimes that falls off my desk but maybe I just haven't figured out the best way to utilize it. I am very pleased with this purchase and I feel that the price was excellent. I would have given them 5 stars if the ear cups were a little bit bigger and therefore more comfortable for me.

VAmazing headphones for the price.  I picked up a pair for my mother in law for christmas as well as a set for myself for a business trip.My mother in law uses these with her Kindle to watch Netflix and Hulu without bothering my father in law.  She likes how it blocks out the sound of whatever he is watching on tv and how he can't hear what she is watching.I like them for the fact they are over the ear and while not noise cancelling they block out a good amount of sound while on a plane.  You can still hear the low hum of the engine but not like how you do without them on.Only downside is the material feels sort of like a vinyl and will get sweaty after a few hours of usage.  But that doesn't matter much because you get hours of usage without them becoming uncomfortable.  I had my original pair like this last for about 3 years before one of the ear cups started to short out and the material started to separate on the headband so for the low price you get great sound and a few years of usage.  Totally worth it.

VThis is how music is meant to be heard! I'm blown away by these headphones. It's a beautiful balance between highs and lows that I was looking for and these headphones absolutely deliver. You won't get any more crispier highs and bottomed out bass from any other set. I highly recommend over anyone trying out affordable headsets at a reasonable price. I listened to Stevie Ray Vaughan then moved to highly bass driven sigur ros and wow these can handle it all. I'm glad to shell out a minimal cost for quality headphones. Sennheiser knows what they are doing when it comes to sound. The cord is at least an 8 plus foot length when it comes to keeping your music player in your bag and just letting your playlist take care of the tracks. Good job on an affordable set that blows away a $300 pair of beats. DONT BUY BEATS!!! The over the ear design is Super comfortable and I was able to fall asleep with them on. This is an amazing product if you want wired headphones without the need for battery power. I am highly impressed so far

VWhen you write a review, you have to keep certain things in mind.  Price point and then the rest.The only reason I am taking a star is that my ears started hurting after 2 hours.  I am very picky with my music.  That being said, music appreciation is very subjective.  This headphone delivers excellent bass response, that is clean and realistic.  You feel like you are in a soundproof room, which is the way headphones are supposed to sound.  I sit next to the tv with this one and the tv looks like it is on mute with my headphones comfortable high.Some people may not like the high response but it is clear and not extended to overpower your music, guitar sounds clean, cymbal is like it is next to you, tabla is a joy.  IMHO, the highs are perfect.It also does well when the volume is turned up high.  What is wrong with this?  Maybe it can get a little sweaty but how else do you achieve noise cancelling without hugging the ears closely?For $30.00 this is a steal!!!

VI bought these to use with my digital piano, so I was looking for something that would be comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and provide rich sound quality.  I trusted the positive reviews on these headphones and I'm glad I did.  I regularly play for over an hour or more, and I have yet to find them uncomfortable.  In fact, they are so pleasant to wear that I almost have to remind myself I'm wearing them before getting up.I like that they come with the 1/8 to 1/4 adapter since my piano headphone jack is the 1/4 inch plug, and the cord is nice and long so I don't feel constrained to limited movement.For only $25 I'm impressed with how they sound.  I feel I'm able to get the full range of what I paid for in my digital piano (a Casio PX-150), and actually prefer to play while wearing the headphones over outputting through the onboard piano speakers.I'm very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend these to anyone interested.

VI'll admit to purchasing these headphones mostly out of the great price they were listed at.  Granted, the purchase took me a couple days to make as I compared several brands with many reviews to find out if they would be a suitable fit for me.  When I received the headphones today, I was overjoyed to finally have a pair of headphones that weren't the usual $5 pieces of crap that were simply affordable rather than what would be wanted.I'll say they fit damn near perfectly on my head/over my ears.  There is light pressure but it's easily forgotten once the music starts pouring in.  The clear distinction of all instruments, the crispness of vocals, that perfect emphasis of bass.. all blend into a wonderful experience from the beginning of a track right until the end.Do I regret this purchase?  No.Is it worth it?  For anyone looking to upgrade some dingy set of headphones or simply looking for an affordable and enjoyable experience, yes.  It is worth it a thousand times over.

VWork fine when cable is intact
p992
sg5
VThey're very nice for what they are. Not expensive. They fit comfortably. The sound was fine for awhile when I got them.Still, the flaw is that the audio wires are affixed to the headset. Eventually, they get snagged on a branch while you're mowing, or they get caught on a drawer handle in the kitchen, or the wire gets damaged in a million other scenarios. And once the wire gets damaged slightly, the sound isn't the same.Why, at this point, isn't it standard to just make all headphones feature audio cables that can be unplugged? So when they catch on something, the cable pulls right out instead of breaking the point where they connect? So when the cable is otherwise damaged somewhere, you just pull out another $1 audio cable and replace it?Seems like a design flaw at this point. Unless it's intentional because they've crunched the numbers and realized they'll sell way more headphones by letting the audio cable remain such a weak spot?

VI'm writing this review with the understanding that these headphones cost under $25...Sound quality - unbeatable at this price.  Solid bass, decent accuracy.  They could handle my bass guitar when being used as a direct monitor.Comfort - Okay.  They weren't uncomfortable, but not really super comfortable either.  They're acceptable.  They didn't bother me after using them for a couple of hours.  They're nowhere near as comfortable as my Beyerdynamic DT770.Cable - Super long and comes with a cable manager.  The cable does connect to both ears and I prefer the single ear configuration.Bottom line - These are the best under $25 headphones you can get.  I've tried a bunch, and these take the cake.  The HD 201 might be slightly better in some respects like appearance and possible comfort.  However, I believe the sound quality is a little bit better in my opinion, although it's obvious that the EQ is tilted toward the low end somewhat.

VMy kids love listening to music, and these headphones are perfect for them.  The cord is very long, which makes them handy on the occasion when they need a long cord.  But, the cord can be wrapped in a little device that is included for that purpose, so the cord is not in the way when you do not need the extra length.  My son, who is a high school senior, has been using his to listen to music while he does his homework.  He listens to Jazz and classical, and is particular about the sound of his music.  He loves the sound of these headphones.  He also finds that they block enough outside sounds that he is not distracted while doing his homework.  It helps him concentrate.  When my daughter asked for headphones for Christmas, we researched headphones again, but ended up buying the same headphones for her.  We didn't find anything else in the same price range that looked like they would be better.  She has been using them the last two days, and loves them!!

VI get these at the same time as a HD 201 because I can't decided which one will fit more my needs since both have great specifications for the price.After I get these and try them, these are more appropriate for my girlfriend since she has an smaller head than I am, the sound quality is great, the ear cup is great, the ear fits really good inside of them and isolates the external sound just by that great quality ear cup.These are my first Sennheiser headphones but for sure will not be the last, their quality and fidelity is beyond anything I have used before so I love now this brand.I can't believe a headphones with such amazing quality for less than USD$30.if you are in budget these are a great option, if you have a big head as I am, then pick the HD201 who has almost the same quality features but with a different form that will help to improve how comfortable they are.

VThese aren't noise canceling but just putting them on the world around quiets down.  I'm very impressed with the quality for the price. As an audiophile guy, these seriously sound 10x, no make that 20x better than the standard earbuds that ship with the iPhone, even some upgraded Sennheiser earbuds I bought that cost more than these headphones. Okay, so maybe earbuds can't match the performance of over the ear headphones can but if space portability (being able to stash them in your pocket when done) is not a concern like at home when you're tired of the wife talking (just kidding), or on a long travel trip, these make a great companion. Bass performance is good, but not over bearing. The overall sound is full and not at all tinny like what you get with small earbuds. The best thing about over the ear headphones is they are much more comfortable than wearing earbuds. For the price, you can't go wrong.

I have traveled with these headphones, thrown them in my work bag daily, worked out with them, (watch the long cord though on the machines!),  and turned them every which way but loose and they are STILL going strong!  Not only is the durability amazing but the sound is beyond high quality in comparasion to the more expensive headphones such as BEATs, etc.  My nephew, (teenager), borrowed my headphones on a long roadtrip.  He did not want to return them once we got to our destination.  I asked him what happened to his sworn testimony regarding BEATS?  LOL  At any rate don't look at the cost and think they are not worth much, price should be higher in my opinion.  I would utilize these in the studio also, (coming from a former rapper).  High quality, just can't say enough about them!

These are definitely not tight.  I can wear these all day.The sound quality is also great.  I'm not a pro, but I think it's great.  I listen to a very wide variety of music from Rap to Classical and it all sounds great.  I also use them for streaming video from my laptop.Adjustable and long cord.When I purchased the first ones, there were reviews of humming.  I did have that problem at first---BUT I realized it was due to an USB fan connected to my laptop.  I disconnected it and voila it was gone!

VI bought these as an inexpensive way to keep down distraction in my "open office plan" office.  (A horrible idea for people paid to think for a living.)  These are the first closed headphones I have owned.  I have more expensive Sennheiser and Grado headphones.These were a huge improvement over the ear buds I had been using in the office in both sound quality and keeping the distracting sounds of co-workers from disturbing my work.  My only complaint is they feel a little tight on my ears and if they had a bigger can to fit around my ears instead pressing against them it would be much more comfortable.Over all though, I still look forward to listening to them when I get into the office.  Yes there are better headphones out there, these are better than any $25 pair have a right to sound.  Give them a try before dropping more for less sound.

VWorkhorse headphones for a great value!
p1050
sg5
VThese headphones have been a pretty solid buy so far. I bought them primarily for my guitar and bass (wanna plug in without waking the roomies and neighbors) and they have worked fairly decently. Overall, the sound is muffled for that purpose, but listening to recorded stuff? It's amazing! A friend recently recorded a demo, and the sound quality change compared to regular ol' earbuds was so much better with these puppies. If you are looking for recording headphones? save up and get something more, but for the casual listener who wants more out of their experience, and versatility for a good price, you can't go wrong. The ONLY complaint I have is this: the cable and wraparound attachment (otherwise you have quite a bit of loose cable) is a liiiiittttle too bulky for my tastes, even with the belt clip part, but with winter approaching, I can just stuff it in my pocket.

VExcellent sound - but very uncomfortable
p1056
sg5
VAfter thoughtful consideration, and reading so many reviews, I bought this headphones. My main deciders were audio quality, price and reliability (based on brand name). In all those criteria this headphones is a clear 5-star for me. One other pros that I hadn't thought about is the length of the chord and the convenience of winding it to appropriate length - very thoughtful by the designers.The only thing I don't like about it is the inconvenience it causes in the ears. Wearing spectacles, amplifies the strain near the ears. I was hoping that with time the plastic will lose its tightness - but it has been 8 months and nothing has changed. It is good in some ways, but the discomfort persists. But, when I start watching something that is far more engrossing, the discomfort gets out of the way. So, if comfort is an important factor for you, look elsewhere.

p1062
sg5
VI have been using these headphones for the past 2 months and have been very happy with them. They are comfortable, at least for the 1-2 hours I usually wear them at a time. The sound quality is more than acceptable for this price point. Those that say these headphones sound as good as $100+ headphones just aren\u2019t realistic. However, these do sound very good.One aspect of these headphones could be a pro or a con depending on your needs. The noise cancelling or rather noise muffling\u2026 I, for one, like the amount of noise these keep out. It muffles all the sound going on around you while still allowing you to tell when someone is talking to you. Necessary because I work in an office where I actually have to interact with people on a regular basis.I give them 5 stars for the quality they deliver at this price point.

VSo my standard iPod headphones were getting old-- the rubber peeled off, wires were exposed, etc. I needed new headphones. BUT, I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a pair of headphones and a picture of Dr. Dre. Sorry, I'm in college; I don't have money. So, I got these. When they came, I was blown away by the sound quality. It was a definite upgrade from my broken, crappy iPod headphones. A couple of minor complaints: the cord is ridiculously long, and the headphone itself is a bit tight. I know others have been complaining that it was unbearable, but for me it wasn't too bad. I just have to take a little break every thirty minutes or so because by then, my ears feel as if they're on fire from all the blood that's in there. It's honestly not as bad as it sounds. So overall, great headphones for the price. Highly recommended.

VBuy the 201s instead ... or save up for something better.
p1074
sg5
VI bought both the Sennheiser HD 201s and HD 202s, with the idea of picking one of them to leave at church for mixing live sound. I bought the Audio-Technica ATH-AD700s a couple weeks ago (were $92 !!! for a day, seem to be ~$112 now) for home use.The 202s ... meh. Tight, earpads are smaller, fit ON my ears (which aren't that big), and uncomfortable compared to the 201s. The 202s seem to have more/louder bass, but maybe the tighter fit is one reason. Lower the bass ~3dB and they sound similar in the bass, and possibly a bit clearer in the mids and highs, but I couldn't imagine wearing them for more than 1/2 hour. I do have a large head, so that might be part of the 'problem'!Bottom line: Unless your head is on the smaller side, and/or you like tight-fitting 'phones, get the 201s instead. They compared pretty well with the AD700s in comfort and sound quality. In fact, if you can swing it, look for the ATH-AD700s to go 'on sale' again and get those! They are actually worth the extra money ...

VGood Quality Headphones
p1086
sg5
Vusually purchase the cheaper ear-buds locally, as I tend to break the cord easily, but these headphones are far superior to what I was used to hearing. Before everything sounded the same with the cheap ear-buds, but now I can clearly tell when listening to my audio books if the speaker used a cheap quality mic or a higher quality mic. Sound quality was just far better than what I was used to so you be sure that I'm actually quite happy with this purchase.The only downfall is the fit, which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Initially the fit didn't feel too bad but I could feel it press lightly against the ears, and as time went by if I left on my ears for too long it would get worse and really made my ears hurt. Will invest in another pair that is slightly bigger over the ears once this one gives out.

p1092

VI am new to buying headphones as I bought earbuds since I was in Junior High.Someone told me try headphones for better sound, but I remember the old headphones that hurt my ear and was just a bother to have on my head.I purchased these headphones just to see how different they are from earbuds. As soon as I played my first song, I knew I had been a fool all this time. The same songs that I have been listening to sound much better and the bass sound incredible. The comfort of these headphones let me forget that I am even using headphones. They are very lightweight and the cushion of the ear pieces feel snug, but comfortable.My only complaint is that I am not used to how long the headphones wire is. But, that is just a personal preference and does not diminish how amazing the headphones are.

p1098

VWhat a pleasant surprise. I was really just looking for some cheaper noise cancelling headphones to wear at work. I use studio headphones and have in my home studio arsenal cans by Shure, Sony, and Beyerdynamic. These Sennheiser HD202's are simply amazing not just for the price point but for the comfort and function. The sound quality is absolutely stellar, even when listening to a 48khz AAC+ web radio stream. And now that I have these, I've noticed them being used in radio studios and being included in condenser microphone package deals. I also like the belt-clipping cable spool that comes with it so you can wind up the non-coiled cord neatly.Haven't used these for studio work as of yet but they do sound comparable to my $200 Beyerdynamic 770's and sound much better than my Sony MD7506 cans.

VLong-time Sennheiser User Disappointed
p1104
sg5
VI've owned Sennheiser microphones and headsets, and always revered this brand and its products.  But this headphone just does not do anything special for me.1) Too tight, uncomfortable even at the max stretch.  Like the three-star reviewer said, after a while it actually hurts.  For me, it's more like 10 minutes.  It may work for kids, but not the average adult.  I have a normal head circumference, not a walking candy apple or anything.2) The earpieces are neither comfortable nor have any sound isolating effect.  I know it doesn't promise it, but you'd expect some protection from noise.  My ear buds ranging from $6 to $30 all do a better job.3) The sound is okay. Nothing bad, but nothing "sennheiser" about it either.Recommendation ... skip this one.

VI was in the market for a nice pair of headsets - and saw the great reviews on this and decided to buy these to use while I searched for a "real" pair of headphones.The sound quality of these is far better than that of my Apple earpods - and of another set of headphones I have.  The thing I like about these most is the fact that no one else can hear anything I'm listening to - even if I have the volume cranked up to the max.The sound quality is so great, I can hear notes and details in music that I have never heard before - even with classic rock songs I have been listening to for decades.I was going to buy a nice $300 set of whiz-bang headphones, but these are just so good - and such a game changer that I haven't been motivated to get another set.

Seems a lot of people think Sennheiser products are very, very good and yes they have some expensive ones too but again after asking around I was told these would work fine for my needs, and they have.The only negative is the length of the cord but with the little gismo that came with the headphones you can rap the cord around the thing and it works fine.Has a nice balance of sound, keeps some of the outside noise out and best of all, I didn't spend a ton of money on them!

VThe range on these headphones provide deep rich crystal clear bass as well as crisp very pronounced highs.  The listening experience is very nice, and blows every single pair of headphones I've had in the past of the water.  They easily give those expensive $150-$200 headphones you see at Best Buy like the Dr Dres 'and Bose a serious run for their money.  Maybe not quite as good, but for $25 they come close enough.  I would highly recommend these to anyone.  I also think the comfort level is great.  The thick padding also helps to cushion your ears from quite a bit of background noise.The cord is quite long, but they give you a plastic piece to wrap any unused slack in the cord and it also has a clip for a belt loop.Once again, an exceptional value!

It is sharp & clear and I hear sounds i I didni't notice before on my cheaper headphones. If you're listening to music at work, other people don't hear your music. They stayed on my ears very well and were very comfortable for about an hour and a half.  After that, I took them off, adjusted them, gave my ears a minutes rest and they were fine. I also like the fact that this product has a long warranty.  Would defintely recommend to bargain hunter, such as myself, who don't want to spend a lot, wants somethig pretty good and aren't looking for high end headphones.

VThese replaced an expensive high end set of JBL's that my son gave me 2 years ago. The JBL's headband broke making the headset unusable. I bought these Sennheisers for about 1/10 of the price and they work very well for me. They sound good to me and I still enjoy the music as much as I did 50 years ago with my first set of  headphones. This is my second set of these and they are far more durable than the JBL headset. With my recent experience, I have to consider headphones to be throw away items. I would rather throw away a broken $23 set than a broken $250 set. I have never had to throw a pair of Sennheisers in the trash. Disclaimer: I have worked around running jet engines my entire adult and my hearing isn't what it used to be.

VApril 29th 2012 is the day I purchased these and I loved them. I ran over the cord one too many times and they couldn't take it any longer. I've had many pair of headphones but these are honestly the best I ever had. Its true, at first they grip your head with a death grip but once you get used to it that grip gives these headphones a true strength. Of all the times I tilted my head finishing a soda or doing the dump truck with a bag of chips, these headphones stayed gripped and true. The sound quality I would rate a 4/5, the build of the material a 4/5, and the price a 5/5. But because I can't rate a 4.8/5 I'm going to just give them the 5 they earned. I will be ordering a new pair, and I am happy they are still available.

VVery disappointed in these. First pair I had; the wiring on the right side started to break right where the wiring goes into the speaker casing. It started off with the audio cutting in and out then started popping and crackling. Luckily it happened right before a year so Sennheiser sent me a replacement pair. Second pair; 8 months later same exact thing happened and I'm no longer in warranty. I can only conclude they use really really really cheap wiring. I didn't handle them like they were glass but I wasn't very ruff on them either. I've had a pair of $20 Sony's for 9 years now and they only reason I bought these is because the ear pads on the old Sony's are getting thin. Guess I'll be pulling them out of retirement.

I could just rope with the cord, I do not like that it has to be so long. The 201's are much clear and are much better quality I believe. Three of us in my house tested out both and all of us had the same opinion.I figure for 20 bucks each, what is there to complain about. In the end, I am keeping the 202's for my Ipad, and the 201's are on their way to a soldier in Texas who needs them for school.so the end result is:If you want louder get the 202If you want clear sounds, the 201's are the best bet for the money.

I've been using this exact model for years now (originally purchased in 2006) and they are far and away the best cheap headphones you can buy. They have a very rich sound and a really long cable-- and if you prefer a shorter cable, they include a spool to wrap it up with. I wouldn't recommend these for heavy portable use, but if you want a cheap-ish pair of headphones with great sound to leave at your home or office, you can't go wrong with these.

VThese headphones are excellent for their price range.  I'm used to sub-par sound from headphones, and these are a large step up as far as sound quality goes.  However, there were a couple of cons.  Firstly and mainly, the audio jack that plugs into your device had a lot of useless plastic that made the jack too large to fit in my iPhone with the case on.  This was solved by cutting a bit of excess plastic off with a razor blade.  The second con was more of an annoyance.  The cord was a mile long.  I had to bundle the cord up in my hand with my iPhone while I went for a run.  Other than that, the pads that hug your ears was slightly smaller than expected, however still tolerable.  Overall decent product.

Not looking forward to the earpad ever coming off again. Still worth the buy though.

VThese headphones have remarkably good sound quality for the price. I have listened to a variety of types of music so far - eclectic taste runs from Brahms to Gaga to Nine Inch Nails to Thievery Corporation, and I have found the clarity, range (particularly well defined bass) to be nearly comparable to my son's ludicrously expensive Dr. Dre phones at one 10th the price. Although these don't have noise cancellation, they do a pretty good job blocking out ambient noise, notably my husband's snoring, which was one goal for these phones. Some reviewers have mentioned discomfort after wearing for a while. I have a pin head, so that isn't an issue. I take out earrings if I'll be listening for a while.

I find these to be priced at $50 USD at BestBuy.

VUncomfortable, but decent sound
p1216
sg5
VThese headphones are extremely uncomfortable for even short listening periods. The ear cups are not large enough to go around your ears and they aren't full pads like true on the ear headphones, so your ear is partially squished into the opening. Perhaps if you have large ears then they will fully sit on top of your ears? I have these and the HD 201s and find the 201s FAR more comfortable to wear, having no issues with them for even long periods.The sound is pretty decent out of these for the price, although I find the highs a little lacking. The bass is more pronounced than the HD 201s, but overall the sound quality of the HD 201s is better to my ear.

p1221
sg5
VWhile I didn't expect anything amazing at the price, I expected a lot more from Sennheiser.They actually sound pretty good, when you can get the sound to come through them. On about the fifth or sixth use, the jack started shorting out. Every time I use them, I have to make sure it's set "just right" or the sound doesn't come through. But when it does come, it's got a good balance with enough bass.The headphones are uncomfortable and have a very cheap feel. They squeeze on my head a lot, no matter how I adjust them.  Maybe they'd "break in" and stretch a bit with use, but getting them to work is frustrating.

VThis is the 2nd set that I've purchased.  The frequency response is great.  I bought them for my two gamers at home and they LOVE them.  The only issue that I will point out is that the cord can get in the way if you're not careful.  It's simply something to point out and not that big of a deal.  I point this out because the reason that I am having to replace them is because my son's use them at the computer.  Because the cord is so long they frequently rolled over the cord with the office chair.  I think this is why one side of the headphones stopped working.  Just something minor to be aware of.  Obviously I didn't hesitate to buy two more pair!

VMy previous headphones died and I did some research for cost effective headphones with quality sound. I narrowed it down to these. First off they are comfy and you forget you are wearing headphones. They produce crisp sound that is balanced with deep bass that doesn't sound "In the mud." I listen to a wide variety of music and they can handle it all. If you listen to dynamic electronic music (clean to super nasty) no problem! Bass driven music like hip hop, rock-steady,and reggae, no problem. Everything sounds good!  These are awesome headphones. I noticed things in songs that I never noticed before.  I higly recommend them 10/10 Must buy

VI bought these headphones back in December when they were only 20 bucks. Now I'm not sure if I got these for a steal or if the popularity just jacked up the prices. Now these are 30 bucks, I do feel these are worth that money. These are probably the best budget headphones out there, I was prospective college student in search for some headphones to study with, and these have done a wonderful job. Blocking outside noises, stylish, strong bass, clear, and again I must emphasize a steal. Keep in mind that the Sennheiser HD 202 and Sennheiser HD 202 II are the same product, different box.I am a very satisfied buyer of these Sennheiser HD 202 II.

p1245
sg5
VThese are not good headphones for workouts.Previously I have owned a Sennheiser 200 model which was OK.  It had a very good form factor but audio quality was somewhat poor.  After several years, it has worn out, so I purchased this model.I have returned this one for the following reasons:Too big and too tight on my head.  I do aerobics for 90 minutes, and I knew they wouldn't work.  My head would get too warm after awhile.Cord is way too long.  And the enclosed widget just wouldn't work for me.But for low-cost headphones used to watch a movie on your iPhone or laptop, they would appear to be an excellent buy.

VGot these as a gift to plug into my guitar amps for quite practice.  They really work very well in an amp.  Nice that  1/4" adaptor was included as my 2 amps have different size headphone jacks.  I can practice in a room full of people and the only sound they hear is the plucking of the electric guitar strings (i.e. they cannot hear the amped sound thru the headphones, like they could when I used earbuds or cheap walkman style headphones).  Very good sound replacation and comfortable to wear.  Oh and the belt clip hooks on to the handle of the amp so I don't have miles of cable getting all tangled up around the instrument cable- NICE!

VI work for 7 radio stations and these are our standby headsets for guests who drop by the studio during live radio shows.  The headphones look and sound nice, but in just the last year we've replaced 16 sets of these because one of the ears will inevitably drop out.  I'm pretty handy with a soldering iron, but repairing them is near impossible with the newer style wick they use on the conductors, they are basically beyond repair at that point and you just have to pitch them or go through the hoops of claiming the warranty.  Shouldn't be that hard to manufacture these for a longer life but they must be stuck on that $20 price point!

I work in broadcasting and after years of spending $100 + on Sony's that would have an earphone go out after a year, I decided to put down $30 or so on these and 6 years later they held up.  Only reason I am buying a new one is because the wiring to the adapter/plug in thing is loose and so I have to hold it in a specific position to hear out of both ears (and thats probably more because of how much I threw the headphones around over the years.Highly recommend, great sound for such an affordable price

VExtremely high quality headphones that truly has the most bang for the buck.. literally.I've had these guys for nearly a year now, and that in itself is amazing because I go through headphones about every 3 months as I tend to step on them or accidentally sit on them, which is why I never buy them for more than $20 a pop. These guys when stepped on simply pop out of the headband, and then you just simply pop them back in. It's as if they never were stepped on in the first place.Lookwise they are very sleek and pro like, and are comfy to wear for extended hours. Can't go wrong!

If you have wings for ears, these may be a bit small.The adustability of the headstrap offers great comfort, and the build quality is robust.The cord is very long, but they come with a cord spool which works great at keeping things tidy.Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a replaceable set of work or travel headphones.

VI've worked in radio for over 10 years now and these have been my favorite headphones that we've used.  We go through tons of headphones in the radio business and Sennheiser is always a favorite.  The quality and noise cancelling is great.  Unfortunately, at the radio station, we go through headphones like animals.  All headphones eventually break, cords get cut/shorts, etc.  These are no exception.  We replaced these with a bunch of different types of other headphones and I hate them all.  I want my Sennheisers back.I bought these for at home use, where they will actually last.

VI bought these headphones because I was travelling abroad and wanted headphones to listen to music but to drown out the noise from the airplane too.  And it worked.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my son has the same exact headphones with the same model number, except his headphone are a couple of years older.  His ear pieces are slightly larger thereby making it more comfortable.  Mine ear pieces are slightly smaller and they tend to sit slightly more on the ear than completely over the ear.  I guess over the years they must have made slight modifications to the HD202 II.

VI recently purchased these and Audio-Technica ATH-M30, for two different applications. These are $20, and the ATH-M30 was $50, and I'd say in both cases I got good value. The HD202's sound very good, but I find the fit more tight and uncomfortable than the ATH-M30. I use these at my desk at work, and I generally don't have them on for more than 30 minutes at a time, so they work well for the $20 price tag. and if they get stolen in the office, I'm not out much. Fit/comfort is difficult to judge, as everyone's head is different.Overall, for this application, I'd purchase again.

VThese headphones are quite a step up from the SONY MDR-V150 models I've used for years. Although the packaging says they have "powerful bass," I simply lowered the bass setting on my CREATIVE ZEN 8GB mp3 player, and they play metal music like I've never heard through headphones. They're much louder then any headphones I've used before, and more adjustable, not to mention they come with a 2 year warranty, rather than the standard 90 day warranty. I would recommend these to anyone on a budget who's looking for a pair of good headphones; you just can't beat German quality.

VI tend to break my headphones fairly quickly after purchasing them.  This pair last me more than one year; one ear is starting to not work intermittently just now, over a year later.  They are not especially comfortable at first, but I got used to them relatively quickly and they don't bother me at all anymore.  The sound quality is great for how cheap these headphones are.  I had to repair one wire with electrical tape, but, once again, I think I am exceptionally rough on headphones, so that wasn't a big problem for me.  Better that than having to buy a whole new pair.

Wow i am amazed with the sound quality it creates. I am not a DJ nor acoustic nut but i love listening to my music. Base was deep, everything was good, So if you love listening to music for leisure then i recommend this, And guess what, i bought it for less than 20 dollars... Yepp i think it was 16 bucks on sale.

The cord going into the ear piece is prone to breaking. They have the thinnest copper wire going through them with just a thing piece of rubber around them. The ear piece may easily detach from the wire. I've never had headphones break like that before. I wouldn't buy these again.

VThe only reason these are not 5 stars is that they are a little small for my ears. Specific sounds are a little muddled compared to higher end headphones, but they sound AMAZAZING for $22. Bass isn't everything, but it has pretty good thum-thum-thums. The headphones also do a pretty good job of muting outside noises. I can't hear a damn thing with these on. Haven't tried mowing in them so you'll have to do that.As an FYI, the cord for these is 10 feet long. It's pretty long, so just keep that in mind.

VThe headphones are exactly as expected. High quality for a cheap price. But at the same time these are $20 headphones, so do not go into this purchase expecting the sound quality of a $200 pair. If an option, make sure you tell change your settings so your computer knows they are stereo headphones, made a world of difference for me.I cannot speak of the durability of the product as I have only had it for a week, but it feels robust and sturdy.  I also don't intend on throwing them around the house..

VI've owned these headphones for over a year and they are an absolute great value.  For the price you won't find headphones that sound as good.  They have a nice sound stage and the bass is good but not overpowering.  The highs are crisp but not too bright.  Overall, these are great for everyday listening to all styles of music: classical, rock, rap, techno, and Jazz.I listened to many headphones at Best Buy and these headphones sound better than all but the $400+ headphones.  Go ahead and buy them!

VGreat deal for a throw-away set.  I'm a video editor, so i use my good set at the desk (Bose AE2).  But these are a great backup and i use them regularly for playing drums, mowing the lawn, etc.  Light, reasonably comfortable (a bit tight), good sound.The cord is a bit ridiculously long but could be an asset in many situations - my 3rd pair, the cushions become dilapidated and leave black pieces on your face and ears over time (2yrs YMMV).  This pair came with a rather large cord wrap which i appreciate.

VFantastic headphones for the price. I am not extremely particular with my headphones like some people. If you are the average joe that wants to listen to music then these should work great for you as well. It also has a fair amount of bass to the headphones as well. The main factor I always consider is comfort. These are comfortable to wear for long periods of time due to the cushion. I actually had a prior pair that got damaged and bought another one because I liked them so much. You won't be dissapointed.

VI bought these headphones for my piano because the reviews said the cable was quite long. I'm glad I did, these are excellent headphones. The sound quality is crisp and sharp with good bass as well. I now use them as my main headphones for everything at home including piano playing. The cable is very long, which might be an issue for some but it does come with a good solid cable spool so that you can stash the excess and the length is great for getting behind the piano without pulling or getting in the way.

I think these are way better.  I think their sound is better and I am totally impressed for the price.  They are more comfortable too.

Since I got these to use at work during some long days of data entry, this is a real plus for me.-Good audio quality - these are not top-of-the-line amazing, especially in the lower range, but the sound is clear, and that's really all I was looking for. For the price, these really can't be beat.

VIf for some asinine reason all you've ever used is ear buds for music, you should give these a shot. Best bang for your buck that I've found. These headphones rock and they are only $24-30 online. This is my 3rd set in 9 years. I fall asleep with them on 3-5 nights a week. (In case you wondered why I've gone through so many) Excellent base response and all around amazing sound. In a blind test I would put them up against a $150 set of headphones and I'm willing to bet few could tell the difference.

They're comfortable to wear, the sound is great, and since the cable is so long I can plug it into my laptop and go anywhere in my cubicle without taking my headphones off.  Okay yes, I do tend to roll over the cable at times but that's such a minor issue that I'm not going to take a star off for it.  I fully recommend these.

p1494
sg5
VThese are great, especially for the price! I used them for daily transcription work (not music).The reason I am giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is because every other time I take them off my (long) hair gets caught in them in such a way that it is difficult to detach from the headphones. I have never had this problem with any other headphone, so it must be something peculiar to this particular design. Until I get other phones, I'm having to tie my hair back in a ponytail.

The long cord is a bit cumbersome, but so far the belt clip works well enough to keep the excess cord out of the way when wearing these around the house or garage. If I had known I could enjoy this quality of sound and comfort in a pair of headphones for only $20, I would have ordered some long ago.

I've had more expensive headphones last for less time. The sound quality isn't lacking either. I'm probably going to re-purchase them.

VI've seen many good reviews that go into great detail about the positives and negatives of this headset.  I'll just weigh in with a quick review - despite any shortcomings, these phones are a STEAL at the price.  I've paid 2x as much in the past for phones that were total crap.  Any shortcomings they have will cost you multiple x in purchase price to attain, so for the not-rich like me who just love good sound and decent comfort, I can't recommend these higher.

VI've been a Sennheiser fan for decades and have owned at least 7 different Sennheiser models, over that time.  Every one has been fine, and my high-end headphones (HD-600) are perfect, as far as I'm concerned.  So with that in mind, I can't believe that the company has produced such an awful product as the HD-202 model.  Everything sounds like it's covered in mud.  The "enhanced" bass is truly awful.  I knew I wasn't going to be getting quality headphones for $20, but I didn't expect anything as terrible as this, especially from Sennheiser, a company I've recommended to friends and family since the 1960s.  A real disappointment.

VSO UNCOMFORTABLE!!!I'm not an audio nut, but I read all the comments for these headphones and others and watched a dozen or so reviews on YouTube for headphones.  After my research, I bought these.  Boy am I sorry I did.  They are so uncomfortable on your head.  The earcaps are fine, but the headband is so tight my head hurt after only two hours of wear.Don't buy if you value comfort!

But overall, it's great.Everyone who listens to music (I do while programming at work) should have one of these.

VPros:Inexpensive.  I think better sound quality with more bass than Phillips SHP2600.Cons:Earcups are too small, they press up against the edges of your ear.  I also have the Phillips SHP2600 and they are more comfortable since they have much larger earcups that fit all the way around your ears.  It is not obvious from the product pictures that the HD202 earcups are smaller

VBased on other reviews, you might get the impression that these headphones perform much better than you would expect for the price.  This is not the case.They accentuate bass, but midrange sounds hollow (like it's coming through a plastic cup) and highs are missing detail.They are acceptable quality for the price.  But the price is low.  You can connect the dots.

VI have a large head, and these just fit awkwardly. The earcup ITSELF slides up and down the 'bracket', which is not only super loud when you make adjustments (your ear is literally cupped in an enclosed space on the opposite side of the cup as you clack-clack-clack it into place), but the overall fit is just poor. The sound is fine, but I immediately hated the feel of wearing them.

VThese Sennheiser headphones feel comfortable around my head, have decent audio quality, and are affordable. Despite all these three positives, the main downfall of this product is the audio stops working on one side within a year.

p2134
sg5
VI tested these headphones out right after I received them, no issues with sound, sound quality or any functions. The sound quality is very good actually, I'm quite surprised by it since they were quite a low price. I ordered these specifically for gaming and because I wanted over the ear headphones.Pros:-Great sound quality for price-Base isn't overwhelming-Over the ear style-No install software for them to workCons:-Can't emulate surround sound-Extremely long cord (though it comes with a cable clip)-Cushion/headphone design is uncomfortable for long periods of timeThe surround sound may not be an issue for everyone, but if you're using these for gaming, the headphones create a "deafspot" for anything directly behind you in games. Even after messing with settings on my audio card to try and have these headphones simulate surround sound, I can't seem to get 5.1 surround sound to work properly. This is probably no issue for anyone listening to music, but if you want to use these for gaming, this is a simple warning. If you're playing first person shooters, any sound coming directly from behind you will be extremely low volume.I point out the cord being an issue because I'm only using these for my computer. Rolling around in my chair with the cord not wrapped around the belt clip would just get it all tangled up. With that said, I use the belt clip and have no problems with the length of the cord.And lastly, I find it difficult to wear these headphones for long periods of time. They become very uncomfortable even after a half hour. It's either because I wear glasses, or because the ear cushions aren't large enough around. Otherwise, the cushions are soft and seem durable, just beware if you wear glasses.Other than those three issues that I have with them, they're good headphones. Definitely nothing amazing for spectacular, but they're definitely worth their price.

VOver The Ear, On A Budget
p2140
sg5
VThis is my first pair of over the ear headphones. I typically use earbuds as they're easy to pack and great while you're active but wanted something that had a little better range of sound for just sitting around the house. I wanted to stay at $30 or less for my first pair to see how much I would actually use the larger headphones without breaking the bank. So here's my take after a week of solid use.The sound: If you're used to listening to music through earbuds be prepared for an initial Ah! moment when you first here the bass and the mids. Smaller headphones simply can't produce the same depth and richness that a larger over the ear headphone produces. It's fantastic the first time you hear it. With that said, when you start critically evaluating the sound with various genres of music you realize that while the tone is nice and full, it is at times a bit muddled. Now I can't really say that's a drawback given the price point. Had I spent $150+ on this pair of headphones I would be disappointed but at this price point the sound you get makes these a good deal. The bass is nice, the mids and highs pretty clear and the overall range seems pretty good. Some lower tones you may have completely missed with earbuds will be present with this set of headphones. When the tones get really low you do lose the crispness. Imagine a tuba ripping through a few low quarter notes; you might pick the tone out as a tuba but you probably won't here any separation of the notes.Comfort: I get what some reviews are saying about being uncomfortable but I think the complaint is a bit overstated. I have mid to large size ears and a large head. The headphones feel a bit tight at first but aren't necessarily uncomfortable. The opposite side of this would be the headphones being loose and slipping, I'll take them being a tad bit tight as I tend to take the headphones off every thirty minutes or so anyway to take a walk around and loosen up my legs.The Build:  They're plastic and don't feel like much but again, these are low dollar headphones. The pad at the top and the ear cushions feel like they'll stay in place if you're not abusive with the headphones. The clicks when adjusting the individual ear pieces feels a bit cheap too but I don't feel like it's going to be a problem. The Cord is REALLY long; you can decide if that's a plus or a minus, for me it's just something to get used.Overall:  If you're considering there headphones it's because you either don't want to or can't spend a couple hundred dollars on a set of headphones. If you keep your expectations in line with your budget I think you'll be pleased overall with this set of headphones. If you're expecting supreme range, razor edge separation of tones, bullet-proof build and luxurious comfort from a set of headphones at this price, then you probably will end up being disappointed. For the money, this is good buy.

VJust got these today, but already wore a few hours and this is my first impressions/review.Pros:-- Good, balanced stereo sound.-- Good bass and low frequency response-- Comfortable and lightweight-- Surprisingly pretty good noise-cancellation, both coming in from outside noises and from going out from sound leak from the headphones-- Long cord-- Price!Cons:-- Slightly plastic feel-- Could be a little on the bass-heavy side for some (for my use, I enjoy this but it's a slight con)-- Wires are somewhat thin/frail, but as long as I'm at least somewhat careful/gentle with these I don't see this being much of a problemSide-notes:-- 3.5 to 6.3mm adapter is a nice bonus-- Cord wrap accessory seems kind of silly and useless-- Packaging was kind of a pain to open, but it is what it isClosing statement:After a few hours of use I can already tell that these are amazing headphones for the price, and definitely worth the money. You get pretty good balanced sound and good bass response, comfort, and a long cord suitable for many different uses that have a headphones jack (3.5mm).I use these for my PC, and with using my webcam for my microphone, it is a good pair and works well for gaming. Have both good sound and a clear mic, and for the price it is an absolute bargain. Able to hear directional footsteps and gunshots in CS:GO and listen to a variety of musical genres all comfortably with these cans. Price was $22 at the time of purchase for me, but I'd say these are worth it even more than that, so at this price it is an absolute steal.Just be somewhat gentle with them because of the plastic body and somewhat thin wires, and these should serve just about anybody who isn't an audiophile's needs. Even for PC gaming.

VI purchased this headset to be able to study with less distraction at school. I wanted something other than ear buds that was inexpensive and had good sound. After owning these headphones for a semester, I enjoy using them.Comfort: This set is very comfortable. I can wear them for hours without any pain or discomfort. With an average size head and average size ears, there is not too much pressure on my ears/head. They do tend to get hot after a while though and that can be fixed by just taking them off for a few  seconds then putting them back on. the way they fit, if you brush them forward, the way the drivers are hinged, they will rotate and come off your ears. I fixed this by removing them from the sliding tracks they sit in and just flipping the headband around. The cups sit partially on your ear and were surprising comfortable.Sound: Just remember these are pretty inexpensive headphones. They tend to have ambient noise in the background, but this is not noticeable if you are not used to headphones (I didn't notice this until I got a pair of Bose headphones). They are not noise canceling but do a decent job of isolating the surroundings such that conversations will become muffled. They're base heavy which can become kinda muddled in songs with a lot happening in the lower register. I would describe the base as though its boomy, but can sound like your standing next to a car blasting sub woofers for some songs. The highs are crisp but can occasionally become overwhelming (very rarely though). In comparison, the mids can seem under powered. Over all you're getting pretty good sound for the price.Wires: The wire is long and you will need to get used to dealing with the wrapping clip they give you, which can be bulky, but can disappear once you've gotten used to it. Having two wires can be annoying at times but isn't too much of an issue.Overall: Buy these headphones if you want an inexpensive set of headphones that has pretty decent sound and are comfortable. Great for studying.

VGreat Kids Headphones, a smart addition to Spring Break drive-a-thons :-)
p2158

VWe got these headphones for our kids, aged 4 and 7 (average size heads and ears) to use on road trips. Most of the kids headphones are criticized for comfort, isolation, sound and quality. These cost about the same as kids headphones but seem superior in all these regards. Admittedly, they don't have a volume limit but most devices have secure volume controls. However, the comfort, isolation and sound quality are so good the kids shouldn't need to blast their eardrums. I'm a little apprehensive about how well they'll hold up to but there is a 2 year warranty.Pros:Comfortably fit kids heads, adjustable and stay putCups fit over-ear for kids (NOTE: most adults should consider these on-ear headphones)Excellent sound isolation (judging by the shouting volume when the kids were "talking" while wearing them without sound), should be great for eliminating road noise, additional patience may be necessary in capturing their attentionCords are long enough to reach across the family truckster (but have a spool to wind up excess)2 year warrantyOnly cost a little more than "kids" headphonesWork for adults tooCons:They don't fold (making storage a little cumbersome)The design is a little dull for kids (but there's plenty of room for stickers and other flair)No in-line volume controlNOTE: My impression for adults is a little different. These are still great sounding headphones and offer terrific value. My references are over-ear Bose (QC15) and some other Sennheiser units. The cups are not quite large enough to be considered over-ear though my ears aren't exactly small. The headband creates quite a bit of pressure, likely making them secure but unsuitable for extended listening.

VDon't buy it!!!. BARELY a circumaural headphone. Not comfortable for the ears.  I think I will buy another one.
p2164
sg5
VSo disappointed!!!I bought a HD 201 before this one and I was very happy with it but I sadly broke the connector in a plane it. So I chose this one as replacement because first it was supposed to be a circum aural, second it was supposed to be better than the HD 201.That's right the sound is a bit better (I think It is because this one is closed back and the 201 is not).BUT it is so uncomfortable, that you can't wear long time without feeling pain ON your ear (it is not comfortable at all) . Feeling that you don't have at all with the HD 201: I was using the HD 201 all day long without any trouble or pain on my ears.AND also I don't know from were they took the print for the ear pads but it is BARELY a cirumaural headphone. It is way to tight and not as big as the picture show. And I don't have big ears at all. Just to explain my point there is way more room in the HD 201!!Pros: The sound is good for the price. The accessory/tool included in is good to roll the extra wire (and you have some with 2.5m of wire). Good evolution from the HD201 where you don't have it.Cons: Bad evolution of the HD201 in term of comfort. Ear pads are too small (compare to the HD 201). Pain on ears ( not because of the sound but because of the uncomfort)! you have to remove it several time in a day. Straight connector easy to brake.Conclusion: if you don't want to spend a lot of money buy the HD201 is more comfortable and cheaper (depend on the website). Or If you have money, buy a more expensive one or another brand/model but it is hard to find cheap circum aural headphone (except the HD201). Or if you use just for 1 hour a day it might be okay not great but you can deal with it.I hope it will help. I didn't check the low rates before buying it.And I am so so so disappointed that so many people are satisfied from it. This headphone doesn't deserve it .I am not picky at all but it seems reasonable when you buy something which cost more (original price) and is an upgrade of something you expect AT LEAST the same standards as the old one with slight improvement on specific things (design, sound, ....)!

VGreat, broke after 6 months in a carry-on
p2170
sg5
VElectronics are one of the few items that I always find more expensive in stores.  Enter: Amazon.  For less than 50 bucks, this pair of headphones is exactly what I needed: soft, comfortable, and better sound quality than earbuds.  I will write this from the viewpoint of someone who traveled a lot with these headphones (as I did).First, the Pros:1. Compared to my earbuds, which I had to turn up to ungodly volumes to drown out the airplane engines, are a complete turnaround.  The sound is crisp and rich in tone, even with some base undertones that I could not get with my earbuds (duh.)2. Although I have small ears, I find these headphones to be very roomy, and fit comfortably around my entire ear.  I would think they could fit ears of small- to medium-sized.3. Long cord length and comes with built-in clip.  I especially enjoy the large buckle-type thing that wraps the cord around it and allows for smooth control of cord length.  Although it is a manual cord wrap, I found it especially helpful on plane rides to just throw it on the laptop keyboard when I was watching a movie, or stick it in my lap when I was writing something on my computer.4. Excellent control of headband size.  I'm a 5'4" woman with a large head.  The size adjustments on the earmuffs are great, much better than those old ones where you had to adjust the entire headband, with these the earmuffs move up and down according to your head size, almost automatically, it was so smooth.Now, the Cons:1. The inner portion of the earpiece sits FLAT against your ear.  I sometimes feel like my ear is being pressed against a flat panel LCD monitor.  Although the mesh does somewhat protect your ear, it still makes me feel self-aware of how close the ear 'muff' is.2. The ear piece, although it was able to move easily based on head size, is made of a cheap ball-and-socket joint (imagine what your hip joint looks like, ability to move it, etc, it is just like these headphones).  The track is a thin piece of plastic holding the ball joint in place.  ANY sort of pressure will break it.  Of course, I treated these just like any other item I buy, rather rough, on my carry-on especially with it banging against my legs and whatnot.  The cheap plastic "guide" where the ball join sits in cracked off on the end.  So now I can "remove" one of the earmuffs entirely (I will upload a picture later).3. VERY uncomfortable for long periods of time, and with glasses.  Of course while flying, I hate wearing my contacts, so I wear my glasses instead.  It is next to impossible not to get a headache using these headphones if you wear glasses.  Although on a plane, you're crammed into a small seat, so of course it's easy just to remove my glasses, and I can still watch movies/tv shows comfortably with my laptop in my lap.4. Sometimes during a flight, the cord comes unraveled from the ENTIRE plastic device.  I swear this cord is 100 feet long - why Sennheiser, do we need so much cord length?  Unless I'm planning on plugging these into the output on my TV and watching it from my neighbors house, I think even just a few feet should do the trick.In conclusion, I don't think I would buy these again.  They are rather bulky, not portable.  When I first got them they would 'clasp' themselves closed (the earmuffs would touch) so they were portable/safe that way.  After time, the earmuffs get stretched out because of my rather large head, and this is when the break happened.

VComparison to Sennheiser HD 201
p2176
sg5
VI got the HD 202 II and the HD 201 years and years ago, and it wasn't until now that I sat down and really compared them back to back.Price: They're both very affordable and about the same price.Sound: I agree with most of the others who've compared these two headphones. The 201 has a cleaner sound, but it lacks the bass of the 202. The volume on the 201 is also a little lower, but it really shouldn't be a problem assuming you're not trying to blast your eardrums out. Less than half of max volume on my macbook pro is perfectly comfortable listening. Now, I do wish the 201 had a little more bass, so if that's important to you, maybe you shouldn't get the 201. The 202 has a lot more bass, but it's a slightly muddier sound sometimes. Overall, I prefer the HD 201's cleaner, brighter sound. I'm not a bass-head.Comfort/Fit: Hands down the HD 201 wins. The cups on those go around your ears, whereas the ones on the HD 202 rest partially on your ears, which becomes uncomfortable. The 202 is also generally just tighter, but somehow the frame is also a little long for me. (I have the tiniest adult head like ever.) The HD 201 is adjustable, whereas the HD 202 is not. The HD 201 just feels really lightweight and comfortable in general - no tight spots anywhere.Miscellaneous: Both headphones have long cables. The HD 202 comes with a cable winder, which is handy. The 201 does not. Just be careful with your cables, and if you're out and about, you can tie up the extra cable with a twist-tie.I need to replace the Steelsound 3H headphones I've been using, and I'm going to take these HD 201 phones back to school with me after the holidays. The HD 202s will stay here. They're both very solid, affordable headphones though. Props to Sennheiser.

VTough to beat for the price and the Sound quality
p2181
sg5
VI like my music and am fairly particular about good audio quality.  For my critical listening at home I use a Sennheiser HD-600 with custom cables and a tube headphone amp.  When I started looking for good quality sounding headphones for my kids for a long road trip, I decided to give these a try.  Ratings on other sites where generally good so I took the plunge.Packaging - I ordered 2 (one for each kid) and both came well packaged with various accessories for cable management (really long cable) and use with different size headphone jacks.  It was not a standard box but a clear plastic molded packaging that is throw away.  No case was provided for storage.Sound Isolation - Being a closed back head phone they don't leak much sound to the surroundings and I found that to be true when my kids used them with their ipads.  It also seems to isolate outside noise from coming in as well, since my kids and I where able to hear well with these despite the loud road noise from the rental car we were driving.Sound Quality - As mentioned earlier sound quality is important to me but at this price range I wasn't expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good they are.  Clear vocal and instrumental audio.  Fairly neutral sounding.  Don't expect a lot of bass from these. Not as detailed as the HD600 - but then again these cost 10x+ less.Durability - My kids at 6-8 years at the time are fairly rough on the cables and head phones, and although these are made of plastic, they held up well overall.  They yanked on the cable, sat on them, and they held up fine.  One of the ear pieces popped off but it was easy to put back on.  Nothing broke, apparently you can remove the ear pieces from the main head band. So they pass this test.Adjustability - was good to fit well for my kids and myself - the upper head band padding made it feel fairly comfortable and worked for our head shapes.  The tension was a little tighter for me (for more than 1 hour), but great for the kids.  They could wear it for long periods.  Just so you know I do not have a big head as I wear a size small helmet, for bicycle and motorcycle, so the fit may be a consideration if you are an adult and plan on wearing these for extended periods.  The ear cups felt soft and did not feel abrasive to the ears.  I wish they were a little more breathable as these can feel a little warm if you wear them for a while.  I am spoiled with the velour ear pads on the HD-600's so this is not a specific ding on these as it is pretty much par for this material used for the ear pads on many headphones.For my purposes for the road trip and kids usage - They worked out great.  For general use I'd give them 4 stars because of the long term comfort.  Good set of headphones if you want really good sound without needing to worry about  kids banging on them.

VBack to buy another pair
p2187
sg5
VLike the title says, I'm back to buy another pair after my first pair gave up the ghost after 2 years and 2 months of almost daily use. I had a reminder at the top of the page that I had purchased this item in July 2011, so I decided to write a review of my 2+ years experience with these headphones. First, the sound is very good but not great. There doesn't seem to be any high highs or low lows. All frequencies tend to blend together. I suppose it's hard to "stage" headphones, especially at this price. By the way, the price has increased around $5 in those 2 years. I've used these on many devices such as iPods, laptops, desktops, tablets and cell phones and have been pleased with the sound quality over all platforms, especially those with HD audio sources. The plastic construction is fairly sturdy and the fabric around the cushions never tore, cracked or flaked. I can wear these for hours and they remain comfortable. They also have a very good 2 year replacement warranty.This brings me to the death of my first pair for which I feel partially responsible. I use these at home and at work, but instead of having 2 pair, I often carry them back and forth. When carrying them, I try to make them as compact as possible which included pushing the cups all the way up and winding the very long cord around them. I love the extra-long cord. It was always a positive to me, but I felt like I was going to cut into the cable using the small notches in the included wind-up belt clip, so I never used it. I just wrapped the cord around the cups. Well my routine of making the headphones compact ultimately cost me. About 6 months ago, the left cup started popping out easily but it wasn't broken and would always pop right back in. Sennheiser actually describes the removable cups as a feature, so it never bothered me but the track that the cup slides in was obviously getting worn out. Secondly, wrapping the cable started to break the wire just beneath the small strain relief area. Once that started, they were doomed. The sound in that side started to cut out with much movement and the speaker eventually went mute within a week. This seems to be a common problem with this model and is mentioned in other reviews. It's easily repaired with a little effort and electronics handy work.So, what did I think? Would I do it again? Well here I am about to order my second pair. After doing some basic math, I figured my first pair cost me about 2 1/2 cents per day. The bottom line is, it's hard to find quality construction and sound at this price even if it is a few dollars more than last time.

VDecent but it has a couple big issues
p2193
sg5
VI have actually bought 2 pairs of these before and I am now looking for a third pair of headphones so I am conflicted.Pros:I like the soundDecent priceNot 100% comfortable, but they don't hurt like a lot of other ones for me.Cons:Long long long cordThe plastic piece that comes with it to wrap the cord around it is not good.The sound does not come out of both ears for long. *This is the biggest issue*For more detail on the cons, I don't mind a long cord, but this one is crazy crazy long. Now this can be very annoying, even without imagining the tangling. Now, the long cord wouldn't be an issue if the plastic piece that comes with it to wrap cord around worked well. First, it seems like it has so much cord it fills up the gaps easy and trying to put part of the cord though those tiny openings ends up being pushed out easy, and if that pops out easy, then its useless because it unwinds. Also it will eventually (within a couple months) start to split the cord up. How the cord is made from 2 smaller ones kinda glued together, it will start to split it at the point when you try putting it through the dash opening on the plastic piece. That may be an issue that leads me to the 3rd con, after not that long of a time the sound just stops coming out of 1 ear, then in time both. I thought my first pair was just a bad one, but after it happened to my second pair I just think its the headphones. Not sure why the sound just stops working out of one ear quickly, but if its the cord being split by the plastic thing you wrap the super long cord around, then that plastic piece may be the biggest issue. I say if you do buy this, find something else to wrap the super long cord with.

Vstrong in the studio
p2199
sg5
VThese have served as my studio headphones for over 5 years, and I'm very surprised how long these have lasted! They deliver a very flat frequency response and can pick up even very high and low frequencies. Very incredible considering how CHEAP they are! They are also very sturdy---sometimes the earpieces fall off the headband, but it's very easy to re-attach them. I've had them and abused them for a long time, and they've never let me down. I'd say these are ideal for knock-around studio headphones for music production on the road. When I went to conservatory, I noticed that these headphones are at every station in the public audio lab, so I'd take that as a strong endorsement. Obviously, they can take quite a beating and still be good enough to use for music production.Another great thing about these headphones is how long the cable is! Sometimes it's annoying to wrap it all up; I usually use a rubber band or a twist-tie to keep the cable together. In any case, the long cable allows me to walk away from my interface/mixer to adjust something on the other side of the room without taking off the headphones. Very nice for adjusting sound on-the-fly in the studio.I wouldn't get these headphones if you're looking for a pair for enjoying music casually. There are better headphones on the market that color the sound nicely for that (if that's what you're into). Certainly, there are more comfortable headphones than these. My ears tend to hurt after more than 5 or 6 hours of wearing them and not taking them off, which is usually more than enough time. These are definitely no good for lying down on your side and listening, but that's not what these are for anyways.TLDR; These are an excellent pair of cheap, indestructible studio headphones.

VI got these headphones over a year and a half ago, as a present. I had asked for them after my friend ended up with her pair, and I witnessed them working well after the six-month mark that it normally took her to destroy any pair of speakers, earbud, headphones, ect. Let Kalei at it for six months, and it's dead. We teased her about it, and people who didn't even know her knew about it. But these? When she hit seven months, everyone noticed. "You've had those forever!" "Seven? How much did they cost???" Well, at her eighth month, stil working, my second pair of wesc's died, and my birthday was coming up, so I told my sister about these.I've gotten a pair of headphones on my birthday since I was 13. Why? Never has an affordable pair lasted longer than a year. Last year broke a long tradition- this pair didn't die until a week ago- 1 year and 7 months since I got them.I haven't treated them particularly well, either- carry them by the cords, shove them in my purse, wear them rollerblading in all hells kind of weather... from washing dishes or unsnapping one earpiece to share my music, I've put them throu alot- and untill now, they've lasted quite well.Of couse, everyone has spoken highly of the sound quality, so I imagine it's quite good  in comparison to most things this price, but I grew up on bose and sony, noise cancellation and never less than $50 a pair- and I found that these easily compare. I hear things in songs I didn't hear before, but I also find that some things are a tad off- not that it bothers me; Im no sound snob. For the price, it's higher quality than I expect.As for comfort, I find them perfect. I have a smallish head, being a small human in general, and rather small ears for my head, and for me.. I wear these all day long without a thought. The connection between the earpieces and band doesn't get tangled with hair, but sometimes it does adjust it's self looser when I move.The main 'con' about these is the same as every other pair of headphones in the world- the connection in the cord, were it meets the earpiece, eventually wears out. some quicker than others, but Ive never found a pair immune to this problem, and as long as you can afford to replace them every year or so, I'd say go for it.

p2209
sg5
VFor people wondering about the HD 201's vs 202's, I bought these for myself and got the 201's for my sis, we literally compared them back to back, smae songs etc so if you're curious you can read this.HD 202'sProsGood bass , I don't know about the audiophiles but the bass was good in these and I like that with most of my music, it's not the obnoxious kinda bass either, the good kind.Good volume(201's were a bit more low), but can get kinda obnoxious, I'll get into that soon, but the volume on these are fine with music games and media, slightly unlike the 201's but at the same time was kinda too much...Barely any leakage, since the volume is a bit above average and the headphones fit sturdyier onto your head the sound is concentrated more, so not much sound gets out, even when a little high volume. The 201's are more loose on the head, so they let out more noise.Good highs, and deep, focused sound, so I never really needed them too loud.ConsSometimes certain songs of high quality (like 320 bit songs/FLAC's) can seem TOO loud, like you can turn it down, but I literally turn it down to about 5-10% for it to be normal.If youre using a MP3 player/Ipod or something it might not have enough power in it to power these, so some songs you can hear a feint static in the music if they are 320bit or FLAC's or something, and I even switched it between the 201's and these, and a entire track was heard alot more on the song on the 201's rather than the 202's cause my Vita/Iphone couldn't power the 202's I guess. Normal bitrate songs didn't do this however, but on the PC or like a tablet or something it'll be fine.If you use a Equalizer and boost the sound, the highs sometimes you can override it a bit, so it'll make your ears feel foggy and it gives a tedious feeling to your eardrums, like how you feel when you take off on a plane with all the extra stuff added (if you tweak it too much maybe?), but I found out this was for all good headphones, even my old USB ones. Though the 201's were a bit more accepting to Equalizing it.They are a bit tight, this is probably the only real Con, after about 45+ mins my ears get kinda sore, not major sore, thats only after about 3 hours but it is tight. And will leave your ears sore afterwards if you have them on for a long time, though I just take mines and kinda stretch them outwards then put them on, and it isn't tight anymore, ha (I wouldn't recommend that for future length, but it works lol)So overall they are good and tbh the cons only come around sometimes, like the too loud, that really isnt a con I just get kinda lazy and dont wanna keep turning down my HQ songs. And as for the Ipod part I dont really use it for that, I only use the laptop so... And when I use them on the go about 10% of my songs even do the static out thing. But the main con would probably be the tightness.HD 201'sProsMore clarity, listening to these compared to my 202's I notice that the 201's sound alot clearer with some songs, especially like Pop music or instrumentals, the 202's brought out the bass more and my sis liked mines better for that, but the 202's lack the full clear sound the 201's will give you, sound more like.. a Orchestra of 200 people, 20 would be left out on the 202's while all can be heard on the 201's. (I noticed this listening to the Overworld theme from FInal Fantasy 8, I could heart the trumpets etc more with the 201's and certain other genres you cna hear vocals better)More balanced volume, didn't need to really jump up and down the volume with the 201's since they are lower volume than the 202's, this is also a con though, will get into that. But the volume is more balanced and the instruments all seem a bit more 'equal' with the 201's, I personally like my higher highs and bass of the 202's and so does my sis, but again I like the 201's more with the balance and instrumental music.Much easier on the head than the 202's, some people say these dont hurt at ALL that's not true, my ears still feel a LITTLE tingle with these on after about a hour, but its barely painful like the 202's after about a hour ,I get used to it but they do stay kinda sore.. the 201's are more light and cup over than ears rather than sit ontop like the 202's.ConsLower volume , on the Ipod's or tablets the volume on the 201's 80% was equal to the 202's 40-50%, and if you have low volume songs, they wont get loud at all on the 201's (But who still has LQ music nowadays :P), also they are lower in general, I said I didnt have to mess with the volume much on these but that was because they are lower in general so it evens out, when Im watching movies etc sometimes these aren't really that loud when it comes to people talking etc.More leakage, these leak more than the 202's , maybe because they aren't as tight? But when my sis has her music up I can hear it about 6-10 feet away while my 202's don't leak much at all, it's some there if you have them bumping, like any headphones, but since the 202's pump out alot higher and they are a bit more focused(smaller cups) and are tighter, you don't even need them as loud as the 201's like I said above, so you wouldn't have them up that high to even begin with.Much less bass than the 202's, the 201's have the clarity and balance but the bass just isn't there like how they are with the 202's, when I try to use these right after a session on my 202's my ears feel neglected for the lack of bass, lol (Though my ears get a break... tight 202's and no I don't have a big Dumbo head :P)But these are great and I like them (HD 202's), my sis's (HD 201's) are a bit lower in volume on portable devices, but doesn't matter on the PC and hers dont have the bass mines have. But her Pros are that you dont get that too loud sometimes or slight feint static with HQ songs on portable devices and hers have higher clarity, like you can hear instruments etc more, but is missing the bass mines have. Oh, and hers arent tight, they fit fine.Oh yeah and these come with a reeeaaallllyyy long cord, the HD 202's come with a cord winder though, the 201's don't, but my sis keeps hers tied like how they were when they came, I mean it' a helleva alot of cord, both of them, I sometimes accidentally roll over the cord at my PC desk and have even tripped over it a few times. The 202's have a cord winder that you wind the cord up on and clip it it to you, the 201's don't, but my sis just ties it up and puts it in her pocket when shes out. People do give me looks when I have all that cord wrapped around me when I don't wind it up, lmao

VWow!My prior experience - I've always spent maybe $10 or less on headphones.  Best I've owned where Sony.  I have an iPod and those in-ear headphones you get are pretty good and I thought the sound was excellent, until now!A friend at work had mentioned the name Sennheiser.  I'd never heard of them so I looked on here, Amazon, and then went to my local Bestbuy store to try some out.  I was amazed.1.  The sound.  I'm no expert but I'm not deaf either ;o)  The sound out of these are amazing.  The bass, the highs...the vocals.  I've recently got back into Depeche Mode and listening to a lot of Trance music.  It's like listening to music all over again!  The tracks sound so clear, loud and alive in your head.  You can hear the different instruments...the breathing of the artist.... I just love it!2.  I paid $25.  For $25 these are great value.  At Bestbuy I tried the Beats, Bose, Sony, JVC.... they're all $100 plus and do sound great too but for $25 these sound just as good if not better so why pay more???3.  The build quality.  Excellent.  They feel very well made.  Solid.  Ok it's plastic but its good quality if that makes sense.  More importantly is the fit on your head.  They are extremely comfortable and cover your ear and block out all the outside noise!  You know when you talk too loud because you can't hear your own voice, that's what it's like and that's with the music off!!!! They are that good!These headphones don't cover your whole ear but are very close and the cushioning is superb. I bought my daughter the next model down (HD201 - $20) and they do cover the whole ear.  The HD201, the cushioned rim of the headphone goes completing around your ear.  These HD202II don't.  They will rest on your ear but they block out all the exterior sound and feel great! I've tried both and I prefer these and this model sounds even better! For me this pair are more comfortable.You won't go wrong buying these for $25.  Quality product all around.  Thanks Sennheiser!!!*** UPDATE - 1/8/13 ***Still loving these headphones!  People say that with any headphones you need to use them so many hours for them to 'break-in' and the sound quality gets better....maybe they have now, the sound is first class!  All my other headphones sound like trash!  I played the same song and plugged in each pair OMG!  awful!  These bad boys blew them away sounding louder, clearer.... just plain awesome.  One correction to my above remove....these headphones do fit AROUND your ears not on them.  It's a close fit which is great, they feel snug and keep the outside sound out and the inside music in.  For $25 I don't think you'll find better...not even for $150.Cheers.

VDefinitely not disappointed in these headphones. Well worth the price on Amazon and then some.
p2220

VThese are the first pair of over the ear headphones I have purchased. I purchased them based on extensive reviews and looking for the cheapest possible option with the best possible quality. Admittedly, I haven't used any other over the ear headphones to compare. With that being said, I would still definitely recommend these headphones. I am not the least bit disappointed in them and do not regret purchasing these headphones over any other more expensive options. Having only spent around $25 dollars for these off Amazon including shipping I couldn't really justify spending $100+ on a pair of headphones after listening to these. I am sure there are some quality headphones in that price range that "might" sound better than these but for only $25 dollars these sound amazing enough. Unless you have money to throw away or need serious studio quality headphones for producing, these headphones are all about great sound + extreme value. You might not regret purchasing more expensive headphones based on all the money you save with these. I went with these over the comparably priced Sennheiser HD 201 because reviewers said the HD 202 II had more bass. Some reviewers said that the bass may make them sound muddy, however. When I first plugged in the headphones they did sound a little muddy but that was easily remedied. I played with my equalizer settings and then I downloaded a program called DFX Audio Enhancer which is a sound processing program. The difference was night and day and these headphones no longer sound muddy. DFX Audio Enhancer is why I am able to to give them 5 stars. If these headphones sound muddy to you then try downloading that program. SRS also makes an audio enhancing program as well. Both have free versions as well as paid versions. I am not affiliated with either of these companies. Another thing that helps these headphones sound better when you listen music is if you listen to high quality music downloads at 320kpbs if possible. Listening to music at 240p or 360p streaming on Youtube won't sound as good. So before blaming these headphones for sounding muddy make sure you are listening to high quality music sources and have your equalizer settings optimized.Prior to these headphones I have used earbuds almost exclusively. I've used the iPhone earbuds and honestly anything sounds better than those so that's not a fair comparison. I've also used Sony earbuds and JVC Marshmellow earbuds. I personally like the sound of earbuds just as well as over the ear headphones but I will say that the HD 202 II over the ear headphones separate the lows, mids, and highs better and can keep up with faster music better. The glitches sound crisper with these headphones when I listen to dubstep. A good song to listen to that will really help you see how well these headphone perform is Skrillex - Kill Everybody (Bare Noize Remix) on blast with DFX Audio Enhancer turned on at the default settings. It's amazing how well these headphones can keep up with the glitches and separate the glitches from the mids and bass. These headphones also seem solidly built and have thick cables which is a plus. I don't see them breaking but if for some reason they do, they come with a 2 year manufacture's warranty. The cable is also fairly long if for some reason you need a really long cable.If I were to have to list some cons of this product I would say that out of the box without playing with your equalizing settings and downloading a sound processor they may seem muddy. Also, if you wear these headphones for a long time they might make your ears a little sore from pressing up against them. Nothing intolerable but noticeable so worth mention. Also, the cord is very long. This could be a pro to some or a con to others. If you need a long cord then it's great to have. But if you are using these to listen to music on the go from your phone or portable media device then a long cord might get annoying. I only use these at home so it doesn't bother me. And comparing these to earbuds, when you listen to loud music it leaks and other people can hear your music. It's not that loud but, considering earbuds don't leak at all, it is noticeable.

VPlease note: The items shipped are not HD 202 II, but HD 202. I knew that when purchasing because at least one other commenter noted this here, but they were still cheaper than the next cheapest HD202 listing on Amazon.OVERALL:I bought these cans after a lot of research looking for sub-$100 headphones that are good enough for home recording. These, however, fall into the rock bottom cheap category despite their good sound. FTW! It was a toss up between these, and Sennhaiser HD201. I went for these because I liked the look of them more. They seemed less bulky. Both had great reviews for recording, though the HD201 has a bigger following.SOUND:I"m not disappointed. I wouldn't say these are bumpin' bass boosters, but they are not lacking. I haven't experienced the increased higher frequencies that other users have reported, but I don't listen to anything that would showcase that. I'm using these to monitor my guitar recording (black metal) and have no complaints. In general, the freq color seems pretty even to me (unscientific observation). However, I wouldn't use them for mixing, but no headphones are good enough for that. I also hear that these do better when amped, but just in my computer output or my USB I/O (Alesis IO|2 Express) output with no other special equipment, they sound just fine.FIT:I have a big-ish head and was concerned about the tightness over long periods while wearing glasses. After about 3 hours they begin to hurt a little, but that's better than any other cans I've tried so far, and probably a good time to take a break!I may get the HD201s to try as well, just for fun. But at this price point the quality and craftsmanship is excellent.There are also some mods to the HD201/301 on the head-fi.org forums.

VBest headphones for the price range in my opinion.
p2232
sg5
VFor the price these are excellent headphones. From the perspective of a neutral sound these headphones are a little bass heavy, but not so much that they try to add bass when it really isnt there. These headphones are kind of a jack of all trades when it comes to music but is more heared towards rock/R&B; than anything else because of its higher bass response and only average high end reproduction. So when listening to Classical/Orchestral(I would recommend 320kbs or higher only for those genres) do not expect miracles unless you have never tried full sized circumaural(enclosing the ear) headphones before then they will sound amazing no matter how you slice it. I would go to headfi.org if you want to read more in depth reviews on sound quality and such, but you will have to remember some audiophiles will have harsh opinions of headphones because they are used to using to $200-$300+ headphones coupled with $100+ amps while listening to FLAC or WAV files so keep that in mind. If you plan on using these headphones only at home them they are fine as-is, however if you plan you using these headphones while traveling I would advise making some modifications to  increase their overall survivability.The first step if any modifications are to be made(THIS STEP IS TO BE MADE AT YOUR OWN RISK) is to cut the plastic piece located under your chin(if you are wearing them) preventing the headphone cables from being separated. I used a box cutter to carefully cut it on both sides then removed the plastic piece. This will give you some headroom on the headphones even if you aren't planning on modifying them further.The next step I would suggest would be to tape, glue, or in some way secure the cable so if it snags on something(and trust me at some point it will snag and all it takes is once and your headphones are dead) there will be no strain on the connection between the earcups and the cable, just the cable itself. I wrapped the cable up around the earcups and then taped it securely with some slack so that the connection isnt bent or stressed.One last modification that is purely yo to personal preference is to secure on or the cable around the headband and make your headphones single entry(wire coming only from one side) instead of double entry. For me this allowed me to removed and put on my headphones without worrying about them getting tangled or if the cable was properly under my chin or not.These Headphones are a real value but because of that the price can vary over time dramatically, even from the same seller. I have seen on amazon these headphones be as low as $20 with SS shipping to as much as ~$40 with $5 shipping. So if you see them with little or not shipping in the low to mid $20 range then go for it, otherwise I would wait to see if the price goes down.Keep in mind that headphones are an incredibly subjective item to buy not only because of pure personal preference like other items, but because we all hear things differently. One personal might not hear all the frequencies and nuances of sound another person can, so only by actually listening to the headphones over time can you really know if they fit you or not.

p2238

VThese headphones are a revelation.I'm used to using the standard pair of earbuds bundled with my Zune 4GB player. They served me well, but the cables getting a bit frayed now near the joint. The covers always used to get lost or dirty and they were a tad bit uncomfortable in the ears. Sometimes they'd slip out. Prior to that, I've used various crappy earbuds and on-ear headsets.After much deliberation, and hand-wringing, I bought these Sennheiser's. The sound, compared to what I was used to, is mind-blowing. Bass and vocals are amazingly thumping and clear. The cups are incredibly comfortable and the band fits snugly.Some interesting things I noted:1. The cable is 3 meters long and feels sturdy. Sennheiser bundles a little plastic thing with two notches and a clip around which you can wind the cable to reduce its effective length as desired. It takes a while to find your sweet-spot for length and relative position of the spool. Fortunately it is all manual, so there's little room for breakage. The clip on the spool comes in handy to snap it on to clothes. It is very light and unobtrusive.2. The adjustment mechanism is initially not obvious. The cups are on a notched rail on the band. You slide them up and down to adjust the height/length. It feels a bit wonky, but works fine. Apparently, the cups can be removed for DJ-style single-cup use or cleaning. I haven't tried it.3. It comes with a 1/8th" standard-size plug and a 1/4th" adapter to use if you have big amps or musical equipment.4. Some folks have said the cups get uncomfortably hot after a while. I have not experienced this at all in using the cups for more than 3-4 hours at a time.5. I really wish there was a inline volume control. Most of my devices at their lowest volume setting sound a bit too loud through these. The snug fit makes them very good at noise-isolation. You won't hear another person talking unless they sit right next to you and talk into your ears. They won't hear your music until it gets uncomfortably loud for you, even if they sit next to you. If nothing is playing however, you'll hear the outside world just fine. So they're safe.Sennheiser is perhaps the only company offering a 2 year standard warranty on their headphones.All in all, these are best use of a $20 bill you could make. Trust me, if you are going to pay $200 for an iPod or $500 for a phone, spend a little more and get these. Bundled earbuds suck.I know what everyone in my family is getting for birthdays/Christmas/anniversaries from this year :)

VMusician's Review (I approve... but read on)
p2244
sg5
VIf you're anything like me you're reviewing these headphones from 20 sites, watching YouTube videos to see if it's worth a small investment because after all money is money. I cannot tell you to buy this headphones or not but I can tell you that I don't regret buying them one bit. There are some pro's and con's in my opinion, read on.Pro's: I love the style, it's sleek nicely put together and look professional. I like the sound these produce. To be in the under $50 range the sound is phenomenal. I'm listening to J Mayer, Michael Buble, No Doubt (yes it's a classic), Sade, Jay-Z and worship music and it sounds great. There is slight noise reduction, nothing to write home about but it's ok- then again these aren't noise-cancelling so it's ok. The bass is good and so are high notes that you so eagerly want to hear when listening to your guitar solo. They aren't the loudest headphones when connected to your iPhone (you won't be that guy on the subway) but they are doing great on my MacBook Pro, I have it on 1/2 way and it's hurting my ears (please keep in mind I'm a musician thus almost deaf!). I think I made a great purchase!Con's: Mother always said there is not beauty without the ugly and ugly without its beauty... something like that anyway. I am not a fan of how cheap the soft part under the arch looks glued on there. When I put pressure on the soft part of the top i can see where it was glued and I can pull it off with force. The glossy back of the ear phones pick up finger prints easily making them look not so clean even if you've had them for 2 hours only. It does come with a cable longer than DMV lines but I guess as a guitarist it CAN come into use. It does however come with a cable roller.... device that I didn't think I'd like but I really do. COMFORT is great the first 30 minutes, after that you can feel the pressure on your eye SLIGHTY, however, the trick is to just move the ear phones slight back or front, it honestly made the pressure go away going on 40 minutes now, so I've had them on for 1 hour and 10 minutes and I don't even feel them. I can't comment on longer stays but I wouldn't see anyone wearing these for 5 hours straight.Overall would I buy these again? Yep. Would I buy them for my mother or other? Yes. Would I record an album with them? Depends who I am.. I'm sure that if you're a novice you'd like them but I'm sure that if you're a professional seasoned producer you aren't reading this, and if you are: I write music!! They are great, great headphones. Furthermore, you can't beat Amazon Prime's shipping so I bought them and I love them. I kind of want to take off work just to listen to music. =)

VI spent quite some time looking at different headphones at a reasonable price. About a year ago, I began to run a podcast in conjunction with a local comic shop. As our audience increased and we were encouraged, we decided to start upgrading equipment to better ourselves. So we started using better mics, we upgraded the software we were using, and a soundboard. Recently, we decided to get a headphone amp. Now that will let everyone plug in a set of headphones to hear themselves and anything else going into the podcast (no longer making me the only one that can hear everything). So then I began the search for the right headphones.I had to find a good quality headphone with a reasonable price so that we all could afford to buy them. I came across these and a few others. Then I saw them here on Amazon at a great price. So I decided to buy them and become the guinea pig and try them. When they arrived and I put them on, they shut down almost all the noise around me. Talk about noise reduction. Our gardener was outside working and I could hardly hear him. Then I would take them off and hear the equipment being used. Mind you, this was just with them on, no music had been played yet. I connected them to my iPhone and it shut everything down around me. I couldn't hear a dang thing other than my music. The clarity was there. The only downfall is they are a bit bassy, but nothing bad at all. Then when I opened my Headquake app, the sound got even better.Next came the tryout with the podcast. Heavenly! I could only hear the panel through my headphones. I wasn't hearing any real ambient noise. It was perfect. Then the price really helped. They were within everyone's budget. Only 2 panelists didn't order them. (1 being he already had a good set he recently purchased, the other having purchased his before I saw these). Overall, these are a great product for the price. Sennheiser makes a quality product and these budget ones didn't fall short of their quality. I would highly recommend these to anyone.

VIt's tough to get five stars from me when it comes to Sennheiser. In the past 18 months, I've had four sets of Senn phones disintegrate on me for one reason or another. But I needed a pair of back-up headphones after a friend sort of hijacked my preferred Audio Technica phones. Believe me, I searched high and low for a good set of headphones that were not from Sennheiser, and I kept coming back to this model. My requirements were fairly simple: the price had to be $20-25, the phones had to be sufficiently portable that I could use them on my Fire and iPad, and they had to produce bass frequencies well enough that I could reproduce the binaural beats commonly used in psychoacoustic meditation soundtracks. Anything else was gravy.These simply fit the bill better than anything else out there. I bought them for $19. That was a week ago. The price has since gone up, but if you're patient, it might come back down a little. Or check the Amazon Warehouse deals to see if you can pick up a pair at a discount. "Like new" condition should get you about 10 percent off.Considering the overall value of these phones, anything less than a five-star rating would not be honest or fair. They do their job very well. After a break-in period, they had no trouble with binaural beats. With a variety of different types of music, they seem to reproduce well with minimal coloration, and they are certainly leaps and bounds better than most earbuds I have tried (although I have not tested the really expensive earbuds of the Monster or Bose persuasion). The headphones are fairly comfortable although not as comfortable as, perhaps, higher-end audiophile phones costing a lot more. The design and construction are really better than anything one would ordinarily expect in this price range. They work very well on both my Fire and iPad. The only real quibble I have with them is the cabling--I don't like Y-cabling.But for anyone who wants a solid value, these Senns make a lot of sense. Even if they only last me 12-18 months, I still regard them as a very good purchase. I hope this helps.

VNow, this is coming from someone who upgraded from ear-bud headphones. I really wanted some over the ear headphones, with decent quality, and for cheap (I was expecting to pay $40-50 and was glad to see $20 options). In no way am I crazy about the absolute best quality of sound, but trust me, I love good quality sound; I'm just a college student so money can be an issue.So I looked around and found a few over the ear headphones with decent quality in my price range ($20-30), and after comparing specs and reviews, I decided to try these out. The first thing I noticed from the HD 202 headphones was the long cord. For me, that's not important, as I just use it for my computer, so if anything, it's too long! But that's only my perspective for the reasons why I use headphones. Could be a little obnoxious if out and about with an iPod though. Good thing though, is that it comes with a holder for the extra cord, so it's not so bad. You just have to unravel and ravel the cord if you need to change lengths.I put on some music from my computer, hooked up the new headphones, and I was amazed. Fantastic quality, and great bass as well. For $20, I was expecting far less quality, and am VERY pleased with the quality of the sound from these.Only downside that I've found so far (besides the nuisance of the longer cord) is the comfort of the headphones. You can adjust it, however, they are a little bit tight on my ears, and just barely fit the size of my ears as well (medium ears, I guess?). So if you have big ears, or a really wide head, might not be the headphones for you. Personally, I do feel a bit of discomfort, but I'm hoping I'll get used to it (usually do to things like this). Might just have to adjust them every once in a while, or take them off for a couple minutes for a break. I don't see much of a problem with that.Too long; didn't read:Great quality for $20! Absolutely fantastic quality for the price, and has the plug adapter as well so you can use it with a variety of different devices. Only negative is that they can be a bit uncomfortable around the ears (being not quite big enough for big ears, and wide heads). I'll get used to the comfort, as long as I get the good sound! Quality product.

VLike several other people reported in reviews here, I received the Sennheiser HD 202 model, not the 202 II.  A fact I'm not *entirely* upset about, because the price on their advertised Sennheiser HD 202's was higher than the 202 II's at the time I ordered.Now about the phones...These headphones are "Okay"...  They're certainly nothing to write home to momma about, but you get what you pay for.  The construction is clearly very cheap, the cord is similar to those you might find on $10 headphones at Walmart (except for the fact that it's extremely long, which I like), and the rest of its construction is a very cheap looking plastic.  Given any abuse, these headphones will undoubtedly break easily.Sound Quality:After reading reviews on here my expectations for sound quality were set pretty high.  But I have the sneaking suspicion that those who wrote glowing reviews about the sound quality must have been accustomed to $10-$30 retail headphones.  I would judge the sound quality at perhaps slightly better (fuller bass) than those cheap Sony studio monitor headphones you can get for $20 just about anywhere.The notes are very clear, and it is true you can hear even vague notes in songs, but these headphones do not produce a very good sound-stage.Comfort:There's nothing that sets these headphones apart as far as comfort goes.  After about an hour and a half wearing them, my ears are a bit sore.Overall:If you're looking for a set of decent enough over-the-ear headphones, these are a pretty good deal.  I definitely plan on using mine for things like watching movies and playing video games, but as for music I'd rather stick with my Shure Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor, Black in-ear earbuds.  If you're an audiophile or a professional, shell out some extra cash and get some better headphones.Shipping was quick, ordered em at about 2p.m. yesterday with next day air, got em today around 1:30.

VGreat product.  I got them on sale for about $22 and they are almost certainly better than anything else you can get at that price point.  Before I review specifics, I'd like to confirm the claim in other reviews that they do indeed advertise HD 202 II in the description and send you HD 202's, which are purportedly the same item with new packaging (looking at the data sheets on Sennheiser's website, I'm inclined to believe this is true).  Personally I find that irrelevant and irksome because the two versions have separate item pages on Amazon, so they clearly can and have distinguished them.  However, I figure they might be doing us a favor if the item is legitimately the same aside from the packaging; we get what we REALLY want for wicked cheap by allowing them to bypass our finicky consumer brains.SOUNDI listened to a variety of music and found the sound quality is excellent; the bass is quite well balanced, with the ranges sounding fairly crisply defined.  The closed system blocked out almost all outside/ambient sound, giving solid isolation.COMFORTThe height of the earpads is easily adjustable on and they are very soft and comfortable.  I was surprised they didn't get sweaty sitting in 80-90 degree heat for an hour; a little hot but not sweaty.  The headband is molded plastic so you can't bend them to a shape as you can with metal, but you can flex them a bit so they loosen up if you have a fat head like I do.CONVENIENCEThe set is extremely lightweight and has 9 or 10 foot cord.  Included in the package is a notched take-up that allows you to spool your cord and clip it to your belt or just improve neatness (be careful you don't miss it, as it's kinda hidden in the packaging and easy to accidentally throw away).  Also included is a nice snap on 6.3mm adapter in case your stereo or other equipment has the larger plug.  Finally, the set is modular for DJ use, travel, and storage; you can remove the earcups from the headband by sliding them to the top of the railing they ride in and tilting them out.  It's not exactly obvious how to do this, so some instructions would have been nice (I figured it out from other reviews on the internet and looking closely under a lamp).CONCLUSIONAgain, I am impressed.  Very nice set for the money.  Comfy, sturdy and most importantly they sound good.  I'd have given the HD 202's the full 5 out of 5 stars if they hadn't made me look for third party help on removing the earcups.

VI am no audiophile, but I decided that I would like to get a decent pair of headphones sometime. After some research, I settled on the Sennheiser HD202. I am extremely satisfied with my decision.Sound:I feel the sound is great. If you're a bass lover then you should be happy, the bass is prominent and quite pleasant without sounding too boomy. However, you will also enjoy the midranges and highs from these, which stay quite clear unless extremely loud. However these headphones have fairly low impedance so you won't have to crank up the volume to get loud output from them. I listen to a wide variety of music and they are excellent for all different genres. Also, they are remarkably good at isolating noise. If you're playing music, you most likely won't hear anything else (I don't play my music very loud either, but these are good for isolation).Comfort:These are on-ear headphones, so they rest on the fleshy part of your ear rather than covering it. They are quite comfortable for the most part, but after extended periods with them on you will probably want to take them off for a break. The cushion is nice and soft and it doesn't hurt your ears or anything.Build Quality:For $20, these are built quite well. The cushioning is nice, and the plastic of the earphones and the headband seems fairly durable. They will resist normal wear and tear quite well, but don't do anything stupid with them, such as putting heavy objects on top. The cord seems to be fairly well constructed as well and should be fine. You also get a two-year warranty along with purchase from an authorized retailer.OVERALL:For under $25, you are not going to find better headphones. They isolate well, have very good sound quality, a reasonably sturdy build, fairly comfortable ear cushions, and best of all are backed by a two year manufacturer's warranty. I highly recommend these to everyone looking for decent headphones under a $50 price point.

VThe Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones deliver audiophile quality sound at a price that borders on the incredible.  I have owned a number of headphones over the years from companies like Koss, Sennheiser, Sony, AKG. and others.  These inexpensive, comfortable, headphones deliver all the sound you want to hear without distortion, discomfort, or a high price.  They have excellent highs, midrange, and bass.  They deliver clean, lifelike,audiophile sound and unless you are willing to spend much more for headphones you will never know the difference between these and pricey headphones such as Beats by Dr. Dre.  The differences between these Sennheiser headphones and expensive headphones are very subtle and barely discernible even to those who have "high end" equipment. Nobody has "high end ears".  Most people will never be able to hear those differences anyway.  If you told your friends that you bought these for $100 they would believe you and compliment you on your choice.  These are comfortable for extended listening, do a good job of blocking external sounds, and fit well on large, medium, and small heads. I listen to a wide variety of music and they are also excellent for listening to TV and movies.  Vocals are clear, there is no discernible distortion, and I love them.  At this price you can buy several pairs and give them to people you like as a great gift. I owned a pair of Sennheiser 448s which my grown son sat on and broke.  These are just as good.  Sennheiser models HD202 and HD202 MK11 are the same headphones they just come in different packaging.  All in all, this product is a triumph of engineering and deserving of praise. Sennheiser HD448 Closed Circumaural Hi-Fi Headphone

VPROS:-Very awesome quality! Every piece of audio or any song I listen to sounds nice and clear, and the bass is nice and clear. Make sure to mess with the equalizer on whatever music player you use however, so you can get the best music quality for you.-Fits my head well. Keep in mind that I'm a teenage girl with an average sized head. However, my dad tried them on and he says they're quite comfortable. They also stay put, so I don't think moving around is a problem.-The style. Not only do they feel awesome, but they look pretty kick a*s too!-Quite comfortable. They're nice and soft :D-Normal when it comes to blocking out outside noise. I originally had JVC air cushion earphones (which are fantastic in ear headphones that are also very cheap on amazon. Get them!), which had crazy good noise cancellation, so the headphones were quite a change from that.CONS:-Not very comfortable after a long period of time. Since I have long hair, usually if I just cover my ears with my hair, the headphones are still comfortable. But if I don't do so, after a while, my ears kind of ache. So if you are a dude (or gal)JVC HAFX67B Air Cushion Headphone (Black) with short hair and larger ears (or ears the same size as mine), then beware.EXTRA:Although the chord is quite long, this isn't anything the included clip can't handle. Besides, no customer should whine about it considering the description says that the cable is 10 feet!There is an included 6.3 mm adapter plug. I haven't used it yet, but this is great for those who are professionals.BTW, amazon didn't seem to include this information, so I will:Frequency response: 18-18000 HzImpedance: 32Sound pressure level: 115 dB (1kHz)

VDo NOT buy these headphones
p2298

VIf you're looking for long-term headphones, these are NOT the ones you should purchase.I bought these headphones in 2012. For a solid 1.5 years, they were fine (pretty nice sounding bass), although the noise emission from the headphones were terrible. I couldn't go into a room full of people without them knowing what I was listening to, even with the volume turned down to an adequate number. But that's not why I'm giving this 2 stars. As mentioned in the other review, these headphones will randomly stop working in one ear. Yes, one ear only. And with the 2-year warranty, you're going to go through a bunch of them. Here is what I endured:Fall 2012- May 2014: fine, until the headphones stopped working in one ear. Sennheiser offers free postage for repair", so I sent mine in via their website.May 2014-June 2014: Received a brand new spanking pair from Sennheiser. I was excited. The headphones worked for a solid month until the left earphone stopped working. THIS WAS A NEW PAIR. This should not happen.June 2014-July 2014: Sent the headphones back to Sennheiser. Received a new pair two weeks later. And within two weeks, THE EARPHONE STOPPED WORKING.August 2014: A new record, ladies and gentlemen. Sennheiser, again, sent me a new pair, and the right earphone stopped working in...*drumroll*...ONE WEEK. I only used them twice, then whoosh. Dead earphone.You really get what you pay for. Although these headphones are inexpensive, don't expect them to outlast the warranty date because that's how long on average they are designed to work due to a mass technical design flaw. My advice? Invest in a more expensive, quality pair of headphones that you can use for a longer duration of time.

VI bought these headphones almost exactly a year ago, and they only just stopped working for me. That being said, I liked them so much that I'm about to purchase another pair.First off, I'm no audiophile. These were the first pair of headphones I've ever owned that cost more than $10 and weren't earbuds. So, I won't comment on the audio quality. I will say that the ability to block out ambient noise is pretty good. You can easily reach a comfortable volume where the rest of the world quietly fades to nothing. I've been startled more than a few times by someone "sneaking" up on me.I've also had next to zero problems with comfort. I have a normal-sized ears (or at least I like to think so) and glasses, and these headphones always fit comfortably over them. They do tend to get a bit warm after extended use, but sometimes that's nice in the cold climate where I live. The only real problem I've had is after long usage (> 2 hours), they did tend to squeeze my head uncomfortably. To be fair, I do have a large head, and a 15 minute break always relieved the pressure.Finally, durability. After a year of use, the left speaker would stop working unless I held the cable in a certain way. Again to be fair, I treated this pair pretty roughly. It would stay in my backpack constantly, unless I was using it, and I'm sure the cable connection took a beating. Thus, I took a star off the rating, but I'm very satisfied for the price I paid.In short, these headphones are comfortable, have decent isolation, and no comment on audio quality. I owned a pair for a year before they broke, and will buy another pair. If you're not picky about audio quality, this is a great product for the price.

VIt had been a while since I had had my last pair of Sennheiser phones. My previous experience with this brand had been with a more open phone design, one that allowed a lot of ambient noise into your ears as you listened (unless you really blasted the sound--not recommended ever). The sound on those earlier phones had been ok, maybe a little flat, not very detailed. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I took a flyer on these headphones.I've been pleasantly surprised. These phones have very nice sound, with good bass but also a lot of nuance in the higher ranges, too. I've been hearing a lot of old favorite songs with new ears, so to speak, since getting these phones. The closed earcup design does a good job of blocking outside noise. (These headphones are labeled as noise-cancelling; I'm not sure if they are considered noise-cancelling by physically blocking noise, or through their interior design and output, but they are pretty effective nevertheless.) Whether the design is noise-cancelling or not, it certainly is comfortable. I've had no problem wearing these cans for hours at a time; I've even fallen asleep with them on without any resulting discomfort, even if I'm directly laying with my head/ear laying directly on the cup. So, good sound: check; comfortable: check; noise-cancelling: check. Good stuff.The only real downside: the cord is very long, which is not necessarily bad, but the take-up spool provided with the headphones is awkward and doesn't hold the spooled up cable very well. An improved solution for taking up the excess cord would be most welcome.Overall, a pair of headphones well worth the very reasonable price.

VI have used these headphones for over 2 years now and this is my second set of headphones and i personally feel like these headphones are worth twice as much as they are listed!Pro's--- They are extremly comftorable and don't get sweaty or hot when you have them on for to long.The sound feels like it's right next to you, unlike some earbuds and heaphones i've owned that feel like the sound is coming from a distance.The quality of the sounds is perfect! my friends and kids always ask me if they can use my headphones because they really like to listen to good quality sound!These headphones are over the ear which are alot more comftorable then on the ear headphones and have a lot better sound.I have had people complain to me that i am deft when i have my headphones on because the noise cancellation is that good!The headphones last litterally forever! the only reason I bought a new set (of the same brand) is because i didn't know they have a 2 year warranty!Also the headphones are removable so instead of the headphones breaking, they just pop right off and then pop back on (if they are in your bookbag a lot then is is great for you!Con's--- The cord is a little long(, but that is good for if you move around the office a lot.)The cord gets tangled a lot and it gets twisted up so much i have to straighten the cord some times.Overall--- This product is almost better then the $300 counterpart of your bose headphones. Dre beats are actually a lot worse then these headphones in sound and it comfort, so i suggest you buy yourself a pair because these headphones are THE BEST!!!

VThree and a half stars--would be more if not for the flimsy feel.
p2357
sg5
VFour stars on sound. Two stars on materials. I decided to stick with the sound rating on the stars, since Sennheiser offers a really long warranty.The unattractive and flimsy feeling plastic is not as good as I would expect from Sennheiser, even for entry level headphones. These were a gift and they do sound quite good, especially in comparison to a majority of headphones in the same price range.  I'd have likely spent more and gone up the line if I'd been buying for myself, but even so, they are quite clear and smooth without sounding flat, and present yet not overpowering bass.  Definitely my preference vs. many overly bass heavy headphones these days that wipe out the midrange to my ears.Still, despite all those positives, it's impossible to ignore that the plastic feels cheap and flimsy, and the cord is disconcertingly thin. Also,while comfortable enough (weighing next to nothing is a positive of thin plastic, I suppose) I don't see them withstanding normal wear and tear. For example, while adjusting them for my smallish head, I was worried I was going to crack something. They just felt flat out fragile. I guess the material quality is *somewhat* expected for the price, and the warranty is there to back them up for two years, a generous amount of time if something goes awry, so... perhaps (hopefully!!) I'm mistaken and they'll hold up against regular use. If they do surprise me and hold up decently, then I'll be back to up my rating. Fingers crossed.So to sum it up...if they hold up, then this is a pretty fantastic set considering the price. If not, then I suggest spending a bit more.

VI was looking for headphones that might drown out the world - these do perfectly fine. I have neighbors that deem it necessary to crank up their car stereo (which sounds awful with all the metal rattles - they are not audiophiles by any means) so after searching through the reviews and doing some research of my own, I have found this set. Absolutely fantastic quality (I have limited funds otherwise I would have opted for a higher priced different brand). Great low's - great high's and I can only hear a muffled version of my voice (equates to when your ears are plugged or you have a SERIOUS sinus infection) when I have it turned all the way up and cannot hear anyone else. Leak is minimal - but would be heard by someone trying to meditate in the same room. : ) It comes with a plastic piece to wrap the excess wire, but I doubt I will use it. I ordered (in addition to this headset) a 15 foot extension cord - which will come in handy when I am trying to do workouts quietly (I love my music loud but do not wish to offend others) which will give plenty of room away from my equipment. However, the cord length included with the headset by itself is sufficient in length - it would allow a person to move from place to place in a small room without fear of pulling equipment off the counter/shelf/etc. I would recommend the extension cord if you wish to have a "mile" to move around. This headset would also be quite useful for binaural/theta/etc however this will not drown out the world around you - just muffle it considerably. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend.

VI chose this rating for a few reasons, other than theobviously disappointing title :[ To be honest I wish Icould give this product a 4.5-5 stars...so I just rounded upto 5 stars :)The good:1] The sound quality is superb, excellent bass, trebleand overall level of sound detail. This is what shinesthe most about this product to me!2] Comfortably designed. They do not make my ears or headhurt in any way, even while I am listening to music.They can be adjusted if you have a really big or small head.3] The sound cable is long. How long? ...Long enough to go allthe way across my room! Which is about 8-9 feet.I considerthis a good thing because if it is "too long", you can justtie it with a plastic tie or rubber band.4] No batteries! I consider this a plus because I hatekeeping up with batteries and charging them. I'm notsome kind of anti-battery freak, I just like to avoidbatteries if possible.The bad:1] Due to the physical design and length of the cable, theseheadphones are not ideal for jogging. I have jogged in thembefore just fine, but the long cable and overhead designis a tad inconvenient.Overall, an excellent "A" rank product in my book, and I highlyrecommend this to all music lovers, even to those who jogif you can deal with the minor "inconveniences'. I considerthose inconveniences to be overshadowed by all the positivesI listed.

V$25 dollars for peace.I received this as a gift to myself for Christmas, which I used over the holiday season. I work in an office environment where things are always loud and distracting. My work colleagues may as well have taken a permanent vacation when I have these on. The headphones do a great job on their own by mechanically blocking out noise just by the way they fit snugly (not too tight) on my head and ears.As for sound reproduction, you couldn't ask more out of $25 dollar pair of cans. I do feel that the overall bass response is a bit much, but this can be handled quickly with an equalizer tweak in whatever device you are using. I'm currently using a couple devices. My iPhone 6S through plays my favorites very well - and very well balanced. My work gave me a Dell Latitude E5550 to work from - and this is where I have have to do some tweaking with the EQ (VLC on Linux has a nice EQ).Considering the price again, I'm listening to old familiar tunes that seem to have a new life brought to them when I listen to them with this headset. Maybe it's the placebo effect, but I feel like I'm able to hear stuff I've not picked up on before. These headphones are great - and I would recommend them to anyone looking to spend up to $40 on a entry-level pair of headphones.One last thing concerning durability.... I've had no problems in the week I've owned these. I will update this review in a few months as there seems to be a theme in the comments concerning built quality. Time will tell. Until then - enjoy the music!

p2470
sg5
VI was really excited to get these after all the reviews on this site.  When they got here, I openned up the box immediately and went to check them out and was shocked by the uneven sound of the phones.Disclosure, I am NOT an audiophile, so I don't know the jargon.  That said, I love to listen to clean sounding music.  Hearing crisp audio gives me a sensory thrill that only a few things beat in life, and I have been told that I have pretty good hearing.  So it's really important for me to hear ALL of the frequencies in a recording.  These headphones are so far bent to the low end of the spectrum as to be almost unlistenable for me without an equalizer.  To get a ballanced sound, I have to have the EQ set to31hz --- -362hz --- -2125hz - +3250hz - +2500hz - +41k ----- +32k ----- +44k ----- +68k ----- +516k ---- +7In otherwords, the treble is all but missing when the EQ is flat.  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I tried them on my Ipod, Droid, Pionneer VSX-1020, my PC, and my laptop, and they have the same muffled high range on all of them. In the high register, even my Iphone earbuds have clearer sound.The 3 stars is because they seem well built; They have more than adequate volume; and they are mostly comfortable (altough the cups don't fully enclose my ears).Oh well, back they go...I may try the HD280.  They have excellent reviews, and the Freq range reaches 25k instead of 18k.  They were the headphones I was looking for (from CNET review), but the reviews for this one prompted me to give it a try.

VGreat bass, really long cord
p2476
sg5
VThese headphones are awesome and here is why:Pros+great bass that is definitely noticeable+noise canceling sound really generates sound clarity+comfortable fit around the ears and top of the head.  They can warm your ears up if on for too long (3 hours or so), but are fantastic in the winter as replacement earmuffs.+durable (dropped them and sat on them many times and not a single scratch nor sound difference) The actual speaker phones can come off as well as I have accidentally popped them off when I sat on them, but do not panic if this happens because they can easily be popped back into place.Cons-EXTREMELY long cord that becomes very annoying very quickly.  The headphones come with an oval clip that the cord can be wrapped around and clipped to the side of your pants or outside of your pocket, but the cord tends to unravel very easily.  This is really the only bad thing about these headphones.  However, I have learned to turn this negative into a positive by utilizing the length: for example, if I am watching a movie on my laptop and don't fell like unplugging my headphones to get up and get something a few feet away then it becomes pretty handy.All things considered, these headphones provide great sound quality for a great price.  The length of the cord can be annoying hence the 4 stars, but these headphones are still worth a shot, better to have a longer cord than a shorter one, right? So all in all, a 4.5 star rating. One last thing, the headphones come with a DJ headphone jack that will be useless unless you DJ.

VI have purchased 2 pairs of these in the last 6 years, and they are used on a daily basis (sometimes for 8+ hours a day). They are not, as others have stated, $500 headphones, but they so much better than your entry-level open-air headphones or iPod earbuds, it's not to be believed until heard.The difference is so stark, it's akin to becoming a drug addict. Every person that has taken me up on my offer to switch out their headphones for a brief listen to these has almost instantly become disgusted with their previous equipment. I am no audiophile, but I spent the near entirety of the first 2 days of owning these lying down, the euphoria of revisiting my music library in superior definition washing over me.I realize that I'm being dramatic, and that the same experience is quite likely still possible by switching to a higher quality headphone, but you'll not find anything of the sort in this price range, or even nearby. If you're thinking of buying Beats for $100, $200, $300 dollars - STOP! And at least give these a quick listen. If you're not impressed, give them to someone. But I'm willing to bet you'll find them comparable or better than at least entry-level Beats, if not significantly better. And for 1/4 or 1/8 the price.My only complaint is that my ears barely fit into the cups, and that they become quite sweaty after extended wear. Hence knocking off a single star. If they were completely comfortable, I would give a 5-star review, based upon performance and price.

VI was very disappointed with these headphones. I got them mainly for my new sound blaster Z, but even with portable mp3 players I have bought many in-ear headphones that sounded way better than this for the same cost. I expected that even for an entry level, getting a brand name set of headphones would sound good even if it wasn't the highest model. It is such a shame that a pair of headphones that cost as much as this one would have a frequency range of 18 to 18,000 only.. the sound gets EASILY distorted if the volume gets a little too high due to the very obvious limited frequency range. my friends told em that 18-18,000 from sennheiser is cleaner than getting 22,000 hz form another brand. That was not true at all. Brand name headphones should never ever be below 20,000, because any number below that shows a very clear scratchiness to the sound if the sound input is even the slightest bit more powerful than average. Also the sound is very flat and quiet boring, and I don't know if that is because of the limited frequency range or because sennheiser has a flat sound in general. The bass is very unsatisfying.. sounding like small, dull shots of air rather than a smooth bass, and because of the low quality sound, u get a scratchy bass instead of a smooth bass. Playing with the equalizer settings even slightly makes the sound completely terrible. i have heard much better headphones than these. Not a good pair for it's price and definitely not a pair to judge the brand name buy. Avoid these if possible

VW.O.W! This is the first pair of Sennheiser headphones I've ever bought...and right now I'm kicking myself for not getting a pair (or several pairs) earlier. These things are amazing. Listening to "Time" by Alan Parsons Project and I can hear every note like the band was sitting here in my living room...nothing gets swamped because they wanted to add bass or midrange. Every emotion of the singer's voice comes through clearly and every instrument is right on volume.Listening to "How Does it Feel?" live version by the Rolling Stones, and I can pick out the different sounds of the voices when they're all singing the chorus. I can hear Darryl Jones's fingers sliding up and down the strings as he picks out the bass line.This is the low end of the Sennheiser brand and I'm so impressed with the sound quality that I'm definitely buying another pair. I can't imagine how their more expensive gear could sound any better than these.I bought these to have a "cheap" pair or headphones to keep noise out and listen to music while I'm doing yard work...these are so good I almost feel bad using them in such a rough environment.These have large enough cups to fit entirely around my ears, so they're very comfortable and keep the outside noise out.I've spent a lot more money in the past for headphones that didn't sound or fit half this good. To get this kind of quality for this price, I can't imagine I'll ever buy another brand of headphones.

VDespite the initial enthusiasm that I had felt for these headphones from the beginning, which was over three years ago, I wanted to give them a suitable long term test before reviewing them. Although I don't have a new pair of the same type of Sennheiser headphones to compare them to, and while also admitting that I'm not a true discriminating audiophile that has sampled a full spectrum of audio equipment, I can only say that I am still very satisfied with the only pair of headphones that I have; the headphone adjustment slots haven't broken, the ear cushions haven't torn, and, overall, when listening, I can still more so viscerally experience the music in a way that I haven't been able to achieve with anything else that I've used thus far. I have to agree with what a few of the other reviewers had stated about these particular headphones, in that for the uninitiated listener that's used to cheap headphones and monitors, Sennheiser's HD 202(for the record, the original and second version are the same, with the only difference being the packaging) headphones are a very inexpensive investment in providing you with a medium to experience music on a more profound level.FWIW, my brother and I compared my HD 202's to his pair of House of Marley headphones after playing various types of music that accentuated either treble or bass, or treble and bass; we both gave the Sennheisers the nod across the board with the only exception being that the House of Marley headphones have better design aesthetics.

VI bought these headphones for $25 in July, 2010. They were my first pair of headphones, before I had only been using earbuds.These were comfortable, they are lightweight with plenty of padding. The ear pads aren't very big but there is enough cushioning so they did not hurt my ears. I like that the frame was removable. The cord is very long on these, which I did not find too inconvenient but I did not benefit from that either because I mostly use them when I am listening to music on my laptop while working.The sound quality though wasn't what I expected after reading the good reviews on them. My brother owns a pair of Sennheiser HD515 and the sound quality difference is remarkable, which is understandable considering the price difference. These did not sound clear or resonant, but they were okay at blocking out outside noises. I think I bought them after reading that the bass quality was good, but it does overwhelm all the other tones / sounds sometimes in bass-heavy music, which I didn't like. But for songs in which I wanted the bass to be more emphasized, these did that.After about a year of using the right side stopped working. I am not sure how long these usually last, but I feel like that's not very durable at all. Like I said I only used them at home so I did not frequently drop them or throw them around.I had high hopes for these and I liked them at first but I think I would rather invest in a more expensive pair that is more durable and performs better.

VThese headphones are simply amazing! The sound quality on these is top notch. I've compared these to so of the better skull candy headphones and can barely tell the difference. The Skull Candy headphones were slightly better but cost $100 more. The full range of sound comes in full, crisp, and clear. While I can't attest to how they sound with every kind of music the sound awesome with all the bass laden industrial and electronic music I listen to on a regular basis (Nine Inch Nails, Gary Numan, Deadmau5, etc). Another nice feature of the headphones is that the cord is absurdly long. It is ridiculous how long it is, I'm using a clip to shorten the length down to around 3-4 feet while I use them at my desk at work. One last thing, while these aren't noise cancelling they isolate noise fairly well.The one negative to these is how they fit my large head. My head is pretty large and at first the fit on these was a little tight. After about a week they fit fine. They fit around my ears plenty fine. Overall it was not a huge deal because they were only a bit tight.I realize that these will not sound as good as some of the "professional" quality headphone on the market, the difference to me is not enough to spend over $100 to get better headphones. Also, they are not the trendiest looks pair on the market but if you are like me then as long as they're not ugly that's not a problem.All in all, these headphones are an awesome value.

VI bought these headphones because I needed a cheaper alternative to the Turtle Beach headphones for XBox 360 gaming.  After having played several games, watched a movie, and listened to countless music tracks with these headphones, all I can say is, WOW!!!They have built in bass, which makes anything you listen to far more "booming" than it would usually.  Considering the type of music I listen to, this isn't a problem at all.  It felt like I was listening to my music live, which was amazing.  You'll never listen to music without headphones again after having used these!The gaming on these headphones is outstanding! While playing, I noticed sounds I've never heard before.  While they don't give you the same "real sound" as the Turtle Beaches (meaning I can hear when something is behind me moving around), I can hear everything much clearer than without headphones.The price is great; it is very reasonable for the quality you receive. They don't feel cheaply built either, which is nice.  The pads are super comfortable and I can wear them for several hours (which is the case when I start to game for the night haha) without my ears starting to hurt.My only complaint is, when I was watching my movie, sometimes it was difficult to understand the dialogue because the music is so enhanced.  This might be fixed by something in the settings, but I'm not sure how to do that.Other than that, these headphones are well worth the money.

VThe first thing I noticed about these headphones as that they have a ridiculously long cord, but fortunately it is easily managed by the cord winder that comes with them. Then I appreciated their aesthetic beauty for a while. They are neither excessively flashy nor bulky, but rather a perfect subdued modern design.Next, I noticed that they sound wonderful. They have rich, clear, and consistent tones across the spectrum and make whatever you're listening to come alive. Everything from tech house to doom metal will sound amazing on these headphones. They're also very comfortable even after an extended period of listening. Every other pair of supra-aural headphones I've owned have made my (somewhat large) ears very sore, but not these.After about a month, I realized how durable they are. My girlfriend bought a pair of HD 201's around the same time I bought these, and hers had already broken in her backpack. Meanwhile I was subjecting my 202's to lots of undeserved abuse and they're still holding up six months later.Overall, these are the best headphones I've ever owned. If you aren't a producer or an audiophile, you really don't need anything better. However, if you're still listening to music on the earbuds that came with your iPod, you're definitely missing out. These are an excellent value at just over $20 and have quality comparable to other brands' $80-$100 range products. Definitely worth it.

VA great pair of headphones!  Terrific sounding and durable.  I live in an apartment and use these for when I practice my instruments (Guitar, Bass and keyboard) as well as for general music listening.What I like:-Fantastic range, timbre and clarity.  Very prominent when I play my keyboard (very high dynamic range instrument).  Produces very fat/thick sound on my Fender Stratocaster that I can't reproduce even with a stage-quality Roland amplifier.  Impressed!-Incredibly durable!  I've owned over 10 years.  The ear pads got worn after about 8 years but I was able to get replacements for them and was back in business. Genuine Replacement Ear pads Cushions for SENNHEISER HD202 HD212 HD212-Pro HD497 EH150 EH250 HD62-TV Headphones The pad covering on the headband is completely gone (there is no replacement for that) but I don't care about that-Long cable!  You are not tethered to your listening source with these.  (And yet there is no sound degradation that I can perceive and I have good ears!)-Lightweight and comfortable.  There isn't much to these headphones, they are all plastic which keeps them light on the head.  I often listen for several hours at a time and I'm not bothered at all.-Pads provide decent shielding from outside noise.  (Not noise cancelling but hey, you should be looking at other headphones if thats what you need)Absolutely no cons!5 stars, I can't recommend any higher!

VThis is my third Sennheiser HD 202 II, and I really love it.The sound sounds better than any other headphones or earbuds I tried so far! (I'm a poor college kid, so the most expensive headphones I had were $30, so maybe don't have the highest of expectations on this)There were only a couple of annoyances, which were,1) I have kind of big ears, and my ears hurt after over two hours of use. I used to have glasses, and that made my ears hurt much faster, but even after eye surgery (lenses suck), a couple hours of use will sore your ears out.2) it can be very good, but for me, the wire was way too long. I like long cords, but this one was waaaay too long. They do give you something to wrap the excess cords, but using it made me feel kind of awkward, since there was a bunch of clumped up cords that were pulling down on the headphones. Also, this is my third one in two or so years, so I've had two broken in that time period.3) Finally, this applies only to my current one, but the left ear only, I hear light static whenever I use it, never on the right side. It's not terribly loud, but I end up getting headaches if used for too long. So I generally just have one side on.Overall, I love the headphones, and I would recommend it to people that don't generally wear glasses or have large ears! It will probably be better than most other headphones you can buy at the same price range.

VThe Sennheiser HD 202 headphones provide an adequate sound for the price.  :PROs:-Cheap. It is hard to find headphones that can produce this level of quality music for this price range ($30~).-Quality; if you've been listening to your sub-$10 earphones or your Apple iPod earbuds, then this set of headphones will seem almost too good to be true.-Durable; when you hold it in your hands, it feels it can last quite a while even if kids are using/abusing these-Cord length. The cord length is VERY long (approx 6+ feet)-Portable; doesn't take up too much space and because of the durability you don't have to worry too muchCONs:-Quality; if you've owned above average headphones such as Bose or the more advanced Sennheiser, then this pair will sound absolute trash to you. You will immediately notice that these lack clear sounds and tend to "mix up" the sounds.-Comfort; as I mentioned, the comfort level can become frustrating after half an hour of continuous use. While the earmuff part is very soft they can also get very hot after a period of time.  Not so much of an issue win the winter but in the summer you will need to remove them every once in a while to cool off.-Not much noise-isolation; if you wish to only hear your music or movie these may not be the best for you.  Although, for this price point you really can't expect much.

VThese are so good I had to leave a review.  My first review on Amazon.I was worried when I thought about buying them.  My brother owns a pair from the HD400 series and he's pretty much in love with them.  He says they're the most comfortable headphones in the world with awesome sound for a good price.  So I was a little scared that since these were about 30-40 bucks cheaper they may disappoint.I'm glad I was so wrong.When I got 'em I tried them out against my brother's and to my surprise...there was close to 0 difference.  In fact, it was so little that I didn't even notice it the first couple of times.  These perform.  As expected of Sennheiser these sound amazing; especially considering the $20 price tag.  More than happy with this.This is also a nifty little thing because the phones pop out.  I've popped 'em out accidentally a couple of times.  Any normal pair would've broken, but huzzah!  These are still alive right after I pop 'em back in!  Sweet and absurdly useful design.As for comfort I wear these for hours at a time.  Sure, I have to take 'em off after like 1-2 hours of continued use and let my ears breathe, but really, I shouldn't be wearing headphones that long without a break anyway.  In any case, comfort is not a problem for me.Anyone looking for quality headphones for everyday use but not willing/unable to pay the price tag should get these.  Quality music on a budget.

VI bought these headphones against everyone's bad reviews and I am extremely happy I did. I paid 18$ extra for overnight shipping cause I hate waiting and it was worth it. Before I get into the review I would like to state first that these could out class beats solo but nothing higher than that. The sound reproduction is much clearer and crisp than from my Philips SBC HP250 and the bass is pretty good (I have heard better BUT the bass is still outstanding.) Everyone has complained about the comfort of these and I see where they are coming from because in a couple positions it does hurt after a while but if you adjust it just a little it doesn't hurt my ears at all. The one and only problem is that Sennheiser makes quality headphones and because the sound reproduction is so great if you have a low quality song it brings out every bit of the song, I didnt have a problem with that on my Philips because the Philips mostly muffled that sound. These headphones are ideal for both high bass and louder songs and also your more acoustic and classic songs too. These headphones are dynamite on techno, electronic, house, dub-step on high volumes and low volumes too. One of the bigger reasons I bought these is cause i've seen sonny moore (skrillex) using these. My final conclusion is that these headphones are clear, crisp, and powerful, and anyone who wants to create, or just listen with them would love them.

VA steal at $15, OK at $30
p2668
sg5
VI recently bought a pair of these on sale for $15 on Amazon, and I'm auditioning them on Pandora One through a Meridian Explorer USB DAC device.Here are some thoughts:1. They're cheap.2. Comfort is OK, although they do feel rather warm. They're also somewhat tight - perhaps3. They're a steal at this price, but I'm not sure I would pay full price for them, considering what else is available in the $30-50 range. Highs are quite recessed, and bass is prominent. Overall they're not that engaging (I'm comparing them to Sony MDRV6's, which are admittedly 3 times the list price). If you want more high end, you may be better off with Sony, Superlux, Monoprice, or even a higher-end Sennheiser.4. They may be more appropriate for applications where you want to cover up harsh sounding electronics, such as the typical headphone jack on a laptop. I'm not surprised that they're marketed as appropriate for DJ applications.4. The cord is rather skimpy. I would predict that they might fail with frequent use. Also, the cord is incredibly long. Using the provided cord reel (a little piece of plastic that you wrap it around) makes things more manageable, but the slots on the reel are tight and could damage the cord. (I see that there many mentions of the poor quality of the cord in other reviews).If they go on sale again, grab a pair. Otherwise, shop carefully.

VThere are few things I know about music, and one of them is that I like having it around me all day long. I may not have expertise in sound or music, but even I can recognize that this headphones have incredibly better sound quality than the standard iPod headphones. Bass sounds rumble your skull, you hear every single detail you may have not heard before, and you have a great sound isolation. The quality of the materials is also quite good, I use them (and abuse them) everyday taking buses and walking on the street and they don't have even a scratch. They don't come with a case, but it's ok, I just hang them in my neck when I'm not listening, they aren't a burden. The earcups are a bit small for my ears, but it's not tiring.My only gripe is the über-lengthy cable that has a rather simple way of shortening it. It comes with a sort of plastic bit (that's qutie pretty with a glossy Sennheiser logo) that's used to wind the cable around, but the cable sometimes gets loose of it and you end up with a hefty amount of cable hanging around you. This bit has also a plastic belt clip that is perhaps the least quality plastic part of the whole headphones set.However, bear in mind this headphones are a mere 20 bucks. They might not be sound-studio level, but are good enough for a guy who want's great sound out of his iPod to disconnect from the outer world. I completely reccomend this product.

VI'm no professional, and have no technical knowledge. This is strictly a "user" review. But on that note- for the price these are great little headphones!I'm a woman with an above average sized head, and they fit well. Even my daughter with the teeny tiny head has no trouble using them. The foam on the top adds to the comfort. They're easy to adjust, and stay in place- no slipping about, size wise. The cushioning around the ears is also very comfy, and when I use them for hours I don't experience any unpleasant hotness.I like the long cord. I can plug them into my kitchen TV and move about my working space easily. And, as other reviewers have stated, dealing with extra length is easily done, but I appreciate the extra length when I want it.Sound wise--well, they're not going to sound like you spent $200, are they? But for the price, I think they're great! For me they have just enough outside noise blocking- I can hear the phone, but conversation around me isn't at all distracting. I've owned other, more expensive headphones that deliver better sound, but I spent a whole lot more money, too. I've used these daily for months (well, someone in my house has!) with no problems at all.Obviously not for professional use, and if you're picky, keep looking. If you're looking for affordable, reasonably good sounding, comfortable headphones, you should give these a try.

VThese are good quality headphones with a major design flaw.  The sound is great, as you would expect from Sennheiser.  The cord is very long and includes a cheap plastic belt clip that allows you to wrap unneeded or awkward lengths of cord around it so you can jog or go mobile.  The belt clip is very cheap and will break if you are not careful.  But the major drawback to these headphones is the comfort level.  While they are noise-cancelling and padded enough to feel good against the ear, they just barely cover an ear that is small to average size.  They do not encompass the ear like a good pair of studio headphones.  If you have big ears, do not buy these.  But the most uncomfortable aspect of these headphones is the tight fit of the band that goes over your head.  It is way too tight and stiff.  There is no way to adjust it or stretch it out without risking damage to the product.  I am hoping that with more usage the band will stretch out gradually to become more comfortable.  Now, at least the headphones are not painfully tight.  They are simply annoying.  This will however make long stretches of use uncomfortable.  If you have a big head, do not go for these.  So sound quality is good, but the design is flawed.  Spend the money on a better pair if you can, otherwise these will do.  But do not expect anything special here.  Just a decent product.

p2758

VI've had these headphones for around 8 months and I have to say that they definitely are worth the 25 I spent on them. First of all, the highs, mids, and lows all sound very crisp and clear. The bass is definitely there and does not muddle the quality at all.I've pretty much beaten the crap out of these things and they still are in great shape. I'll just throw them in my backpack to go to the library (as I'm a college student) and never really have to worry about them breaking. The build is plastic, but they definitely are made well. It is also ingenious how they designed the actual earphones part to break away from the headband. This way, if too much stress is put on the headphones, it just separates without breaking anything. Then you just simply pop the earphone back into the headband and..Voila! good as new.I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a good sound quality without breaking the bank. Only thing is that, although these are over the ear headphones, if you are looking for something that completely isolates the environment around you I would go for a pair of Noise Canceling headphones. These do an "okay" job just because of the over the ear design, but its not enough to really isolate your music.if you are on the fence about getting them, just do it. you will not regret it

VI've had these headphones for a couple years now.  I can listen to music at work, so I have these headphones on for many hours a day.  I was looking for a good sounding set of headphones that didn't have a lot, or any noise leakage.For the price, they are an amazing value.  They sound very good.  The bass sometimes blows me away.  I love bass, and these do not disappoint.  They have basically no noise leakage.  They can make the ears hot, and can sometimes be uncomfortable.  But, remember that I'm also sometimes wearing these for seven to nine hours a day.  They have a very long cord with a plastic piece you can wrap up extra cord.  It's not a flat anti-tangling cord, but they don't tangle all that bad.  They don't look very good.  I just bought a pair of headphones from another company on sale because I was hoping to find a decent pair that looked a little better.  They leak way too much noise and didn't sound as good, even though they often sell for twice the price.If you are on the fence, I'd say give these a try.  At this price range you can probably take the hit if they aren't everything you were hoping for.  I know when I bought them I was looking at several pairs on Amazon.  They had the most reviews, and so many were positive I thought it seemed like a good bet.  I was not disappointed.

VI got these headphones a little over six weeks ago, and they've been amazing. I've never bought anything else from Sennheiser before, but I'll certainly buy more now. I decided to buy them after looking over Sony, Sennheiser, and V-Moda headphones; these seemed to have the best bang for the buck.In terms of musical quality, these are better than I'd expect for $30. I'm one of those guys that really likes a pounding bass, and these certainly give you that--though not at first. For the first day I had them I thought they were lacking in the lows, but after I left them playing at full volume overnight, they're really great. Plenty of boom. The highs are clear, and I've got nothing to complain about in the mids.They're also pretty comfortable. They will sometimes feel a little tight around the ears if I wear them for more than two or three hours, but not always. The way the headband doesn't change and the speakers move up and down is also nice, because I don't have to worry about the headband getting stressed and breaking.All in all, I give it a solid 4/5. I can conceive of a better pair of headphones and, like I said, they do occasionally get a little irritating after prolonged listening, but those are minor complaints. I have highly recommended them to all my friends.

VMy husband bought these for me several years ago. They fit me well and are adjustable and comfortable. When my kids kept breaking ear buds or sony brand over the ear headphones, I decided to spend about the same amount of money or slightly more and get these headphones for my kids (girls aged 8 and 14) as well. So far, so good! Not only does the performance beat a lot of the more popular brands out there, they don't really break easily. As an added bonus, you can also purchase replacement parts directly from Sennheiser, such as the earphone holder or replacement ear cushions as these things can wear out long before the mechanical parts do. My husband has a more expensive pair (  Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones  ) that he has had for over 10 years that still work, and he uses them all the time, at home and at work. I wouldn't buy any other brand.Edited 3-11-2014I am going to have to modify my review of these headphones. I bought 2 pairs of these, just over a year ago, for my daughters. Both of them have the same problem. They can only hear sound out of one side. My older one uses hers a lot, and my younger one uses hers occasionally. I am very disappointed, as I have always had the best of luck with Sennheiser. I would buy the brand again, but certainly not this model.

VThe first thing you need to know about these headphones is that if you have a regular sized head these headphones are going to hurt. They fit my head really tightly when I first got them and I had to take them off and massage my ears. BUT it is worth it after 2 weeks they will loosen up and fit your head comfortably. I read from an official representative of the company that they made them have a tight fit so they can loosen up to fit your head. You pretty much have to break in into these headphones like shoes. My favorite thing about these headphones is the noise cancellation, I had a roommate who was always on the phone and with these headphones I could not hear her at all and without music playing her voice was still significantly muffled. She would often have to wave her arms to get my attention cause I couldn't hear her calling my name. These headphones have good sound the only complaint I have is I wish the treble was a little louder. Also some claim these headphones have sound leakage but they really don't, when you don't have them on they have major sound leakage but the second they're on your ears there is practically none. if you can get through breaking them in its a decent buy. I wouldn't recommend them to a friend just because I don't think they will be willing to break them in.

VI have owned 2 pairs of Sennheiser headphones, and these have extremely good sound quality for how cheap they are. The HD 201's do not sound quite as good, but that's probably because they are $20.PROS:Sound quality: Good level of highs, mids, and lows. Very deep bass and these actually drown out a lot of outside noise. I was surprised at how much noise they cancelled. Much better than the 201's.Design: Made for mid to small ears. There's also a cushion at the top and the ears cushions are just enough padding. Sometimes I forget I have them on.Price: Outstanding price for how good they sound. They aren't your Bose or Beats by Dre but what do you expect! Great for the price.CONS:Chord length: WAY TOO LONG!! These must be made to watch TV because the chord is about 10 feet long and I didn't realize until I unwrapped the chord. I use them on the computer so I only need about 3 feet.Comfort: After about an hour they start to hurt my ears, I don't know about anyone else but if I wear them for a long time I have to shift them around.Overall I am very impressed at how good they sound and the noise cancellation is really good. It comes with a plastic device to wrap excess cable up. Good product Germany!

VThe best for daily use...
p2822
sg5
VI use these almost everyday. I bought these based on the multitude of other great reviews on amazon and have not had much experience with other headphones at all. Nevertheless...CON-- The cord is very long (multiple feet!) but this comes with a spool to wrap the wire around. The foam is very nice and cup my normal/mid-size ears well.-- After a while my ears do get warm (borderline uncomfortable for me) and I have to take a break-- No L-shape connector, wears down faster than the rest of the headphones-- Moderate cord noise (?) when brushing up against other objects.Now, with the bad stuff out of the way...PRO-- These are made from high quality, durable plastic. I have run over the cord multiple times accidentally fallen on these without them even showing as much as a scratch.-- The earcups are adjustable connected to the main band by a sphere of dense plastic.NOTES-- These do a good job at drowning out outside noise, however these are not meant for total sound isolation and the sound will leak from these starting at moderately high volumes.-- Not super portable (ex. for running, car and train rides.) Just nope. Cord too long.

p2828
sg5
VI purchased the first model of these in July 2010 and used them daily\u2014until November 2013 when the left phone stopped working. I used them mostly for Netflix viewing and music listening via iTunes and Pandora. I'm not an audio professional, so I can't really comment on sound quality, but I thought they sounded pretty great. And they're not half bad at cancelling noise either. Sometimes, if I was trying to concentrate on a project, I'd put them on and just use them to block out noise (without playing any music). They're also very comfortable. I had no problem wearing them for multiple-hour Netflix binge-a-thons. In terms of sound leakage, I wore them in public often (in quiet spaces such as libraries, classrooms, coffee shops, etc.) and never had a problem with anyone complaining that they could hear what I was listening to.The only downside is the cord. It's very long, which I found a little annoying. But if you use the cord wrapper, it's not too much of a problem. I would definitely recommend these for the casual listener or for anyone who needs a comfortable pair of phones for extended wearing. I'd buy another pair myself, but I think I'm going to invest in something a little higher-end in the hopes that it'll last longer than three years.

VI am in love with these headphones. They are perfect for an audiophile on a very limited budget (and is not some weird form of music hipster). They give amazing sound, the circumaural design cuts out lots of ambient noise and puts you in a world of clear, beautiful music. They are a little uncomfortable after a few hours of wearing them (4+ hours for me) and they are difficult to lay down and listen to music with. But I have no complaints about the audio quality and overall they are not so uncomfortable I have to take them off. I've worn them for about 12 hours straight and wasn't bothered much. If I had smaller ears it probably wouldn't bother me at all.When I put these babies on, the world stops existing and it's just me and my flac files.If you have been using generics the sound quality will BLOW your mind. Of course, if you're listening to a bunch of low quality MP3's (like an idevice will down-convert your music to for compression) there's no point in getting them except exceptional cost-effectiveness. $20 at wallyworld for some crudders, or $25 on amazon for awesome.If you are looking for something for binaural tones, these don't have the nessicary range for complete effectiveness but they still can have that functionality.

VI think the Sennheiser HD 202s are a good buy. Unfortunately, they are hard to come by because the HD 202 II and the HD 203 is all Sennheiser sells right now. But, these are well designed headphones. They have good sound quality and equalization (without an equalizer) and smooth bass. The Germans who make these really know how to produce good and cheap headphones.PROS-The cups are very comfortable on most people's ears.These are DJ headphones, so the speakers come off the design easily (but stay on when you want them to).The headband is unbreakableThe entire headset is durable and small, so it is easy to carry, even if they don't fold flat.If you take away the headband, they fold flat.CONS-I have to keep these out of the reach of my friend. He wants them so bad.MY RECOMMENDATION-If you are looking for a good pair of dirt-cheap Sennheisers, get these. If you are willing to spend a few more dollars get:$100-200: Sennheiser HD 518  Sennheiser HD 558$200-300: Sennheiser HD 598  Bose QuietComfort 15$300-500: Sennheiser HD 600  Sennheiser HD 650$1000:  Sennheiser HD 700$1500:  Sennheiser HD 800 (The Lamborghini of Headphones)

VAt one time I bought a pair of those $10 on-the-ear cheap headphone for use with my tablet. My son currently does not have internet access in his apartment, so he comes over to my place to get his fix. In order to not bother me while he is on my PC he was using those cheap headphones, but said they really hurt his ears after a while. I didn't particularly like them myself. So I did a lot of research and settle on these as a replacement. Sennheiser has always been a big name in audio, and these headphones continue the tradition. For less than three times what I paid for the very cheap phones, I got a set of very comfortable, very responsive, magnificent headphones. My son loves them, and I do too. They have a very long cord, but do include a very nice cord keeper to coil up the excess you don't need in a nice little bundle. I know some reviewers knock them as not 'audiophile grade', but they are a very good buy for money for someone whose ear is less discriminating. Also, they don't bleed out. I am usually across the room from my son when he is using them to watch a movie or whatever, and I have yet to hear anything leaking out. Not all phones, even ones more expensive than these, can say that. I definitely made a wise choice.

VI love music, and listen to it regularly. I'm not an "audiophile" in the sense that I've bought a lot of different products, but I love music, attend concerts, and the like. So I've been looking into "nice" headphones for a while, and regularly stop into the Apple store to try the Dr. Dre, Bose, Skullcandy, etc. headphones that they have on display. After looking at reviews here and at head-fi.org, I decided to go for these since they were only $20 bucks.I am not disappointed at all with the sound quality. They sound at least as good as the Dr. Dre, Bose and Skullcandy (aviator model) headphones (without noise canceling. I tried songs at 128kbps - 256 kbps, and all sounded good (obviously the 256 was the best). Save yourself the $280 bucks and from looking like a weiner by wearing trendy headphones that don't sound any better.The only complaint I have is that they are pretty tight on my large head. I am an XL head, and they're a little tight for my comfort. Also, the cord is the length of a football field. It comes with a thing to wrap it around, but whatever. I'm not jogging with them on, so i don't care if it has a bundle of wound extra cord. Heck, it might even come in handy. Otherwise, very pleased.

VI bought these supra-aural headphones as a replacement for my Klipsch Image S4's. Let me just say that first of all, the price point is much, much better. I did not burn these headphones in with pink noise, white noise, or any other form of burn-in audio. I simply began pumping my music through them right away. In my opinion, for $20 headphones, they don't need it.Now, lets get into the performance.Pros:- Comfortable to wear for long spans of time- Crystal clear highs, excellent and strong lows.- Frequency response is ok, 18 - 18000 Hz.- Somewhat noise-isolating- Better than earbuds, especially Apple and Skullcandy; up there in audio quality with Klipsch.Cons:- Cheap plastic construction- Supra-aural headphones- Not noise-cancellingIn general, if you're looking for a good pair of headphones while not trying to break the budget, these are the best choice. HD 202 II's are a great choice. Since they're only $20, give them a try, and play the music you'll listen to most. Remember - just because they're popular with mainstream media and the mainstream population (Beats) doesn't mean they're the best buy for your buck.

p2900

VThese Sennheisers are LOUD and they never lose quality, even at max volume (which, I HIGHLY recommend that you don't listen to for more than 3 minutes.). I keep these at roughly 12% volume on my laptop, and it's very clear, and loud enough. You shouldn't put them more than 50% on a laptop (then again, depends on your laptop, but at 50% for my laptop, these are VERY loud). I'm not an audiophile, but I can tell these are very clear, and can play very nice highs and lows at the same time (the bass shakes your ears at loud volumes). The voice sounds like the actual person singing. I bought them for $24, and these are the best headphones I have ever heard.A couple of other comments:They are comfortable for 3-4 hours, and after that, if you have glasses, they hurt a bit, but you get used to them.These will NOT output max volume on an MP3, you need a laptop or a computer to produce the max volume and clarity. Some mp3s are better than others. I have found that Ipods are the best, in that they produce more volume than other MP3s without losing clarity. All of the MP3 players that I have tested, however, will output more than 90db, or more than what you're supposed to listen to headphones at anyways.

p2906
sg5
VThe sound is great. It eliminates outside noise, and the bass is impeccable. But here's my problem. I bought my first pair of these back in January, 2015. About 2 months later, the wire ripped on me. The wire is 9 feet long. It's not 3 feet, it's 3 meters - Which is about 9 feet, for those of you non-Europeans like me who misread that accidentally. So I bought another pair about 2 weeks ago. The wire just ripped on me again on the left side. The result of both of these cases was that one ear worked and not the other. The wire is as cheap as they come. And way too long. The cause of the ripped wire is that I wore them very frequently because I am a musician and I'm coming out with a new album soon. Or I was. It was set for April 30th, but now it will get pushed back more, because I am now without a pair of headphones once again for any further post-production. 2 stars because of the sound quality, otherwise I would have made it 1 star, because of the cheap 9 foot wire. So if your a music-addict like me, and you tune out to your music very frequently, I would say don't buy these due to the fact that the wire is just very fragile and extremely long. Otherwise, there pretty good sounding. Hope this helps.

VIn the past I had a set of basic Sony headphones, and decided to give Sennheiser a try one day.  So I bought HD 202, it they sounded like night and day, so that was the last Sony item I owned when it comes to headphones.  For the money, you simply cannot even compare them, quality and detail is amazing.Doing sound mixing at my church, I have bought several different Sennheiser headphones, and used anything from 202 model to professional level sets.  By the way, calling these professional means nothing really, just a marketing touch.  At some point I auditioned several sets side to side, and they all sounded different.  The price may not reflect what sound better to you, but if you are looking for details in critical listening like recording and mixing, spend a bit more.The HD 202 model is really intended for casual listening, and after about an hour your ears may start hurting simply from the pressure headphones create while worn.  They do sound amazing for the money, and isolate surrounding noise rather well.  I would strongly recommend this set to someone who may need to listen to music at work from time to time, or travels and does not want to worry in case it gets damaged or lost.

VFor the price I paid, these are a 9.5.  I had a pair of Logitech $20 headphones before this.  They finally broke after 2-3 years of use at work.  Although they did the job, they were really pretty bad.  They were uncomfortable, the foam padding fell off pretty quickly, the mic was crap, they felt cheap and flimsy, the sound was pretty bad, and they were USB.  The USB is actually what went out on me.Now, compare this to the new Sennheiser HD202's I just bought.  They are solid feeling, the padding on the ear pieces are faux leather, there is a pretty thick pad that sits on your head, they sound amazing(for the price I paid), super long cord, and they are fairly comfortable on your head.The downside is that they ear cups are not that comfortable, but not that bad either.Bass is much more responsive than I imagined they would beTreble is crispy, but not too crispyThese things are pretty amazing for the price.  I'm just using them at work to listen to VODs, hear the occasional song or two, etc...so this is more than enough for my work needs.  If you are looking for the cheapest headphones you can find(like me) that actually sound and feel decent, these are the ones.

VI wanted a good quality set of over the ear headphones to help drown out the white noise caused by the constant chattering of the people I sit near at my work.  These do the job perfectly.  I can now sit blissfully knowing that the only sounds I will hear for the next 8 hours will consist of a constant stream of death metal (the only proper music to drown others out with, IMO).  Now on to the meat and potatoes of this headset.  The sound is great for low/mid range priced headphones.  In addition to using them at work, I also use them to mix some personal (crappy) music at home, and again, these do a great job.  The construction is a bit on the cheap side, but that was expected for the price.  So I tend to try and be a bit careful with them.  Like other reviews, the ear cups are a bit on the small size.  They just fit my head/ears.  I'd say I probably have an average head/ear size, but if you think at all that you have big ears you may want to find a different set.  Going and trying some on isn't a bad idea either.  The cord is SUPER long, but the included cord wrapper makes up for that.  I would certainly recommend these to anyone wanting to not pay a ton for quality sounding headphones.

VGreat Entry Level Headphones
p2969
sg5
VIf you are looking for a good pair of headphones without breaking your wallet, these are a great option. Sennheiser is known to produce quality headphones, and these definitely fit the stereotype. The sound quality is impressive, especially for the low price tag here on Amazon of around $20.The HD 202 headphones have a good sound to them and don't seem to lose much quality. The mid and high range sounds sound very clean and crisp and don't seem to distort, even when the volume is raised a little. They even seem to cover bass fairly well, although it isn't as strong as some headphones.The ear pieces are very comfortable, as well as the top portion, as they are all cushioned and padded well.  They also cut outside noise out fairly well, although it is not full noise reduction. The extended cord is a huge plus, allowing for a larger range of movement, ideally if you were in studio or recording audio. They are great headphones for studio work if you are just starting off or are a little strapped for cash.Overall, these headphones are well worth the price and are worth buying if you are just starting off or looking to save a little money for other, more important equipment.

VI bought these to take on a upcoming trip to use with my android phone, that doubles as my mutimedia device. The earbuds I have are lacking. I am very impressed with the sound quality when I plug into my phone. Do I dare say, it's revitilized my interest in some music? Hopefully they're decent on an airplane. I know, strong statement for a $25 pair of headphones, but they really do blow my earbuds out of the water. Solid lows, strong highs, and like I read in another review I can hear things I don't usally hear.That all being said, the reason for the four star is that when I plugged in to my home stereo last night, they didn't have the same effect. No matter what I did with the system itself, the sound was muddy and much lower. I even fooled with the connection. I have a pair of old wireless Sennheiser headphones, which of course, were more expensive that I normally use with the stereo and they sound way better. Even though sometimes the reception blows with them and you can't move your head very much.Other than that, fabulous for what I bought them for which is for my personal device. I'll try to update after using on an airplane in a month or so.

VA lot of headphone for not a lot of money
p2987
sg5
VBought these because my recently acquired puppy has a bad habit of eating earbuds. I'm nearing 70 years old and live in a house with very poor acoustics, so if I'm going to get anywhere near the joy out of music that I have had my whole life, some kind of headphones are absolutely necessary. Until these arrived, I figured earbuds were the way to go for both comfort, isolation and sound quality good enough for my aging ears. Was I ever wrong. These are very lightweight and comfortable when adjusted correctly on the headband. Misadjusted, they are pretty uncomfortable, but they slide pretty easily on the headband. But the sound quality is amazing, even to my tired old ears. Clean, deep bass, clear midrange and highs make them a joy to listen to. And the isolation is excellent. Haven't used Sennheisers since I was doing radio back in the early 70s. Seems like that might have been a bad move as I am truly loving these. Feel like my ears have reverted to my teenage years with these, and they cost as near to nothing as you can get. I am extremely happy with these headphones, and the dog doesn't seem interested in eating them, which makes them pretty much perfect for me. :)

p2993

VYou get more of what you pay for, but they will not last forever.Just like those normal earphones, these ones die within a year or two. However, Sennheiser's warranty ensures you'll get a one time replacement as long as it dies on the year before the warranty ends.Comfort-wise, these headphones can't last for about 2 or more hours without hurting your ear.Sound-wise, its as good as a gaming headphone, but not as good as an expensive one. In other words, if you want a budget gaming headphone then get this, if you want a somewhat hardcore, high quality headphones for audiophiles then this one is not for you.My headphones died in a year, I had it replaced and it lived for about 2-3 more years and it died today. I was actually thinking if I should buy the same headphone because I really liked how it sounds. I also don't like to spend too much money on things that doesn't last forever a.k.a headphones. Every headphones die, its just a matter of time when that tiny wire inside that cord snaps and one of the sides don't work.TL:DR - POOR? Need a decent headphones? Get this. Rich? Need a decent headphone? Get this

VThis is an excellent pair of headphones for the money. I have a pair at the office and also at home. I can count on these to deliver great bass and overall sound quality for the casual listening that I do either while working at the office or working out at home. They are comfortable around my (large) head. They fit comfortably all around the ear and block outside noise as good as a cheap pair of noise-cancelling headphones. The cord is extra long so you can move about your workspace without pulling on the headphone jack. I have used them on airplane rides, and they are much better than a pair of little ear-bud headphones, though you will still hear some engine noise. If I workout with these, my ears will get sweaty but I find this happens with any pair of closed-ear headphones. I expect years of use out of these; a similar pair of HD203's lasted me several years until I started losing one channel due to a loose wire at the 3.5mm plug. I think this happened due to normal wear & tear such as pulling on the cord accidentally over time, rather than due to any defect in the product. For the price, I threw those out and got a new pair of HD202s. Can't beat them!

VThese headphones don't hold a shadow to my Audio Technica ATH-M50 studio 'phones.  These headphones also came $130 cheaper.  So long as they remain at their current $20 pricepoint, they're the best headphones for the money you can buy.  This is also probably true at their normal price of $60.Only reason they're not rated 5-star is that there are several $150+ headphones that have better audio fidelity, but don't let this discourage you from purchasing these.  I'm no true audiophile, but Seinnheiser is no slouch when it comes to headphones, even when it comes to 'phones priced for the masses.  If you want exacting, excellent headphones of unmatched quality, these won't do it for you, but if you just want a good, solid, awesome pair of headphones for everyday use (ideally MP3 player), then these fit the bill, and most excellently so.  I cannot stress the value of these headphones in comparison to their sonic fidelity enough.  For <$20, best headphones you can buy, period.  For <$60, still probably the best.  Anything over $100 and you're creeping into audiophile range, but these will hold you over until you find the headphones that are 'just right'.

VI thought that with all the positive reviews about this product the bass would have been better.I turn the whole volume up on this headphone and I was hoping for a stronger bass.I try my computer my phone and a radio, the only difference was on the radio it seem louder but still lacking bass.The one good thing I can say about this headphone is that they are pretty good for gaming sounds it seems to do a very good job at it, So that kind of redeems the product for me.This brand had a good rep in the past so I though I was going to get similar bass to the px100 or maybe even better but I was wrong.Oh some people may find themselves with  overheated ears, they do get warm so if you live in cold climate that's a plus if not you will be taking them off quite often.Well to summarize considering the price I should give them a four instead of three stars, but sound was not as great. In gaming sound I give it four stars.The cord is pretty long so that's 5 star, plus it has a bigger connection for other audio devices such as a receiver.I can't quite recommend this product highly but is good enough, for gaming sound and most music not hip hop.

p3034
sg5
VIt took me some time to review these. They were my first pair of Sennheiser headphones, my introduction to the famous German brand. Let me tell you that at the time of my purchase, they were definitely the best headphones I had ever used. The bass was powerful, but not overwhelmingly powerful, just perfect. It took some time for me to get used to the ear cups, the first hour can be painful, but they adjust pretty well after a few sessions.The sound quality is well above the average, the highs are crisp and clear, the lows are powerful. The construction, like many have claimed, is cheap, but thanks to that they are very resistant to pretty much anything. I've dropped them quite a few times, and they have endured. The feature of removing the ear cups from the headband is just great, perfect. This allows me to disassemble them and store them using as little space as possible. The chord holder is great; 3m of cable on the go is a though one, but with the holder it won't be a problem.These are standard headphones, with Sennheiser quality. Great for a gift, for personal home or on-the-go use. And for the price, a bargain!

VI seldom feel motivated to review products since I'm buying something from Amazon all the time, but I thought I would share my thoughts on these headphones. For background, I've done podcasting and love music and have tried different headphones and currently own the Sennheiser HD 650's which are excellent.The 650's have beautifully balanced sound, rich bass, the treble never goes tinny. They're comfortable. Lovely.Here's a secret: the Sennheiser HD 202's are nearly as good at a fraction of the price. Nice, strong bass that is favorable to modern rap and R&B.; But the tone at the higher end is still smooth. No tin.I got these for my son to wear on the bus and to use around the house. At the price, I won't cry if they get banged up, but what a pleasant surprise that the sound is so fantastic. The cans are comfortable. The headphones rest easy on the head and are nicely adjustable.My son has no idea of the price and I'm not going to tell him. My daughter who has Beats was shocked and feels that the sound is better on these. That's only a $150 savings.Buy these! You won't regret it.

VThese absolutely rock! Especially good if you're a fan or creator of any genre that involves nuances of bass or drums. (As a matter of fact, to illustrate just how good these are, I recommend looking up a Yoshiki drum solo or a Mike Portnoy drum solo.)Did I mention being a creator? If you're an electronic music artist, these headphones will definitely increase the quality of your work because you will be able to hear it in MUCH better quality than cheap headphones. I used to buy $4-10 headphones because they were all I could afford and because I was like "what difference could they really make aside from noise cancelling"... these make SO much of a difference.Only thing I would say negative is make sure they're 60% off again before you buy - that was the only way I was able to afford such great headphones :) That and you will make use of the cord clip if you're a laptop user actually working on the laptop - cord, unclipped, is a bit long for the distance between laptop and head usually. That said it's perfect length if you need to plug it into something further away from your head or if you need to have your laptop further away.

VThe below is a review from my son:I bought this pair of headphones looking for a pair that would have better sound quality than just apple earbuds or other similar products.  I was very surprised when I found out that I got far more than I was looking for.  I am an avid dubstep listener, but ever since I got these headphones I havent been able to listen to my dubstep with anything but these headphones.  They can blast the bass and they do very well in making it so I cannot hear outside noise.  I could sit and listen for hours and they would still be quite comfortable on my head, and I do have a fairly large head.  It is a bit weird at first with the orientation of the headband, it forces you to wear them farther forward on your head than other headphones do, but you get used to it quickly. One thing is that after about four months of use, the left ear cup did stop working, however I do believe that it was no fault of the product.  Overall the Sennheiser HD 202s are definitely a pair of headphones that you get more than your moneys worth out of, and one that I would recommend to anybody looking to get a banging new pair of headphones for a wonderfully low price.

p3080
sg5
VIt is good but NOT perfect, at least for my head/ear combination.1)The headphones are comfortable and soft but the ear cup material is not very breathable so you sweat which is easy enough to ignore.2) Another MAJOR problem wrt to fit is sound quality. When on my ears, these headphones sound like crap. Really, crap. They sound shallow with little bass or bass that rattles in a distorted way.Only when I PRESS the cups down on my ears with my hands, the quality of sound is heard, ie,  bass increases dramatically. It's a total disappointment that  in order to hear 'quality music', I need both arms occupied pressing the cups to my ears.3) Due to the relatively high ohm resistance of these headphones, they lack volume. With a Samsung tab2, raising the volume to max is often not loud enough.In summary, these headphones are not the best suited for me. (Your experience may be different.) They sound good when I press the cups to my ears but otherwise are not worth my time.  I would not be buying this again and will aim for a lower resistance headphones from Sennheiser. (Yes, I WILL buy sennheiser again.)

I always feel good when I get an e-mail from Amazon letting me know one of my reviews or suggestions helped somebody else out. We really are all in this together. THANX! One last, and most important, comment about these headphones...the SOUND. That is why we buy headphones, isn't it? They really do sound great, and this is coming from a guy who owned 2700+ albums (when c/d's came along) and over 3,000 c/d's before I bought mp3 players. The greatest thing to me about mp3 players is the ability to copy or download ONLY the songs worth listening to. i am now up to over 900 songs and just keep going. If these headphones did not reproduce sound accurately, I wouldn't own them! you will love them. Again, THANX!. Tim Drain.

VGood Stuff... I own 2. The Sennheiser 202s are good as far as being professional headphones ...umm..No. Now that is settled, lets go.  The price for these phones are incredible. The Sennheiser 202's sound great. They have a long cord, ergonomically fit yet adjustable.  Durability I stepped on them 2 times the muffs fell off. I just simply clicked them back on again. The bad thing is I did blow these phones and the cord did give way after 1 years use. A positive of experience is I would rather destroy 20 dollar phones than the $60 plus range ones.  Use these phones for ,your laptop(the reason I bought them in the first place), uncool jogging, Ipods and stereo if your running around 50 watts RMS (that's an opinion rating).Every once in a while a product comes along that breaks but is well worth replacing because of the usage and owner satisfaction.  These fall in that category. In electronics you get what you pay for...The Sennheiser 202's break that mold slightly.  Your looking for a headphone and only got $25 buy the Sennheiser 202's but you may have to replace them some day.

VThe Sennheiser HD 202 ll headphones are a great deal. When you first open the package you will think that they are cheap because of the plastic feel, but do not let that fool you they are a quality product. I find them to be quite comfortable to wear at extended lengths. I do have a fairly large head and the HD 202's flex perfectly to fit. They are snug, but they are supposed to be, that is how you get such a great sound and block out the ambient noise. Not only do I wear these for listening to music but during video editing as well which can take hours to do. The cushioning on these are remarkable for the price, very soft and pliable. The sound that they put out is crisp and clear. Yes there is a bit of bass in them but you can usually adjust your EQ setting to compensate for that. I like having the 10 foot cable, it is just long enough to give you room to move around with out any hassle. They include a wind up belt clip for those who do not want so much cable dangling freely. Over all I love these headphones you get awesome quality for the price you pay.  I am thinking of getting another pair.

VI purchased for watching movies using my iTouch and iPad during travel.  While they are not noise reducing, the fit is very nice and keeps most outside disruptions out.What I liked:--Inexpensive for over the ear headphones ($45 in Feb 2011).--Good sound (I am not an audiophile) and these worked fine for my music and movie rentals.--Good fit and very comfortable over ears and on top of head.--Decent recreation of sound that didn't require volume on 10!What I disliked:--They don't fold up for easy storage - but I knew that going into the purchase.--Jury is still out on quality since I have only used them 5 times - no worries yet.Bottom Line:  Worked exceptionally well for my needs.  I needed some noise reduction and they kept out disruptions.  I wanted something comfortable and they were exceptional.  I wanted decent sound so I didn't have to turn the iTouch and iPad to their highest volume setting.  I wanted a over the ear that fit my budget and this fit the bill.  Overall, a great product for the money keeping in mind the primary use.  Would give 4.5 stars if I could.

VI've owned audio technica headphones, Behringer and stanton all costing me 50 dollars or more, each one broke.I bought these headphones expecting less or average quality, I was amazed with the sound clarity including bass when listening to my old productions. These are def good headphones for music making and for the record nobody masters there music with headphones, But with these you possibly could, The beats sound as they do without headphones, I love them.The best part about these headphones is the bass, I can now edit bass in my beats without turning my subs all the way up. These are good.The only thing I dont like is the cords on each side of the speakers, Plus the ear pieces are made for small to medium size ears if you have big ears or a big head these aint for you. I contemplated alot between these and the hd 201 or whatever, But I heard these were better with bass and they sure are. Im still listening to these right now and there good now i can produce some music.If i have problems I will return them but so far so good, Thanks and fast shipping, took 3 days!

VThese headphones are just bafflingly bad. The cups that go over your ears are tiny, smashing your outer earlobe, and the tension between the ears is so tight that the headphones leave marks and give you a squeezy headache. Trying to wear glasses at the same time makes it even worse. No, the problem is not with my head or ears. I am a smallish woman with a smallish head. If these headphones are way too small for me, who are they designed to fit? A child? Also, they came wrapped in some of the absolute worst welded-shut-clamshell plastic packaging I have ever seen in my life. It took me ten minutes to get into the package, ruining a pair of scissors in the process, and nearly ruining my hands and the headphones, too. And now I can't even return the stupid headphones, because the package is a pile of shredded, bloodstained plastic shards. Save yourself the trouble and do what I should have done: Get a new pair of the Sennheiser HD201 headphones that served me well for years before finally wearing out.On the plus side, I guess the sound quality is good, considering the price.

VA while back I bought a 75 dollar pair of behringer headphones for my music production with fruityloops 7, They broke fairly easy and after that I vowed to not only not buy expensive headphones but to take care of them and put them away after each use..I bought these after much anticipation and that was almost 7 months ago, these headphones still sound great, The bass is powerful and the sounds are good.Although I produce I'm not 100% knowledable in the db field, I dont know what audio levels these should be if your trying to produce soley on headphones but if your just listening to music these are great, the sound pumps especially for dance music.Did I mention I have less hearing in my left ear due to swimmers ear as a child?Well these fix that problem because it sounds the same on both ends of my head.Point is for 25 bucks you really cant go wrong, These are durable and will do you well, They also offer a previous version that is more lightweight than these and sound just as goodyou cant go wrong with this brand.

VI am very happy with these headphones. For the price I believe that they are the best that can be had. I have tried several other headphones for this price range, and these are my favorites. Here is a rundown:Pros:- very comfortable- excessively long cable- clear sound- sound can get very loudCons:- excessively long cable (depends how you view this feature)- cable comes from both ear pieces (I'm comparing this to the skullcandy hesh which only has the cable from one ear piece and significantly reduces clutter).Basically they are really really good despite the long cluttery cable. But that is something that can be ignored. They have to 3 most important features for me which are: comfort, loudness and clarity, and at this price range they simply cannot be beat.BTW, I have also tried the hd 201 headphones, and whilst they were also good their drawback was that they didn't get very loud. These headphones improve on that and can get loud if needed. So I would definitely recommend these over the 201s.

VMixed Bag
p3155
sg5
VThese headphones are truly a mixed bag, having very powerful sound output (esp. the bass) without having to set volume high; but, as numerous other reviewers have noted, they are not comfortable (at least on my average-size head).  While the bass output is quite impressive for such relatively-small headphones, the treble and mid-range sounded to me somewhat murky, not crisp.  Their biggest positive is definitely the level of sound produced; their biggest negative is that they are narrow in fit, especially noticeable if worn longer than 30-40 minutes.  They don't offer much capacity for shape adjustment, and though the padding on top is soft, they felt as if they were squeezing my ears and created an inordinate amount of body heat (if worn longer than 30 min.).  Maybe it's just an individual issue of user's head shape, but I could not give them more than 3 stars for the lack of comfort alone.  For sound output apart from comfort level, they'd merit 4.5 stars.  The price I paid (less than $25 frt-free) was terrific; I ended up giving them to my son (who loves the bass thump!).

VMuddy bass
p3167
sg5
VThese might be "ideal for DJ's..." but no "audio pro" will be satisfied with the frequency response.  Sennheiser lists the range as 18-18,000 (-3 db from 1 Khz), but they roll off fairly quickly below 50 Hz and above 12,000 Hz.  There is also a bump around 100 Hz which, coupled with the roll off, muddles the bass.  I believe the technical term is "boomey".That said, these headphones are still a pretty good value.  They are very efficient (Sennheiser is known for this), sound better than most all headphones in this price range and are reasonably comfortable.  The cushions actually rest ON your ears instead of around them.  This isolates ambient noise fairly well, but you will need to take these off and give the earlobes a rest periodically.I bought these for the "talent" in the recording studio.  They are perfectly suited for that purpose.  They are tough enough to take some abuse and sound good enough for the musicians to stay with the playback.  Don't bother using these for mixdown.  For that, spring for the HD 280 and a decent set of near-field monitors.

VGreat Sound, Not Great Comfort
p3172
sg5
VThe good:-great sound-noise cancelling-nice bassThe bad:-tight on the head-really long cordThese are the best-sounding headphones I have found in this price range.  I really like bass in my headphones, and these are the best I've found for that.  Compared with the standard Sennheisers, there is a noticeable difference in the low end.However...the fact that they are noise cancelling means that they cup tightly around your ears.  I don't know if I'm a weirdo or something, but the tight fit gives me a headache.  I really want to like these headphones because I like the sound, but ultimately if they aren't comfortable, I can't wear them.One other thing - I read some reviews complaining about the cord.  Since these are "professional" headphones, they have a really long cord.  Bottom line is that it's annoying.  There is the wind up belt for the extra cord and while it's kind of nice to have the option, in reality, 90% of the time I wish the chord was just a standard length.  The fact that these are meant for a DJ also contributes to the earpiece design.

VI was looking for a decent pair of headphones for some general-purpose audio needs both at home and at work, and I read the reviews here and elsewhere, which all seemed to be favorable. So, I added them onto my Christmas wishlist as a cheaper alternative to the Bose I really wanted, even sight-unseen. Indeed I got them instead of the Bose, and for the money they're very, very nice! Ran some Coltrane through 'em and I could really hear a lot -- so much more than my earbuds and other $10 bargain store headphones. Much closer to the higher-end Audio Technica studio headphones I have for more serious work.Some of the commonly stated concerns in the reviews here are indeed things I've picked up on, but they do sound great and block out enough ambient noise to give you a nice listening experience. And they're reasonably comfortable. Kinda wish they had a volume knob of some sort, but that's being super nit-picky. There's no reason not to buy these, especially if you don't have a ton of money to spend. I'll probably buy another pair to take to work. They're that good!

VI have many different options for pushing sound to my ears: open-ear headphones, closed-ear headphones, noise-blocking earbuds, and normal Apple earpods. These are the ones which I recommend to people who only have the earbuds that came with their phone, and they want something that sounds good. Most of the time, these people are price-conscious, which means that anything I'd recommend with three digits in their price is right-out.For the roughly-$25 price tag of these, you're getting good overall performance on all counts. Decent bass, as long as you're not exclusively looking for that booming sound, and decent everywhere else. The big thing here is that, compared to just about any earbud or "comes with device" option, you are getting something that is decisively better, and at a price that many people are willing to get just to try.One thing to keep in mind: this set of headphones comes with a very long, 10' cord. So long, that it comes with a cord holder which you will use if you want to be portable with these headphones.

VThese headphones have a very good, flat response across a very wide frequency range. Bass was surprisingly good. Of course, this is based on the price. These are not noise canceling headphones and they do not pretend to be high-end Bose headphones. However, they work very well for as little money as you have in them. They do not fold up, but are very light weight and small enough that they seemed to work well in the top of a backpack on a recent overseas flight. Ear pads and head band are both reasonably comfortable. The cord is very long. However, they come with a simple device for wrapping up and controlling the cord that works pretty well. They also came with an adapter that allows this unit to be used in stereo equipment or on guitar amps, as well as laptops, portable CD players and ipods. The best part....all this is accomplished without having to stuff "earbuds" in your ear! This allows for long-term listening with out the long-term discomfort. These provide a very nice alternative to earbuds, which is the primary competition in this price range.

VTHese headphones are GREAT! As a dubstep lover, I found that the bass produced by these headphones is excellent. Compared to my skull(?) earbuds, this is godly. I usually use my x11s as  the headset for listening to music while on my computer but these are better. I can hear and feel MORE BASS. I dont understand why in other reviews people say that there is too much bass coming from these but TBH i think there should be MORE BASS. Yes these headphones are noise cancelling but i dont like the fact that other people can basically hear what i'm listening to. I listen to dubstep/electric type music and people from where i live only like to rap and hip hop etc. I want to listen to Dubstep on MAX volumne like i do at home but unfortunatly i wont be able to on the bus or in public really. lol O WELL. Also i find these headphones to be quite confortable around my head but i began to feel a bit discomfort when i put my glasses on (because of the plastic of glasses being behind your ears and all etc etc.) For 30$ this is an excellent buy. Highly recommended.

p3223
sg5
VThese inexpensive headphones comfortably fit my over- sized head and ears, but the cord is much too long and I quickly grew tired of the "over- bassed" sound reproduction. The audio response curve is not flat- large amplitude bass peak which becomes tiresome after listing for a short period. The overemphasized bass seemed to drown out voices and higher sounds, cymbals for example, were muted. I suppose the long cord was intended to allow one to sit across the room from the sound source and be able to plug in the phones.  Certainly there is enough cord for this, but most of us use Android based personal devices  and do not need all that wire. I cut the line down to 3 feet and will use an extension cable for those (rare) times I need to access something across the room. Because these phones effectively muffle ambient sounds, I'll use them only for travel, not for day to day music listening. If you are one of those folks who has outfitted their vehicle with a massive woofer that shakes the fenders off the car, these are the phones for you.

VAfter reading so many reviews that these were uncomfortable I was concerned that they may not fit over my ears which are large (so I've been told). Surprisingly these fit really well completely covering both ears, and become uncomfortable only after an hour and half of wear but a short break fixes that. The sound quality is great, just as good as any skullycandy headphones I've used. Also these block outside noise to an extent which is noticed as soon as they are placed over the ears(without any music playing), and there is not much sound leakage at higher volumes and none at all when at mid to low volume making them perfect for the library. These seem to be a lot more durable too than most headphones in this price range. The cord is really long which is nice and they come with a clip to rap the cord around which can be place on the hip or in a pocket. The only down side is the generic look but when the price dropped to $19.98 it was no problem deciding to buy these. Would definitely recommend for the home office or use walking across campus.

V-HD201Much clearer mids and highsLacks Bass, most people will notice it but how much this affects you will depend on your preference in music.Larger than HD202, so it's better for people with large earsThe trade off is that it is uglier than HD202-HD202Greater range in lower frequencies (Better bass)Downside is that in direct comparison, the sound from HD202 is not as clear as HD201. It's not as crisp and there's more distortion.Looks better on your head than HD201-ConclusionI own both these headphones and my conclusion is that the HD201 is better because the highs and mids are clearer but it really lack bass. HD202 is good for movies and gaming where the bass adds the wow factor, but the same music sounded dull and less enjoyable in comparison to HD201. My recommendation if you really need headphones to be under 20 dollars is to get the HD201, but you won't be satisfied in all aspects of listening. If you can stretch it, get a different pair that is under 40 dollars.

VI got this HD 202 as a free gift that came in with my digital piano three years ago. I thought it would be cheap and trashy (free stuff usually is). But when I tried them they gave me a very pleasant surprise. The sound was rich and well balanced. Not like some other cheap headphones, they actually have very good bass, good enough for most genres (I mainly listen to rock from 80s and 90s). I keep them on my piano for practice most of the time. After getting used to them, I can't bear the sound from the built in speakers on my piano any more, not even close to the headphones. Some people complained about the comfort. But I never felt any discomfort after hours of piano practice with them. But I have a very small head compared with average. I'm also surprised that they are very endurable after all the three years considering how i abused them by accident sometimes. I haven't found any disconnect issue or anything malfunctioning so far. I would definitely recommend HD202 to those who need a pair for use at home or office. You'll love them.

VI really like these headphones but I must be used to open/semi-open headphones as I own the Sennheiser HD280 and 202 MKIIs now and both sound a bit muddy but I guess that's the nature of closed cans.Overall I like these headphones.  The cord is very long but I wish it was a little thicker as it seems easy to break over the years.  Only time will tell on that one.The pads are very good and so I give it a high rating for Comfort but fit is a bit strange.  I feel the headband rides more towards the front of your head which is a strange angle compared to most other headphones I've owned and tried.The bass is there and tight, mids and highs seem a bit muffled to me but once again, this is due to them being closed headphones.Isolation is decent for the lighter weight product we have here.  They don't do as good as the HD280s and so I would not use the 202s on a field production trying to mix audio for my recorder while in front of a loud PA but for every day outdoor productions and listening to music, they are very good at that.

VThe Sennheisser headphones, in general, present the best value for the money over other brands. I have had a pair of similarly priced 201 model Sennheisers for the past several years and thought they were great. However, they deteriorated badly over the past several years (build quality). I expect many of the same issues (cushions cracking, plastic pieces breaking, cords splitting) but don't care too much because the cost is very reasonable for decent headphones in constant use over three of four years.My main comment is that, while I'm hardly an expert, the sound quality of the 202s seems far superior to the 201s. However, the fit is much tighter and these could get uncomfortable after wearing for an extended time. I'll provide an update is I feel the need to. The tight fit does allow me to turn the volume down quite a bit and external noises are very faint. The bass is also better. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone wanting a decent pair of headphones for use with an MP3 player/tablet/laptop.

VI bought this product because Amazon had it under the "Over-the-ear" category: IF you are looking for an OVER-THE-EAR headphone, these are not for you!Well, I couldn't blame the product for my lack of reading and blind trust of Amazon. So, I made them a gift for my fiance.I thought they felt fine on my head (which is a little big), and she said they felt great on hers (small head). I liked the padding on the ear; they felt as though hours of use would not be annoying.The sound quality was great, (4 out of 5), they obviously aren't Bose, but if you are a casual listener of music, podcasts, etc. then the quality is perfect for you.The quality of the build seemed a little iffy to me, just where the ear pieces were attached to the head strap. There is a mechanism that didn't feel completely sturdy to me to increase/decrease the size of the headphones.Well, I think that Sennheiser makes a good product, so I went out and got the over-the-ear 201 Sennheiser because I liked the sound quality of this product.

VBought these about 2 years ago, use them almost everyday sitting at a desk, and they are like new.  I wanted headphones that would block out office noise and these block out about 80% of noise when they are just sitting on your head.  Very comfortable over the ear fit, you can wear them for hours.  They are not too big that you look funny or feel bulky on your head.The sound is very good.  I'm not an audiophile, but I am picky about sound quality.  The sound is crisp and the bass is EXCELLENT for a $25 set of phones.  Very long, thin cord which is great if you need to move around.I like to have a good set of phones at work, at my desk at home, and a set for cutting grass on the tractor.  I've tried a few other brands since and I wish I would have just bought 3 pairs of these.4 stars for sound quality, comfort, and price.  The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that they are not the most portable.  I wish the arms folded in or something so I could bring them with on the plane.

VSennheiser HD 202 II Headphones
p3292
sg5
VJust received my headphone yesterday.  They are a slimmer design from other similarly styled headsets I have seen. I like that they are not super bulky.  They adjust by the earbuds not by the headband which I feel allows you to get a more snug fit around the ears.  The sound is much leaner compared to my old set of Sony headphones.  The Sennheiser claims to be bass boosting but I noticed a more clear treble so far.  The most striking thing about these headphones is how they compared with my brother's Beats by Dr. Dre.  To my surprise, I found the sound of the Sennheisers to be just as good if not better.  The only thing the Beats win on is noise cancellation which is far superior to the Sennheiser.  However, when you compare the price differential, you should at the very least buy the Sennheiser pair first.  I've read reviews about the wiring going bad and the earbuds breaking.  I may update my review depending on how those components do at a later time.  At this point, I'm very glad I decided to give this set a chance.

VWhile these are not the best sounding headphones, they do not cost very much.  That said they do sound at least as good and are much more comfortable than a set of inexpensive ear buds.  For those that don't like ear buds or have troubles wearing them, like small children, these are a great option.I was very concerned about build quality given the price but had hope based on the Sennheiser name.  I was not disappointed.  The construction is simple but sturdy, and I have no concerns that they will have a short life.I purchased this pair for my 10 year old who struggled with ear buds and liked the idea of over the ear head phones.  He loves these.Previously, I had purchased a pair of Skull candy headphones for his older brother which cost more than double.  The sound quality was comparable but the build construction is not.  The Skull candy over the ear headphones fell apart.  The construction was too complex and had too many joints one of which failed.  The Sennheiser is far superior.

p3304
sg5
VOverall I was impressed with the audio quality of these headphones, the bass is great and it sounds better than most other $60 headphones, so for $20 it's a bargain. The earmuffs can make your ears a little hot after prolonged use but I don't find it as annoying as some say. They feel comfortable and the headphones are very light weight, which is great as heavier headphones can become bothersome after a while. The real flaw behind this is the EXTREMELY long cord.. I can see how this would be great for DJ's or someone that produces music, but for anyone else it could turn them off. They try to fix this with a cord take-up that winds the cord up and can clip to your belt. This does work well, however the problem is that it's really heavy. I was expecting to be able to hang the clip but it's so heavy that it drags the cord down with it and puts stress on the headphones. If you can deal with this problem I do recommend these headphones as they have great audio quality, are lightweight and comfortable, and are inexpensive.

VI know Sennheiser is known for professional level of headphones and extremely nice quality, and I think these headsets look very nice, the leather around the ear piece and the top of the head is above average quality and has a nice look, the cord is long and soft, and most of all, the sound quality is GREAT, I love that part but the 3 stars for 2 reasons:For this level of headphones, I was disappointed because:- Having these headphones on more than 10 minutes starts to hurt my ears. I am a small-medium person so small-medium head size, and I can't believe how much the pressure on my ear was bothering me. When I took the headphones off, the top of my ear was beet red from the pressure.- Even after adjusting the headset, the pressure is still really uncomfortable for any length of time.If you like a super snug fit, then you may really like these headsets. My #1 favorite is still my Sennheiser HD515. So I'm happy with the company but giving it a 4 star with generosity because of the ear pressing!

VI bought these headphones after my regular iPod headphones were worn out.  I must say after using cans for the first time I can't go back to in-ear-headphones.  I realized how much I was missing out in sound.These headphones have a 20 dollar material look but pack a 50 dollar sound.The Good:My music is now more vibrant and I definitely enjoy it more.I also purchased the high end Sennheiser HD 595.  When I compared the two, these cheap headphones do put up a good competition.  If you are not an audiophile, you really ain't missing out on much.  They do the trick at 90% less of the cost.The bad:The material however is very very cheap.  It almost feels and looks like a plastic toy.From a comfort perspective they are ok.  Your ears do get tired after an hour or so of use.  When you take them off, you feel relieved.The cord is long, as in 3 meters long.  The cable will get in the way if you planning to take these on the road with you.At 20 dollars, you can't complain though.  Awesome buy.

VBest $20 headphones ever!
p3345
sg5
VThese are awesome for the money! I don't think you'd be able to come across another $20 headset that comes even close to reaching the quality of these. My head is a pretty large so over time they kind of make my ears feel numb, but at least they don't make my ears hurt like other pairs of headphones I've owned previously. I guess I could say that I'm an audiophile and that these headphones leave a lot to be desired, but at its price point I can't complain at all. Sound quality is pretty above-par although its higher ends could cause some hearing fatigue after extended periods of listening. Also comes with a 3.5mm jack to 1/4" converter - came unexpected and convenient for a weekly studio gig I have. The only problem I have with this is its unnecessarily long cord. Why?-These headphones are only 20 bucks, not some studio monitoring cans. At least it comes with a plastic thing you can wind the long cable around. Sennheiser was even considerate enough to add a belt clip on the plastic thing too. Thanks guys!

p3351
sg5
VThese headphones perform extremely well, especially at this price point. The dynamic range is good and the tonal separation very good.The cord is surprisingly long, almost as if these were intended for an age in which people still sat in an easy chair while plugged in to their amplifier - does anyone use headphones that way anymore? I imagine many of us are using these with a laptop or MP3 player, in which case there's simply too much cord. The supplied cord winder is very cheaply made and of limited use.Now to my real gripe - they're just uncomfortable. Headache making, head compressingly uncomfortable. All the money goes into the speaker elements leaving very little for the band and adjustment - it's downright cheesy. A cheaply molded, thin plastic band attaches to the ear cups with a very primitive friction fit adjustment. When in place there's always too much pressure no matter how I adjust the size, making these unwearable for more than 30 minutes or so, such a disappointment.

p3356
sg5
VWhen i first bought these headphones i really had no intention of actually finding a REALLY good set. It performed more than what i had expected and i guess you could say it was worth the gamble to try.  There is a lot of sound reduction meaning a lot of outside noises can't be heard. it has great sound quality even to bass which is really good because most headphones require some bass EQ to bring the bass in songs up. i was more than content with getting these headphones my only thing for anyone reading this review; if you don't like a long cable, yes this is made with a very long cable, it may not be a feature you may like. However if you don't mind the cable, as it does come with a plastic i will say windup piece, its more than perfect again great sound guys really love it. I use it sometimes when i dj a little but the plastic windup could use an evaluation as i don't really like having to wind it back up by hand. A spring set would work maybe i don't know its my opinion but good job again sennheiser.

VGreat Headphones
p3374
sg5
VThese headphones are a great buy. I have purchased many headphones in the past 20 years and I love these. If you like LOUD music these are the best ones I could find under $100. The sensitivity means that these headphones will pay twice as loud as most available and 4 times as loud as alot of cheaper ones. If you use these with an iphone or mp3 player this is important. The sound is awesome with clean lows and clear highs.  There is one problem though. The cord is around 10 feel long and as most mp3 players and phones use the headphone cord as the fm antenna this degrades the reception abit. I was thinking of cutting the cord to the length that is best for fm when I read of a trick that works. Coil about 3 to4 feet of the cord into a tight spiral no more then 2 inches in diameter and secure with tie wrap or tape and this really improves reception. The coil should be on the headphone side of the cord.Comfortable-Light-Loud-great bass-crisp highs-and Sennheiser quality

VMy previous audio device was a pair of Skullcandy Dub earbuds. When they finally wore out, I began looking for an upgrade. A number of friends had bought headphones a few years prior, and they strongly recommended Sennheiser. I asked a more tech-savvy friend about the specs for this particular pair, and he agreed with the other reviews on Amazon - these headphones are a fantastic deal at the price.For the average listener, these headphones are amazing. They sound great, much better than my previous earbuds, and play a variety of genres beautifully. They fit comfortably over one's head and ears. The cord is a little long for the average person, but included is a small piece for cable storage. The headphones also come with a 1/4 adapter - one of my friends uses hers to play on a Clavinova in her school music lab without disturbing others.Overall, if you're looking for a midrange item and aren't seeking anything particularly fancy, these are a great pair to buy!

VThese headphones paired with the bass booster for an iPod makes an EDM fan like myself very happy.  I mainly bought these headphones because I wanted more bass in my life compared to the likes of the traditional skull candy in the ear headphones.  The headphones have surpassed their expectation both in use and their lasting.  I've had them for over a year and the only complaint I have found is the cord.  (Disclaimer: This complaint is more of a rant than an actual complaint.)  The cord is so long that when it unwraps from the holder, which it does a lot throughout use, it takes a while to wrap back up.  Now this wouldn't be so bad if the cord didn't unwrap so frequently, but it does so it causes me some frustration. (/rant.) HOWEVER, I do suggest these headphones to all of my college friends looking to get a quality pair on a strict budget.  These definitely deserve the 5/5 that I gave them as they are durable and produce a good sound (with nice bass) for a cheap cost.

VI got these as a replacement for some Skullcandy Hesh headphones I got as a gift a while ago. Skullcandy doesn't have a great reputation, and I'm aware that I'm a plebeian when it comes to headphones. I'm used to the bass-heavy Skullcandy sound and I'm very impressed with these. The bass is just as good without being so overbearing. The headphones are soft and comfortable, and they muffle a fair amount of outside noise without music. I can wear them for more than an hour without discomfort even with my glasses on. They stay on my head pretty well too, and I wear them while running and unicycling. Since these are DJ headphones, the cord is absurdly long. This isn't an issue with a rubber band, though. These aren't as loud as the Hesh, but they come very close. They'd be suitable for use as a tiny stereo around your neck, if you're one of those people who likes to share their music with everyone in a public space. These are the best headphones I know of at this price.

VFor the price I paid for these Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black) there's no complaint. These headphones look and sound like the cost a lot more (maybe $150 - $200). The included cord is very long and if you're a DJ the included 1/4" adaptor should make your day.You don't get a case though and the cord is not detachable and lacks volume control (just look at the price). The ear cups can't be twisted of folded either.Overall, the sound quality is brilliant and you'd be tempted to keep cranking up the volume and not remember there's a possibility of you going deaf :). The headphones block a lot of outside noise as well and fit relatively comfortable on your ears. There's and included cable management system and the padding is very comfortable.As I said before, the sound and build quality is that of headphones at a much higher price point. I certainly don't think I'll be traveling without them!

VThe Best Headphones $20 Will Ever Buy You
p3422
sg5
VThese are by far the best headphones $20 will ever buy you! They are comfortable for long periods of time. They have excellent quality and passive isolation. They can take any beating you throw at them. I have stepped on these things, thrown them in book bags for years at a time, etc. etc. They open up after around 20 hours or so of listening, so don't be surprised if they sound a bit too bassy at first. Although, they do tend to boost the lows, so if you want less of that, one EQ setting or two will set you on your way. They can be easily driven by any phone, iPod, mp3 player, laptop, stereo, whatever you have. The only, absolutely only, problem I've ever had with them is that sometimes one of the cables becomes unsoldered from the ear piece. This obviously cause the audio to go in and out. Just spending $2 or so in shipping to Sennheiser, within the first two years, gets me a brand new pair of headphones. Furthermore, they pay shipping on the way back to you.

VEXCELLENT CRISP SOUND! The bass response of these headphones isn't muddy and the high end frequencies are not sssseee or muddy either. The mid range sounds a little less pronounced than most headphones, but I like that....hard rock guitar still sounds awesome with these headphones. I've listened to techno, trance, hard rock, pop, 80s country, grunge, new wave, roxy, classical (Beethoven!) and early 80s rap and had no complaints. I've plugged them into an ancient walkman cd player, my Sony home stereo, my laptop computer, my Sansa and Zen mp3 players...the headphones make everything sound better, although they will pick up how aweful low end sample rate mp3s sound.The only album that didn't sound steller was Foreigners 'Records' album (a greatest hits album put out long ago) but I'm thinking it was the album itself that wasn't mastered very well. These headphones are well worth the price, and your not paying for the name branding, your paying for quality sound.

VThe Sennheiser HD 202 are quality "value" headphones for the money. Now let's not confuse these for any thing like  monitor headphones. These are not pro studio quality but for under $30 what is? I've used these for church video and sound board monitoring. Clean sounding and good bass response in my opinion. Very comfortable fit for my head & ears (my ears are on the smaller side). Durable enough (careful because I broke the left earcup from the frame - totally my fault) comfortable and great choice for a cheap music/monitor headphone. The cushion that rest on the head flaked of over time but again, I used them a lot and my coarse locks contributed, I'm sure. I think you can do a lot worse for the money.Pros: Comfort, durable, good bass, decent range of adjustability - the cups slide up and down, very long cord, price.Cons: Only what you find in many under $30 headphones! Non-folding, bulky to travel, larger ears probably not the best fit.

VFirst off. I paid 33 Dollars with 2 day shipping. 2 months ago I paid around 65 dollars for Skullcandy Skullcrushers.They lasted about 3 weeks. When I first got these HD202's The first thing I noticed was the long cord. It really isn't that bad because they give you a thing to wrap it around with a clip on it. What really amazed me was how good these things sound for 30$ ALOT better than the Skullcrushers. Obviously, the bass isn't as "loud" or doesn't "vibrate" as much, but the HD202's have a good amount of bass. It is kinda "muddy" but not bad.Pros:VolumeNot much DistortionLong cordbang for buckSoundClearityCons:Loose on headCheap DesignSmall ear cups/padsDoes not cover whole earBasically, you can't go wrong with these headphones for around 30 dollars. I hear such good things about these, I don't want to buy another pair of different cans that are more expensive because I don't want the HD202's to still sound better.

VI found it rather hard to believe all these amazing, great reviews for a set of headphones costing less than $30, but I took a chance and bought these for my kid to use.  He's not real careful with stuff in his game room and I figured it was no big deal if he broke them; better something like this instead of my expensive studio cans.Well, when they came in I tried them out and I was surprised and impressed!  Very good sound!  Good mids and highs and a nice tight bass that is solid but not overly boomy.They're also very light and comfortable to wear for long periods.  I listened to all 12 tracks of an album and I was hardly aware of having phones on my head.The long cord is excellent, and I love the fact that it comes with a wind-up clip for the times when you don't need the full length of cord.Anyone looking for a good set of headphones that won't break the budget would be well-served by getting these.

VI needed two headphones: one for my workplace and the other for home. After some research, I decided to purchase two headphonesA. Panasonic RP-HTX7 MonitorB. Senheiser HD-202 II Professional...so that I can directly compare the two, both good and well praised headphones. I am neither an audio engineer nor a music professional. I really don't have any specific preference in genre of music I hear although I put slight emphasis on bass and beats. Below are pros and cons for the headphone in my opinion.B. Senheiser HD-202 II Professional+ Pros: Good sound quality especially for the bass and beats(i.e., clear plus for me). Very comfort enclosure. Very long cable with detachable winder. Very light-weight.- Cons: The packaging. It was EXTREMELY hard to open the case. This must be the second worst package of this kind I ever (tried to) open if not the worst. Other than that, perfect...oh well, maybe cable hitting my chin time-to-time?

VI spent easter weekend just hoping that these would show up on my doorstep. I've never sprung for an expensive pair of headphones before in my life, and I have to say that these are easily the most amazing things I've ever gotten. Well worth the money they cost, easily. I don't have the money for a big pair of 100$+ headphones, so these were an amazing deal for any audiophile on a budget. They are a little warm, and they do bring audio imperfections to the surface if you're using inferior formats, so they're good if you're a music editor like I am. The cable winder is great as well, because this cord is horrifically long. I could've kept my headphones on and gone in the other room with how long this is. One complaint I have, the cord is a straight jack, and not an elbow jack. That irked me a little bit, but I have an elbow adapter, so that's not an issue to me. It might be to someone else though, so beware. Alas, still a great buy for 27$. 9.5/10

VI was looking to get some cheap over the ear headphones that would replace my iPod buds. This pair has delivered on it's mission to replace the buds. They fit comfortably over my head and the muffs cover my ears pretty well. I did rate comfort only 3 stars because the frame interferes with my eyeglasses a lot and they do tend to warm after prolonged usage (3 to 4 hours). The sound delivered by the headphones may not compare with a pair worth $150+ but they definitely warped the iPod buds out of my existence. The sounds are much clearer and music can be better appreciated.If you're looking for something to replace your iPod (or whatever other portable music player) then these sturdily built headphones are definitely something to consider.Two last things: LOVE the chord length, let's me move around without worrying about pulling the plug out. These headphones are NOT noise cancelling!! Make sure you don't buy these thinking they are...

p3504

VEven though I say casual, I have very sensitive ears. And after using Sennheiser headphones and earbuds, there is no going back to cheap american brands.Sound quality: Clear, well rounded sounds both in base, mid, and high ranges. Some more expensive headphones doesn't even match up with this one, and it's only $27. If you are looking a pair of headphones that you can use for a variety of music, this is the one to get.Price: So reasonably priced! Compared to the sound quality you will get, it is REALLY cheap!Quality: The only problem I have with Sennheiser is how easily the cords close to the ear stops working. For me, it's always been the right ear. But Sennheiser does have a really responsive customer service, and claiming your 2 years warrantee is very easy!This is a definite worthy buy!I just ordered my second pair. The first lasted for about 2 1/2 years with one replacement.

VI purchased these headphones to use at work, so I needed something that will be comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  These don't measure up.  After as little as 15 minutes, these headphones irritate my ears, especially the right one.  I'm not a big guy and I don't think I have unusually large ears, but the ear cups on these headphones are small and tight.  They don't surround your ears so much as they press directly on them.  After a few minutes, they become pretty uncomfortable.They sound fine and appear to be well built, but I can't stand to wear them.  I'd return them, but they came in the awful clear clamshell/blister package that you have to destroy to get open and expose yourself to razor-sharp plastic edges to get them out.  It's too bad.  I also bought a pair of HD-280 PRO headphones to use in my studio at home and they are much better.  They are also twice the price.  I guess you get what you pay for.

VI have had these for maybe a month now. This is the first pair of over the ear headphones I have owned. I have only had earbuds before and going from those to these is night and day. The sound is simply better. When listening to some songs I can hear things I never heard before. I do a ton of homework so I use these 5 days a week for 6+ hours everyday. They are great at blocking out all the distractions around me. When I have the volume at a reasonable level I can hear very few ambient noises. I listen to a very wide range of music from indie rock, hard rock, country, hiphop, pop, rap, symphonic mucic, etc. They sound great for all these.  My only complaint about these is that they are made of plastic and they aren't collapsible. When ever I go anywhere with them I have to wear them around my neck. I don't dare put them in my backpack for fear they will be crushed. I don't think they are fragile, just not ultra durable.

p3528
sg5
VThis is a very early review as I just got these and have only used once. I got them to use at the gym. I personally can't stand ear buds. My hearing is not the best either - probably from years of hunting when I was younger. I have tried many headphones as well as ear buds but the sound level was very low for me - I usually had to turn the volume on cardio equipment to the max to get a listenable volume. With the Sennheiser I get a vey good volume level with the volume on the cardio equipment at the @ half way mark. Very pleased. If you plan to use these for working out, here are two things to consider. The cord is way to long - I plan to cut out a lot of the middle and reconnect the end with the headphone plug. If you push hard enough to sweat, you will find that your ears sweat around the muffs. To me these are minor issues. If these units stand up I will be very happy. If I have any problems, I will update this review.

VI was looking for a low price set of headphones and saw these while looking at some other Sennheiser products.  I have owned several pair of their open air type headphones but none of their isolation type and was curious about them.  I read several of the reviews which were mixed.  So I thought I would give them a try since they were under thirty dollars.  I've been listening to them now for several months and I can say that for what I paid for them that they are okay.  Are they the best set of headphones I've ever owned - no.  Are they the worst - no.  But for the money they are not a bad buy.  I listen to a lot of progressive rock and jazz and they seem to do well with that kind of music.  The padding on the headphones themselves can get a little uncomfortable after thirty or forty minutes.  But overall I do not regret buying them for what I paid for them.  I like my HD 470's better but I paid a lot more money for them.

VI have owned a pair of these for a really long time. I used them almost every day for about 4 years straight. They have stretched out a little to fit my gigantic head, but even when they're new, they don't squeeze too badly.The chord is extremely long, and it comes with a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter if you need to use them as a monitor as a musician or recording artist to plug into a mixing board or stereo output.The sound is clear, and the foam pads are pretty comforable - even after all these years. The only complaint I have for them is that the pleather cover on the earpads eventually degrades, and begins to peal off. It doesn't make them any less comfortable, but it does look a little ugly after a long period of use.Even so, Sennheiser makes good headphones, and these haven't let me down. I will probably keep buying these until Sennheiser goes out of business or stops making them.

VThese are a GREAT pair of headphones! The only issue I recently had with them was that the right piece fell off, but that was easy to reseat into the headband. It's so easy to adjust them to a perfect fit, and they are so comfortable to wear compared to my old Sony pair. The wires are nice and sturdy too. It might snag itself onto things, but it won't easily break.They sound great too, and I love that there's a 2-year warranty on them. I really don't think I'm going to have to replace them for a long time now though, I'm pretty sure I'll still have them way beyond the warranty.This is my first Sennheiser purchase, and I will continue to buy into their brand. I'm actually looking into getting a wireless pair now.If you're someone who goes through a lot of pairs of earphones and headphones in general, I'd highly recommend you consider their stuff. The 2-year warranty, again, is a steal.

VGood bargain for the money. I believe some of the reviews may be inflated. They're really nice, but you probably wont be saying stuff like "Man, I could hear some people talking, outside the booth!" like some reviews give the impression. If you're like me then you own either inexpensive in ear, or those flat, on ear headphones, wanted some beats by dre, saw the price, and realized the only way you'd get headphones for that much is if you produced something that earned you the money. I saw the price and the specs and I got these. Sennheiser is a respected brand in the audio game, and from what I can tell its for good reason. These are comfortable to wear for hours. I think I've gone for maybe 6 hours with them on before they get a little heavy. Pretty much the only difference I hear between these and my earphones is bass. A lot of the lower end sound comes in a lot clearer with these. Overall, a nice value for the price.

VI bought this set of headphones to replace my pair of Sony MDR-XD200 headphones (currently retailing for more than $60). This pair is so much better! The sound is good, with a pleasant balance between the bass and treble. It is also far more comfortable than my last pair, and the cushioning on top means there are no pressure points on the top of your head. The on-the-ear headphones do become a little painful after prolonged use.  But usually that's my reminder that I need to take a break!The other aspect of its design I appreciate are the clip-off earphones, something I didn't discover until I trampled on them accidentally and was sure I had broken them (this has happened to past headphones with me). But the clip-on design meant they just popped off and were easily snapped back in to place, no harm done! As long as these stay nicely-priced (currently less than $30) they have my full-throated recommendation.

VI purchased these headphones to mainly use at home and at the office. Currently I use them to listen to SPotify and with my iPad when watching Netflix/Youtube etc.At the price point I purchased them at ($20.83) I wasn't expecting audiophile quality but honestly I am blown away. The sound clarity is amazing, music comes across clear and crisp, the bass is hearty and the highs extreamly clear.Comfort wise, they are also very good. I was skeptical at the begining due to the fact that the entire head piece is made of a thick solid piece but so far so good. I figure that over time the band will loosen up a bit but I will have to wait and see. I wore them the first day for about a good 4 hours while at my desk and I can say I didnt suffer from any ear fatigue. The ear cups cover my ears comfortably but then again I don't have Dumbo ears :)Overall I would hihgly recommend these headphones at the $20 - $25 price point.

p3582
sg5
VI purchased the pair I am now using 2 years ago and they still work as well as the day I got them.  The cord hasn't shorted out and they provide a good full range of sound - plenty of bass for this price range.  I am very picky about head phones needing to deliver plenty of bass and a full range of sound.  I bought these in order to provide some sound dampening when running my lawn mower and they do a decent job.  They're a little bulky sitting on your head and you might have to re-adjust them a time or 2 while mowing to maintain comfort and to keep them from slipping off your head but overall they are functional for this purpose.  They're definitely not for running in or activity with similar amounts of movement.  You might find the extra long cord somewhat irritating but Sennheiser provides a spool to wind it up to shorten the cord when needed.  I'd buy another pair when these wear out and highly recommend them.

VThese headphones are really good. They outlast all of my other cheap headphones. I got a pair of sony headphones and they broke about 6 months after I got them. I got these headphones at the same time and they havn't broken yet. VERY DURABLE. I don't baby them, either.These headphones also have decent audio quality. It's nothing special. If you want good sound quality go get some good logitech speakers with a big a*s subwoofer. I always listen to my speaker system (great bass and crisp clear audio) and use these when I have to listen quietly for whatever reason.These headphones are pretty cheap(price) but they are very well made. The cord is extremely long and I can get up and grab something else in the room without having to take the headphones off. That's a plus for me but it CAN AND WILL get in the way at some point, but it's not really a big deal. I'd rather have the length be too long than too short.

VMy headphones have stopped limping along and have now finally quit working altogether after roughly 1.5 years.While the headphones were working, they were perfectly good. However, after a year of use, the corded connection of the right ear-phone became frayed and I lost the ability to hear anything on that side. I commuted with these headphones from home and work, so I wrapped up the (long) cord around the headphones themselves - this likely caused the stress that broke the cord. While there is more that I could have done to prevent this (use the cord-winding piece provided), I don't believe that I was being too hard on my headphones. I also heard the same complaint from a friend when I told him about how one ear-phone had stopped working.On the plus side, the headphones were bought on sale and so were not too terribly expensive. On the downside, I expected a longer life than 1.5 years.

VI purchased these headphones looking for a decent set of circumaural headphones without spending a whole bunch of money. I'm not an audiophile, I just wanted something to use to listen to music and play games with.I admit I am quite pleased with the sound. The headphones do a good job of blocking out outside noise, too. However, my main complaint is that after a few short minutes of wear, the pressure of the cups pressing against my head becomes extremely painful and uncomfortable. I've tried stretching them gently over a cardboard box and leaving them for a week. It was a short-term solution at best.I'm really disappointed, because I really like the sound I get from these. I just wish that I could comfortably use them.Pros:- Decent sound quality- More than adequate cord lengthCons:- Extremely uncomfortable/painful for me. Your mileage may vary.

p3609
sg5
VFirst off, these headphones are very inexpensive for their quality. The sound clarity is not incredible, but for almost every listener besides hardcore audiophiles, they will certainly get the job done. The most distinguishable feature these have are their incredibly long (10 ft.) chord. Most headphones I encounter will only have a 3 to 4 ft chord and I will have to buy extensions for the kind of listening I do. I need a long chord to play drums along to my computer, and these headphones are the first ones I have purchased that do not make me move equipment around in order for the chord to reach. The package also comes with a nice 6.3 mm adapter which I always seem to be short of. Overall, I would recommend these headphones to everyone except for those hardcore audiophiles who would most likely find faults in them. Also, if comfort is your main decider when buying headphones, these are not in the top tier.

VWhat a bargain.  These sound great and are very comfortable and for 20 bucks how can you go wrong.  I especially like the can adjustments that have a wide range of settings and stay where you adjust them to, not like other headphones that slide all over when you take them off.  The cord is nice plenty long and is very manageable with the ingenious and extremely simple and efficient cord reel with belt clip provided.  Looking at these headphones one can see that they are very simplistic in design and very functional like most German engineered products.  I'll never worry about buying any Bose or other $200 plus headphones for traveling, these block out exterior ambient noise effectively and without batteries or any other complications.  For traveling, no worries, for $20 I can replace them 10 times for the price of Bose or other brand that pays for gads of advertising and is built into their price.

VI needed a new pair of headphones for when I don't want to bother switching my Bluetooth back and forth.  I'll connect these to my iPad, desktop computer, phone, whatever is playing something to keep me humming away at my desk.  These are VERY comfortable and I have no problem wearing them all day long.  The cups fit perfectly over my hears and make a comfortable seal to keep sound out.  They're not noise canceling but they do a great job of muffling ambient sounds.  Really nice when I'm listening to something and someone is playing NOT what I'm listening to.  Bad grammar?  Oh, forgot to mention, I have not a small head if you have questions of fit  ;-)  Only issue I have is that these headphones tend more towards bass for my liking.  Not terrible, don't get me wrong, just a tad too much for my ears.  Otherwise great headphones, long cord, nice cord winder and I would recommend these to others.

VFirst off my shipment arrived days ahead of the scheduled delivery, kudos to Amazon. This is actually my second time buying these headphones, I purchased them for my girlfriend years ago and I just remember how much she enjoyed them. So here I am years later looking for a nice set of headphones and I stumble onto these again, you just cannot get this kind of sound for under $50 dollars from any other brand I have tried. I figured what the hell I'll just get these again. The bass is full and the sound is crisp even with MP3's. My only complaint would be the volume doesn't seem to go as high as with other headphones. Again this is a slight complaint as these do just fine, I just like to really crank my tunes sometimes ( Yes, I know it's awful for your ears). Otherwise the construction is solid and for the money I do not think you will find another pair of headphones up to these standards.

VI was looking for a set of headphones to use at work that would not only keep the noise out but would keep the music in.  I work in a cube farm so being able to drown out the noises around me is just as important as making sure the guy over the wall can't hear what's in my ears.  I tried a few other low cost headphones and while they kept the noise out, they didn't keep the music in.  I found a pair of Sennheiser at another store, bought them and loved them but ended up returning them because I couldn't justify the $70 price tag just to listen to music at work.  A couple months later I was browsing around here and found these.  They're almost identical to the pair I had returned so I thought 'why not?'.  I've now had them for several months and I'm still in love with them! I can listen to my music as loud as I want and nobody can hear it, even when they're standing right behind me.

Sennheiser has out done themselves.These are a steal for the price and quality. I can't believe these headphones are not at least 40$. They work like they're worth more.I recommend these headphones for the price. If you are looking for something simple to have if you just stay at home or listen to your ipod on the bus or train, these are perfect.The cord is  a little long, but hey, better than having a short wire jack hmm? They are comfortable for my head fit.I love them.I cannot be anymore happy. Worth every dollar I spent.

VFantastic sound quality, but wire is too long and cheaply made
p3662
sg5
VI may not be an audiophile, but I feel that these are hands-down one of the best pair of headphones you can get under $50 for the sound. I particularly enjoy the comfort of the over ear construction (although a couple of my friends may disagree). However, I feel that the cord provided is much too long, even with the wire holder provided (which shouldn't be necessary). It has made it easy to damage the wire from tripping or accidentally pulling on it. Because of this I have gone through 2 pairs (one a warranty replacement). But the fact that I have gotten 2 pairs should be telling about how much I really like these cans. I decided to try the Sennheiser HD 439 to try and see if I could get even better, but these BLOW the 439's out of the water in terms of sound. I am impressed that a product $20-$30 cheaper made by the same company can be better than the more expensive product.

VFor $25 you get decent/good sound quality. Padding around the earphones and on top for your head for comfort. I have a small/medium size head that's shaved and found the these to fit firmly snug to my head and comfortable for long periods of use, but I can see where people with bigger heads with hair will find discomfort using these for a substantial amount of time as I've read in other reviews. Outside sounds get cut out pretty good with a little leak through. Comes with a sizable cord. These headphones are quality and not junk. I'd recommend purchase of these for your child, teen, or if you yourself are looking for an affordable solid entry level headphones. The only make or break thing to consider with these is if you think they may be too tight for your head and will feel uncomfortable with prolonged use. Have small head? Buy it! Have a large head? Buy at your own risk.

VI love these headphones. They are sturdy and seem to have great connections.  I use these very often, have had them for a year now and they are as nice as day one still.  No static or cracking. They do not completely block out the outside sound, but I like that so I do not get surprised or miss an alarm or something.  They give you a surround sound experience and are very comfortable. Plug into my laptop, but having a hard time finding other components that accept headphones.  Check for headphone jacks on the component you would like to use this on.  I thought that the "audio" jack on the front of my dvd player would accept this, but it did not.  I have tried some adapters, but have not found the right one yet. My lack of research on that one, but love them on my laptop, long cord makes it so I can listen to music and do other things and not disturb everyone else.

VI cannot believe these are just $20.  I have a drawer full of earbuds, other over ear, under ear, every kind made it seems, and these just blew me away with the sound.  I take public commute and they shut out all the exterior noise, and I get full music sound, beautiful music, good bass, clean crisp music.  I love them.  The only thing negative  I can say is the appearance, they do stand out, in public.  I would prefer more discretion, but the sound is incredible for the price.  I just order behind the ear Senheiser's for a lot more, $60 bucks, because I ride my bike a lot, and need the behind the neckband due to my helmet. But I am sold on Sennheiser sound.  For the money, the Phillips behind the neck phones for $20 are decent, but my music is distorted at even the slightest elevation in sound, if the $20 Sennheiser are and indication, I can't wait for these at $60.

p3698

VFirst off, if you've listened to Harman/Kardon, Bose, or similar, you better lower your expectations. But then again, you payed $30. On the package it says powerful bass. This is a lie. You want that and that only, get some Beats. On the other hand, I think it has wonderfully balanced sound from high to low after a little breaking in. You can easily pick out the different instruments on any song. Your ears do get a little warm, however fit is very good.I don't really like that it doesn't have only one cord out of one earphone. The headband constantly feels like it's in the wrong place. Included, there is a cord winder, but the notches to keep the cord rip it up slightly. Lengthwise the cord is nice as I have used it monitoring a mixer, you need to move around a lot with them around your neck. They seem durable enough for being plastic, we'll see how they fare.

VMy old Koss over the ear headphones stopped working just like the pair I had before them. They are very good throw away headphones but they are not the best quality when it comes to longevity. I saw a pair of Sennheiser's on sale at Target and I thought about buying them. I read reviews and was quite impressed but wasn't sure if they were for me. Then I found these Sennheiser HD 202 II Pro. Headphones here on Amazon for cheaper. So I decided to go ahead and purchase them for my home use. I received them in a timely manner and tried them out. I Love Them. They sound great, fit snug, and perform well. They aren't the best at noise cancellation but they are great, certainly studio quality. They're far better then the Koss I used to use. I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a good quality pair for home use. This was a quality purchase.

VFor the price you pay, these are pretty nice headphones. I have owned many Sennheiser headphones and I needed another pair for work. These are definitely acceptable but there is, of course, better out there. If you need something simple that just works, these are it. But if you want something you can wear all day or that have a better sound, be willing to spend more. If you can afford the Sennheiser 280 Pro's, it is well worth the additional price (about 3x more than these).Pros-Lightweight-Sounds good for a variety of music styles-Don't stick out as much as larger headphonesCons-Ear cups are smaller than I had hoped. Ears barely fit causing discomfort after a while-Bass sounds a little garbled on some strong hits-The cord is wayyyy too long-Little cheap feeling but this does keep weight down

VI will first say that I am not an audiophile but I have owned other headphones that I can compare these to, mainly Bose. While these are not Bose headphones, for the price they have decent sound. For me, the bass is at times overbearing at times, but the package does state that this unit has "powerful bass." Compared to other brands that I have looked at and tried in the same price range I would say these are one of the best sound wise and also have a good build quality for the price. I did not have a large budget at the time of purchase to replace a broken set so I decided to try these. I do like them for what I paid, I would also say that the sound quality would depend on the user's preference and the type of music they listen to. Would I recommend them to a friend? Yes, they are inexpensive and will get you by until you can justify a higher end set.

VThese headphones have very good sound quality, especially if you are used to listening to music with lower-quality headphones. I don't like a ton of bass in my music, but it still delivers in that area. All mid and high tones are clear and crisp. Make sure you have good quality songs and these will be even better. The stereo sound is pretty great too. I haven't had any problems with sound leakage either.While some others have reported having comfort problems, I find them very comfortable. They fit well on my head and have soft earpads. If you slide the earcups to the top position and twist, they also come off for travel and portability, another nice feature.The cord is really very long though.. Just wrap up the extra slack and you should be golden.All around very good headphones, I recommend these to my friends and family.

VI got these headphones about a month ago, and I love them. They are very comfortable, although I guess my ears are too big, and the buds don't fit all the way around my ears. The soft padding is great, but after a few hours, they begin to feel a bit too tight. The sound is incredible and a big plus for me, is that without any music, outside noise is greatly reduced. I can't hear my officemate talking to me...which is part of the reason why I got these in the first place!The cord is nice and long and I can walk around my entire office without having to take off the headphones, but I just wish that it was retractable! I've stepped on the cord, gotten it tangled up in my chair, feet etc. The thing that they gave me to keep the cord wrapped around is just too big and cumbersome to wear, so I don't use it. So, I give it 4 stars just because of the cord.

VClosed over-the-ear headphones are more comfortable to wear for extended perios than earbuds and it is no surprise that you see more and more people wear them in the NYC subways. Long commutes and loud ambient noises make closed headphones often a better choice.  I got these Sennheisers for someone who loves to listen to music and podcasts but who has broken a lot of headphones. The durable but flexible one-piece headband is more rugged than the multi-part headbands on other products costing much more. I own a number of very good headphones and while each brand may have a sound character that you like or dislike, I find the HD 202 to be accurate and pleasant to listen to for a variety of music types. Let's face it: for the price of two "dollar store" headphones that sound very mediocre and break easily, you can enjoy these quality headphones.

VI bought these headphones right after Christmas on sale for ~$20, and they are simply amazing, low end response is sharp but smooth, Bass pumping, but not overpowering the high end, sharp and clear as diamond. I would take these over a pair of Beats any day, they feel better on the ears, show professionalism, and are just of a better quality.EDIT: Nearly 10 months later they are working just as good (if not better) than they were before. I believe part of that is that the drivers are now conditioned, as well as the pads are now softened from repeated use. Making them quite a bit more comfortable as well as creating a better seal around your ears for audio to propagate in.EDIT 2: (1-22-14) After over 2 years of hard service these headphones are still going strong, everything is holding together nicely and the sound is still crystal.

p3757

VMy first pair lasted two years before the left earpiece went out.  I assume it was either because the cord connection is cheaply made (I mean, these ARE $20-$30 headphones), or it could have just been use and pressure on the joint where the wire meets the earpiece.All in all, these are great headphones on a budget.  Even though they lasted two years, they were very good.  Good quality sound, comfortable for up to two hours of listening (after that my ears started getting sore and I would just need a ten minute break).  They are pretty cheap plastic and the ear pieces have a pretty basic sliding function - but the plastic never broke or gave out.I am going to purchase a better pair of Sennheiser - probably the HD 518.  Side by side with comparably priced Sony, Koss, or Audio Technica, these perform better dollar for dollar.

VI am a student at Winthrop University. From time to time I need to sit in a common area and do some studying. In the past I have used the ear buds that came with my iPod, but they are not always comfortable -- and they have a tendency to slip out of my ear. These headphones are extremely comfortable, and they totally enclose my ears so that with my background music set at a pleasantly low volume, I am still insulated from the ambient sounds of my environment. Because the headphones are the size they are, the actual sound producing devices for each ear are larger that those in the ear buds, and that results in a much better quality of the sound. Oh, yes, and there's one more thing -- they are affordable! On a student budget, the $200 and $300 ones may be nice, but I suspect that they are nowhere near as much better as the higher price would imply.

VI've had 3 pairs of this headphones, not because they break but because of my dogs. The build quality is very solid and the sound quality is absolutely amazing! The cushioning is extremely soft and the noise isolation is really good. They may be too tight for the first couple of days of wearing them. I would recommend putting them on a basketball to expand them a little without going through the "cranial squeezing". They can be really loud, I used them sometimes in my office as speakers and there was no distortion nor suffered from any quality loss. The cord is REALLY long but is comes with something you can wrap it around. If you are looking for more mild headphones with not such an aggressive bass or volume tolerance I would recommend Panasonic RP-HTX7 as they are lighter, really good sound quality but not as bassy and loud as these.

I have a set of Bose sitting next to the bed and a side by side comparison is pretty impressive. These have very nice low frequency response and good sound through most of the ranges. My music tastes are pretty scattered from 70's folk rock to Deadmou5. These handle the ranges capably.The ear cups could be a little larger to cover my entire ear like the Bose though. I had a set of Beats and after one 3 hour flight returned them. They did not fit over my ears, and smashed my earlobes against my head, causing much pain quickly. These aren't as roomy as the Bose, but not near as cramped as the Beats.For the price, how can you pass it up. I'd buy a second pair just to have as a backup. Go for it, you probably won't be disappointed.

You really can't go wrong with these.Pros:-sound great-inexpensive-durable and long lasting-comfortableCons:-cord is ridiculously long. I use these as my everyday headphones and that long cord gets in the way often-the included cord wrapper seems just barely too small for the amount of cord.-materials are fairly cheap feeling (although, as mentioned before, they do last)If you are on the fence, get off.

VI have 5 pairs of these babies, and none of them have ever failed me. I use them for tracking in my home studio mainly, but sometimes I listen to my iphone through them. I can recommend these to home studio owners because of their value (price vs functionality) and their durability. These things are rated for a high SPL, and let me tell you... THEY CAN TAKE A BEATING. If you record music you may know that sometimes a musician will want the bass or kick drum absolutely wailing in his/her cans. I have always dreaded that until I got these. You can crank the fire out of them and they will not falter. DO NOT get the HD 201's if you do anything besides use your headphones occasionally. I bought two of those and the bass drivers blew out within a week of studio use. Cough a little extra dough and get these extremely valuable and durable headphones.

VI've been eyeing for these for a while and finally bit the bullet and I'm loving the sound quality this provides.  I'm not even a music-listener by any means, but do listen occasionally while doing school work or watching Hulu/Netflix on my iPad at work.  Voices come very clearly and bass in general is deep.  EXCELLENT value now that the new Senneheisers are out (the 203's).  Only minor gripes is that the chord is a little long for general laptop/iPad listening (although I understand more serious audio enthusiasts require this)...and the ear cups are just a *tad* small, which is only noticeable when listening to music for more than maybe 45 mins.  Nothing that would make me detract a star.Might pick up another pair as a gift, or maybe another as a backup pair.  Senneheiser is now my go-to brand.  Very happy with these headphones.

I personally stopped using them because I wanted a good pair of headphones for the gym... but my novice mistake was not thinking about how hot your ears get in these sucks. I ended up buying the behind-the-head Sony headphones that I also reviewed, which served my gym purpose far better... and had the same quality of sound as these. These Sennheisers would probably be good if you like to watch laptops in your bed and don't want to be noisy... but don't buy these if you're looking for bass, crisp treble, or just high quality sound.

VI got these headphones for my son, because he always had his music up so loud on his Ipod with his earbuds, that I had to keep on asking him to turn them down, CONSTANTLY! I didn't realize exactly how great these headphones are, and at a really affordable price! My son can be in the same room with me, have the volume up where he likes it, and I can't even hear anything! It's like magic for me, and total enjoyment for him! These headphones are professional quality, clear sound with great bass, nice long cord if you need it (with something to wrap the cord around to keep the cord in good shape), the headphones unclip, they don't leak noise, and I have bit more sanity finally! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND these headphones for pro's and parents who want their sanity back! I may just need to buy a pair for my daughter and myself. I love them this much!

VGreat sound.  Cheap cord.
p3810
sg5
VFor sound quality and comfort these are fantastic.  The cord going into the jack fatigued and I lost sound in one ear after a bit over 3 years of steady use at work.  The rest of the headset is still like new so it's kind of frustrating.  I've got an old pair of sony's that cost about the same with a cord I could tow my truck with.  However, they sound muffled compared to the sennheiser's.  Anyway, these are out of warranty so I tried to fix it myself but couldn't get a good solder joint on the tiny hair fine wires with my fat ape like fingers and middle aged eyes.  I'm going to order another pair because for 25 bucks you can't beat this deal but don't think they are magic simply because they are sennheiser.  Frankly I'd rather have a jack hole in the side and buy my own cord.  That way,  I'd be using the same pair for years to come.

VBeyond Expectations
p3816
sg5
V[[ASIN:B003LPTAYI Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)]  I knew Sennheiser was a quality name from a previous purchase but did not expect the high quality I received in these headphones at this low price. As all seem to agree the bass is very strong and clear, not booming and vague. The rest of the range seems flat and pure bordering on being audiophile quality. The very high frequencies are a little weak but but acceptable. These are quality headphones. They fit well and are comfortable. After a few days of heavy use I had adapted to having them on and wearing them had become almost unnoticeable. The 10' cable and spool I found to be very useful. I did not find the cable to be too long or the spool any problem at all. I am very happy with these headphones and have demo'd and recommended them to several friends.

VBroke College Student Review
p3822
sg5
VHere are the pros and cons.Pros:1. Good sound quality.2. Pretty good base.3. Long wiring helps keeping distance between source and your ears. Which is nice. Since there is a wind up belt. Although I really wouldn't call it a good one.4. Really really good deal for the price you pay.Cons:1. Gets uncomfortable to ear fast. After an hour or so my ears hurt. The cushion really doesn't help much.2. Slightly uncomfortable for people who were glasses.3. Sometimes the long wire is not what you need and in place creates problem. The wind up belt doesn't really help that much. It is kind of faulty.For quality and features I would have given it a 3 stars. But since it's such a good deal, i'd say you get more than you pay for. Hence 4 stars. As a broke college students who wants a good enough pair of headphones, I approve!

p3828
sg5
VI've only had these headphones a few days, but I'm very impressed with the sound especially for the price. Granted, I'm used to earbuds and the only other larger headphones I have are some noise-cancelling Sonys for travelling. Regardless, these headphones are comfortable, have good bass response, have a long cord which is great at my large desk, and they isolate the noise from my coworkers when I need it. Thankfully they're not super large so I don't look like an airport worker or like I'm wearing earmuffs, but they still fit entirely around the ear. The drivers are reportedly the same size as larger Sony models anyway. I'm an audiophile and a diehard Sony guy. This pair just had a longer cord than Sony's nice $20 headphones and the weighted average of the reviews is higher. I took a chance on Sennheiser and it's paid off so far!

p3834
sg5
VThe audio quality on these headphones is perfectly fine.  However, I work as a video editor and I usually wear my headphones all day long (around 7 hours).  My ears have never hurt so bad.  The plastic headband is too tight, so the cans squeeze against my skull.  There's no way to adjust how tight the band is, so that sucks.  Also the speakers are not inset far enough into the cans so the speakers press right up against my ears.I bought these cause I was trying to save the company money (as they would be a company expense).  However, I have been leaving work rubbing my ears in pain ever since I got them.  Also, I end up with "headphone hair" because of the band and cans.I'll be spending my own money on probably some clip on style headphones, and I'll probably be spending a lot more cause I need to.

VThey are comfy to wear, the "pleather" ear pads have held up now for close to a year. I have dropped them and stepped on them and they still work well. Good sound for $20 headphones. The ear pieces pop on and off too which is why they were not trash after I stepped on them, I just snapped them back in place. The cord is super long but it includes a clip on plastic piece that you can wind the extra cord around and put on your belt (if you don't mind the goofy look) or hide in your pocket/bag. I have had them for a year now and they hold up well, got them to watch tv and play games with without waking up the kid sleeping. On a side note they do help a lot in FPS games like COD/TF2/BF3. You can really hear the footsteps, reloads, pin releases, etc that you need to hear without blowing money on other headphones.

VMy dogs eat headphones like other dogs eat shoes, so I've had to buy more than my share. The more they ate, the cheaper I bought, and I'm very glad I got down to these. If you've just gotten the mono versions of all the Beatles albums (which, BTW, you should) and you know every note and nuance of the stereo versions by heart and you're listening with every bit of concentration you can muster to hear the differences in the two formats,, well, the Sennheiser HD 202's are not for you. But if you're looking for comfortable, highly adjustable OTE headphones to plug into your computer while you watch Season 8 of House, then stop reading this and buy them. The phones seem to have a hole in the 500-1000 mHz range, so if you have any sort of equalizer or sound-enhancng software between the soiurce and these phones, that will help a lot.

VI own two pairs of these headphones (one for work and one at home), and so do 3 of my cubicle-mates.  They are very comfortable (even on my sticking-out ears) and the sound quality is good for the price.  One of my cubicle-mates says that she often has trouble with headphones that press against her earrings, but these ones go right over her earlobes and don't interfere with her piercings at all.  I wear these headphones for around 8 hours a day (often when I'm not listening to anything, partly out of laziness and partly because they keep my ears warm) and do not notice anywhere as much discomfort as the cheaper ones I used to own.  I think I've got an average-sized head, so perhaps the folks who complain of discomfort happen to have wider skulls.  Anyway, my first pair is 2 years old now and I haven't noticed any degradation.

VExcellent Sounds and Built To Last!!!
p3858
sg5
VFirst of all, these headphones are outstanding.  The sound is pure and crisp.  My oldest son (17) has a pair of 299 Beats by Dre.  They are nice but stupidly priced.  I bought two of these for my younger children (8 and 4).  The sound is excellent and they look great.  What should be noted is how well they are built.  Solid one peice to go over the head with just the right padding under the top.  Also the padding around the ear seams just right as well.  The way the earpeices adjust up and down is to be complimented.  Very durable which is great for anyone but perfect for kids who no doubt will be hard on anything.  I have had them for three weeks, and with constant use from my kids, they are still unscathed.  Definate Top Value.  Sincerely, I cant see how the can make and sell them for the price I paid. Definately buy these!

VFor some reason it's nearly impossible to get ear buds that you don't have to actually shove into your ear canal. And since my earbuds broke and the in-ear ones hurt too much, I finally decided to jump on the bandwagon and wear some super retro-ish headphones.These headphones specifically have great sound quality; I'm not audiophile, grant it, but they're better than any Skullcandy earbuds that claim to have high bass but are really just so muffled that it all sounds the same. I bought a similar pair as these from Sony for about the same price, and I can tell that these are much better in terms of sound quality. The chord length is ridiculously long, but it comes with plastic clip to wrap excess chord around.If you want affordable, quality headphones, I'd highly suggest these and others by Sennheiser.

p3882
sg5
VI must say I've been a bit silly. I Purchased those headphones to do some monitoring of audio I record for different project.I saw that they described it as having deep bass, but I thought it meant just regular good bass, not overboosted ones...Definitely not a flat frequency response, so if you need that don't buy these.The bass is actually way too strong for me, even to listen to music and not for accuracy purposes, but then again, I guess some people may like it this way.It does offer good sound quality if you tweak the equalizer, so in the end you can reach a nice listening experience, but still no good for monitoring audio.The quality is a little cheap and they hurt after about 1 to 2 hours, but then again, they are really cheap...If you want a cheap pair with deep bass, go for it!

VBEST HEADPHONES FOR YOUR MONEY
p3888
sg5
VI absolutely love these headphones, thus why i was shouting the subject line. They are super affordable, are well made and have great sound. I bought myself a pair, my buddy a pair for his birthday, my brother a pair for Christmas, and my coworker just bought a pair on my recommendation. I could not be happier. A friend of mine is a sound engineer and he gave them 2 thumbs up after he tried them out. He uses studio quality headphones and he said these sounds as good as pairs that cost $200+. They are comfortable, the cord is really long(I am tall so that's not a problem), and do a good job of blocking out ambient noise. Anyone looking for a set of nice headphones, that does not want to mortgage their house to pay for them, should BUY THESE. Possibly the best purchase i have made on Amazon (I have bought over 150 things).

VHaven't bought a pair of headphones since college (1979!), and I had what I thought was the best light weight headphone available at the time, the Senn HD414--I didn't think technology could improve that headphone or its excellent price at the time--the discounters sold it for under $20.  These HD202's are every bit as good--and even lighter--how do they do it?The HD202 produces a gorgious sound powered by my ZUNE--I never realized you could power a big headphone with a portable device--so many talk about carrying another ampilfier--not this headphone.  It is my new walking companion--and it keeps my ears warm for my winter walks.  I will never use an in-ear phone/bud again.  I love them.Leave those high priced headphones on the shelf--the HD202 should satisfy most critical ears.  A true bargain.

VI got these earphones to use at the gym, to watch the TV while on the treadmill.  They work very well and do a good job of blocking outside noise.  There is one thing that I do not like about them, and that is the length of the cord.  The distance from the start of the cord where it attaches to the headphones, to the other end, is 125 ". The earphones come with a thing on which to wind the cord, but I am finding it inconvenient, as at the gym, it moves around and slips, and the cord not wound is easily tangled. If you want earphones to attach to an electronic device across the room, and need 10 feet of cord, this may work well for you. I am still trying different ways to wind the cord so it is not in the way.  However, like I said, the earphones themselves are fine to use, and they are also comfortable to wear.

VMy son used these daily with his iPod & iPhone for a year before the left speaker died. I took it apart to see if one of the wires had become disconnected, but the soldered connections were sound. Taken apart, I was able to see the (expected) cheap construction.The headphones were not especially comfortable for me, generating sweaty ears in a matter of minutes. My son could and did wear them for an hour or more at a stretch.Sound quality is OK, certainly not outstanding.The cord is way too long, something that appears to be a common feature on similar headphones. I would hope that headphones would last for more than a year, but for the price, and given the abuse they received, I can't really complain. I'll be replacing these with a better quality and hopefully more durable set.

These are some of the best headphones I have had, ever.- The build is simplistic, comfortable (depending on your ear / head size of course), and not ugly at all. Very catchy style.- The cord is more than enough which is great. It also includes a cord holder contraption to hold the length of the cord of your choice.Overall I give these headphones 10/10!Must get it if your looking for a great pair of headphones at a cheap price.

VI recently purchased these headphones from amazon as my first set of over-the-ear style headphones hoping for a better sound quality than the older foldable and portable Sennheisers (which I am still quite satisfied with).  i was hoping for something that would sit more comfortably on my ears with a equivalent sound quality.Unfortunately, I have to say, these headphones didn't meet either of my expectations.  After about 15 minutes of listening, my ears get uncomfortably warm and force me to take the headphones off.  In addition, the sound quality was in my amatuer view was muddy compared to the previous Sennheisers.The cord design is too long and the wrap around device they have added is heavy and unweildy.  Next time I will go to try out a set of headphones before purchasing online.

VI've been in the market for headphones ever since Walmart and Target have been making a big deal about selling earbugs that have to be jammed into your ear. Not a huge fan. Anyways, my partner referred me to these after she saw me hovering over some Beats by Dre, saying these were hands down a better deal and quality. Welp. I don't exactly know if she's wrong, buuut these definitely didn't leave my wallet crying. I love the sound quality of these, and so far as everyone says, the only down side has been the extremely long cord that is a nightmare during GYM use. But, given the price, and quality, I don't really see these losing a star over that. My partner seems to like it as I've already walked in on her dancing around the room with these bad boys - guess that long cable is useful to some people afterall.

VI absolutely love these headphones - they're so much better than earbuds. The sound is great, and they fit reasonably comfortably, although there's a little pinching around the ears. I'd rather there be a retractable cord, because the huge cord holder is ridiculously gaudy, but I guess more cord is better than less. The ears are adjustable, and the padding feels nice, as long as they're not on for long periods. I'm not really a sound guru, but I think the bass is good, and there's a really nice range at all volumes. I have to keep the volume low, so it's not like I'm maxing out its capabilities by any means. I really like them for just sitting and listening to music or TV on my laptop. The cords don't come out of the ears, so they get annoyingly in-the-way sometimes, but it's not an exceptionally big deal.

VThey're good for the price I guess. However they are painful to wear for any extended amount of time. On ear headphones really shouldnt be as tight as these are, though I suppose they would fall off more if they weren't as tight. I just dont think that they are particularly well designed in terms of shape.The cord holder thing can be useful, but the cord falls out of the two notches that are on it WAY too easily. It's a hassle, but you can't really get rid of it because the cord is so long without it.The sound quality is alright. Its noticeably worse than the good, more expensive pair that I have now. But that's the thing. They lasted me a year (they didnt break, I just got fed up with them) which in my opinion was worth the price tag, because they're really cheap for headphones.

I am a female and I have a small head, they fit perfectly. I even wear them to the gym so it cancels the noise of others around me while I work out. The headphones stay on. If you have big ears- not recommended. The headphones are adjustable, but not by much.When listening to music and so forth, the speaker quality in them are amazing, The ear pieces detach and are able to share with a friend. They come with a long cord, a  very long cord. I just place a big knot in the center of it while I work out.Great price, quality of material, comfortable and worth every penny. Definitely recommended.

VFits well for a big head like mine. They provide you with an adapter if you want to connect it to a phono jack. So if you are into DJing or an audio mixer guy this would be handy. But am sure you guys would have a tini - phono adapter anyways. The cord is really long. maybe 6-8 feet. But then they provide you with a belt hook in which you can roll the cable and just use how much cable you need and hide the rest. That way it doesnt look all that messy.The sound quality was pretty good when i used it and the ear cusions are very comfortable initially. I am giving it a 4 star because its a great headphone with a great price but then your ear starts paining after 30 mins of use. But that could me just my problem. But if you see the same ear hurting issue from others then beware. I bought it for $20

p3993
sg5
VI prefer over the ear headphones for comfort and less outside noise coming in.  I was actually considering buying headphones that cost in the HUNDREDS when I came upon these and thought "What the heck, it's only $20.00."  Well, I received them, put them on (they adjust -- another bonus) and turned on the music.  YES!  This is what it's all about!I don't sit for extended time periods listening to music so I can only say that after one hour, I had no ear pain like other reviewers state.The long cord can be a plus or a minus, but I think of it as a plus.  The enclosed thing that you can use to wrap the cord to make it shorter makes it nice, but I most likely won't use that much.  I move around my desk so the long cord makes it nice.You can't go wrong with these.

p3999

VI have been using these headphones for about three weeks and they are a great fit and produce high quality sound.  The cost of this product is very reasonable.  I read some of the reviews about this product before I bought it.  There were some comments about the headphones becoming warm in a short length of time.  I have not found this to be true for me.  I've worn them several times for 60 to 90 minutes straight and my ears do not get warm.  They are very comfortable.  The only negative thing I have to say (and this is minor) is there is no volume control on the headphones so the volume has to be adjusted on the devise I'm listening to.  My previous headphones had a volume control so it took me a few days to get use to that.  Overall I'm very satisfied with the product and also with the price.

Almost had my eardrums blown out lol...of course when there was no sound I cranked it up on the amp and when switched...well you can guess the rest lol. But anywho these headphones are fantastic for the price from what I read Sennheiser is a pretty good name in electronics but even then I thought for this price there not gonna be anything special, got them on right now and of course I had to listen to Pink Floyds Dark Side IMO the best headphone listening album out there and the sound is amazing soooo crisp and the bass is booming. Would I recommend these to a friend...yes I would.

p4011
sg5
VI just opened these and tried them out and these are the best headphones for the money!  They have a lot of bass, which I like, but it isn't overpowering and muddy like some can get.  I got them on sale for $14.99 and they sound AWESOME!  I am not an audiophile by any means, but I like my music to sound good.  I listen to MP3s most of the time and I will use these at work connected to my phone.  The cord is long enough that I can reach to the other side of my desk without dragging my phone across my desk.  They block out most of the surrounding noise.  I can barely here the keys on my keyboard clicking as I am typing this.  The last set of headphones cost a little more than these and they don't sound as good.  As I said before, the bass is great and you can hear the highs clearly as well.

VI've purchased many of these headphone sets over the years! Noise-muffling--yes!! You can still hear outside sounds to some extent, but those sounds are 1000 times more muffled than with ear buds, and the sound quality is 1000 times better, too! I've had some trouble with the cord shorting out (a couple of times) after EXTENDED use (while working out, which is probably not what they're designed for! Too much twisting around--duh!) The good news there is that both times this happened, I just boxed them up and sent them to Sennheiser, and they replaced them, straight up! And quickly, too! (They'll do this as long as you send them your original receipt. Instructions for returns can be found on Sennheiser's website, under repairs.) Bottom line: These headphones are WELL WORTH the expense!

VSo I  opened up the package and put these through a test of different genres of music.I played Pink Floyd - Division Bell. These headphones really capture every subtle sound in the song with clarity.Bassnectar and Skrillex - I think the headphones really shine here with the bass, put a smile on my face and pumped me up to go run 10 miles with these babies on.Very comfortable to wear, with a cushion on the headband even. Incredibly good noise cancellation. Can't even hear myself scream with these things on, I bought these for use on the treadmill because I hate the sound of myself running so these will work great. I'll post in a month to update on how they stand up to the gym. If your thinking about buying these, you can't go wrong for the price range.

VMy parents have owned a pair of these for a couple of years now, so when my Philips died it was suggested I get the same. I have now owned these headphones for almost 3 months and they still work.I'm no audiophile, so for me the sound quality is just fine. I also really like the long cord, and how it can be removed from the ear pieces. I tend to mangle wires while working, so being able to replace the cable is a huge plus. Also, the cheap price does not reflect a cheap build quality. The plastic is sturdy, not thin and overly flexible. However, I do find the plastic band is at times awkward and (depending on what clips I'm wearing) poorly placed. And the clip for the cord is completely useless.I am very please with these headphones and would buy them again.

p4041
sg5
VSo this is a great pair of headphones when it comes to build quality and sound quality. I cannot give an expert opinion on the latter as I just use it for listening to music or watching videos on my laptop. It has a VERY long cord which is why the included belt clip is useful for properly folding the long cord.My only grief with this is that my ears start hurting after a few hours on these. And I cannot keep them on for too long when its warm. But I think that is more an issue with all over the ear head phones. My head might be a little to big too and while vertical adjustment is possible, nothing can be done about the horizontal. And this is something I have seen with more over the ear headphones. So, all in all, good stuff. Just a small chance it might hurt after a while.

VWas really happy with this purchase but almost wanted to give it a 4 out of 5 for one reason only. The earmuffs feel really small on my ears almost like it doesn't cover them completely. If you wear them for long hours it leaves your ears feeling sweaty. Also the tight grip hurts! I don't know if I have a big head but I never had this problem before it feels like when I wrap them around my head it's squeezing me and only by taking them off every half hour can I manage an 8 hour work day. That should have made this review a 4 but that aside the quality of the headphones are amazing even the plastic (took me forever to remove the plastic case) I get to hear these lower notes in songs I never knew that had them. Certainly not the best headphones but for this price I am very happy.

p4077
sg5
VBought on Black Friday for $19.99, been using at work for 2 days now.Overall, pretty good headphones. Audio quality is great to me, but I am not a big audio guy. I previously used a pair of Ipod ear buds I had since '06. The pads on top and ears are really soft. It squeezes my head from the sides a bit, but I've got a pretty big head. I just need to take them off after an hour of use. Also, if you want the pads to completely go around your ears and not touch them, you better have some small ears. The inside of the ear pads is only 1" x 2". However, the pads still make a pretty good seal to keep out ambient noise. I also wear glasses, and I do not have much trouble making them work while I wear them. Only a little adjustment, but I have small frames.

VFor less than $30 I am extremely satisfied with the sound being reproduced by these headphones. Your expectations for clarity, definition, transparency, depth, separation ...  of sound needs to be somewhat restrained, as these would be considered lower priced headphones. But my ears are more than content. The bass is accentuated, especially noticeable with Hip-Hop; but with the right volume it is nice and tight. Headphones are comfortable and light.  I also have the Audio-Technica ATH -M50 which do a better job with all the sound attributes mentioned above (I'm sure the experts have more) but they were ~ $100 more. I' m sure there is a sweet spot between the money spent and the sound you get, for me both these headphone do a great job with the money and sound equation.

VIf you don't have a lot of money but want great headphones, look no further! These headphones have great sound quality, comfort, and durability compared to what I usually use (headphones and ear buds of about this price or cheaper). Now I haven't used any expensive high quality headphones before, but when it comes to quality for the price, I doubt these headphones are easy to beat. My first pair broke after a year (which is mostly my fault since I'm terrible with headphone jacks), so I bought a new pair of these because I highly recommend them.If your main concern is price but you still want great headphones, I would recommend these.If you want the highest quality headphones and are willing to pay any price, you should probably look elsewhere.

VOK, I just bought these and I've had them on for 2hr now. So this is my initial assessment.First off, I wish I had payed more attention to the details of the "cons" listed in others reviews.Pro's:These sound incredibly good. Easily comparable to those listed at 99.00 and more. Perfect separation of highs and lows and very little EQ adjustment will be needed for all computer environments.  For the money, I don't think there is a comparable set of over ear headphones for this money.Con's:My ears are sweating. To me, it's something I didn't think would be an issues but due to this these are not extended ware headphones unless you in a extremely controlled environment.All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase.

VI bought these headphones for a couple of reasons. I love Sennheiser headphones, they are loved all around the internet, the cable is very long, and they were selling for $25!!! These really are the best headphones you can buy for $25 or even $40. The sound is very crisp and clean, the bass is very good and it is not overpowering, they are very solidly built, and they have very comfortable pads.  The only problem that I have with them is the fact that they  are not really around-ear headphones or on-ear. They are in between sort of, and they do hurt my ears a little after a few hours of use.  Everything else though completely cancels that one con, and I totally recommend them for anyone looking for a good set of headphones for your computer or tv.

VOk, So i dont normally do reviews but these headphones are great! I bought these headphones with the FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier to use the audio out on my TV to play my PS3 and Xbox while the wifey sleeps, and i am blown away! For 22 bucks these headphones are awesome and sound even better when you run them through the fiio mini amp. The only two issues i had were the ear cup size, i have a pretty fat head but theyre still pretty dang comfortable, and they have there only little static buzz, but if you adjust the out coming audio (TV, Ipod, Phone, ect.) and turn up the mini amp it sounds fine. I would highly recommend these to any budget conscious gamer or music lover. Dead Space 2 Has never been more fun :)FiiO E5 Headphone Amplifier

VFor the price, these are a good pair of headphones.  I am not an audiophile by any stretch of imagination, but am bugged by noises that some people may not notice. I was not able to notice any audio issues with these headphones. The bass comes in loud and clear as do the mids and highs.As others have noted, the headphone cups are somewhere in the middle of "on ear" and "over ear".  The padding is pretty soft, but does get to be un comfortable  after a while.  They block out sound okay, but not perfectly.It has a really looooooooong cord. The included cable management device is helpful, but if you're not expecting/needing this length of cord, it may be a negative.  Especially if you want to use these as a portable pair.

p4124
sg5
VEdit: After a couple months of fairly uncomfortable use, either I got used to these or they broke in, I don't know which. But they are much more comfortable, and sound, to my ears, pretty good. I think the tight fit helps to block external sound as well. Also, THE CORD IS REALLY ANNOYING. I don't know why Sennheiser puts ~10 ft cords on their cheapo headphones. How many people are really using these in the studio vs on an MP3 player or in front of a computer? Not many, and the long cord is a pain. The only good use is when you want to kick back and watch a movie, but I would much rather buy an extension for when I need it than carry a wad of cord in my pocket all the time. Keep this in mind if you are thinking of purchasing these for mobile use.

VI've used headphones each day for work for the better part of a decade. Early on, I tried different brands and types, but none gave me the sound quality nor the comfort I desired.In 2006, I discovered the Sennheiser HD 202 headphones and have not looked back. They have a far-superior sound quality than other brands I've used, and the headset fits perfectly over the ears and head with great comfort.This is the third pair I've purchased over the years as using them each day for about 8 hours does create some expected wear and tear. I've gotten about 3 years use each of of my previous two sets, which I am more than happy with given the cost (which has run me about $25-$35 each set).Excellent product; highly recommend!

I also recently went to a local high school basketball game, where a local tv station was covering the game, and the camera woman and the man on the sound board were both wearing these headphones! Professional TV personnel! These really are an awesome pair of headphones, especially for the price.

However if you have a small head with small ears im sure these would be perfect.

VAt work, several folks have the $300+ Bose noise-cancelling headphones.  I have these.  At one point, I borrowed a buddy's headphones so I could see how great the Bose are and how I absolutely must sell my liver so I can have a pair.  I used them for an afternoon, and found that they made my ears sweatier, and although the noise cancelling does work - the over-the-ear design of these Sennheisers worked pretty darn well as well.  Plus, for the music I was listening to, I actually preferred the sound of these Sennheisers to the Bose.  I don't need to keep a stock of batteries, either.So to make it clear in case it's not - I tried the Bose noise-cancelling headphones and prefer these $25 wonders.  I think I'll go spend $275 on myself.

VI use these everyday at work to drown the cube chatter; the sound quality for these head phones are some of the best I've heard in all the ones I've owned over the years, especially when you consider their relatively low cost.The only reason I didn't give them a 5, was because they hurt my ears after an hour or two of using them. Either my head is too wide (I'm 6'4"), or the head phones are built for child size craniums, either way they can be a pain to wear. The only temporary solution I've found is to have them stretched overnight by wrapping them around my PC tower. This stops them from squishing my ears the next morning, but the go back to being a pain by lunchtime. I'll deal with them for now until I find something better.

VI am not good with headphones.  I lose them or the band across the head breaks or something happens.  Not with the Sennheiser headphones.  Each ear has its own wire to connect to the main wire, there are raised bumps on the left side so you know if you are putting them on correctly and it comes with a cord winder.  I really hate long cords on things because they get tangled up, but with these headphones, they include a little piece of plastic that you use to wrap the cord in...very handy!  The sound is excellent, too!I liked these so much, a few weeks later I got a pair for my son.  When the right ear stopped working, I simply send them back for a replacement.I highly recommend the Sennheiser HD 202II Professional Headphones!

VI originally bought a GameCom 377 Gaming Headset and was very dissatisfied with the sound quality. After looking around and reading a few great reviews of the Sennheiser HD 202 I gave it a try. As soon as I put them on I noticed how much kick they have. The Bass is very good and it has a pretty wide sound range. Needless to say I shipped the other headset back for a refund.Pros:Price, this is an incredible headset for such a cheap price.Very comfortable, can wear for hours and forget they're even on.Noise cancelling is quite good, my PC fans are barely noticeable even before I have sound playing.Good cord length, comes with thing to wrap it up if it's too long for you.Cons:No audio dial on the cord.

VOnce you finally free them from the packaging, these were exactly what I wanted. They are a nice looking matte black and have a nice, clean look overall. Some reviews said they are a tight fit, but they stay on my head while I'm doing chores and stuff, so, that may be a good thing for some. If you're careful, you can heat them at the top with a hairdryer and stretch them out a tad. Worked fine. They sound great. I liked the price. I like Sennheiser stuff. I like the fact that they don't collapse every time I take them off, like my $100 Shure's do. I like the cord winder belt clip thing. I like that the cables will disconnect at the muffs in case you ever step on the cord while walking. For 25 bucks? you absolutely can't beat these.

VI got these on august 6. I popped them out of the box and tried them on. they were very comfortable compared to the lame ear buds that I had used before. you can make them larger or smaller for your head. I plugged them in and they have awesome sound. way, way better then my old ear buds they make my ear buds look and sound like trash! I think that to sum it up don't buy ear buds but get these. they are of reasonable price and for less you get great sound. one more thing I for got to say is that the have tons of extension. and to hide that cord they include a plastic wire holder where you can wrap the cord up and hide it in your pocket so the no one knows the extra cord is there. I love these headphones! I recommend you get them!

VNo way are these headphones intended to be a top of the line item, however it is not described as the best. I AM 100% satisfied with them and the price I paid. I only needed a pair for testing and not for the Ultimate Sound Quality. However, they DO sound as good as one would expect from a product that cost as little as these. The headband and ear pads are comfortable and quality. Comes with a cord stow away device that you can wrap the cord around for neat storage. VERY impressing length of the cord...ELEVEN INCHES!! Cord is on the flexible side as opposed to some less expensive headphones that have cheap STIFF cords. They are very lightweight. Overall, I think they were a great bargain and I'd buy another pair if I needed them.

p4213
sg5
VEven compared to other headphones in this same price range and with a closed back, these are very muddy / muffled / veiled poor sounding headphones with an artificial boost of bass.  The added bass would be ok if I could hear any clarity or detail in the upper mids and above.  They claim to go to 18khz but they start to fall off quickly at 12khz.  Sennheiser may have great headphones at higher price points but they obviously cripple their cheaper products.  I ended up with a pair of Koss R-80 which are about the same price and do not suffer any of these limitations.  I gave two stars and not one simply because they do look good and appear to be well built and were comfortable but I was always disappointed everytime I put them on.

VMaybe I'm old fashioned, but I can't handle earbuds - they hurt my ears and don't deliver the sound I want, and they're often more expensive than I can understand.  I love these headphones, and you can't go wrong for $20.These, though, are nice, old-school DJ headphones that cancel enough noise that you can use them while someone in the same room talks on the phone, but they don't turn you deaf to the world.  I use these to edit video in a shared office, and I never have trouble with the audio quality OR with hearing my officemate if she needs me for something.  They're very comfortable and mold around your ears perfectly.  Since they aren't wireless (and for the price, they shouldn't be), the extra-long cord is very helpful.

For some reason they arrived at my door within 2 days, which I was extremely impressed with, so big thanks to the seller. But the sound quality is absolutely exquisite, which was surprising given the fair price. I've been listening to music religiously since I got them! Also I'm a very small female and they comfortably fit both me and my gigantic boyfriend perfectly, which is pretty uncommon to find. They're easily the best value I've found on here so far.

VMy five star rating is based mainly on value and sound. In this price range you are getting cans that produce a very, very good and balanced sound which work well with all kinds of music. Good bass, mids and highs but all balanced together to produce a pleasant sound across the board. Better than Soundcandy Hesh 2s and the like, which cost more but produce muddy sound. Now they are relatively cheap and they aren't the most comfortable pair of cans I've listened to but for an hour or so, they are fine. The build quality is well, competent. We'll see how long they last. If you are on a limited budget and want to hear your music and smile at the quality, you should be pleasantly surprised at just how nice these headphones sound.

VI was looking at all the over-ear headphones and these stood out to me immediately just because of their good looks. I ordered them on Friday after reading multiple reviews and seeing the continuous great ratings. I just got them in and they sound AMAZING. My music sounds fuller than it ever has, without being too overpowering. I used to use Apple buds or other bud style headphones and these are worlds better than those. I originally contemplated purchasing Beats Solo HD headphones, but I'd rather not spend $200 on a pair of headphones I'm only using on my MacBook Pro for iTunes and to watch movies. I would recommend these headphones to ANYONE. They sound amazing, they're extremely cost effective, and they're very attractive.

p4249
sg5
VI used to have a pair of Sennheiser HD 202 headphones.  Best value ever.  They were $20 and easily outperformed everything else in the store in the sub-$60 price range.  I bought them and abused them until the cable connections got finnicky, but it was easy to pry them apart and re-solder things.  Did this a few times until I lost the headphones.Checking recently, I can only find the HD 202 II headphones for $30, but they look EXACTLY the same as the old ones--and $10 more expensive.  I bought them, and can confirm that they are EXACTLY THE SAME as the old model.  Only difference being price.  They're still the best value out there, but I'm not happy that Sennheiser faked an upgrade just to make a few more bucks.

VI bought these because my 7 year old Grado SR60s are going back to the factory for new cords and pads. 30 bucks shipped wasnt bad and I can always pass them down to my kids.I was expecting good cans due to the reviews. Theyve gone through 2 hours of burn in and I tried them and am a bit disappointed. The sound is bright, just like Japanese mini-components of yore. You know, the 3000 watts PMPO kind. Its a clean sound, but nothing inspiring. More like a really good clock radio. If you like the sound of BOSE or Sony, you may like these.I'n not totally bummed out because they were 30 dollars. Just thought I'd get a steal, got value. They pretty much sound like most quality offerings in the price range.

VI was instantly impressed by the sound quality of these headphones. I never expected that for the $22 price. I gave a high rating because of the value.Pluses: - long (10') cord - sound quality (the bass response is right there, where I'd never expect it on headphones)Minuses - The ear cups are not quite as deep as needed, so there is some bottoming out on my ear lobes. The cups are also narrow along the horizontal axis of the side of head so they crowd my ears a bit. They are easy enough to get on, however, if you just slide them forward a bit and back a bit before centering on your ear lobe. - The pressure of the head band is a bit hard for my extra large sized head. The molded plastic is not adjustable.

VAfter an hour of reading reviews on headphones in this approximate price range, I chose the MEElectronics HT-21's. After another hour (of listening), decided to return them and purchase the Sennheiser HD 202 II's. If the HT-21's are worth the $29, I would value the HD 202 II's at $60+. Much better sound reproduction across the range. I was a bit concerned about the bass response being too much, or heavy, but that's not the case. I listen on an iPhone and iPod with the equalizer on flat. These are comfortable for over the ear cans and I can wear them for as long as I want, so far maybe 2 hours or so. 99 times out of 100 I would say that you get what you pay for, this time I think I got more... terrific deal, I paid $21.89!

VI use these with my digital piano, and they handle the task very well.  Smaller headphones can't handle a loud piano performance, but with these ones, I can play myself deaf, no problem!

They are also comfortable on ears, so you can play for hours at a time. Finally they good quality.  The first pair of these that I bought last me two years.

I even go to the gym with it...BUT!!!Who the hell designed a headphone with such a long cord? Come on, who in the world plugs his headphones to a computer and goes 15 miles aways to listen to music??

I realized that the bass response of these headphones was not too different from that of some cheap in-ear headphones my friends had.Not too impressed by the plastic make. I have to be really careful when I carry it around, as if fear they might snap or bend or lose their shape any moment.All in all okay-ish. Good if you keep them at your desk at all times. Nice looong cable which would allow you to move around if you are at your desk. Its a good buy for its price and ideal for someone who just needs a neat pair of headphones.

But the tone quality they provide, the fullness of sound, overall comfort, long cord, ear and head cushions make these one of the best values at this price point.  I have a variety uses for them....bass guitar practice, i-gadgets, laptop computer and vintage stereo equipment...I will upgrade later for my vintage stereo equipment, but these will remain my everyday workhorse for non-specialized uses where I still want/need discernable sound quality.

HD 202 II are just superior) and nice isolation.For 20 dollars, I think it's impossible to get any better.Bottomline: If you want a pair of good and unexpensive headphones to use with your iPod, this is your choice.

Closed back, so your co-workers don't have to know you're blasting 2 Live Crew all morning.I normally use "DJ" headphones, so whenever I put these on they sound a little thin and light on bass by comparison, but I stop noticing after a song or two. Construction is all plastic all the time. The cord is stupid long (they include a winder), but it doesn't cramp my style - I'm just using these at a desk. If you want to move around with these on, I don't recommend them (get something with a coiled cord).For under $20, you got 'em for cheap; they're well worth that.

VI've tested these with various types of music.  I'd say they're rather lacking in the high end.  Nice at the low end, though.  They aren't comfortable.  The earpads could stand to be a little bigger.  The cord goes to each ear piece rather than just one side.  This is annoying and makes it a little tougher to quickly know which is left and which is right.  The cable is really long (10 feet) which is more than I like but may fit your needs.  There is an included belt clip to wrap the extra around.  Note this clip is pretty darn big and isn't something you can just leave hanging on the cable suspended in the air.  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't purchase these again.  At least they're pretty cheap.

This, I assume, is so called "marketing product" it is so good and so cheap, that it will let you thinking - If I can get this for 20 - what then I can get for 60 ?The sound quality is close to the some of the premium Philips headphones products, which for me are favorite for the sound, which does not annoy even after longer period of listening.

The sound quality is great once you get used to using these headphones (the excessive bass took me by surprise at first listen) and break them in properly (I had them play my computer library of music for hours while I left to go about my daily routine for a day).Bought them for 20 bucks during the black friday deal, and I'm glad I bought them.Would recommend to friends.

(I guess I was expecting the music to sound like it was coming from tinny headphones). Crystal clear!  I also like the cord winder, because the cord is so long, its nice to keep it wound up a bit shorter when using these with a piano.We loved these so much, we ordered a 2nd pair so we could use them when playing duet on the piano.

VThe headphones have a nice sound and is generally comfortable for me. Although after a couple of hours it starts to hurt my ear. My biggest complaint is that the wire is waayyy to long. When using the headphones for music on my phone, i have to place the whole wire in my pocket and when i take my phone out to get a call or I want to change a song, the whole wire often falls out and I have to put the long wire back into my pocket. Even though they give you something to wrap the wire with, it is still annoying to roll it up everytime and can still come loose every now and then. Overall I rated it a 3 because the sound and comfort is good for the price, but the long wire just bothers me too much.

VI this is GREAT headset for the price.I use it to listen Pop music and my voice (karaoke). These headphones excel  in high and medium range. Base is softer, Range separation is excellent phones are very clear. Again probably open headphones would give you better quality, but for the price I think these are excellent.Durability: they look OK, I am not planning to take them for the trip, an if for any reason they break I will just buy something else. If they last for a year for this price I am happy.Cons: this is more a personal preference and I did not take oout star. I don't like when cord is not user replaceable. in most cases cord breaks faster then headphones.

Vi tested these headphones via online sound test on frequency response, spectral flatness, dynamic range, bass shaker and lot of other things. it performed from satisfactory to very good. what can you expect else from 23$ headphones? i've been using it at office for various things and before that I used it couple times at home for movie editing with some sounds and music involved.. i'm very pleased with it. Unless you are crazy about sound quality and intend to spend more than 200$ on headphones, these headphones will more than satisfy you. In this case you pay much less than you get: it's no worse than most 150-180$ headphones i've tried, and i've tried quite a few from various manufacturers.

VFor $23 bucks and free shipping, this set of Sennheiser headphones is a great value. The bass is great on this...probably not as good as $300 phones, but why waste all that money on that? Mine is fine - but the cable is too long...and the phones themselves are a bit small for my head. Yes, I have a big melon head...but for a gal or someone smaller, these phones will do nicely. Got this for the wife and she loves it with her ipad. I'm not sure about the long term strength of the headset, though. The plastic headset feels like it could snap if someone accidentally sits on it. I know this from prior exp. with this same mishap. We'll see. Still a good qaulity set of headphones. Solid four stars.

Vthis item is perfect for the ipod. i used alot headphones, this headphone is not good at middle to high range. however, the bass is very good, and the high range is acctually not that bad. definetly wort the price.for the comfort, i could say not too bad at this price range. but i can only tolerate for 1 hr i think. this headphone is not close type, at least cannot close my ear perfectly, that's the reason it is not that confirt.if you do not like the bass and comfort, i think the best way is to get PX200. much more balance, but higher price. or if you like the great bass with better middle to high end, you may consider the DENON AH1100. but those are several price higher than this one.

VI listen to a lot of electronic music. These headphones nail all the highs, mids and lows. They will make all of your music sound magical. Every time someone recommends some really expensive pair of headphones, I bring these up. I honestly feel that if you don't have a very expensive amplifier to power your headphones, you're throwing your money away if you get any headphones other than these!Outside of the sound quality, they're pretty comfortable. I have a pretty big head and I've worn them all night several times with only a few breaks needed. The only negative thing I can think is they're not very aesthetically pleasing. They look kind of geeky. I don't care though, they're awesome.

VFor the price, these headphones seem of decent quality and have pretty good sound. A lot has been said about them already. I'll just add some quick pros and cons:Pros:PriceGood bassDecent cord length (I can plug these into the back of my 47-inch TV and still sit far enough away for a comfortable viewing distance.Cons:The bass seems to be just a little too pronounced, at the expense of high notes.The earcups are on the small side. My ears are not unusually big but they barely fit inside, and it takes some twisting to get the cups situated comfortably.No volume control on the headphones. You'll need to control volume at the source.

Vi bought this for the numerous positive results but this item is just flat out uncomfortable.  i usually always give positive results but i need to let people consider it before buying it.  overall this product is worth the money but it just hurts your ears cuz the headphones are too small.  after about 5 minutes of using it, i had to take it off, it hurts my ears way too much.  but the sound gets really loud and the quality is good.  it has a decent amount of base.  say if your friend puts it on blast over his ears, you can barely hear what he is listening too which is a positive thing.  but if your used to listening to in ear headphones (like me) then you will hate this product.  peace

VI'm no expert and I've only had a few crappy headphones in my life, but I knew that Sennheiser has a great reputation. So I bought this pair for just over 20 bucks, and listened to my Yahama clavinova piano, and what a wonderful sound! Honestly the speakers on the clavinova make the pianon sound like a bit of a cheap machine, but through the earphones it was pretty much as good as any grand piano I have ever heard, Steinways included. I am more amazed at the sound the machine makes than the heaphones, but nevertheless the latter are truly deep and rich - possibly biased more to the lower notes but I am not sure. My piano sounds like a concert grand now and I don't even wake up the kids!

Headphone wise, coming from someone who isn't an audiophile at all and normally uses Apple earbuds and thinks those are amazing, these are really nice sounding! Bass isn't too strong, but it's at a good level. It also blocks out sound well, I can't even really hear the keys on my keyboard clacking when I have them on. I really like them! They're a bit tight but that doesn't bother me too much. I'd definitely recommend these to someone who are in need of reasonably cheap headphones and can't afford 150 dollar Beats.

I compared them to another model that Sennheiser makes that my friend has and they're almost on the same level despite a 30 dollar price difference. The only thing that's bad is the amount of cord. This may be good for some, but not really for me. I ended up getting one of those twist ties they have on packages of bread to wrap the chord and then just got a ziptie to make it easier. That's the main reason it's 4 stars and not 5. After having these, I don't want to go back to regular earbuds. I would definitely recommend these.

VNo complaints on the sound - it's very clear and a good balance of bass to treble and not at all tinny so that part is good.  They're a little snug though.  Also the cord is pretty long - I do prefer a slightly longer cord and this was more than enough length even for me.Good little pair of headphones if your ears aren't overly sensitive to the pressure of the headphones.  My son likes them fine and has no issues but they are way to tight for my head and I don't have a large head either! (only 5' tall witha  correspondingly small head lol).  Anyhow these sound great for what you pay for them and the pressure thing won't bug everyone but it was just enough to deduct a star.

VAlthough these were listed as "professional-headphones" I bought these to listen to audio books and music on the bus to and from work. I found these to be quite comfortable and had more than enough power to drowned-out the external noise. I actually noticed bass in certain songs and special audio effects in books I have never noticed before. The ear pads come off in case you want to share with someone, which is nice. The only draw back for me, which could be a plus for many, is that the cord is extremely long.This works great for in house use, but winding up an extremely long cord  and shoving it in your pocket/bag is awkward. Regardless I would buy these again for the price.

The best thing I like about these is the fact that no matter how loud you pump up the music, NOBODY CAN HEAR IT! That was a major selling point for me, due to the fact that I have a "hater" in the office that I work in. This fool was complaining about my music being too loud, and I had on buds! Anywho, I'm very pleased with my purchase, and I encourage others to follow suit! You will not be disappointed!

I actually can enjoy the music again AND hear in both ears more than two months out of the package.  Seinheiser damages their rep making throwaway phones like these.  I take my ATH M30s home on weekends for relaxing.  And bought a pair for my wife and daughter.  From Merle Haggard to Van Halen to Mozart, it's all great!  The Seins?  I'd never listen through for enjoyment.  And unless you're extra careful, they don't last!

VI ordered these headphones to use with a backup desktop computer in my home office. They are comfortable and the sound quality is excellent. I'm not sure how you could do better in terms of value. They are crisp and clear at all volume levels and with all types of audio, from YouTube to iTunes to Windows Media Player. They come with an oval plastic piece around which you can loop excess cord, which is a nice accessory that I didn't see mentioned in the product description. The cord is long and, since I use them sitting at the desk, the ability to neatly loop the extra cord instead of having it hanging loose is helpful. This is an excellent product at a really attractive price.

Vi was amused to find a very, very long cord attached to this when I opened the package. It also shipped with a plastic spool thing that you could wind the cord onto and clip to a belt. The sound quality is top notch, as is the protection from outside sounds. They are lightly constructed, and would be better suited to use indoors where the speakers will not become detached from the plastic headpiece. If it does not bother you to snap one or both of them back on each time, and you can think of some way to get rid of the extra cord, these phones are good for hiking and work.  I am not kidding about the cord, and you can move around a large room with these if you unwind it!

I have been wearing it now continuously for 25 minutes and already they started hurting my ear about 8-minutes ago.  Now for the second negative, the sound is bass dominant.  On to the positive.  The cable is very long which I really like.  I would return it but I really need a headphone so I will keep these for now until I find a true over-ear headphone.

I use this while listen to Pandora, and I am amazed by the sound quality that's coming out of this headset. Comfortable on the ears (I don't know what's deal is with the people saying it's not comfortable at all).  The padding sits on your ears (rather than enclosing them), but it sits well.Cons:Poor sound isolation.  Other people can hear what you are listening even at medium volume.Long usage tends to get your ears sweaty.  So once in a while, I would shift it to let my ears breathe (which would make it audible even more to outsider).

VThe Sennheiser 202 II Headphones are a great value.  This is my 2nd set.  The only shortcoming is that the wire grommets into the headphones crimp the cables so tightly, the frail thread-like wires will eventually shear right through and you'll lose one side or the other.  I repaired one side when it went out by cutting out the bad section at the entry point to the headphone (about 2") to the terminals, then resoldering the leads to the earpiece, VERY CAREFULLY.  But, when the other side went out the soldering iron melted the plastic isolation material between (+) and (-) at the earpiece ruining it.  At least now I have a spare earpiece for the set I just bought.

I did a lot of research and tried to find good products at low prices. These headphones I consider to be the biggest steal of my entire list of purchases. It is great at keeping the sound from escaping, even at loud volumes. And it seems to be pretty durable. I mean, obviously I don't throw it around, but its been knocked around a few times and it still works fine.

VOk, two songs into it and my ears are soaked.  I like Sennheiser and when the jack on my folding compacts pair finally gave up, I decided to give these a try.  First time trying this style of headphones and probably my last.  Way too sweaty.  At least they were fairly cheap.  The fit is pretty tight also with no way to loosen them up.  The adjust vertically but not horizontally.  Sound quality is good with good bass but seems a little muddy to me.  Missing high range.  Check out songs with a dominant bass like "Fourty six & 2" by Tool.  Actually, I think this song sounded better with my compact Sennheisers.  Will try to fix those and update post if I do.

VI would have rated these headphones 4.5 stars if they hadn't stopped working less than a year after purchase. Here's the thing, great sound quality, bass, and noise cancellation for the relatively cheap price you pay, as well as very comfortable. Really hate the ridiculously long cord which often gets in the way in makes it difficult to take on the go at all, but I usually used earbuds on the go and these at home, so it worked out fine. But yeah, the left headphone stopped working completely in under a year. Must have something to do with the cord since I could temporarily hear music when I adjusted the cord for a second. I wouldn't recommend these headphones.

VI find these headphones to be very tight and I don't have an unusually large elephant head.  I know these are cheap but I expected them to be more comfortable.  They are a pain to wear for me after an hour or so.  The cushions on the earpieces are fine though so if you have a long narror face go for it.  For $20, it's plastics galore as expected but the sound is not bad at all and I primarily use it for gaming so as not to wake up the house at night.Update - I have not changed the original rating because it has nothing to do with it, my dog chewed off the wire.  After much soldering and trying to fix (which was a pain), these are in the bin, RIP.

VExcellent sound quality for the price. I generally use a pair of Audio-Technica headphones, and while these Sennheisers don't sound quite as good, they're great for leaving at work or traveling. The ear cups may be a little small for some people, but you should be fine as long as your ears are average. One major plus is how light they are. Anything even moderately heavy is too much for the top of my head, but these don't cause me any pain. These headphones aren't the most durable around, but their price makes that negligible. They don't fold, but they're still quite thin, and the ear cups can be popped off the band if you really need them to be compact.

VI've gone through about four pairs of these. The sound quality is great with nice bass thats not boomy or buzzy. Great clarity. I love the long cord for playing guitar through the headphones. My only problem is that the cord gives me the freedom to move around enough that I occasionally yank on the jack pretty hard accidentaly and after a year or two the right channel starts cutting out because of this mistreatment. All of my pairs have eventually failed in this way. That being said I keep buying these over and over. Ive tried more expensive skull candy and beats brand headphones but they dont sound any better than these cheap things to justify the price.

VThis is my first "big" headphones. I'm used to always use the earphones only, and I was not used to a really good quality of sound. This is a really good headphone! It has a smooth ear cups, that suppress the outside sounds. It fits perfectly, and also has REALLY NICE bass sound. The only thing that I can complain about, it's the extremly long cable. It's like 400 miles long. Well, I think it works perfectly for DJs uses. But when I carry it on me, in the street, it's kind of annoying the wind-up belt clip and all the excess cable. Besides that, it's wonderfull! I'm really happy with this product!(I apologize for my beginner's english)

The difference is AMAZING....They perform as well as the $490 set I had on...Merry Christmas indeed!"

VI received these headphones in under a week (ordered Sunday arrived Friday). I'm have some great Sennheiser ear buds but these headphones blew me away! I'm not an audiophile but according to me these sound great. They are compact enough to be able to be taken in a back pack and look rugged enough. I listened to a couple of 320kps songs with them and the sound was a crisp and perfectly balanced. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants extremely good valued, functional, good quality and absoloutly  PERFECT  headphones!P.S. The long cable is great for watching TV with as you can sit on a sofa 5m away and still watch it with these headphones on.

If you wear it for more than an hour it may disturb a little.It obstruct external sound in a smart way and involve the hole ear making possible to lisen voices, choruses, instruments, melodies that you never thought were there.The cable is very long and its lenght can be a frustrating.Its height is easily adjustable, so don't worry about you head size. My is big.It has a soft "sponge" at the top, so you will feel like having a velvet pillow in the top of your head.

VI'm not what you call an audiophile, but I think these headphones sound very good. I was using Apple's earphones before these and you can certainly feel the difference in audio quality. I feel like they're quite comfortable. They block just enough outside noise (quite a lot I might say) and they audio is crisp. The only thing is that when the volume is high, everyone around you can clearly listen to what you're listening to (I'm not sure if this happens with all headphones or not), but overall, I would definitely recommend them. The price point I found to be a great defining factor and you can't beat the price for the quality of headphones you get.

VI've had these for half a year or more now. They work great! I carry them in my pack everyday which gets a bit of a tough time on it, but have not had any breaks or wire tearing. They still have the same sound as if I just bought them. I did not realize how long the cord actually was until I got it but with the clip/wrap it works great and stays the length I need! (I would not suggest these for parkour or skaters. I dabbled in both and have seen some of my friends with similar, but their wires were shorter.) I would definitely buy these again especially for the price. You are getting a great deal. If I had to buy some again it'd be these.

VThese are amazing headphones for the price, much better than other headphones I've tried in this price range. I use them for gaming, listening to music and home recording. The bass really booms, and the mid- and high-frequencies come through clearly. The mid- and high- might not be quite as sharp as higher-priced headphones, but when I'm playing a game or listening to music I dont even notice it. The sound quality is high enough that you can easily get immersed in the fight or the song or whatever experience that you're looking for. Unless I win the lottery tomorrow and can afford a $400 set, I will not be retiring the HD202 anytime soon.

VThis was purchsed as much to eliminate outside noise as to listen to source.The adjustments to position it over the ears leave something to be desired, but with a little fooling around you can get them properly fitted.  I am not an audio professional person (anymore) but they certainlyseemed to give good reporduction quality.  They do fit over the ears which helps reduce room noise, but not uncomfortable or heavy for a period of time ( several hours) The cord is about 8 to 10 st long to allow for movement and has a "wind-up bobbin" for enused length.I would recommend them unless you a professional with perfect pitch.

VFrom a non-audiophile perspective, I think these headphones are great!  The quality is crisp and clear, and like the product description says, the bass is really deep.The only complaint that I have about them is the cord length.  It's 9 feet I believe, which isn't bad if you're going to use them for home, but for travel it is kind of a hassle.  It does come with something with a clip that you can wrap the cord around, but if you don't have anywhere comfortable to clip it then it is kind of hard to use them outside of a static environment.Overall 9/10, even with the cord length.  It's the best bang for your buck.

p4647

VThe plastic headband on these headphones is a single molded piece, with the ear cups attached to each end of the headband. It's a very low-tech inexpensive looking arrangement. It probably works well enough for some people, but I find the headband too tight. Not just a little too tight -- I mean that after only about 2 minutes, I needed to take it off. This is a deal breaker for me.In fairness, the sound quality is very good, and even amazing given the low price. However, considering the overall design of the too-tight headband and the cheap plastic, I think it's a bit too grand to call these "Professional" headphones.

It is the size of the earpiece is snug. It does not leave a lot of room for the ears but you kind of get used to it after wearing them for a while. For the price it is a really nice deal.

They do not compare to $500 Beats by Dr.Dre or Bose, but for $20 they sure sound and feel much better than anything else. I will be buying my sister these and a couple of friends for christmas.

But as a woman with certainly no bigger than a medium size head and not "big" hair, this really clamped down.  Comfy as far as the earpieces on my ears, but wow, tight.I only took off one star for fit as fit is very individual.

VThe bass was not as good as my Sony on-the-ear headphones, and the treble is more pronounced.  For my application (checking for distortion in audio programming equipment) it will probably be better since most of the distortion I am looking for is high frequency.Maybe I just have a skinny head but the earcups don't close tight against my head, so to close out the maximum background ambient noise I have to use both hands to squeeze them against my head.  I wasn't expecting that.Although it is not stated in the ad, they are 32 Ohms, have a 3.5mm Stereo plug and includes a 3.5mm-to-1/4" plug adapter.

VI purchased these headphones for gaming purposes.  The length of the cord (10 ft) helped enormously since I sit back a little ways from my tv.  The sound was great for the price and I had no problems to speak of in that regard.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of budget headphones.  The only flaw I encountered is that they were too tight for my big head.  After wearing them for 5 to 10 minutes my head and ears started to ache.  They became uncomfortable so I had to return my pair.  If you don't have a huge head like me, and are looking a good low-priced pair of headphones I recommend these.

VI am a predominantly classical and soundtrack composer and use these for both writing and mixing. Yes, if you compare them to a $400+ set of studio headphones, they will sound really bad, but for this price I haven't seen anything else that compares in sound quality or comfort.A lot of people seem to say that one side dies on them before the other. I haven't seen this exact thing, and have been using the same set for almost a year, but a few months after using them, I did notice that one side wasn't playing any sound. I unplugged them and left them overnight and the next morning they were working fine.

VI purchased these primarily to use with the Rocksmith game for my XBox360, as listening to the TV speakers is out (because of sound lag) and since I often play after others in the house have gone to bed I opted for these instead of external speakers.  I play bass guitar on Rocksmith, and these accurately reproduce the right sound for the bass without distortion.  While not noise-cancelling, the cans also fit well enough over my ear as to drown out most ambient sound.  I didn't want to spend a lot for headphones, but I wanted good bass reproduction.  These fit the bill for me and I recommend them for similar users.

VThe sound is wonderful. I bought these to use at work. The ear cuff design allows me to wear them for extended amount of time without bothering my eardrums. In ear buds can be hard on your hearing and lead to ear infections, so these avoid that issue.The soft padding will slip on and off easily enough so it doesn't mess up my hair but stays securely on my head.The cord is really long which is nice because it allows me to plug direct ally into my computer and listen to online radio stations, music I have stored on USB drive, and company programs.Overall, great product and I am happy I bought them!

VI really liked the last pair of Sennheisers I bought, and by all accounts these were supposed to be one step up, but the sound is a bit thinner, less bassy. And the ear cups are so enlongated that they can only be used in one position instead of many; haven't they noticed that not everyone puts their headphones on the same way? If you wanted to, say, put these on and rest your head, it's likely to push one cup partially off your head which wouldn't happen if you could put the arm under your chin. Some people have always worn over-the-ear phones with bar in the back, and if you do that with these, the sound leaks.

VI got these for work since I didn't want to use my more expensive cans since the cubicles are open and anyone can just walk in and take them.  Well since I've retired I tried them out at home and they sound really bad next to all the other cans I have at home.  If I had to do it again I would spend the extra $10 and get the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 for $39 which I also have.  The ATH-M30's are clearly superior in sound and comfort.  I've since given these to a friend and he loves them for use on the plane since they isolate the plane noise from really well but even he has since gotten the ATH-M30s for home.

VI don't have a basis of comparison against more expensive headphones but for listening to my iTunes and CDs, the sound is exceptional: higher range notes (Mozart oboe and strings, Helen O'Connell vocals, Janis Joplin in 'Bye, Bye Baby', Kristen Chenoweth singing anything), the fidelity is 5 star. I just played Lionel Richie's "All Night Long" which has a drum beat running throughout with the occasional snap of what must be castanets, and the bass is just as good. What else can you ask from a pair of headphones? If there's any muddiness, it may be in the mix. But these headphones are well worth the money.

I got them because I listen to music while I work (otherwise I fall asleep) and I am sick of the cheap headphones breaking, but I cannot wear them for even half the day.Update 4/30/2014The plug is breaking and the earpieces pop off occasionally, but I just pop them back on.

VI originally bought these for my son to use in one of his classes in school. Both my son and my wife told me these headphones were excellent since I am overseas and was not able to try the headphones out personally. I ordered a pair for myself and they are excellent for the price, but they do not go over my ears like I thought they would. They actually sit on top of my ears. My son is 12 and they go over his ears. So I would say for fit wise they are better for chidlren to go over their ears. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have excellent sound quality, just wish they went completely over my ears.

VAn excellent buy. I needed to listen to TV, radio, etc. but did not need the wireless capability or the perfectionist quality of the top rated (and expensive) headphones on the market. This model brings in nice clear sounds and the ear cups block out enough surrounding noise to make listening enjoyable. Dialogue is clearer than with quality speakers. Since it takes standard connections, a wire extension is cheap and easy to hide.  One slight drawback: ears will get hot over time.... just remove them during a commercial break.Shipping and packaging were great, and the unit came without a scratch.

I am not an audiophile so I cannot tell you how well these perform compared to expensive headphones, but I can tell you I am completely satisfied with the sound I get with rich bass and I can hear the dialog very clearly.  The extra length on the cord came in really handy.  Also, I have found them very comfortable. I think these were a steal at about 26 bucks.

p4826
sg5
VI was looking for some headphones to use with my TV at night, and settled on these due to the long length of the cord and Sennheiser brand name. What you see is what you get really, a good sturdy set of headphones with decent quality sound. The headphones are pretty lightweight and comfortable to wear, and are adequate for long periods of use. These are great for TV, or for anything else where a long cord may be required. If you don\u2019t need the long cord, go for a pair with something shorter to avoid the wire clutter. Overall, they represent good value for money from a market leader in headphones.

They are not noise cancelling so I can still yell at him to turn off the TV and do chores.  I did slip them on myself and they are very comfortable.  The sound quality is very clear.

I was looking for headphones that would be an affordable version of Bose Noise-Cancelling headphones. Well, these are the middle class version of those Bose headphones. This product muffles extraneous noises while no sound is being pumped into them. That's good because I have a ROOMmate. I finally used them for music, and, WOW! What a difference! I can hear high quality sound without hearing any mild extraneous sounds! Yay! Great product, and especially for the price!

VI'm on my second pair of these headphones. The first pair got broken wires where the earpieces meet the cords. I was disappointed that that happened, and would think that some small design change would prevent disconnected wires like that. They did last a few years before that happened, though. Anyway, I liked them well enough to get a second pair. They are pretty comfortable. I've worn these headphones for hours at a time without noticing any soreness, although if I rub my ears afterward I do notice it.Update 9-16-14: this pair got broken wires in the exact same place that the first broke.

VThe sound quality is fine, and the headphones are comfortable.The wire is very thin, and the first time we opened it, it already has a loose spot where the sound comes in and out.  I bought this in early December, so didn't get to test it until after Christmas, as it was a present, and then it was too late to return.I don't like the cord-winder thing either - the cord is too long for what I wanted, but I'm afraid that the C pieces that hold the wire to the holder are going to pinch it and wear out the cord faster.I guess I need to spend more money next time.

No real bass. Not super crisp.  But again, they're hovering around $20, so you're getting what you pay for.

I also tried them at home and listened to a podcast and they were fantastic. For the price, I truly don't believe you could find better (he commented that they had "great base" too).

Much easier to hear and concentrate on study particularly, but also music.  These will pick up all sound good enough for me.

I  just hope it doesn't revert back again.The cord take-up spool is nice for storage but relatively large and heavy.

I can't wear these for more than an hour without getting headaches. As far as sound quality is concerned, I don't think you can beat these within the $20 price range. So-price excellent. Quality-good. Comfort-not so good.Gave these to my wife to use. I retried them after a couple of months and found they do loosen up.

VThese headphones are incredible for $20. I bought them thinking they would be junk, as they only cost $20 but I was greatly proven wrong. They hold bass decently but have more of a punch style bass as opposed to a booming bass. I've listened to all types of music with the headphones. Classical music sounds incredible, you can pick out each instrument clearly, although some fidelity is lost. Rap sounds.., like rap. Rock is crisp and clean, despite the dynamic changes in the music's tone and bass.These are a must have, after listening to my first pair I bought another set for work.

VI've been searching for a pair of headphones for a long time that would allow me to wear glasses with them without the arms of my glasses pressing into my head. The clamp isn't too tight on these, and the pads are large and soft, which made these comfortable. I just tested them on a 25-hour flight with only mild discomfort towards the 20th hour, so I'd say these were a success.The long cord really irritates me though. It comes with a cord winder, but the cord is so long that after wrapping it around, the winder becomes this heavy block that dangles from your headphones.

It holds your head tight enough and you will feel it after 20-30 minutes. This is the only major drawback in this model.The second problem is the volume level. There is no volume level setting in the headphone , however you can do that on your tablet or laptop.Hope I covered most!!

They give you a cord wrap so you can shorten the length that's out, but that gets old after a while. Also, like other reviews have said they tend to pinch your ears, so you have to adjust them from time to time. If using these for an extended period of time they also tend to get a little warm around the ears. If you have the extra money try the Grados SR80i headphones which are also great universal headphones.

VAs I read another reviews saying that this product it's quite tight, that's true, it's tight but it worth if u r looking for a good sealing around the ear, it has a powerful bass as it says in the product description...It might turn in uncomfortable if used for long period of time.Good product, but the cable it's big (3m) 10ft, so it might bother a bit, but has an accessory which u can roll the spare meters of cable. The brand is good and well known, which compensates the price. It's an OK product if it would be more expensive, for this price, definitely worth.

Vdont waist money on super expensive headphones that u wont be able to tell much difference from.....beware of prolonged use of headphones, they can cause ear problems, these ones fit very snug to your head, and after prolonged use, can cause inner ear issues!, im not a doctor but ive noticed this problem with a few people....besides that, these sound great, bass is good, not over powdering, i use them to produce music on occasions...maby they arent the most "correct" i wouldnt suggest producing music with headphones though if your looking for a professional sound.

VI was looking for a cheap pair of earphones for my ipod, and decided that taking a chance on these was worth the gamble instead of buying another pair of marshmellows at Walmart for $25. Oh my my, what a great move. For $24, these are so far more superior than the myriad of earphones offered at the local department stores. They sound great, are comfortable and best of all they are Sennheisers. I wear out a cheap pair of inear's about every 8-10 mos, so even if these only last a few short months, no big deal, I can replace them as cheaply as the department store cheapos.

VI use these mostly for playing video games without disturbing the rest of the household.  I'm on my second pair because the first one I bought was either defective or I'm defective.  The wire going to one of the ears got pulled out just enough to disconnect the wiring.  So no sound in one ear is obviously less then ideal--thus, I ordered a second pair.  Maybe I was too rough on them while battling alien hoardes, or maybe I just got a dud pair.  Very comfortable for long periods of time, easily adjustable, and I would rate the sound somewhere between great and excellent.

VI LOVE good headphones with good sound, but it seems I can't find any high-quality, over-the-head headphones unless they are kind of huge and Princess Leia-ey. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Sound is great, faaarrrr better than the last two Sony's that I bought. I just wish they would make headphones that were a less..masculine? Maybe a little daintier. Sound-wise though, it's great, which I'm happy about because there was no way to open the plastic package without demolishing it, so I don't know if I could have returned them if I didn't like them, in a ravaged package.

VI can't speak to the product's longevity, as I've only had them a few days -- but I'm already incredibly happy with the sound and fit of these headphones for the price. They fit over my ears snugly but without giving me a headache, aggravating my ear piercings, or shifting my glasses. They muffle outside noise well enough to make it easy to zone out to music in a busy office environment. And the sound quality is awesome to my untrained ears. Nice bass without losing quality of vocals or other instruments. More than effective for a casual listener. I'd buy theses again.

VExcellent sound quality at all ranges except for when listening to something very quiet. With low volume stuff, it tends to sound washed out with no bass. At moderate and loud volumes though it really shines.The cord length is almost annoyingly long, but I'd much rather have too much cord than too little.These are extremely tight. If you have an above average head size, you might want to try something else. I have an average head size and I find them pretty uncomfortable, though either I've gotten use to it, or it's became less tight over time.

VI really like the sound these headphones put out. Often I switch back to them and fall in love with the sound again, but the reason they don't get used all the time is they get hot really fast and they tend to make my ear lobes sore. I don't have this problem with my other headphones. They also look really ugly and generic in my opinion. Also Sennheiser isn't exactly a household name around here, so these fail in the style department. When I am not using these I fall back to my basic Sony MDR V150's that are are usually cheaper and dont bother me after hours of wear.

Also, it has a 12 foot cable (~3m), which is good for the kind of use I need.The price is fair for a product of that quality. Buy it without fear.

VI'm on my second set of these headphones.  I had my first pair for a number of years before I broke them (my fault not manufacturer's).  I was so glad when I found out they were still available that I immediately purchased another set.  I only use these when on vacation (usually in airplane),  They are phenomenal in audio quality.  On a recent flight a teenaged boy in front of me had the same headphones (a first, despite all the positive reviews on Amazon I had never encountered another person using these headphones).  In short I highly recommend these headphones.

VIf you're coming from headphones that are $75+, these won't awe you. However, if you're using $20-$30 headphones such as the ones that come with ipods, sony or Skullcandy, these are well worth the 20 bucks. These are a bit heavier in bass - I like this because my B&O; A8 and Grado Sr80i lack. The highs however aren't very good but I am biased since I am coming from more expensive headphones. I like throwing these in my backpack when I go off to study in the library/coffee shop since I can leave the more expensive sets at home. For 20-35 bucks, you can't go wrong.

After wearing them for about 2 hours, I found that my ears were warm to the point of sweating. Minor complaint, for the price, these headphones are phenomenal.

These headphones are super comfortable, have a great sound and are a WAY better deal than anything else. They sit over the ear comfortably, the Beats are a little too small to sit over the ear completely and are fairly tight on your head. They are much more sturdy but all you have to do is take care of these Sennheisers and you are good to go.Bottom line: Buy these headphones and you will not regret it.

VSennheiser is a great company that backs their products. These headphones sound amazing. I listen to all kinds of music and from my experience, the Sennheiser produces great results. I have had hiss before in headphones, but these are dead quiet. They block out a lot of sound even though they aren't noise-canceling. My one gripe is the size. They take up a lot of space in your suitcase or carryon. Also, my ears get a little hot after a few hours of use.I would recommend these to anyone looking for a cheap yet great pair of headphones.

Strong bass and mid, a little lacking in the highs, but hey, they're 25 bucks. I find them quite comfortable, the long, long cord was a little issue, but the cord holder helps. I highly recommend these cans if you are looking for inexpensive replacements for your ear buds or other cheappies.

VI got these to replace the Sennheiser headphones I had previously that were broken by a very spiteful individual. I love the brand, as they have such amazing quality. They are comfy, sturdy, and sound better than a choir or angels. The ten-foot cord helps, too. They are kind enough to include a bit of plastic to wrap the excess cord around but I find it bulky and heavy so I choose to use a third-party cord winder to take in the excess cord. These are amazing headphones and, in my opinion, rival the 200 dollar Beats or Skull Candy headphones.

VShort review. These sound pretty good in comparison to the cheap ear buds you get with your iPod. The bass is pretty good, but having an equalizer on whatever you're connecting it to makes a big difference with your listening experience. I like them. They're very comfortable. The only thing uncomfortable about it, for me personally, is that because my ears are stretched and I wear plugs, so they don't fit inside of the cups very easily. At first this is kind of annoying, but after awhile I get used to it. Otherwise, I'm satisfied with them.

VI bought these headphones to wear while I was playing video games or watching movies on my TV. I like the cord length and the doohickey to wrap it up on it. I am not an audiophile in the least but the sound is clear and not muffled. The headphones are a snug and the ear cups do get hot but I barely notice if I'm busy.My only complaint would be there is a high pitched whine when the sound is muted or nothing is going on in a game. I know it's related to my TV/Consoles since it doesn't happen on my laptop. No idea how to fix that.

VI took a chance with these headphones - trusting the advise from a member at a MP3 players forum and I must say that I was totally pleased with the sound and design - although I look a bit strange with them on out in public. Full ear coverage. One thing that is some what hard to handle is the 10 foot cord. I can see that the long cord could come in very handy when kicking back and watching a movie in private. (chair or bed)For the price I think it could be one of the best headphones around. Sennheiser (German - made in china)

VAmazing headphones.  Been using them for a few months now at work to keep the office noise down.  Although these are not noise canceling, when the music is on, they drain out the majority of the noise. They fit perfect, feel perfect on my ears, and do not feel like $20 headphones. Go ahead and pay $$$$ for a dre or bose, but these do the trick. Only thing I did not realize was that these came with an extremely long cord, but if you keep it wrapped it, it's not a problem.  Definitely a good buy - especially at this price. Can't go wrong.

p5201

VI like good sound, but I also like saving money. We use the Sennheiser 202 in the media lab where I work, and we've had nothing but good experiences with them. When I bought a pair for myself, it was the same thing. You will not find a better pair of headphones in this price range. Sadly, they're getting harder to find.The only reason they don't get five stars is because the earpieces pop out of the headband a little too easily (they pop back in easily, too, so it's not a big deal). Other than that, I love these headphones.

VI had my last pair for 8 years and beat the hell out of them. They finally shorted out on one side and after shopping around I got the same model. They don't blow out when hooked to good equipment and they make small electronics pop. I can easily say that they match up to the sound quality of headphones many times their price. They are light weight for an over the ear model and cancel out background noise pretty well. The wiring is kind of thin as is the material on the cup cushions but like I said; I got 8 years out of the last ones.

I would highly recommend this pair if you want to be thrifty.

p5225
sg5
VI got these headphones to use at the office to listen to music. The light weight of these makes them great for use for hours at a time. I normally use a pair of Sennheiser HD280 Pros, but those headphones are heavy and, after a few hours of use, can be painful due to the weight and clamping pressure. The HD202 don't have as much sound isolation, so these wouldn't be ideal if you're looking to drown out a lot of background noise. However, in a quieter office or if you still need to be able to hear people around you, these are great.

For under $25 you are getting quality headphones with great sound.  Now, the sound isn't equal to $300-$500 professional headphones but for the casual user, these are great.  They also stand up to abuse from my children (6 - 11 yrs)and are in excellent shape for the past 18 months.  If you are looking for great sound and quality in one package, I highly recommend this product.

If one does not need them for long hours at one go, these will be 5/5 in comfort.I rate Sound quality as 4.5/5. I feel trebble is little less. Bass/ Beats are nice.Overall nice headphones.

VPerfect For Guitar Practice, So-So With Musical Reproduction
p5255
sg5
VI mostly bought these for the fact they've got a nice long cord, and I was needing something for guitar practice. They do a great job of reproducing guitar sounds, and can get louder than you'd really need them to be, without breakup. However, when I went to use these for listening to a few CDs, there was an undeniable hollow sound around the 2kHz-4kHz range. This could just be because I use Sony monitor headphones for most of my headphone listening, but this issue had me reaching out for the EQ settings, which I hardly ever do.

VThis is my third set of Sennheiser Headphones. I wouldn't be coming back for more and buying them as a gift for other families members if I was dissatisfied with them.  Only drawback: The cords connecting to a laptop etc. and to the phones are not replaceable. If something goes wrong with the cord, you have to buy a new set. This happened to me a month ago. Good way to sell Headphones but an unnecessary expense for the average consumer. Sending them in for repair is not really an option, simpler to buy a new pair.Chris

If you want real production headphones don't spend $30 on these spend $100 or more on Bose or something higher grade.  If you need entry level workability and a long headphone chord then these are perfect, just be carefule, they do blow out sort of easily.

One the sound quality is good as I read, two they do fit to form around the ears, my son even tried them out and he liked them as well.  Three, I have to agree that they do put pressure on or around the temples and there was some discomfort with this. I have learned to move them around a bit after placing them over my ears to alliviate the pressure the ear forms have against ones head. Overall I like them, but wish they were more comfortable.

They do a solid job of blocking out sound & also have very nice sound fidelity.

VPurchased these for my girlfriend so she could have a good pair for the gym. The sound quality is great. Bass response even better. The main drawback is that the cord is super long in ways it should not. Even though there is a Wind-up belt clip for excess cable it honestly just needs to be made shorter. I understand the headphones were created with the DJ in mind however as a working professional DJ i still find that the cable is just too long.However for the price and the quality it's worth it one hundred percent.

You have to twist and play with it to get it to come into both ears. And I haven't used these much. Other is that they are tight fitting, so after about 30 mins, you need to take them off.Probably a good beginner headphone...but kinda disappointed in Sennheiser.

Of course my Beyer Dynamic studio headphones that require an amplifier sound better, but I use these for shooting professional video to isolation sound and focus on the audio. Very good for the price they are. I would recommend these over some $40 AKG headphones I bought around 5 years ago.

Plus, they block out I'll say about 50% to like 67% of background noise when not listening to anything. Another thing is the cord is extremely long, but it comes with this clip that you can wrap the cord around and clip it to your waist, backpack, pockets, etc. The whole speaker is removable.

VI bought these headphones for my boyfriend and he likes them a lot.

He says the cord feels like it's 20 feet long and comes with an  amp jack for listening to your guitar playing, so that's probably why it's so long.  Apparently he trips on it a lot.  All in all, it's great for the price.  I'd recommend it.

They are only able to be adjusted by moving the ear pieces up and down, but the problem is that the plastic head band part is too tight and narrow. The foam also does not go completely around the ear and actually presses up against the ear. They are wearable for 20 minutes or so before it starts to get painful.

VBefore I used these Sennheiser headphones, I thought for $20 it would be just OK - nothing special.  I wasn't in the mood to pay $100 plus for something decent.  But after I used it I couldn't believe how good they were - especially for $20.  These headphones provide a really nice flat response with a excellent balance of lows, mid and highs.  The only minor complaint I have are the cushions.  Just a little too firm for long-term listening.  Otherwise, they're great.  In fact, I bought a second pair as backup.

VI am a casual listener, and I really appreciated the sound quality from these headphones. They fit around my ears very comfortably and I can pick out the bass and instrumentals individually with the sound quality. I've bought ear buds from Apple (~$20.00 when I bought them) and also Sony ear buds around the same price ($20.00), and even some noise-cancelling headphones (~$30.00), but honestly this is the best sound quality out of them all. The cheaper price was a serious understatement of the superb quality.

VI think after first trying these for a short time they are some of the best sounding headphones I've ever had, bar none. I might have liked them to be adjustable, but it really isn't necessary.  Extra long cord is good for clandestine TV watching in the wee hours., also included RCA jack is pretty nifty. The packaging however, is another story. I damn near sliced my hand to the bone trying to open the plastic bubble. There is just no need for that sort of security, and will keep me from buying any more.....

The only thing resembling those were the name. 1 of the two had the speaker jarred loose and it clinked around inside until I took them apart and re mounted the driver. They are light weight, somewhat comfortable, and OK.  I didn't realize how much I would Despise the " Y " wiring,vs just 1 point of entry.

They deliver THE SAME SOUND QUALITY, IF NOT BETTER as those "Beats" headphones Dr. Dre and Monster make. They may not be as stylish, but these have the noise reduction without required batteries (Like the Over Ear Beats), deliver INTENSE bass (Very much like the beats), and save you $280. THAT is good. They are comfortable for long periods and just....I just approve. I shot down the beats. You know they're good.

p5413

VI bought my first set of headphones in 2010. Then in 2011 they suddenly stopped making sound in one ear, so I bought another pair. Now it's one year later and again, stopped working in one ear. I use these with my ipod while I'm working out, so its not like they get over-used or abused or exposed to any 'enviromental' damage. There is no reason for them to stop working. For twenty bucks you get a years worth of use and I can get the same thing for ten bucks. That makes these not worth the money in my book.

VI found these headphones to sound OK & the fit is OK but not real adjustable.  I guess they are not too bad given the price.  I expected a little more from Sennheiser.  The thing that bothered me the most is Sennheiser is marketing these as HD 202 II.  There really isn't any "II".  The packaging is new but the product is the same as the "I".  You can call Sennheiser as I did & find this to be true.  I think Sennheiser makes some very fine headphones, so they do not need to resort to this slight of hand.

VI'm not incredibly picky about sound quality (hence the $25 headphones).  I was seeking something with noise-cancellation, good bass, and a comfortable fit.  These do an adequate job closing off the outside world, and seem to have pretty rich sound.  But they're not very comfortable for long periods of time.  Also, the cord is about 50 feet long.  Maybe that's common for studio-style headphones (maybe not?), but it sure is annoying as hell when you're just trying to use them with your phone or computer.

VSennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black)Wanted a cheap set of headphones and the Sennheiser being a big name went ahead with these ones. Turned out that they are fantastic. The sound quality is really awesome for the price. The only thing that irritated me is that they have a surprisingly long cord( and trust me when I say long) which much be almost 20-25 feet long. Its irritating sometimes but manageable. Id suggest giving them a try just for the price of it.

They're large enough to comfortably cover your ears and block outside noise, while providing clear audio for both spoken content and music. The cord is long enough to reach a computer under your desk when working or the device in your pocket when exercising. Their appearance also clearly states "I can't hear you" so people don't mistakenly attempt to communicate with you while you're wearing them.

VI bought this headphone out of curiosity. What interest me the most is first, its below $20 and second it has good reviews. Sounds (literally) too good to be true.  I could have agreed more to the good reviews on this headphone.  I used this with my iphone, since'my iphone doesn't have an equalizer app,  the bass is kind-of heavy with less detail.  So I used this on my android phone downloaded a music player with a built in equalizer and then the bass got tamed.A value for the money headphone.

VI too received headphones labeled HD202.  No mention of the MK II model anywhere.  However, a check of the Sennheiser website says the only difference between the 202 and 202-II is updated packaging.  And the UPC listed on the Sennheiser site matches the UPC on the HD 202 package I received.  So it seems that there is not actually an updated version of the headphone itself.  Lastly, MSRP on their website is $39.95, so the savings listed by Amazon is a little misleading, but still a great price here!

Note that I had to only wiggle the wire not the connection to the computer.  The issue seems to be right where the wire meets with the plug and has the extra thick flex grip.  I'm quite happy with the sound coming to both ears, but disappointed I had to wiggle the wire to get it to work right the first time.

I really like clean, well defined bass without losing the bottom. These give me just that as well as bright,clear highs without ear fatigue. I have a pair of AKG studio monitor headphones & i would put these up against them anytime at a fraction of the cost. i'm thinking about getting another pair. I LOVE THESE PHONES!

My only real problem with them is how tight they are on my head. They are tight enough that they give me headaches after an hour or so. I can alleviate that by stretching them out (I put them on the armrest of my chair for five minutes, and I store them stretched out over a basket. Other than the tightness, they are great.

Because of carrying my iPod in my pocket the cord on the headphones shorted right near the input a few months ago, but I still bought another pair of these because I'm so in love with them.

VThe headphones worked alright for a year, though the sound level was not as powerful as I expected, and the mechanism for winding the long wire was cheap and inconvenient.The biggest puzzle is that the headphones stopped working one year after purchase.  I inspected the wire and found no tear on it.  Just stopped.  Makes you wonder if this isn't a built-in obsolescence.  In any case, I will shop for a different brand now, so they may well have helped their competitor unintentionally.

You will not find a pair of headphones at the price that produce better sound.An advantage of these over the even cheaper 201's is that these don't leak sound as much.  However I find the 201's to be slightly more comfortable.  Either of them are a great buy for the price.

These work really well for that, but not so well for listening to regular music - it ends up sounding too muddy and muted.If you like your music really-extra-super-bassy, then these might work for you.

VWhen I first saw these headphones, I thought, "Wow! Only $20 (at the time) for these headphones?! And they have good reviews?!" so I thought i'd try 'em out. When I first got them I noticed that they had awesome sound and bass for only $20. After wearing them for an hour or 2, I noticed how my ears felt a little sore. That is the ONLY downside of these headphones. If you can cope with a little discomfort and want headphones with awesome sound for cheap, look no further! Hope this helped!

VI have been looking for a set of long cord headphones and decided on these. For only 20 something dollars i was expecting great sound quality, but i was wrong. The bass on these headphones is PHENOMENAL. and the mid and upper range does not suffer for it. They have a nice fit, not perfect but nothing to complain about. the pad on the overhead strap adds to the comfort factor. all in all a great set of headphones. Not studio quality, but for the price, your not going to find better value.

p5617
sg5
VThe bass on these headphones leaves a bit to be desired, but that's really all there is to say negatively about them. The highs and the mids really have a sparkle in them, and these make a good headphone if you have a good collection of FLAC music but not enough money for some of the really high end Sennheisers. The fit is comfortable, but I find that after two or three hours the tips of my ears can start to get sore because the cups aren't as deep as some of the other headphones I own.

p5623
sg5
VThese headphones have exceptional sound quality.  You can hear instruments you normally don't hear with speakers or other headphones.  I used them for classical music mostly.  Occasionally I use them to play video games and you can hear what direction things are coming from.  If you are going to use them for gaming mostly then I would recommend you buy the HD203 but for music I would definitely recommend these HD202s.  I am very pleased with my purchase and I know you will be as well.

VThese are not noise cancelling, but they do deliver clear sound and are very comfortable to wear.  I listen to a lot of classical which is often recorded at different levels, and have no problem hearing anything.  I had tried a couple other headphones before these, and the Sennheiser are the most comfortable.  An extra bonus - the wind up belt clip that comes with them can also be clipped other places and makes for the perfect place to hang the headphones when they are not being used.

Used every day and carried in backpack so hard use.  The first sets lasted over 2 years while the most recent set lasted just one year.  Tried to fix but noted the cheap wiring/electronics and felt not worth the effort.  Decided to repurchase due to cost, but may have to rethink if break so soon again.

Specific kind of music and the right kind of equalizer settings make these headphones really worthy. I would recommend these headphones to anyone who has just begun their journey in the world of music.

VThese are good for Bass, but clarity of instrumentals is quite bad. I tried it on a number of different genres, it sounds like a live performance on the more classical songs, this may be due to switching from in ear buds. They are very good for rap/hip hop because of the bass, turnup!I gave it 5 stars because I was looking for something with good bass and for the price, I have no regrets. I have big ears but I squeeze them into the cups, lol, no pain so far. Get them!

VI have had these headphones for about 2 years and they sounded good and like others have said, they get warm on your ears. After about a year the wire on one side of the headphones pulled out and I had to take them apart and re-solder the wire to the speaker. 2 months ago, the other side pulled out and I soldiered that speaker as well, but now that speaker does not sound right, so I am looking to buy new "better" headphones. You get what you pay for and this is no different.  :/

They perform very well accurately reproducing rock, country and jazz. A thoroughly impressive product!

You can find better sounding headphones near this price range and much better for not much more.  They are fairly flat but tad bass heavy.. maybe.  Not a ton of range but pretty even for what they can handle.I have had them years not and they broke where it pops on and off the head strap.. but that was my fault really.

I'd only use these headphones on a plane/travel for its noise blocking abilities. They do sound very good however, and pretty effective in noise isolation.

I know some people have their complaints about these, but for the price I could not have been happier.  They could easily sell these for $60.  That's my two cents!

VThese headphones are decent and worth the money but the sound is not that impressive.  They have decent bass, but the higher ranges are not very clear.  I replaced an older set of Koss headphones that I paid $35 for years ago, and was hoping for similar performance, but these are not nearly as good.I don't think they should call these 'Professional' headphones, it implies a level of quality that these do not have.  Still a decent value for what they cost though.

It is great for at home stuff like music and games though. And comfortable as well.In summary, They are a very good pair of headphones for the price.

VI'm not too picky about headphones, so this review may not be for audiophiles. I usually like a set of headphones if they have decent bass and play the music clearly enough. Going by that criteria, these headphones are satisfactory, especially for the price. The best part about them is that they fit on your ears beautifully, and in the process, block at least some surrounding noise. If you're an average user like me and don't want to spend too much money, go for them.

VPros:-Great sounding headphones, Just enough bass for my listening habits-Affordable if wanting to get a set of headphones-Super Long cordCons:-Super long cord-Ears feel smashed after listening for about an hr-Not very portable-Due to the cord they can be clumsyHow can this get 4-stars with more cons that pros? Because the good outshines the bad and these headphones meet my needs. The cons are just to to consider when mulling over the purchase.

VWish they would make them foldable so you could store them better.  The fit is good/comfort is very nice.  Blocks out outside sounds very well.The cord is very long though..and on both sides of the headset.  I got a different pair after this with only one side with the wire and lmuch shorter in length.Sound is pretty good.  I'm not an audiofile.  The bass is slightly heavy but i like that.  Sounds are crisp and over all great to my ears.

VI am a fan of Sennheiser headphones. I needed headphones to use when playing my digital keyboard. "Regular" headphones make my ears hurt after a while and they are in need of a massage. These headphones are by far better but not as comfortable as I hoped (they are $20 headphones after all). For the price they are very good but weren't suited to my needs. I ended up returning them and buying the 598 headphones which are leagues above this one (and in price too).

VExcellent Sound Quality

VI was a bit overwhelmed at the quantity of different headphones on the market.  I specifically bought these to use for a boom operator to monitor sound during filming.  I was blown away by the quality of sound.  Granted, I'm no audiophile, but I have lots of experience with sound and much of what I do revolves around the recording of it.  I was very impressed with the quality throughout all tonal ranges.  For the price, I'd be skeptical that these can be beat.

VWhat did I buy!!

VAfter looking at all the other reviews and features on this pair, I thought I was in for a surprise. And I was...a bad one. Honest opinion, they suck, its exactly what you pay for, I'm a audiophile, in A/V work, produce music and so on and I needed something different for something not too expensive. Its very basic and cheap and tight on the head with a weird design. They remind me of something a little above a pair of airplane headsets. Returning right away.

VDidn't expect much for less than $25, but these definitely work for what I need them for.  I certainly wouldn't use them for any serious studio/mixing work, but when I'm just laying down some vocals, these will fit the bill for input monitoring.  My kids (with much better ears than mine) say that the mids/high-mids are a bit over-emphasized, but again...for input monitoring while recoding vocals, it'll work. The cord is nice and long, which is a great plus.

VI like this a lot.  The bass is a little bit too loud and sometimes a bit distorted, but comparing this to the HD 201, which I ordered at the same time, this one is better.  Don't worry about the reviews saying it is not adjustable.  It is adjustable; you do it by pushing the earpieces up or down.  I recommend it.  However, I haven't owned it long enough to vouch for its longevity, and this is typically the problem I encounter with products ordered on-line.
