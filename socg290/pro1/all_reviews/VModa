VI was hesitant to get these headphones as I have a large head (32cm round, I think) and have typically needed to use monitor style headphones in the past. When they finally arrived I was surprised by how small they looked out of box. I ordered the XL-memory cushionsV-MODA XL Memory Cushions for Over-Ear Headphones (Black), but they hadn't arrived yet, and when I first put these on I was very happy that I did. The included ear covers didn't cover my ear at all and caused discomfort after a while of having them on my head. When the XL-memory cushions arrived I snapped them on and was very impressed by how much difference it made. My ears were fully covered and the noise reduction was significantly better.This is probably my first pair of "nice sounding" headphones so I'll just say that they sound better than my cheap skullcandy Ink'd 2.0 ear buds and my logitech stereo speakers and leave it at that. The noise reduction is fairly significant. I use them for flights and have been impressed that I only need to increase the volume by one or two clicks to drown out most of the noise. Don't get me wrong, you can still hear noises, but the headphones do a pretty good job. I followed most of the reviewers' suggestion to let music play through them overnight so I didn't really hear a progressive improvement since I did it when they arrived. The storage case is great and gives a lot of protection to the headphones. The headphones are great for hands-free phone calls, but note that for android only the middle button will work (volume controls only work for apple devices). The styling is great and neither the metal nor the leather has faded after 7 months or so.Overall great quality headphones. Definitely worth the money.

VQuality headphones for a steal of a price
p20
sg5
VI've bought these way before amazon was selling them for over double the price, and I still would have recommended them to anyone/everyone. They are extremely comfortable, and give off amazing bass for only being powered by the music device it is plugged in to. The reason I had to purchase again was only because my first pair got stolen after 2 years of use. Buy them if you are looking for an amazing pair of headphones that WILL last (if taken care of properly and even without will last), have great bass, feels/looks designer and in no way cheap. Bonuses it comes with a adapter for guitars, two cable for different uses- both excel in their respective strengths- and a case to help these durable headphones to last even longer.

VThese are great. Because they're over the ear they do block some sound out without any music on. With music on, you get a great music experience. The cushions are good, but you definitely can't wear these for more than a few hours at a time.I use this for anything from classical to dubstep to punk rock. Sound quality is very good throughout though I have to note that the bass is the most developed of all the sounds.The case is very good--it doesn't get scuffed easily. It also comes with a little clip so if you don't mind clipping it to your bag, you're good to go. I say this because it is impossible to wear these around your neck.

VStylish, great sound quality, decent build quality and a good price. I couldn't ask for much more.I've had my Crossfades for some time now, and I still love 'em, even through the minor trouble I've had out of them.One thing I have to say before I dig into the pros and cons - the sound quality is fantastic. Some people have complained about the bass being a bit strong, but with an equalizer I have to say they sound absolutely fantastic. Here goes the breakdown.PROS:Comfortable for use less than 1 hour - for added comfort get the XL Memory Foam Cushions.Sound quality is GREAT for the average listener. Audiophiles may be picky.Stylish headphones - they look greatSuper-durable skeleton - the frame is nearly indestructibleChoice of cablesCONS:Some of the plastic cracks over time, even with light useCan get uncomfortable with extended wear if you don't invest in the better cushionsThe in-line mic cable isn't compatible with many android phones (you can purchase an adapter)I have to give props for V-MODA for taking care of cracking parts - all I had to do was send my headphones in, and the other cons on the list can be taken care of without company support. Buy better cushions and invest in the adapter for the in-line mic.But when it comes down to it - these headphones are for listening to music, and they are great for that.

I bought these in 2013 and the headphone are still the best ones I have ever owned, the sound is amazing the build quality is perfect. I will only buyV-MODA products from now on. I have treated these the same as the others, dropped them many times, I even stepped on the and popped one of the headphones out but it just clicked right back into place. Did I mention they also replaced my audio only headphones for my cellphone.You can also customize the color of them to make them personalized.

VThese cans are durable, comfortable, and certainly deliver on volume. On top of that, they look awesome! The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the fact that they are missing some of the highest frequencies, which can make music seem a bit muddy at times. There just isn't any sparkle. But when it comes to having a pair of DJ cans that can take a beating and keep you isolated, these are a very good affordable option.

p182

VI wanted to give these headphones a decent period of proper use in order to provide as accurate, and reliable of a review as possible. I've currently been using these for about a month and a half at this point and have a few things I would like to point out for those of you who are on the fence about purchasing these headphones:---PROS---1) First and foremost, these headphones (as you can tell in the product pictures) are aesthetically gorgeous which hold true in real life, far demolishing other headphones in this price bracket in not only appearances, but also the overall build quality. The headphones have a solid metal frame, and the only plastic on the headphones are the black areas in between the silver shields and the ear cushions. On top of this, the peripherals complementing the headphones in the package include a hard shell, felt lined zipper case that are molded to the shape of the headphones (VERY nice touch), as well as a two cables, and a carabiner for easily attaching the case to a bag of sorts. Not to mention, and this is something I can't truly comment on, the aesthetic customization possibilities of these headphones are unmatched by other headphones in their class due to detachable mics/custom ear shields etc.2) The headphones, as a result of their build quality, are very heavy in comparison to most other brands I have tried (particularly those built by Audio-Technica, AKG, and Sennheiser). This however, does not make them overly uncomfortable during extended listening sessions by any means, and if anything I feel like the weight of the headphones give them a very premium feel alongside the materials used. Although, the headphones did require the purchase of accessories not included to make them comfortable for listening sessions longer than just a few hours (see cons section below).3) Concerning sound quality, these headphones are absolutely NOT what I would consider "studio monitoring/studio grade" headphones simply because of their sound signature. I bought these for casual listening on the side, and wanted to try a pair of notoriously bass heavy headphones for the first time to get a taste of something "more dynamic," I guess you could say . This isn't to say the headphones don't sound incredible, because they do after tweaking them (see more below in the cons)... however, they certainly lack that flat sound signature that's desirable for dialing in accurate mixes in the studio. Instead, I would consider these far more "consumer grade" strictly alongside popular headphones such as Beats simply because of very, very pronounced bass that relatively overshadows a slightly muddy mid section, only to be topped with a clear, but soft layer of high frequencies. (Side note: I can't comment on how these outclass/underclass Beats as I have never used them, just using these as a popular comparison).---CONS---1) Delving deeper into sound quality, this is where I have to start listing negatives of the headphones. Disclaimer: I would not consider myself a hardcore audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, but do I appreciate headphones that have impeccable sound as anyone else would? Absolutely. I also firmly believe that absolutely anyone can tell the difference between great sounding audio peripherals, and poor sounding ones. That being said, unlike most other reviews on this page, these headphones absolutely did not blow me away right out of the box. Not ever having fallen for the "headphone burn-in period" theory (which is simply that, a theory, look it up if you don't believe me), what they sound like out of the box is exactly what they sound like one and half months later. Bare in mind as well, that I am currently using a $150 DAC/amplifer combo to power these of which have a 600ohm power rating for studio grade headphones. Again, this is not to say that they do not sound great, because they do... with some tweaking. If you are like myself and have grown accustomed to flat response headphones over the years because that's all you have owned (even if you believe you have not), you will absolutely not like these right off the bat. However, this was not detrimental to my overall rating, because I ended up downloading an audio plugin for my PC that reconfigured the overall sound profile of my computer in an effort to flatten the sound a bit. Overall I would say my efforts were well met, making the mids and highs shine a bit more than they were perhaps manufactured to perform. If anyone is interested in the program, it is an EQ APO downloaded here:http://sourceforge.net/projects/equalizerapo/On a side note, do yourself a favor and pick up an amplifier at the very least to push these headphones to their max capabilities. Once you have enough of a boost powering these things, you'll easily be able to warp the overall sound signature with the program above to your heart's content.2) Aside from the sound profile, the headphones themselves do have a very premium feel about them at the cost of their overall comfort for very long, extended periods of listening. I bought these with the intention of easy-listening for about 7 to 8 hour periods on day to day applications such as Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and Spotify while I work (of which I find myself doing a lot more often now than audio production). I have to admit I feel a bit cheated with the leatherette ear cushions that were included with the original headphones, simply because V-Moda offers truly premium, denser, and softer ear cushions as an accessory purchase on the side in what I believe is solely effort just to pull more money from their customer. If anything, I feel like the denser ear cushions should've been included right off the bat, instead of charging an extra $20 for oddly shaped, one of a kind ear cushions. Thus, having been dissatisfied with the original cushions which might work well for those of you with very tiny ears, I found myself having to purchase the ear cushions because as I mentioned and as you can plainly see, the headphones sport a unique hexagonal shape not replicated by any other manufacturer.---CONCLUSION---Overall, I would recommend these headphones to someone who is:1) NOT looking for studio headphones with a flat sound signature, but IS looking for an extremely well manufactured product as compared to other headphones on the market for daily, casual listening applications.2) Knowing of the fact that these are bass dominated headphones, of which the mids are a bit muddied and highs are clear but very much so over-shadowed. Do yourself a favor and buy an amplifier at the very least, preferably an amplifier/DAC combo to enhance the sound signature for a more natural output, and then if you use these on PC download the EQ APO mentioned above and tweak the sound to your own personal preference.3) Willing to potentially fork over more money for added comfort in the future if the ear cushions do not satisfy you like they did not for myself, as well as more money for aesthetic customization options and detachable microphones.Thanks for reading my review, I hoped it helped you out a bit.On a side note and as I mentioned above, I cannot comment on the other accessories offered by V-Moda such as the detachable mic, or the shields and how they work/perform/look with the headset as I have never used them.

VSo far estimated 130 Hours of music on these headphones and they definitely sound better than the first 50- hours.I listen to Rock, Indie, House and Garage mostly.So here's the breakdown:-Rock/ Indie: Great but not fantastic, most times I tweak the EQ to make them sound better.-House and Garage: Absolutely fantastic, I mean just fantastic. Its like having a party in your head. Bass can be a bit too much sometimes tho but again use an EQ then its sorted.-Pads are extremely comfy, some days I use these bad boys 5 hours straight with no problem.-These are definitely going to last me a long time, they feel like solid pair of headphones in your hands.  .I think at this price range they are one of the best if not THE best in my opinion.

VThese headphones by far are my favorite. In my honest opinion they sound much better than and Beats version of headphones. But thats just my personal opinion. The carrying case it comes with is very nice but also can take a beating for your headset. And I like the fact that it comes with 2 versions of the removable cords, one which is just a straight cord that goes from your device to your headset and the other one with control buttons to control volume and answer calls. The ear cushions are really comfortable and I can keep them on the whole day, I honestly think that it helps that the Loop that goes over your head is somewhat ergonomic, just the way it expands over your head doesn't feel like its pressing against your temples. Bottom line.... I love this headset.

VI paired these up with the FiiO6 and man o man! They were already good without  the amplifier. The bass is as you may have read from other reviews, amazing. I listen to heavy bass songs and I love them. I don't have a problem with the highs or mids. Just adjust your eq to your taste and these headphones deliver. After the break in you won't have to have the volume up as high to hear the same clarity. The build are high quality to say the least. They are stylish with a nice case to match. These are best headphones I've ever owned. Im a V Moda customer for life. I highly recommend these and I say go ahead a treat yourself to a quality pair of headphones that you won't regret, especially if you love bass.

Good sound blend, with nice bass and good high-ends.  They are durable too and come with a sturdy case.  I have used them in snow while skiing and they held up just fine and they come with a carabiner included, nice for latching onto my ski jacket.

VQuality sound range, build, and design for the price.I highly recommend upgrading the earpads to the "V -Moda XL memory cushions".If you do not get these right away, be aware that if your ears touch the grill of the headphones in anyway, the grill fabric cover and grill itself will eventually develop a grout of dead skin cells and ear wax. You can clean this routinely if you wish, but can sneak up on you if you forget for a few months.

The beats packed a little more thump but it sacrificed clarity in sound in doing so. These are a GREAT buy. I also use them for gaming and movie watching. Very comfortable as well.

VOkay Gang I just spent two years dealing with an Inferior brand of Bluetooth headphones.  Top of the line Beats Studios.  Totally distorts and highs and mid ranges were frankly speaking difficult to hear listening to headbanging metal music. I was also afraid to take them into the Sauna.  Now the new brand I just bought I have came to realize they are nothing short of exceptional.  Mids/Highs/Bass all finely tuned in harmony when you listen to Bass Banging Metal to lighter music. They have much better punch.  Love the buy back program and the quality of build is superb.  Cant speak on battery life just yet but V-MODA Cross fades are my new headphones and they sound better than my q25 BOSE.  I will never leave this company after a few hours of listening.  You have to buy these to understand the quality built in them and the phenomenal sound.  These do NOT disappoint.  Even the case is amazing.  Dont like the fact they dont bend and close like the Beats do but hey I can get used to that.  I say this if you get a pair of these you will appreciate what this company stands behind.  Exceptional Build, exceptional sound, and unbeatable brand name they stand behind.  Try to do a buy back with Beats.  Try understanding words now with outstanding bass which Beats could not do.  You dont need a charge to use the cable.  Its got purposeful quality build in every aspect of the headphones.  Hightly doubt you will be disappointed.  I bought the Sennheiser headphones and returned them.  Yes they were good but the sound of these V-Moda and the buy back program is unmatched. You will fall in love with these headphones.  Fire away with questions comparing them to Studio Beats.  I can answer them.  your average consumer recommends this over the beats studios.  I see why.  Now I will not return this like I just did my studios for Sennheiser's, then finally settling with the V-MODA Cross fades. Will not think twice about going back.  My wife listened to them and immediately wants to get a pair.  Will NOT disappoint.

VI bought my pair 5 months ago and no problems so far! Well except one from the beginning which was that it was missing a screw on one of the side of the part that connects the right speaker to the headband. But even from the get-go I knew that wasn't gonna be an issue due to how sturdy it still was. So I didn't even bother returning it.SoundThe sound was amazing for the price. One of the main reason I bought was for the bass and it had lots of it while maintaining clarity. Way much better than overpriced and crap $200 dollar beats it's ridiculous.DurabilityAnother major reason I bought it is for durability. The company claims it's one of the most durable headphones and so far it's living up to the claim. I dropped them accidentally  from like 4.5 ft and it landed on hard floor with no rug or carpet..and nothing happened to it. Not even a Crack or scratch.ComfortabilityIf you fit it over your ears  like it's supposed to then it's one of the most comfortable earphones out there for the price. If you can't fit over your ears then it's probably the opposite lol. My ears are kinda on the big side and I had trouble fitting them in it at first but I got used to it and they fit great now. However it's a bit on the heavy side so u definitely won't be able to pretend that its not on your head cos u'll feel it lol.PackagingCame with a very sturdy and intricate case that included 2 cords with gold plated ends, one with a mic and another without one, a cloth to clean it (I use it for my glasses lol) and a gold plated  piece thingy for studio use.

VI was looking for head phones for my kids, they wanted beats but I thought they were just over priced, so I did some research  and came a cross these V Mota after further reviews I decided to buy them. When I opened them up they were made very well so now I wanted to hear them. I read there was a lot of bass, After listening to them right out of the box I thought they sounded great !  So the real test now was giving them to my two teenage sons, I know Beats are big with the kids but like I said I thought they were just over priced. My kids looked at them felt them so they knew they weren't cheap, now the sound check, my kids loved them and I know my younger son likes his music with bass so these were perfect. Over all very happy with them. Most important the kids liked them which isn't always an easy sell because they think Im just being cheap and wouldnt buy the beats.

VI found it difficult to gauge the reviews of headphones because individuals have different hearing sensitivities and want different acoustics from their headphones.  For some, a $20 pair is good enough.  For what's it's worth, we have fairly sensitive hearing and wish for a full-bodied sound out of, let's say, radio music spanning the last 4 decades (love classical but we didn't purchase these headphones for classical nor rap).  These headphones out-performed the Audio Technica ath-m50x headphones.  These sound fantastic!  We received them for Christmas, so can't vouch for their durability yet.  But, we are more than happy about our purchase and are looking to purchase another pair or going to the LP2s (wish they were offered in various colors on Amazon).

VI listened to everyone and left these headphones on with music running overnight for several nights. The audio quality on these headphones is very good. I'm not an audiophile, and I cannot judge music by the ranges or whatever. I just enjoy music. The headcase is very nice and stylish. The velcro attachments on the inside are not super sticky, and they start falling down after a lot of use. After extended use, the headphones feel like they're squishing my head. I've allowed them to stretch out a little bit by leaving them open over the box it comes in. This helped the squeezing effect a little bit. It still feels very small. I would not recommend this product for people with big heads, as it can get uncomfortable for them .I think these headphones are very aesthetic. I have gotten compliments on them at airports, coffee shops, and libraries. I use these for studying, and they are very good at noise-isolation. I just wanted to buy a pair of nice headphones, and I chose these. I honestly cannot tell you about the quality of the sound. All I can say is that these sound very very good. I can hear the bass really well. I listen to chill EDM music such as Odezsa and Troye Sivan. I do not have to turn up the volume very high at all to enjoy my music. I can hear every sound in the song.The build of these headphones are great! It's very durable. The connections are made of metal and feel very sturdy. The only part I'm worried about is the part that goes over your head. This is because the fabric material seems very fragile.

I bought changeable plates so that I could change the colors they were about $25 but they were worth it. I have the metal in a nice blue color now.Overall they're really great and I'm giving this product a 5 stars because I was well pleased with it.

VI wanted to review these headphones after I had a chance to use them on a cross country plane trip. With that said, they worked exceptionally well at muting most of the ambient cabin noises so that I could enjoy watching a movie on my laptop. The headphones are really nice to look at. Someone definitely designed these for comfort and to turn heads. Even the accompanying case was designed to fit the headphones perfectly. There are two headphone cords included, one of which has an in-line microphone and which to my amazement, works with my Microsoft Lumia 640. There are also a couple of adapters for versatility and a d-ring for hooking it to your backpack, briefcase etc.

VI WORK IN MUSIC PRODUCTION
p448
sg5
VOk, here are my thoughts..The headphone are designed marvelously, and look great! Well constructed and I have had them for over a year, close to 2 years, still look and feel mint ( thanks to the exoskeleton case )Sound quality:The Low end sounds great with plenty of bass, and deep tones. BUT, while working on mixes, the low end tends to really drown out the mid-high range, depending on the sounds. This isn't always the case though. Listening to fully mastered tracks sound very nice, but the low range is definitely very dominate.Mid range sounds nice, and sits nicely with the high range. Working well together.High range. Back to the bass...the highs get drowned out somewhat. The highs still sound really nice, it all just depends on the song I suppose.My opinion, for music production, I would choose a set of headphones with a much more "flat" sound to them. Not too bright, and not too dull.For listening to music, I do like them a lot, for short periods of time.Allow me to elaborate,If you wear glasses, the pads will press the arms of your glasses into your skull, and after a while, it will definitely hurt.And without glasses, if you listen to them for longer than 30-45, you will lose circulation in your head lol.Yes, they are adjustable, but I feel like they could of had a less firmness in the flex.After all of this, my conclusion is yes, they are good headphones, but I'd recommend them to someone with a smaller sized head, and not a producer. DJ maybe ( does not have swivel ). 4 out of 5 on my opinion.

VV-Moda Crossfade LP Over Ear
p454
sg5
VThis is my second set of V-Moda headphones. The first one I bought was the Crossfade M-80. I decided to try out Crossfade LP over ears headset because I was so happy with my M-80 and I wanted the comfort of an over ear headset for long flights without the high price. The Crossfade LP over ears is an incredible headset, a steal for it's price of $99 and does not disappoint. There is plenty of bass for R&B;, Hip Hop and this genre of music. The highs and mids are so crisp that the bass doesn't take over entirely so it's not entirely just bass heavy and muddy like some other headphones. It still needs more burn time in order for me to make a better assessment but so far, it's a fantastic headphone. The pads sit comfortably over my ears and I found I can wear these headsets comfortably for over 4 hours. It's not noise cancellation, just noise isolation so there is a little bit of leakage. It's sturdy and Sexy looking. Not many people in Canada know of this product but I receive plenty of questions about what type of headsets I am sporting. My answer...V-Moda...give it a try, you will not be disappointed and will be happier with this product over Dr Dr Beats. I have the Dr Dre Mxrs and they have been in a drawer in it's case ever since I bought my Crossfade M-80's and now the Crossfade LP over ears which I will be using for long travel flights.

The sound isolation is a nice feature that helps muffle the outside world, without going to the price point of noise cancelling headphones.My only complaint  is that I wish they were a little bigger around the ears, but work great for my wife.

VGreat headphones, I've got two pairsI know these are called 'over ear' but the only ones I've ever encountered that truly fit fully over the ear (eg, you ear is inside the cup) are the Sennheisers.  I prefer that fit simply because i think it would be more comfortable for several hours of use.That said, I would definitely buy these again (the two pairs are for my girls)

VGreat Sound, Hurt Ear Cartilage Over 2-3 Hours
p508
sg5
VI've had these headphones for about 2 years and like them for listening to music while I work on my laptop. The only problem is that the piece that goes over your ears is too small which makes my ears hurt if I use them for over 2-3 hours. If this was fixed I would be able to wear them throughout the entire day.That is my only complaint.When they were new and the air was dry I would experience some static shock when I took them out of the case and started using them. I haven't experienced that in over a year now. The cable is super nice because it is weaved cloth rather than that cheap plastic that gets hard and breaks when it gets older. The connections are secure for both my device and to the headphones. One of the ends on the cord is angled so that it fits into devices without creating an unnatural bend in the wire (i.e.a 90 degree bend in the cord). It also comes with a cord that would go into an amp for music.The ear foam is soft and nice, even though it presses against the cartilage of my ears. I did a LOT of RESEARCH before I decided to buy these. I think they are good quality and encourage you to take care of them by providing you with a solid case for them. The cord is nice and long so I can move around my desk without pulling the cord out of my laptop. Also, the sound is really good. When I listen to music with sort of conversations, the sounds come from different ear phones and actually sounds like someone is on either side.

VBest pair of headphones I have ever owned. I receive complements on the looks of these headphones all the time. But that's not why I love them. After tons of research, I chose these headphones, because of the large drivers and around the air design. The ear cups are very comfortable, but I'm still considering purchasing the V-Moda XL Ear Cups. I listen to a wide variety of music. Some classical, a lot of '50s Blues, hard rock, alternative rock, soft rock, hip-hop/rap, and some indie artists. These headphones are great for all ranges of music. On my heaviest bass tracks, these headphones perform like champs; no crackling whatsoever. The mids are very clear, which is great for classical music that utilizes many ranges of musical notes. The highs are so beautifully played, it's insane. The build quality of these headphones is by far the best I've seen, especially in comparison to Beats (which are total crap for many reasons). The Kevlar fabric cords with the 45 degree 3.5mm jacks will hold up for years to come. I have dropped these headphones many times, and without freaking out I might add. These headphones inspire the utmost confidence. I would recommend these to anyone! One of the best purchases I have ever made.

p519

VI am extremely pleased with this purchase! I do not know very much about headphones, however these seem to be fantastically clear and look quite nice. Having mine for about a month now, and there is little indication that I use them daily: these headphones seem very sturdy! Made of quality materials and are comfortable to wear. The sound is nice on their own, however I also purchased a separate headphone amplifier that makes a very noticeable difference. These pair extremely well with the FiiO E6 Portable Headphone Amplifier - Black. The headphone cords included are sturdy: wrapped in tough fabric-like material that seems to fair well with protection. The sound is fulfilling, and sounds beautifully. I was quite pleased by the loud sound produced by these headphones, however when taken off and set a side, it is very quiet and are almost inaudible. The cushions do an amazing job at containing the sound, and are comfortable (not to mention replaceable!) Overall, extremely satisfied with this purchase. I can imagine these headphones lasting a long time, and I will be replacing them promptly with another pair when the time comes!

The 2 star loss is for the quality of the earpads and 3-button mic: you must buy the +$20 pads or the hard speakers will gnaw at your ear, the mic is quiet and its' mute button doesn't toggle and must be held down. Convenient that they have accessories to fix these exact fundamental problems... or just a scam.

The cord has a pause play button and volume up/down that is very easy to use and the cord is a good length for me. I do wish they were louder, but that could just be my hearing loss due to years of loud music.FYI- I went and listened to beats by dre, and all the other headphones at Target and Best Buy... these have just as good sound quality for the everyday guy/gal kind of use.

VV-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating Metal Headphone (Phantom Chrome) I have never been a fan of Beats, as they always seemed so flimsy, but I wanted to splurge and buy a nice pair of headphones. I first heard about these from a friend who owned a pair and you could feel the durability; being made of metal. Even the chord for the headphones is durable and has lasted. It's made of a rope like material. The quality of the audio is amazing as well. Moving on to over a year with these headphones and they're still amazing. I would honestly recommend these to anyone.

p609
sg5
VThese are great headphones!  They are very comfortable for a variety of head sizes/shapes.  They are very effective in cancelling outside noise and the sound you get is incredible.  They are used daily for hours in my home and are still working great at almost two years with one exception which I will get to below.  The hard shell case if very hand for my teen son who can put them in his backpack and not worry about damaging them.The only down-side and reason this gets a 4 and not a 5 is the microphone.  The inline mic that came with it did not have a mute function so we bought the boom mic that V-Moda makes.  We have gone through 2 of them.  The first one was replaced under warranty and then the replacement failed as well.  I believe the problem is in the cord.  With daily use the cord wraps up on itself so that it becomes a twisted mess.  I'm sure the wires are fraying inside as a result.  I'm hoping we can find a microphone that works with these great headphones and that will last.

VThese are my headphones for mobile DJ work. Fantastic bass, great fidelity of sound without distortion. Solid build for the most part and a kevlar wrapped chord.Pros: I love metal, and even cooler you can replace 2 panels of each earpiece whenever you want. Awesome sound, great noise isolation, and phenomenal bass without it being the only piece of the music like some other companies (beatz). The included cables are kevlar wrapped and the case is a really nice durable one. Not those cheap bags that come with most pro headphones.Cons: Probably because these are studio headphones the earcups don't rotate for easy one ear listening. I had an issue for a while with the earcups shifting at the point where they attach to the headband, kind of annoying for a bit but now that I have them well broken in they seem to be fine and quite comfortable to wear.

VI own 30+ headphones. These headphones easily beat many in higher price ranges in sound quality as well as in visual design. In my view, their strength or character compared to other headphones is, that they have powerful but still very well defined BASS. Highs and mids seems to be tuned to assist the bass to stand out. highs are clear, mids are somewhat weakend but are still appropriately fitted to make music sound overall powerfull, real and well defined. If you like bass, you'll love these headphones as I do.

VNice headphones, only lasted 3 years
p645
sg5
VThese headphones only lasted 3 years before the left speaker died, as confirmed with a multi-meter showing an open circuit across the terminals of the speaker. Since the speaker is epoxied in and they don't sell replacements, I'm left looking for a new pair of headphones.The good:While I had them I used them for two main purposes: traveling and work. I thought the sound was good, if a little heavy on the bass. They did help quite a bit to isolate noise, but they were definitely inferior to active noise-canceling headphones. Good enough, but not great. The microphone also worked well in conference calls and such.They were very durable, taking a couple of tumbles from my desk when the cord got caught on my chair. The detachable cord is very nice, as it removes one of the weakest connections on a lot of other headphones. After taking them apart I was even more impressed with the build quality. There is a lot of metal and screws keeping everything intact. The speaker is securely epoxied to the metal ear cup. The band and the hinges are also mostly metal and held up great.The bad:They applied a small amount of pressure on my ears, and after a few hours because uncomfortable. This was especially noticeable while traveling. Apparently there is a "papertowel mod" that can be done to give more room for your ears, but I just learned of this after my speaker died so I won't be performing it.The left speaker just spontaneously died. I was sitting at my desk at work listening to music when the left speaker started to cut in and out. I thought it was the cable, but after a minute or two it cut out completely. I tested different cables and different sources with no difference. That's when I took them apart to try to find a bad wire or solder joint, but an open circuit on the speaker itself is pretty hard to fix, especially when the speaker is firmly in the metal casing (ultimately a good thing if you don't need to mess with them).I'm not sure if I would buy these again, as I got them for $75 during a sale and I expected more than 3 years of use out of them. But I did really like them while they lasted.

VAfter two years of owning this, I continue to use it daily. It is definitely reliable and comfort to wear hours on end. The thing I like about this is the bass, it hits pretty hard especially with hip hop and melodic dubstep. However, because of this the treble and mids are a little muffled, not as clear. But this issue doesn't matter to me now because I plug it through a DAC from Audioengine and it works flawlessly. My only complaint is that the microphone does not work when its plugged into my PC and or my Android phone. So if the mic is important to you, don't get it.

VSimply amazing. Not exactly the best "studio" headphones, but great for those electronic music enthusiasts and bassheads. If you do want to use these in the studio however, make sure to learn how your headphones compare to a pair of neutral speakers. I also recommend burning in your pair with either your own music or pink noise.

VBest pair of headphones I've ever owned! I have gigged with these regularly for a couple of years and the only thing showing signs of wear is the top part that rests on your neck when not in use. I put some black gaffe tape over it and you can't tell at all. If you are looking for a durable, great sounding headphone that will last, the V-MODA Crossfade is the one for you!! GREAT PRODUCT:)

VDoesn't hold its own against the M40x
p801
sg5
VThis is a really long review \u2013 I tried to be as thorough as possible to help people making a decision. For all you impatient people, here\u2019s my TLDR conclusion first:  The V-Modas are too bass-heavy for me and sacrifices necessary quality in the mids and highs. The M40x has superior, balanced sound and is significantly more comfortable, on top of being cheaper. If your main concerns are with sound quality, I would highly recommend the M40x over the V-Moda LP. The V-Modas are definitely stylish and solidly built, but it doesn\u2019t offer anything in particular over the M40x that makes them more valuable over the sound quality difference (to me).Background:  I'm a pretty standard consumer - not an uber audiophile, but not inexperienced with sound quality. I\u2019m a college student and listen to music throughout the day \u2013 on my way to class, back in my dorm, when I\u2019m studying, and so on. I was primarily looking for something that provided good noise isolation, sound quality, and comfort without being in ear (I\u2019m sick of in-ear headphones). Mobility/storage are secondary, but still nice. I was also looking for something with bang for my buck because, you know, college.  These are the first studio headphones I bought after my mid-tier in-ear headphones broke and I wanted an upgrade. I initially bought this product and, when I had some doubts, bought the ATH-M40x for comparison. I ended up returning these within a week of receiving the M40x's.Comfort/ergonomics:  A pair of headphones is useless to me if I can't wear it for long. My head dimensions are smaller, but for the most part normal i.e. I don't have issues with headband or ear cup sizing. The clamping force on these headphones was pretty nice out of the box and I was happy wearing them at first. However, after a day or two of use, they started to really hurt the upper edge of my ear. The ear cups weren't deep enough and the padding over the actual speaker portion was too thin, so the edge of my ear would constantly be against the hard material. I had to regularly remove the headphones to give my ears a break and the pain would come back quickly. I realize that there are bigger ear cups you can buy, but I didn't want to drop extra money and effort just to solve one issue. This is obviously subjective, so I recommend taking it with a grain of salt.  The construction is definitely nice, but the connections between the earpieces and the headband are of a thinner, metal material. I don't have any gripes about the sturdiness, but these pieces were uncomfortable to handle. It's not a huge deal, but whenever I took the headphones off/put them on, the metal was thin enough to dig a bit into my fingers and be uncomfortable. Additionally, if I took the headphones off and left them around my neck (which I ended up doing more than usual, since they hurt to wear), the thin metal dug into my collarbone and caused a good amount of discomfort.  The headphones don\u2019t collapse at all, but that\u2019s a very minor thing for me - convenient feature, but I don\u2019t particularly need it. The case that comes with it is very nice though, especially for when I have to put my headphones into my backpack. It takes up a moderate amount of space, but I have space to spare. The cords it comes with are also quite nice (I\u2019m a big fan of the Kevlar cord), the shorter one ideal for my type of listening. This cord does have audio control, but only works for Iphones (unfortunately no Android).  When comparing to the M40x, the M40x\u2019s were vastly more comfortable primarily because of their ear cups. The clamping force was pretty high at first, but loosened up to much more comfortable levels after some use. The edge of my ears still touched the inside of the ear cup, but the additional space/padding over the speaker was enough to make it comfortable. The other main thing is that Audio Technica only offers its monitor-style cords, which are pretty long. I use the coiled cord which is definitely a bigger hassle to handle when I\u2019m on the go, but I manage. The M40x also has greater movement with its ear cups \u2013 it folds, it can flip and face away, and it can rotate 90 degrees outwards. This may make a difference if you find yourself in need of those degrees of freedom.Sound Quality:  I\u2019ll start on noise isolation. I didn\u2019t have any problems with the noise isolation \u2013 it was good enough for me. They definitely felt less isolating than the M40x though. The M40x felt like it had a better seal on my ears, isolated noise more, and leaked less noise than the V-Modas. Not a deal breaker to me, but something to consider.  For the actual sound quality comparison, compared to the M40x, the difference is day and night. I primarily listen to rock music mixed in with alt and rap. As you will hear many people say, the V-Modas are definitely bass-oriented. The lows are always much stronger on the V-Modas (primarily through drums, for rock music) compared to the M40x. However, it feels like it does this at the cost of mids and highs. The first thing I noticed when I got the V-Modas was that I couldn\u2019t hear cymbals nearly as well. At the time I had reverted to using my gaming headset and thought that maybe that headset was just balanced towards the highs. I also noticed that the vocals felt noticeably quieter and a bit canned. After getting the M40x, I confirmed to myself that the V-Modas did not have an ideally balanced sound signature. If you listen to a lot of bass-oriented music, you might be pleased with the sound, but for me, it was really taking away from the vocals, guitar, and highs of the rock music I listened to.  The M40x is far more balanced. The cymbals \u201csparkle\u201d to me. The vocals and guitar sound strong and clear. Better yet, it doesn\u2019t sacrifice a lot in the bass. The drums (particularly kick drums) are nice and punchy, bass is still clear. Not as strong as in the V-Modas, but still satisfying to me. The biggest difference was in acoustic guitar songs \u2013 everything sounded noticeably deeper in the V-Modas while in the M40x, it sounded more natural and full.  In the end, the sound quality and comfort are the two biggest things that matter to me and in those respects, the M40x blows the V-modas out of the water. Any advantages I found with the V-Modas were minor and were things that were easily outweighed by the superiority of the M40x.

I especially like the gunmetal color and flexible yet sturdy design.  The sound quality is good...not amazing, but for DJing purposes they do the job quite well.  At the Amazon price point they're also a great deal compared with the Pioneers and some other brands.

VThese are pretty amazing headphones. My old ones broke after accidentally falling on the floor but with these being metal I can't say I see that happening with them :D I also got a microphone and new, larger ear pads because the ones it comes with are a bit tiny and can hurt your ears if you wear them for extended periods of time (Like I do for gaming) though I have big ears, so that might just be a personal problem. That's my only real complaint. Other than that, I've even already recommended them to a friend!

VI use these headphones every day. They are the best headphones ever as far as I'm concerned. Bought this second pair because I broke the first pair in a mini bike wreck. Sent them back to the manufacturer who is fixing them for free even though they're out of warranty! When I get them back I'll set them aside as my backup pair.They are extremely comfortable. I wear them for many hours at a time with no complaint. The sound quality is awesome. Do the headphones display a bit of character when reproducing sound? Perhaps, but whatever way these things alter the signal, boost or cut frequencies, the result is absolutely perfect. I've tried listening to music with a pair of reference quality phones before that produce a nearly perfect reproduction of the signal they're given, and I like these much better.They're more powerful too. click per click on the volume knob the LPs seem around 50% hotter than studio headphones I've tried.This is a really great headset, and I believe it's worth the investment if you need headphones as often as I do. (Roommates work the 1st shift and I work the 3rd.) I can't say enough good things about these headphones. They are as important to me as my wallet or toothbrush or shoes. I take them everywhere with me. Listen to iPod as I walk to work and walk home afterward. Listen to them when I'm walking to the grocery store. Listen to them all morning while I'm watching Netflix or listening to music while I paint pastels. These things are indispensable!

VI don't post reviews often, but I wanted to for these headphones. I have used them for a few months now and I can say now that the fit, build, sound quality and look are all solid. The only downside was that I needed to buy the XL ear pads because the original ones put too much pressure on my ears after an hour of listening. But now with the XL pads the fit is perfect and I have zero complaints! Sound quality is impressive - its hard for me to listen to music at the gym on my old iPhone ear buds. Can't compare the quality! The carrying case is great. These are the first hi-fi headphones I have ever owned and I hope they will last me a long time.

p914

Vbefore I bought these I had been going through a pair of headphones every 6 months to a year either because they broke, or the sound quality degraded or straight up stopped. (I'm a bit rough on my headphones) it has been four to five years since I bought these and they are still awesome. the sound quality is still top notch and despite the abuse I put them through the only wear and tear is the smooth part of the headband is starting to peel, the cord is barely frayed and the foam padding on the left ear has escaped the black part but stays in place, which is certifiably amazing. They still sound amazing, and for a pair of headphones that can fit my enormous head I am more than happy, and when my pair finally gives up the ghost I plan to get another pair rather than find something else. furthermore the case it comes with is incredibly handy for travel.TL;DR: great quality sound, great construction (will survive apocalypse), can fit large heads. 5/5 would definitely buy again.

VFantastic headphones, sound amazing, with more bass than you can think of, and are in- credibility durable, I've dropped these things on the train, on the ground, and even threw them across the room,(not on purpose, I'm a dancer and when you go in for a pirouette, you forget your headphones aren't attached to your head)

VMan I love these headphones!  The sound is perfect. Crisp, deep bass.  Treble comes in clear, no tingy sound to be heard.The case it comes with is very sturdy, great for stuffing in a backpack for travel.The headphones are really comfortable, I wear them on airplanes even without music playing just to cancel out the ambient noise.  I am constantly complimented on the look of these headphones as well.They are always going on sale here on Amazon - so just wait it out and buy them when they go on sale!  Don't pay full price!

VAwesome headphones for the price, great sound quality and durability. I've had them for a couple months now, and I couldn't be more happy with my purchase. I bought these after a co-worker suggested them, and although with the regular cushions, they can become uncomfortable after a couple hours of listening. I highly suggest getting the memory foam XL cushions with these as well if you plan on using these for longer periods of time. But anyway, if you're looking for something at an affordable price, with good sound quality, and noise isolation. These are one of your best options.

VOnly complaint is I wish it would come with the XL pads included, but still epic headphones, I get lots of compliments on look and quality of sound. Lows (80hz and under) are very defined but not muddy and sound great on every genre i've thrown at it. Being a headphone junkie, I will say that these impressed me at the price I bought them at. On apple products, i've found the "Classical" eq in the music settings to be the most well rounded.Also, buyer beware: THERE IS A LONG BURN IN PERIOD! Mine took about 18hrs to settle. This is usual for most $100+ headphones, but for someone who is not used to waiting, make sure to let them burn in for full quality.

VI previously owned Byerdynamic DT770 PRO 80 Ohms. They were pretty good, a little lacking on base, and the left ear would have a buzzing like a mosquito in my ear when I turn them up higher.These V-Moda's are great!  The bass is punchy and defined, not muddy.  Definition is great across the board but highs and mids might be a little recessed.  These are great for EDM, Electric, Hip Hop.  I highly recommend these.  They look, feel, and sound like quality headphones.  I highly prefer these to the Byers.

VI bought these headphones after doing some online research.  It was a toss up between these and another brand. I decided to go with these based on other reviews from some serious music listeners.  So far I am very satisfied with my decision.  I wanted over-ear phones as I plan to travel by air more this year. I tried them once already on a short flight in a small noise filled plane and they performed well.  I would recommend these for above average to good quality and reasonably priced headphones.

When you are listening to tracks recorded in the studio you can hear the fact that they're in an empty room, if that makes any sense. I can't speak much for more than my opinion as I am certainly no audiophile, but, In my opinion these headphones are incredible.

VI have had the V-MODA Crossfade LP red headphones for about 2 1/2 years and they still work well. I've had to replace the pads and cord going into the headphones, but other than that, they still work well. Nothing has really broken, only a few dents and chips here and there. I use them every day so they've been through a lot. It feels like the left side has gone quieter, but it might be from having that on my ear more. Before, I was going through cheap headphones/ earbuds like crazy. I also never turned the sound up very much with the headphones so that may contribute to its longevity.

They finally gave up. The sound stopped working on one side of the headphones. I almost bought another pair but V-Moda offers free repair for any technical issue even after the warranty expires. I packed them up and shipped them to the factory in L.A. Less than 2 weeks later, I get a package with my headphones fully functional and ready for another beating. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones. If they work for DJ friends, they work for me. It would be unfair to even compare them to Beats or any of those toy headphone$.

VBest Headphones for anyone out there!!!
p1280
sg5
VThe best headphones I could have ever asked for. I shopped for these for a good 2 years before purchasing them. I was skeptical after buying Beats by Dre, solos wireless, and Beats by Dre Mixers. Both Headphones have Broken in the same area. So while shopping around, I purchased some temporary headphones, that just weren't cutting it. I love music and I am picky with sound even though I'm not a sound engineer. I am a hobbyist DJ, that likes to spin from time to time. V-Modas have been on my radar for a while but the price was hurting me due to the Beats breaking and after spending over $500 on headphones. Long story short, from the moment I opened the box, I knew these were it. The product is worth every penny!!! Very well built and feels so good, lets not forget the sound... WOW!!! A very important factor is comfortability. These after wearing every brand out there in the market, I give them a 10. If you are interested, do not wait as I did, and now wished I didn't!!! Go ahead and purchase them you won't regret!!!

VI had these headphones for almost 2 years now and I highly recommend. The sound quality is easily above average. The bass is rich without sacrificing too much treble. I have tried the over ear beats but they feel cheap and in my honest opinion are more about the name than actual quality. These headphones are sturdy, built with high quality, and create rich sound. They also look nice too.

VI purchased these headphones for an amazing price on an Amazon Daily Deal
p1320
sg5
VAll I can say about these is WOW!!!I purchased these headphones for an amazing price on an Amazon Daily Deal.  This means that I got the headphones at half price, but after receiving these I am confident that I would have paid two to three times more for these headphones.  The sound takes a few weeks to really hit its stride, but even from the outset it's pretty great.  While these aren't noise cancelling, I still have a really hard time hearing anyone even on a very moderate volume.  It's difficult to hear myself think with these on, which is why they rock so much.There is great bass and surround sound to these.  Both ears contribute different aspects of songs based on how the song has been mixed or rendered.  If you're using a nice HD sound source, these are comparable to my surround sound speakers at home, except for directly on your ears.  These, to me, are better than the Beats Ear Buds.  These are more balanced than the Beats over-ear headphones.  They compare to Carbine and are really just a great overall product.To boot, these have a load of great accessories to make them fun and stylish.  The color plates are replaceable, though I prefer red.  They come with two cords, one for music and one for chatting on the phone/music.  The long cord for music stretches quite far so you can comfortably move around your desk or workspace.  I've also played basketball with these on quite a few times, and both cords work for that as well.  These can be a little hot if you're moving around, but overall they're great.  Enjoy your purchase!  You wont regret it as I know I haven't.

VLove the sound (especially when I have some good quality music not just someS***ty pop). But they are pretty uncomfortable. I don't have a particularly large head, but I have to wear them at max size. Also, just hurts the physical outside of my ears a bit and squeezes my glasses. So I guess they're just kind of small?

p1356
sg5
VThese are great headphones!  I have owned many, many headphones over the past few years (my wife would say far too many), and these are definitely in my top 5.  There are three things I look for in a pair of headphones: 1) sound; 2) comfort; and 3) style.1) Sound:These headphones sound great, which is true of the entire V-Moda line-up of headphones (I also own the M-80's).  They might have too much bass for so-called audiophiles, but I use them primarily with my xbox one controller, so they are perfect for videogames and movies.  I don't spend too much time discussing sound because its highly subjective.  They sound good and they have reviewed well.2) Comfort:With the stock ear pads, these headphones are of average comfort.  They get somewhat warm, but they won't hurt your ears or head with prolonged use.  The best feature of these headphones is that you can upgrade the stock ear pads with different colors and sizes.  If you would prefer a much more comfortable fit, I strongly recommend that you pick up the XL ear pads for $20-25 in grey.  The sound is a little better with the larger ear pads, but they become the most comfortable headphones I own at that point...more comfortable than the Parrot Zik wireless headphones (highly recommended), my Sony MDRXB950AP/H silver headphones (also highly recommended), and the V-Moda M-80's (not nearly as comfortable.3) Design:These headphones look really great...very futuristic with great materials.  The white leather with grey trim and shiny metal accents creates a premium look that really stands out.  The pictures don't do these headphones justice.  They might stand out a little too much for those people who prefer a more-traditional black headphone look.  You can change up the look with ear cup shields with different colors and finishes, but I actually really like the stock polished silver look.One thing to note, the similar V-Moda M-80's I own had some fraying and unraveling of the headphone cord's fabric weave.  I haven't had any problems yet with the LP's, and the cords can be replaced easily, but its something to keep in mind.

p1380
sg5
VSo my honest review after listening to these headphones for about 30 minutes or so equates to bass, bass, bass; The mids and highs have been recessed alot to accommodate for the thumping bass, if u are listen to any music with an already heavy bass presence expect to struggle to hear the mid range. The highs in my opinion is present by way of being loud but not exactly adequate separation between it and the lows/ the bass. I know am sounding like i don't love these headphones but that isn't the case at all, it works really well for its targeted audience. The bass quality is tremendous and an instant energy booster, so for such activities like the gym and other high impact performance it works . In all i would definitely recommend these headphones, if u are into alot of bass, hip-hop, rap and so fort. So to that genre I'll give it...3.9/5So after a couple more hours of listening time and lending my ears to get acclimated with the sound; i would say it does seem to adjust collectively and rather nicely, in terms of getting familiar with the sounds phases. I still stand by my initial mid range assessment and believe it to be the weak aspect these headphones in my opinion. To finally conclude , the lps really do sound great with heavy bass after u give it several hours of custom time. Again recognize its targeted audience, and u should have fun with these.

VSo I got them and tried them out to see if I liked them. so I followed the directions and such and found that inorder for the sound to actually be good you have to flip around the cable against the direction and the volume adjustment doesnt work. other than that the sound is awesome (given that you flip the cable around) so I just use the back up cable witch works both ways.

p1410
sg5
VMy husband is a Music Producer and DJ of House Music.  He is VERY picky about headphones, but I wanted to get him a nice pair for Christmas.  After reading review after review and talking with other people in the industry, the V-MODE Crossfade LP headphones were highly recommended.  I could have gone with the LP2, but the older version are almost just as good for a lot less.  I really liked how the plates on the headphones can be customized or engraved.  I engraved his plates with his logo.  He really LOVED them.  The cord is very thick and high quality, but what he liked the most is that it can be detached for storage.  They came in a nice case which now he uses to put his flash drives in with his music for gigs and that is all he needs to bring.  It is perfect!

VI do not normally write reviews, but I would like to share my experience of the Crossfade LP.  The overall sound is great and I have used these extensively for twenty one months, and have been totally happy with them until......they cracked on the left side where the adjustment piece is and the screws mount into plastic part of the headband. I have read  reviews where others were having the same exact problem.  I have not abused this product in any way and am somewhat disappointed that they did not last at least a couple of years. Although these are still usable, the wire leading from the left cup into the headband is now out of the slot provided where the plastic piece cracked and will eventually fail from being pinched.  I know that they are only $100, but I have some less expensive pairs that are 5+ years old and without flaws.  I will admit that I will probably purchase another set because of the sound quality.  Hopefully I will have better luck with the next pair.

VKit came with a hard case with Velcro inserts each holding their own aux chord with one having a smartphone remote controller as well as a large audio input adapter. Great headphones. Sound quality was crisp and headphones sit comfortably over your ears. Doesn't completely cancel noise but with music playing you would never know. Headphones don't fold, but I'm reality you don't save very much space with foldable headphones of the same size anyway (~3"). In comparison to beats headphones these are higher quality material and sound for a fraction of the price. I would 100% try these over Beats. Ship it back if you don't agree.

It's obvious that V-MODA pays a lot of attention to detail and that they care about the product they are putting out there.Unfortunately, despite the above-mentioned positives, I had to return these headphones for one reason: mediocre sound quality. I am no audiophile and simply wanted to get the best sound for about $100. After reading entirely too many reviews, I ordered both the V-MODA Crossfade LP and the Audio-Technica ATH-40X and tested the sound out on my own. The sound quality on the ATH-40X was phenomenal to start with -- clear and vibrant at all ranges (it's worth noting that they are tuned "flat" meaning they are versatile but may lack bass as compared to other headphones). In contrast, the V-MODAS sounded muddled, with the bass overpowering the mids and trebs. I tried a variety of types of music - indie, rock, house, rap, Spanish, etc. In all of these -- even with bass-heavy house and hip hop -- the ATH-40X was a clear winner.I hoped that the fabled "burn-in" time might help out the V-MODAs, but after using them for a while they still sounded no clearer. Every time I put them on I was disappointed. It's really too bad, because in every other aspect the V-MODAS far outpace my clunky, ugly ATH-M40X. But if high quality sound at a reasonable price is what you're after, look beyond these V-MODAS.2-stars for sound quality5-stars for styling, build quality, packaging and support

VI've had my set for a few years, purchased from my mothers amazon account. They work perfect even after a few years of frequent use(at least once a week). I've been quite careful with them, and they've never had a major drop, although there's been quite a few minor ones (ex: falling off my bed onto a carpet).The cracked plastic problem that some have reported has not been an issue for me, although I also double checked the tightness of the screws when they first arrived.My only complaint is cleaning them. Having ear wax build up over the course of many years is a common problem with headphones even if people keep their ears clean like I do. Taking off the ear-pads isn't difficult, but the metal covering the actual speaker can't be removed, and therefore is extremely challenging to clean.Every time any one of my friends mentions a desire to buy a set of headphones, I always mention these straight away. Nothing beats them for the price (with the possible exception of the Crossfade LP2. Their price has dropped to 130, but I've not tried them before)I also recently purchased an Mpow bluetooth wireless receiver to give them wireless capabilities, and they work perfectly with that as well.

Vdaily driver for 3 YEARS!! Amazing Pair
p1646
sg5
VOWNED AND USED DAILY FOR 3 YEARS!!! These have been my daily drivers since i was in highschool and i've since graduated college. The bass is phenomenal, highs are great although mids are slightly lacking. But i mostly listen to edm so it has never bothered me in the slightest even though i do consider myself an audiophile. The mix on these is far from balanced but the modified tone it gives is actually really pleasant! These are open back so you can hear through them and the cable is removable (thank god) I've gone through 5 cables so far.THE AMAZING BUILD QUALITY DOE!!These say they are military grade construction on the box and they are not lying. i throw these around like you dont believe, ive never had a pair of anything else last me more than 4 months and these have lasted me 3 MOTHER @#$%ING YEARS. I cant say that enough. that being said I have gone through 5 cables, the "leather" on the top is starting to tear considerably as of recent and they are scratched up a bit but thats to be expected. In terms of sound quality they took 48 hours straight white noise to burn in but once they did they sounded amazing. I've dropped them hundreds of time and I have noticed slight vibration noise when listening to certain bass frequencies but it is not consistent... im not sure if a part of the driver is lose or something i stuck in there but it doesnt happen often and does detract from the listening experience

p1663
sg5
VThese are excellent headphones with unrivaled construction, materials and quality in every detail. In today's headphone mid-range market there's Quality and there's marketing. You can get two different headphones for $300 and on one of them only maybe $50 were put in actual R&D;, materials, fit & finish and quality control and the other $250 you're paying is Celebrity sponsorships, marketing and maybe good packaging. While for the same amount you get a unit that went thru good R&D; to get it right, top notch materials with military specs, strict quality control and good packaging and presentation at the cost of $200 sacrificing profit but offering the best products for their customers. This are really solid headphones with great sound that I can take anywhere, put them in my backpack without worry about plastic parts breaking. They look awesome as they are but they're also customizable with different color side plates. Sound quality is good if a bit bassy but not in a bad way. I use mine's with a Fiio E07K Andes headphone amp and sound it's awesome but they'll work well with your MP3 player, tablet, iPod, iPhone or Android phone.

p1747
sg5
VOk if I could give it another half of a star, I would but, I cant. I am writing this review with only a couple of days experience so I will check back in time.Pros:-Beefy heavy duty cord and controller which i great because they are usually the first part to go on a set of headphones.-Great sound quality for the price. The base is deep and the music is pretty clear-They get loud, like really loud-Despite not having active noise cancelling, they do a damn good job at drowning out noises around you.Cons:-Once the headphones reach about half volume, they start to become noticeable to those around you (I work in a quiet office). The small slits on the bottom of the metal insert begin to radiate the music. (But keep in mind these are DJ headphones so that may be the reason)-The headband is a little tight, not as tight at SOL over ear headphones but not as light as BOSE so if your listening to music for a long period of time like I do at work, then they might start to give you a headache.Overall, for the price point, I think these are probably some of the better over the ear headphones you can get. I just hope they can stand the test of time because, like I said earlier I listen to them at work so they get at least 40 hours of use a week.

VThese headphones are great.  Not only are they really nice looking but the sound is awesome.  At first I was hesitant about the scaly design on the head band and ear cups, but when it arrived it looked very sharp.  The headphones feel very durable.  I've had them for about a month so far and they've survived my active life style and multiple pets. The head band part is very bendy and feels well made. I have already dropped these several time and nothing has happened so far. These are very adjustable and even fit my small head.  The case is nice and pretty compact.  I just wish it came with a handle.  I've worn these for a few hours at a time and they are very comfortable. Overall these headphones are in my opinion the best or one of the best for about 100$.

VGreater Audio Dynamic Range + Balanced
p1776
sg5
VOf the headphones that I've owned, Denon AH-D 310R, Klipsch Image One & Status, RHA SA950, V-MODA's Crossfade LP offers the greater audio dynamic range of them all. While the V-MODA's noise isolation is second to the Klipsch Status. Both being analog - not digital - I found that the Klipsch Status reduces ambient noises a bit better. However the Crossfade's stereo ambiance, dynamic range - there does seems to be something to their "V-PORT" - and overall balance is much better. As well as not sounding muddy throughout it's audio range. Additionally I thought to purchase the V-MODA because of their OUT OF WARRANTY repair service (from v-moda's FAQ web page: "Yes, we can repair mechanical issues free of charge.") The Klipsch Status that I'd been using began "self destructing" after their warranty (2-years) expired. Because they're no longer being made, I couldn't get them repaired (Planned Obsolescence). The Crossfade LP's are the best made and best sounding headphones I've ever owned.

VDay One WoW Factor Impressed
p1782
sg5
VI can honestly say these are by far the best headphones hands down for the price you pay compared to the other mainstream brands such as BEATS or Bose. I started by examining the outside package which already beats the packaged of the 2 mentioned brands by far the packaging is by far superior, but you can't judge a book by it's cover though. I went and broke the seal of the box and again I was amazed on how the packaged the inside of the carton, V-MODA took great care and detail to make sure that everything is very neat. The outer shell casing is an excellent design and is pretty hard and will withstand drops and maybe 10lbs or so of pressure wouldn't want to smash or step on the case with the headphones it but would do great just thrown in a bag on the go, however there is a carabiner clip that comes with this to attach to the outside of your bag for easy carrying and fast loading when you are done with them.When wearing these you will know you are wearing headphones and not like the others that are made with mostly plastic and are really light. These headphones have a little heft to them, but when you put them on your ears they are the most comfortable headphones around. The ear cushions are very soft and can be worn for long periods of time. There is barely any sound that leaks from these headphones when the volume is all the way up. There is no distortion in the sound and everything sounds so crisp including the bass which you can feel around your ears. These are not your noise cancellation but noise isolation which prevents sound leakage and also cuts back on some of the outside noise that you get when you wear a lot of the on the ear headphones which is great because more of the sound stays in your ears and not out.I have given this a try by playing many different types of music and by far this can handle anything you throw at it. These aren't your $250 + headphones but what you get is a great headphone set at a great price that I honestly believe sounds much better than the Beats Studio or the latest Bose headphones minus the Quiet Comforts which are actually noise cancelling and are pretty good but that is if you want to fork over 3 large bills which I did when I bought the QC 3's back in 2007. I wanted something that was more affordable and yet sound quality along with build quality is there, something that is much durable than a lightweight piece of plastic. I wouldn't waste much time looking at other headphones. Just look at the total number of reviews and star ratings for the V-MODA Crossfade LP's and see for yourself that this is a trusted brand  Like the packaging says INSPIRED in ITALY and STYLED in HOLLYWOOD you can't go wrong.

The Case is wonderful---protects, easy in/out, and is designed to clip to a belt loop or backpack.  Comes with two cords.  Could not be more pleased !!!

VGreat headphones, but...
p1836
sg5
VThese headphones were great; while they lasted. I took them to school everyday and used them throughout the day for an entire school year, the right speaker had started to skip around and completely stop every once and awhile. Then the right side had completely gone out around the one year mark. Possibly due to a short in a wire, maybe? I tried to see if the warranty covered this, alas, they have a one year warranty and I had been 3 months late. My luck.

VSo far, these headphones are great.  I would say that they are missing a little midrange.  I believe they are probably made for rap/techno/dance genres.  Like many others, I burned them in--that is, let them play for over 24 straight hours with relatively loud music.  The difference was very noticeable.  So give them a fair chance; burn them in.  I've been working too much to really get much of a chance to enjoy them, but so far, I'm impressed.  I say so far, as I've purchased other headphones, to only have them fail after a short period of time...some not work at all after a week or so.

VAn amazing pair of headphones. I was fortunate enough to find these headphones on an Amazon deal and just said why not. Once I received the headphones and took them out of their packaging and great case, I plugged these bad boys in. The audio quality was outstanding. I mainly got them for music, but have been using them over my gaming headphones because of the clarity. My gaming headphones are 7.1 surround sound which are great for gaming. However, I noticed that the clarity of voice chat was nowhere similar. Every time I have to switch between the two, the sound of my friends turn into sounds from adults in charlie brown. I am looking to purchase the plug in mic for V-moda and am excited to see how it will work. I absolutely love these headphones and glad I purchased them and did not go with any over commercialized brand like beats,

VExceptional Quality Headphones
p1865
sg5
VGreat Headphones. I've had mine for about a month now, and have used them daily for hours at a time. The sound isolation works great; with them on I can not hear anything around me (although I do work in a relatively quiet environment, people converse around me often). They are extremely durable, have great sound (not too heavy on the bass in my opinion, a perfect balance of treble and bass), and fit great. They are impressively light and nearly unnoticeable on my head, I can wear them for hours. Plus, they are aesthetically appealing and can be customized. The case is convenient as well.I would recommend these to anyone.Note: Although I purchased mine during a sale for $80, I would not hesitate to pay near-full price for these. In my opinion, they are premium quality.

These look even better in person than the pictures online.  The sound clarity and openness are great considering this price point.  They are an great value with style for someone not wanting to spend the money (and line pockets of a celebrity) of a $300 pair.

VThese headphones have very good looks and build quality. But they sound terrible. They produce harsh high frequencies similar to the aliens from Independence Day movie. They give really bad headache and ear pain. They don't sound comfortable to ears at volumes higher than 2/15 on Samsung Galaxy S4. And, yes I burned them for more than 24 hours that didn't help either.

p1966

VPros: Sound quality is phenomenal, the bass is just enough that it lets you know it's there but it does not overdue it or kill it like a lot of other headphones of less quality and more money *cough* beats *cough*.The mids are crisp and so are the highs and lows. The durability of these headphones are unmatched by any other, ultra bendable, Kevlar wires, and metal frames. I love the strength they have. And they are very very comfyNegative: They leak a bit when listening to music, but it only leaks if the are really loud which at that point you might have a hearing problem if you need them that loud. They aren't too ideal for a airplane but if you need silence and alone time with music, these are the best.They are noise isolating not canceling so they will not block out all the sound.

p1972

VI don't often write reviews on amazon, but I felt there is need for a few important notes.Sound was bassy and muddy when I first tried these. However, after running JLab audio burn in file (google it) overnight at medium volume on repeat and a couple 8 hour work days listening to music these cans sound fantastic. I am no audiophile, but am not tone deaf. The sound is not flat across the board, especially when compared to my friend's studio monitor headphones, but that is not a bad thing - lower tones are rich while higher ones balance out well. I listen mainly to indie/folky stuff (think Avett and Mumford) and these seem to be made for that style of music. But these definitely have the chops to just as much enjoy classical, rock, jazz, and everything else I enjoy. I purchased these for $75, and I can't say they have the absolute best sound (technically studio headphones will always be better). But HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART.The style and durability of these headphones seems second to none. I work a white collar job and want neither huge black studio headphones nor flashy plastic stuff for teens. I bought the gunmetal grey model and they're the best possible, professional headphones for this situation. They fit my XL (61cm) head just fine - they were a bit tight AT FIRST but now feel super cozy after about a week. The passive sound cancelling is great when around coworkers - doesnt leak much sound at all- but the flexible band is great for having one side off your ear if need be. They aren't too big at all - they seem reeeeally balanced on my head. They aren't too wide (which looks really goofy) or lopsided, and as a very self conscious person with a large head I think they look fantastic, and I bet they would look the same on someone with a smaller head. The removable cable is a big plus, not only for later use but you can pick between a longer cable and a shorter daily use one - on studio headphones under $150+ you're usually stuck with a long coiled cable. Here's the bottom line. Everyone spending $100 on headphones is going to research the sound quality etc, but when it boils down to it, this past paragraph of features is what will make this a memorable headset.Honestly the only slight fault I have found is they seem to sound a bit muddier on my phone than the laptops I use, which is definitely to be expected with any underpowered device and superior headphones; not so much a con as a fact of life.For $100 and under, you will not regret it.

V4* for those who view 5* as paid endorsements.  I bought these headphones and a pair of Skullcandy Crushers at the same time.  I kinda wanted to test them both out since I found them both on sale and I couldn't test the V-MODA at my local electronics store.  The Crushers have very aggressive bass and if you want to listen to 2-3 songs and then have to give your ears a break then go nuts.  But if you want a pair of headphones that will sound crisp and thump so bass even on very low volume then these are the headphones you want.  The noise cancelling is pretty amazing and the wearing comfort is nice.  I live in an apartment so using my shelf system isn't an option most of the time and these headphones let me rock out.  I also have the unfortunate situation of a major construction expansion going on just outside my apartment.  As a student working on my thesis I have a very relaxed schedule where I spend a lot of time just studying or writing.  Usually I have to flee my apartment and find a quiet place to work but now I can sit here with my headphones on and focus on my work.

They came in a black case though the earphones were white, but I really like the black case better.  Case nicely built and has a nice shape.  Everything you need is packaged within the case so when you travel.2. I wore them the 1st night I received them for about 6 hours, and they are very comfortable.  Of course I know everyone's head is different in size & shape.  Ear cushions feel very soft and not too tight, just enough to stay on my head.3. Looks - all I can say is they look better in person than the pictures. This is perhaps odd sounding, but my longest debate was the color choice.  I really liked the white color but felt perhaps it would look much better on a female than a male (yeah I know, stupid thought).  I'm a guy, but the white does not look feminist at all, a very nice color in person.4. I'm not an audiophile, but perhaps what you would consider an average listener.  I use them for music & for watching movies on my tablet.  And I have heard about "burning" headphones in, but from my 1st night of wearing & using them on a variety of music genres the music sounds great & of course movies sounded great also.Would highly recommend these headphones, price wise it would be hard to find better.

VThere is way to much bass in these headphones.  They do not represent the actual sound of a recording.  I was very disappointed in the sound quality of these headphones though i admit several reviewers mentioned that there was a lot of bass. I have been using several different pairs of AKG's that are in the studio and the AKG's sound much better than v-moda do.

VI love these headphones, they are awesome. I feel lucky to have found a pair on sale. I bought these for only $35, normally they are rather expensive, out of my acceptable price range. I would of just passed right over, not even bothering to look at them, but that $30 price caught my eye. Now I see why people will pay so much money for headphones. They sound fantastic! Maybe a little too fantastic; now I will have to sort through all my music, delete the bad quality songs then re-download them in higher bitrates so everything I listen to can sound its best. The headphones are comfortable and fit just right. They have exchangeable color plates that you can buy separately, I have my eye on the green ones. I don't really know enough about music to analyze its sound profile, but I can describe it a bit. It has a really nice deep bass that resonates well, the trebles can be a bit high and irritating if they are bad quality songs. With CD quality music it sounds clear and melodic, hence the reason I need to upgrade some of my music. The headphones block out my roommate talking or watching shows so I can focus on my music, videos, or games with no distractions.These headphones came in a beautiful case lined in red felt for storage. It came with 2 different cables, one with volume controls for a mobile device, and one without for use at a computer. Both cables are braided with high quality angled jacks. It also comes with an adapter for... well I actually don't know what it would be for, but its there for anyone who does need it.

VI'm disappointed with this set of headphones. I read all of the positive reviews, concerning the sound quality and amount of bass, that had been written and decided to jump on the deal of the day amazon was offering for these. I got same day shipping and when I opened them up, they are definitely eye-catching and comfortable to wear as well. I played some songs that I knew had a lot of bass in them and there was basically no bass...my skull candy titan earbuds seem to give way more bass than these and better overall sound quality! :( I'm not sure if I got a dud set or I just was expecting more than I should have. Going to have to return these, I really wish they had worked out because they are beautiful. 2 starupdate 6/26/2015:after asking amazon for an exchange due to these possibly being defective, I received a quick response that they were going to send another set out at 1 day shipping. Got my new headphones and the other set was definitely just a dud; these new headphones have so much bass and the sound quality is great! I will have to break them in like others have mentioned but overall very happy with this purchase and amazon's great customer service! 5 star

VV-Moda Crossfade headphones = Sanity saver...
p2111
sg5
VI'm no audiophile, but I have a huge music collection and appreciate great music.  I bought V-Moda Crossfade headphones about a year and a half ago and I love them.  Over the years, being the frugal (not cheap!) person that I am, I have wasted a lot of money buying dozens of inexpensive earbuds and/or headphones which didn't last very long.  I started searching for an attractive, reasonably-priced long-term solution about two years ago, which led me to these headphones.  At the time these were more than I wanted to spend, so I waited for a sale and got them for about $80 and don't regret the purchase at all.  I work in an office, but I'm inundated with ambient noise from people and other sources and these headphones block noise well, allowing me to concentrate on my work.  I don't work well in a noisy environment and I call them my sanity saver.  Outside noise isn't completely eliminated, but is no longer a distraction.  The sound is great, the fit is adjustable and very comfortable for me; I wear them all day at work.  Also, after well over a year of daily use, they still look almost new, no cracking of the foam etc.  Highly recommended.

p2117
sg5
VAfter using these headphones for almost two and a half years I realized I had never reviewed them. Overall I am very pleased with my V-Moda's. When I first got them I was surprised by how much I had been missing from my songs with cheap earbuds that I had been using. On some songs I heard instruments that I had never really heard before and all my songs were a lot clearer. I listen to a lot of genres and find the sound quality decent across the board. I cant really comment on the bass as I do not play a lot of bass heavy songs and those that i do the settings i tend to use keep it pretty balanced with everything else. Even just playing off my cellphone I tend to keep the volume pretty low as that is all i need with these, off my computer i keep the volume even lower. The noise isolation aspect works well, a lot of background noise is blocked out, it probably could be better but my ears are a little large and so the cup doesnt fully seal around my ears.Build quality is great, even after several years of frequent wear they look almost new, I have none of the cracking that you see in some reviews. The earpads still look good with no cracking or falling apart. Probably the worst looking part is the cable, the fabric covering it has threads tufting off in spots, its not a real problem though. I do tend to keep them in their case when traveling and in a drawer when otherwise when not in use, that  could have helped keep them in the shape they are in.Comfort is the one spot that I have any kind of problem with. I can usually wear these for a couple hours at a time without a problem however, despite frequent wear over the last two and a half years the band is still too tight on my head. Sometimes this means having to take them off after less than an hour or so instead of 2-3 hours.

VUnlike most people, I take care of my personal belongings and if you take care of these headphones, you should not have a problem.  I use these when flying and they do work to cancel the plane noise and allow you to hear your music or watch your video and actually hear the show. Easy to get in and out of the storage case and that is the key to keeping them like new. I like the fact you can unplug the cord from the ear piece. Great buy for the price, no need to pay triple digits for great headphones.

VI did a lot of research before buying these headphones and I was not disappointed. These sound amazing, have GREAT build construction which is vital because I am a college student throwing these into backpacks and hauling across campus every day, with a great cable. People that I have called have been able to hear me clearly. They are noise-isolating (which I wanted, my roommate talks all the time) but if there's no music playing I can hear people relatively well (although I usually slide one side off my ear for better clarity). Overall I love these headphones and this company.

VGreat sound.Only thing stopping me from giving these headphones 5 stars is that the fabric the holds the cushion foam separated from the inside of the headphones leaving the foam exposed.  Happened after about 6 months.  This was covered under warranty but I didn't want to be without headphones for 3 weeks.I should add that these are super comfortable, even with the foam exposed.  I routinely wear these for 10+ hours straight with 0 discomfort.

VI've had these headphones for a while now. While they sound great and keep a lot of background noise out, they give me a headache if I wear them any longer than an hour. The band is strong, but after a while I feel the weight of it on the crown of my head. The speakers also press tightly against my ears. I realize this is a trade off between having good enclosure and sound quality vs comfort. Maybe I'm just sensitive. My head isn't large by any means. I wear a size 7 ball cap. I'd love to give these 5 stars, but I have to nick one star for the lack of long-term wear comfort.

VThe headphones aren't nearly as heavy as a lot of people were describing. They sit just fine. They sound great, and they look awesome. I've had them for about a month or two now and have had zero problems. My only thing is that since the ear-coverings don't fold or anything and that metal piece is there, it's not comfortable to just let it sit around your neck, especially if it hits/rests on your collar bones. Otherwise I enjoy them quite a bit. You can hear music a little from the outside  when you wear them if you have the volume up on the higher end, but who cares.

About a month after getting them I happened to pick up a blanket and the simple static cling of it managed to fry out the right ear on the dang things. Didn't have the receipt so 120$ down the drain. Lesson learned, always wear them in person at a store to see if fit matches regardless of what you hear about online and it doesn't matter how well built they are s*** happens. It's a little sad it only took that much to break these though...

VI received these as a Christmas present. At the time they where only $120.Build quality is superb.  At least 80% metal and it feels very sturdy.  Definitely could stand several drops.Comfort is average.  Being mostly metal they are on the heavier side of headphones. But are comfortable.  I recommend spending the extra $20 on the XL pads to improve it.Sound quality.At first the sound was very sharp and detailed. The highs sounded amazing but never gave my fatigue.Mids were on point at all times especially when voices came into play.Bass was very deep and tight.I heard more music out of songs I've spent hours listening to. And movies were impeccable. Gaming put you into the world of existance.They sounded amazing.But after 5 months and 300+ hour burn in.They've lost the life in them. Everything I've said is still there, but they sound dead. They have a neutral/coldish sound and it takes 4+ hours of listening for them to start sounding warm.For a headphone with low independence and a range of 5hz-30khz I just imagined them to be better.Overall these will sound amazing to anyone and will make them smile. But for audiophiles I would look towards the m-100's or audio-technica, sony, Beyer dynamic,  grado, or even shure headphones if you want something more higher quality sounding.

p2376
sg5
VNoise cancelling drone + bass from headphones give me a headache and hurts my ears after just 20minutes of use.  I'm not a baby either. I use the Drea beat studio with bass all the way up all day without any problems and this is just too harsh. Sound quality for anything other than rap is Terrible. On the plus side,  the bass is amazing but other sound is way too muffled. Anything that's just vocals like a podcast has way too much bass even after turning bass totally off on my sound card PC equalizer. Also the sound bleeds and upsets my coworkers.

Barely any volume, hardly any bass. Sound quality was decent but not excellent. Makes me wonder if reviews I read were planted by maunufacturer.  I don't see how anyone could have a $200 asking price for the quality I received. I did get them for $120, but even that was too much. I have gotten much better sound quality out of headphones for half the price. I would not recommend purchasing these headphones.

V. I bought the white version and it looks great. Shiny metal side panels that are changeable are a plus. The sound is bass heavy so if you are not into a lot of bass look elsewhere. These headphones are labeled as Over Ear but with my large ears not even the XL pads prevent pain over a few hours.

VI truly, truly wanted to like these headphones. I spent a whole obsessive week reading the reviews and considering other options. Mine came within a day of ordering so that was extra sweet.Design: amazingLooks: very striking and unusualCasing: super durableBonus: extra cable, carabiner and cloth to clean the headphones withMy issues with it were the weight. It has a lot of metal bits so it's very heavy so the cups pushes my ears down, making them hurt after just a short amount of time. Also, due to the weight, the headband rests on top of your head and it's very noticeable. After a while, that causes strain all around.The headphones are also very tight creating pressure points at both sides my jaw area. I thought perhaps it was just my head. I let my girlfriend wear it and she has a small head (for an adult) and it hurt and put pressure on her head/ears too.It's really too bad coz they look and sound so damn good especially with EDM!I've returned them after owning them for one day :(

p2465
sg5
VI'm not a snob for sound quality so I can't really comment on that. Suffice to say they sound good enough to me.The color is gorgeous, for those concerned that "rouge" means or could look pink I can confirm that these are in fact clearly red and black. The construction feels solid and I've been rolling over the cord for months now with no issues.My only complaint, which I re-iterated in my review of the XL cushions I bought to make it bigger, is that I wouldn't say they are completely "over-ear". Even with the XL pads it doesn't encompass my entire ear. I use them without a problem but wish they were slightly bigger.

VThis is a great pair of headphones. The audio quality is outstanding in all aspects, especially if you like strong bass. The build quality is unbelievable, no competitors come close. The design as well as the case looks very appealing although that depends on personal preference. The only negative point is the comfort, after listening for more than 2 hours without taking it off, my ears start to hurt due to only a thin mesh/material layer between the driver and your ear when it's inside. The cup padding is very nice and comfortable though.

VThere is much better out there but hey
p2501
sg5
VI've had my eyes set on the Crossfade LP's for years now. Yeah, I know. There is much better out there but hey, to each his own.I am an audiophile and will never settle for mediocre sound quality. With that said, I will say these headphones sound good. They ARE a bit bass heavy. It really does sound like there are subwoofers in your head. Like other reviewers have mentioned, if you're looking for flat, clean and clear well-balanced sound, maybe go for something else. I was in the market for some DJ headphones that can deliver an ample amount of sub bass but without sacrificing overall sound quality. These do the job for me. If I was to give it some criticism though, the mids can use more clarity. Definitely go for something else if you're looking for headphones to mix with. But if you're just wanting to enjoy your music, you can't go wrong with these.These cans are great at sound isolation.Now the thing that really impresses me is just how durable and rugged these headphones are. They come in a hardshell case that can also hold all your little accessories (quarter inch adapter, different length cables, etc). I must have sat on the headphones themselves a handful of times and they're still holding up fine. I accidentally dropped these from high up and the left headphone/driver/whatever fell out and I thought it was trashed. Nope, just click it back in, and it works just like new.Overall, I'd recommend these. If you don't care too much about what color you get, just get the rouge red. They look dope and they're 20 dollars cheaper than all the other colors.

V3 YEAR OWNER (Custom Plated Nero)
p2543
sg5
VI have to say after almost 4 years of owning these head phones i still wear them over my ATH- M50's and occasionally for gaming with my xbox one. There is only slight wear and tear from extremely heavy use and the heat from the florida sun.1. The leather material on the head band has COMPLETELY rubbed off. Now theres just the fabric underneath. I dont know if its becuase if the heat or just 3 years of heavy constant use.2. The headphone aux cables have frayed but this is to be expected thankfully they are cheap and replaceable. HOWEVER, the wiring that connects the headband to the earcups are still ine PERFECT condition!3. And last of all the laser engraving has faded a bit.Becuase of the leather material rubbing off the headband i will be buying a new pair and switching the custom ear and wing plates off the old pair. I will store the new headphones in a safe place and continue putting the old pair work.These headphone are a bit heavy, a little tight and leak a lot of noise, nor do the isolate noise (unless you turn them up til you cant hear anything else) but the sound quality is great, the look amazing and they last forever.I dont regret the $250 price tag when i first got them and i will be purchasing them again.

VThese are great. I have them for 2.5 years and the sound is the best you can get. Only problem is that after a year, they started shocking my ears if I move much. I use them at work sitting in my desk, but I try to not move a lot to not get shocked. I'm not sure I could use it with my mobile phone. If it wasn't for this little inconvenient, these would be perfect. I'm still hoping to use them for many years, if the shocking doesn't get worse.

VAmazing I've had mines since 2012 they have survived through everything, even a year long military deployment in the desert. I've just recently purchased a new cable but only cost 15$ the only reason i didn't give 5 stars, however, I was very rough on these headphones while deployed from; sand,water, motor oil these received the works but still kept on kicking.

VMove over Bose - these guys are great, for 1/2 the price. They are not powered noise-cancelling headphones but are comfortable and do a pretty good job of keeping out ambient noise, particularly on a plane (which is why I bought them). No more chatter, crying babies, obnoxious iPad noise. Just clear, clean audio.

VSo, first off, I need to mention the seller: please, for the love of all that is good in the world, stop using OnTrac. These were delivered when the driver threw, and not dropped or lightly tossed over the gate, I do mean forcefully chucked the box at my door from a distance (and this is by no means my first complaint with OnTrac, it seems to be company wide or I just have the worst luck).Fortunately, they were packed and packaged wonderfully, only the shipping box suffered damage. This was great for my un-boxing therapy. These are packaged beautifully, with a red ribbon you need to cut to boot. Cables came with their own Velcro ties which, for a cable snob, deserves props (there's also a lovely inspirational quote from the proverbial She on the 3 button cable). So there's that.First impressions, they are quite comfortable, though the tips of my ears rub but the xl pads will be on their way soon. They're not too tight but don't move around, and they even fit in reverse. This is a benefit as I don't want the cable running across my chest when I'm trying to manage a bunch of midi devices (and it's music, I don't really care if the panning is reversed). Another plus: they're customizable. Even though I love the gator skin and purple look, I may have to get some custom shields.Now for the sound: at first listen, these are fantastic. They're bassy but I like it, even for production (I have a bad habit of making tracks way too bass heavy and these help balance it out). These are great as a reference point and I was able to keep them on for a decent amount of time without discomfort. More to come if anything changes.Update: I put the gray XL pads on these and they look and feel fantastic.

p2680

Vlovely headphoneI was inclined to buy a Bose headphone and watching review after review on YouTube I decided for this brand. All good reviews about this headphone are totally true. Its amazing : sound, construction, packing, case, etc. My two little critiques for this product is:1- in line control / mic is too close to the headphone, when you have it on your head you cant see the control/mic, you need to use your fingers to find it. No big deal but could be improved if the control/ mic was a little lower.2- when I am not listening any song I lower the headphone around my neck, this way i can talk to someone (as this headphone really blocks the external sound beautifully) I wish the speakers could turn to their side and be more comfortable in this position and give to my head more flexibility to move right / left.Besides these two little things, we are talking about great, great headphones.This is an update. I started having problems with the cord and the mic. Volume was going up by itself and mic wasn't working properly, also I complained that the control was too close to my face and hard to touch it. I contacted V Moda costumer service by email and they replaced my cord super fast. New cord now has mic separated from the control, it's closer to the mouth and the control in the right place.Great customer service and fast shipping. I love this headphone more now.

VBest Headphones I've ever owned!!!
p2686
sg5
VThe best pair of headphones I've personally owned so far! I love my music and I listen to a lot of different genres, little bit of everything. I've had cheap headphones in the past and started paying more attention to sound quality after I bought my first nice set of headphones, the Skullcandy Aviator. They were my flagship headphones until I got a hold of the LPs. After shopping around for headphones so much I started focusing on five main features when considering which ones to buy so let's see how the LPs stack up!#1 Comfort: If their not comfortable your not going to wear them, but you don't have any worries with the LPs. Light weight, flexible headband with decent cushioning, and great ear cups. The padding on the ear cups is memory foam and feels good on the head. Their not very deep though and for me personally their a tad uncomfortable after an hour or so. Normally this would be a deal breaker but V-Moda makes an XL Ear Pad that can be switched out from the stock ones and I definitely plan on getting those which should solve any comfort issues I have with these.#2 Sound Quality: This is why we buy headphones after all and the LPs sound great! I'm not a sound quality expert or Audiofile, but I've heard good and bad headphones so this is the average Jo perspective. I liked my Skullcandy Aviators because they had good clarity and a tight punchy bass, the LPs have the clarity, an open and somewhat 3D-ish sound stage, along with a deeper bass that thumps but is still tight, controlled and punchy. It's not low and muddy like other headphones can be, for the average person these are gonna sound amazing but give um some time. These take a little bit of breaking in so don't judge their sound right out of the box, play some music through um for a day or two and you'll notice an improvement big time. They also isolate outside noise very well which is great for traveling or blocking out noisy commutes and annoying family members. Of course sound always comes down to personal taste and what you listen to most of the time, at least try um and see if they'll work for you.#3 Durability: These are built like a tank and are rated to take abuse far beyond what most people will do to their headphones, if you take care of them with average use they should last you for years. The sturdy build of the LPs is great alone but the back up you get from V-Moda makes um even better. Basically you get 60 Days to try um out, if you're not happy with um send um back with in the 60 days for a refund, that simple. If you decide to keep um they protect you with a 1 year warranty and after that warranty expires and your LPs break, send um back and get 50% off a new pair. Not many companies offer that kind of support so kudos to V-Moda for that!#4 Versatility: These are great for the average person who wants um for general listen. They don't fold up like some other consumer focused headphones, but the included carrying case is very well made and designed, so it makes portability easier. But they are also great for musicians and DJs, they come with a 1/4" adapter for plugging them into amps or other audio equipment. There's also a boom mic cable and adaptor available to turn these into a gaming headset! With so many cool accessories you can get these are pretty much a do it all kind of headphone.#5 Style: Last but not least, these days we all want cool looking headphones but if that's the only reason you bought them your an idiot! If the headphones are Comfortable, Sound Good, Well Built, and Versatile, which the Crossfade LPs are, then the fact that they look good on top of all that is a huge bonus! With a lot of different colors to choose from its easy to find a pair that fit your style but the best part is how customizable they are! The Shields on the sides can be swapped out for different colors, V-Moda has a bunch to choose from and you can even have your own artwork or logo laser engraved on the shields by V-Moda to make your Headphones very unique! Something else a lot of companies don't offer!All together these headphones are an amazing bang for your buck, especially considering that they are under $150 right now and in my opinion they blow away other headphones in this price range for overall value and even ones in higher price ranges. You've probably guest that I'm referring to Beats, if your a Beats owner, do your self a favor. Flush those pieces of crap down the toilet and get a pair of LPs and if you were looking at Beats as your next pair of headphones, same thing. You'll get a great pair of headphones that are built better, sound better, more comfortable and are arguably better looking. Plus they won't break the bank! If you care about quality in both build and sound over flashy gimmicks, then the Crossfade LPs are the right headphone for you!

VSound is very nice, 4-5 stars by my non-audiophile ear. Durability solid. My main issue is discomfort from wearing them. They a bit small and don't fit all the way over the ears and thus pinch painfully after a short time. Also the band is not completely padded and hurts the top of my head. I like the sound but I'm prolly gonna give these to my pre-teen niece with a smaller noggin and buy myself a new pair.

I was hoping to use these at the office, where it can get loud sometimes (e.g. phone calls) but I guess I'll have to keep looking.I'm giving it 3 stars because it's just "Okay". If I had to choose between these or my other (regular/non-brand) earbuds, I would probably choose my earbuds.

p2893
sg5
VI love these headphones, and have had them and used them every day for the past two years. I will say though, that these headphones gave me some small issues, and now a major issue. About 4 months into owning these headphones, the right channel stopped working. At first I thought it was the cable itself. Tested it, and that wasn't it. I decided to break down these headphones to find the issue, and it turned out to be a loose aux port that was keeping the jack from fully inserting (no pun). I tightened up the two screws holding it in place, and it was good as new. My more recent problem, as well as being the worst is the headphones have began to break down. Not the aux cable, the band, or the metal wearing, but the thing that holds the ear-pads in place. A fairly medium sized chunk of silverish plastic fell off of the cup, causing the pad to be held more loosely in place, leaking, and decreased audio quality due to the extra opening making it unbalanced. I don't know how, nor where I could get it replaced, and I would rather buy the piece and fix it myself, but after looking, there are no options. at this point I don't care about the warranty, I just want them fixed because other than that one piece, they're fine. Also, Super-glue doesn't cut it for me and I don't want to damage this beauty any further, they sound too good.

p2916
sg5
VI have limited experience with headphones other than Turtle Beach x41's and these Crossfade's by V-MODA are definitely what I was looking for when I searched for the best sound quality for the price. Extremely satisfied. I can damn near see the music I'm hearing. The cord is braided fabric so it will never rip, but if it does there's a replacement in the handy carrying case. If you turn the volume up all the way fresh out the box, you'll probably damage the speaker. Ease into it because these things can thump. You can feel the bass even if they're on someone else's head. Not too heavy and pretty sleek. You don't look like a spaceman wearing these. Fresh white with protective plastic over shiny chrome. My girlfriend is pissed cause these headphones drown her out while the volume is at 16%. Its great buy these

VMust have for people who dont like BEATS or BOSE and want to save money!!!
p2922
sg5
VLiterally better than Beats and Bose. Beats is more for rap-hip hop/pop music. Bose is more for that acoustic chill vibe. These are pretty much good for gaming, rock/metal, rap, pop hip hop, country. They do require a 1-2 day break in to get the good sound. At first I didn't expect it to take that long and was like these are not worth $179 but I have had them since Jan 2015 and I love them. I use them for my MP3 player, Cell phone, Desktop computer. The bass is amazing, the sound is amazing, if you have an ear for stuff you can pick out a lot of the instruments and know what strings/chords they hit. On drums I can pick up what cymbals are being hit, snare/bass/kicker. Stuff with bass sounds amazing too. It really doesn't leak sound as bad as some people say.

p2940
sg5
VI bought these to replace an older set of Bose headphones that were beginning to wear out. The build quality is absolutely fantastic. The sound is on par with the Bose but I wouldn't say they are any better. The case and cable storage are great for travel and that's the primary reason I bought these. I have a rather large nugget and these fit very comfortably when fully extended. They are a little tight if you wear glasses but otherwise are quite comfortable. The noise isolating feature is not the same as active noise cancelling, however on the flights I've used these they were pretty good at removing most ambient noises. What's interesting is that I was still able to hear the captain and flight attendant announcements without removing the headphones or stopping my music. Not sure why, but it was nice.

VBest headphones I've bought in terms of quality/durability and sound. Still going strong after a few years of heavy usage. Every day for two years I traveled with them on in rain, shine, or snowstorm (they make wonderful earmuffs in winter). Bass is phenomenal and even the highs are pretty good. Beats a lot of them in its price range and a lifetime warranty is always an added bonus. I loved the ability to customize the decal on the ear plates. I simply uploaded a design of my own that fit the guidelines to the company website and waited a few weeks for the results to be sent to me.

p3024

VI just want to add to the 5 star ratings. They definitely need a burn in. When I got them they were bass and mid heavy and I was a little disappointed. I persevered listening to hours of different genres of music. Including my own(hip hop beats mainy). Would I use these as my only reference headphones for mixing? No, of course not. I have other headphones and studio monitors more suited for that. They are great for a second reference though. I was working on some sub bass on a track. They were wonderful for when I muted everything else and focused on that. These headphones have nice bass(clean). It must be due to the dedicated diaphragm. After the burn in the highs came out and really do sound good. I think they are more of a consumer headphone than my others but that's ok. One of the main reason I got them was for the iPhone capability. I hate driving downtown so most of the time when I'm traveling downtown I get on the train and these headphones are perfect for that. I'm all about Siri and the button on the cord wallah. "Play my music shuffled or read text message". Even though I said these are more of a consumer headphone I would still trust them as a reference headphone more than any consumer grade headphone. Don't buy beats headphones they are overpriced. Even if you want a listening headphone and you are weighing options between these or beats...get these. Just make sure you break them in before you make a judgement.

VMy first pair of "fancy" headphones were the Beats by Dre Studio. They were good, but I couldn't get past the price point. These on the other hand, are cheaper and have the same if not better quality than the Studios. I will admit the highs for the Studios seem a lot crisper, but borderline harsh at high levels. The LPs are not as crisp as the Studios, but the bass makes up the difference. I am by audiophile standards a "bass-head", so all in all these are solid for the price point. I have been using these constantly, from playing my PS4 to music on my iPhone 6+. Great pair of headphones!!!

VI'm Not One to Give 5 STARS, but.....
p3119
sg5
VI'm not one to swear either but Holy F@#king $#!t these are the truth!!! I'm still burning these in, but they are already the best headphones I've ever had. I'm not a true Audiophile but darn close. I've spent the last 5 months researching by ear Bose, Beats, Sennheiser, Bluedio, Bowers and Wilkins, plus numerous of mainstreamers. The Mids and highs were obvious immediately, not too bright but crisp. Vocals crisp. And the depth is simply amazing. The only area that may not be up to some competitors may be the bass. However, it's been my experience that this is the aspect that takes the most time. In addition, the only phones with punching bass are the ones that fall flat in all the other pitches. I leave for a cross country flight tomorrow from NYC to LAX and I can't wait enjoy these for an extended period. The next closest are the Sennheiser whether you prefer the Momentum or HD. The problem is that for anyone in a plane or train, the open backs are utterly unacceptable. That being said V-Moda still crushes them!Any doubts, just put Adele 21, which I admit is pretty mainstream, but the vocal renderings on these headphones will transport you to another plain.

VThese headphones are phenomenal. I've had them for over a year at this point. They've sounded really great ever since I opened them. The bass on the headphones is good and prominent without drowning out the mids and the highs. The mids and highs still sound really crisp and aren't overpowered by the bass. The 3D soundstage is amazing. You can really hear the different elements of a track being panned or the effects in the background if you're listening to music. If you are watching a show with them on, you can hear the characters in the background chatting as well. I don't need to have the volume really high at all. I usually don't go past 50-60% of my ipod's volume. They do a great job of drowning out outside noise. Although, I can't discern what people are saying, I can tell if someone or something is making noise (which is important for safety if you're walking around outside). Needless to say, I'm in love with the sound quality.They are really durable as well. While I haven't dropped them, I haven't noticed any wear and tear from normal use. Just be sure to remove the foam covers every once in a while to clean them since you can't unscrew the metal part under it to clean the holes. I pretty much have the headphones in their case whenever they aren't being used. The headphones are really useful and continue to work at a high quality.

VThe v moda LP and LP 2 are great sounding headphones, they sound is clear an bass smooth. I feel these have better quality sound than the Beats solo headphones. They are very comfortable an are noise canceling. As well. They do have a tiny leak of sound that can slightly be heard by others depending the volume. They are very sturdy with a metal construction on the sides an band, For headphones under $150 they are awesome. I previously had the pioneer 1000 but they broke on one side due to the plastic parts an swivel.Great job V-Moda.

VWorld's best headphones in terms of price/quality.
p3191
sg5
VLet me just start by saying that, I am an average user meaning that I do not know a lot when it comes to "sound quality terms" like "bass" and such. However, I am capable of identifying whether the sound is good or not. The V-MODA have a really outstanding sound definitely way above average over the ear headphones and a few steps behind when it comes to premium quality headphones like the ATH-M50x, with that being clear. Let me tell you why I love this product so much, three main reasons, durability, comfort and sound quality. When I started looking for some over the ear headphones all I could think of was those 3 things I just mentioned. Durability, I have to say that I have had 2 headphones over the past 5 years including the SkullCandy Mix Masters which I buy on Walmart by the way, and sure the sound was pretty good, unfortunately they only lasted about a year. Sure, you might consider this a decent run for some headphones, well... No, let me explain you why you're terribly mistaken. This headphones are really expensive. So if I buy one of this things the least I can expect and deserve is to have them for a very long time, so I never have to waste money on them AGAIN. Unfortunately the SkullCandy Mix Masters did not gave me that satisfaction, but the V-MODA man this is really some indestructible thing right here, I must clarify that I am not an intensive user, I mostly use them when I am using my laptop so it's either at home or university, however I travel frequently and this is when sh** gets real, I am very clumsy and I have accidentally dropped them from considerably high places and even sit on them, not on purpose of course (don't judge) and let me just say that they have manage to come out with out a single scratch in all of those situations. Hell, they did not even bend or anything. Moving on to comfort, this are not the most comfortable headphones I have tried. Certainly not with the original cushions, but if you buy the V-MODA XL cushions they become one of the most comfortable headphones I've ever wear so if you plan to use them for very long periods of time (anything more than half an hour) buy those cushions other wise you will regret it. In conclusion if you want headphones that sound awesome, last for a life-time look and are really comfortable look no further. Buy them now.

p3209
sg5
VI've only had these headphones for a couple weeks now, but so far, I love them. I love the hard-shell carrying case--no worries about cracking the headphones in transit. I love the wire that goes from the headphones to the headphone jack--no tangling, no knots, no annoying catches like you get with the rubber looped ones. I love the size--not too big, just right. The sound is good, too. Love seeing my logo on both ears. Love the fact that it's made from metal, not plastic--gives me more confidence that they won't break in two months like ever other headphones I've ever owned. Also love the padding on the ears--they don't seem to fall off easily like EVERY other headphones I've owned. Last but not least, the price is right--$150 for all these things I've grown to love these last two weeks of owning a pair of these.I usually don't put 5 stars, but I just wrote "love" too many times not to.We'll see what happens down the line--I'll change my rating if need be.For now, I "love" them.

VI really, really wanted to like these--they are super comfortable and look pretty cool to boot. I ended up returning them, though. I love music, but I'm not an audiophile who loves technical terms; I couldn't analyze these and tell you how they compare to other headphones in terms of bass, mids, vocals, etc. Listening to music on these, though, gave everything a kind of hollow sound. It's possible that I'm just really used to on-ear headphones and any over-ear set is going to sound weird to me, but whatever the reason, the music quality for me was far below the comfort and fit level. I sent them back the same day.

I'm a female and yet even when I adjust the headband, the foam squishes on my earrings and make my ears hurt a LOT if I'm wearing studs.Kind of a small inconvenience in the grand scheme of things though.

p3243
sg5
VThis is my second - third year owning these headphones and all I've got to say is...wow! These are MAGNIFICANT! With great quality treble and bass, these headphones deliver what it says! My only problem is that eventhough the headband is memory metal, IT DOES BEND. Now of course it's easy to bend back, but it's a pain at the same time. So the only thing I suggest is to keep both phones on at once, because having one off on one ear and one on, with cause it to bend to the left/right a little. But either than that, the sound works the same as the first day I got them! They are DEFINITLY worth the money!

VThe V-Moda Crossfade LP headphones are not what I expected! The headphones sound is a little echo-ish and the bass is okay but not as everybody advertised it to be(I did not expect it to be anyways). I expected a more clear but yet bass heavy headphones. Also, I have medium sized ears and the headphones hurt after an hour of use, they felt more like an on-ear headphone. Overall, the headphones are great but I really expected a better system out of such a reasonably priced headphone($120). I guess I will just stick to Apple headphones, which in fact sound a little better than the V-Modas...

They look sleek, low profile, and you don't feel like you are wearing monstrosities while in public.The headband is super comfortable with a thin cloth cushion which puts no excessive pressure on your head and the earpads are perfect after a day or two of break in. My only complaint is that they are difficult to wear with glasses but nothing unmanageable.V-Moda, you have earned a customer through this stellar set of headphones.Vene Vidi Vici

VGreat sound and build quality. Overall sound is loud and crisp without overwhelming bass. I also appreciate the aesthetic and toughness of the rugged metal frame. The one and only main problem I have is the comfort.They are not terribLy ergonomic and may have sacrificed that for looks. However its only an issue after wearing them for a long session (say 1hr and half or more). They are generally usable for a couple of songs and videos before they start bothering a little. But once again, a very minor problem compared to sound and build!

VAfter a few hours of burn in on the first day, the headphones have been relatively balanced with a big hump towards the bass with a high cut which makes trumpets sound a bit tinny. Anyways, the headphones are solid build quality, and it's been going 10 months strong. The cable is solid, and the case is pretty. The VMODA people are also really kind and really fast at responding as well. When I say these things are solid, I usually go through 10-12 pairs within 5-7 months because I have them on my head for quite a while.

I didn't want to just go buy beats so I did some research and tried out a whole lot of pairs of headphones. In the end I am glad I chose these. The headphones are slightly vented so if you have it turned up people are going to hear what you are listening to, but the sound quality you get for these are fantastic. Perfectly tuned bass awesome and crystal clear tones.

p3338

VThings you should know about this review:1. The last time I remember using over-ear headphones was in my dad's study in about 1982, most likely listening to the Star Wars soundtrack on eight-track.2.  I'm a little deaf in my right hear (because Harleys have their exhaust pipes on the right side).3.  I still can't believe I paid this much for headphones.4.  The "lifestyle" appeal of any headphone doesn't work on me and I'll never walk around in public wearing them.But I love these headphones!  They're sturdy.  They come in a nice protective case with little bungies and velcro for storing the two excellent audio cables provided.  The sound is great and I don't voluntarily listen to anything that has "thumping bass."  My head is fairly big (I wear a size large Shoei motorcycle helmet) and these fit perfectly.  They feel fine over my glasses.  The noise cancelling is good enough that I don't hear people talking to me from the hallway outside my office.

VThe build quality is tops and the sound is above average.  They're currently making great ear warmers for the winter.  Haha.  My only complaint would be that the don't fold in and the metal hinge tends to cut in to your collarbone, when they're rest around your neck.  Not the worst, but not great either.  I also love that I got a great deal for them.  They sound way better the poser brand Beats and only cost a fraction of the practice of anything comparable from Dr. Dre.  I'm almost tempted to get a laser etched replaceable plate  for these (you can do that) for $25 to $45.

p3457
sg5
VI got these on sale for $99 for a daughter's Xmas gift.  Bought mostly on V-Moda reputation.  After a lengthy break-in period, I'm pretty unimpressed by the sound.  Bass is overboosted and unnatural, mids have a tin-can resonance, and highs roll off too early.  Build quality is good and comfort is acceptable, although the earpiece is a bit compact, and those with larger ears may find they don't fit well.  Sound quality is far inferior to my usual in-ear Klipsch S4's.  I feel bad for anyone who paid list price ($200) for these mediocre phones.

VGreat appearance. Perfect sound. High quality. Slightly uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time.
p3479
sg5
VSound quality is excellent. Low frequencies aren't muddy and the high frequencies come through crisp without being piercing. The headphones don't completely cancel outside noises, which I am ok with.The appearance of the headphones are great and really catch the eye, and I love the case/accessories that it comes with. The input cable may even be TOO long but better than too short, and the kevlar fiber really makes it durable. These have served well on all my flights and day-to-day uses. My only complaint is that it hurts to wear these for an extended period of time (about 2 hrs). If these headphones were comfortable to wear, I would give it a 5. Perhaps it will take time for the moulding around the ears to break in and be more comfortable, but it's been about a hear and a half and it's still not quite there yet.

VThese were purchased (along with the boom mic) for my son's birthday. He was in awe of the quality and complimentary accessories.  Then, after listening to the headphones, his smile grew that much larger.  He's coming from the $20 Sony big box headphones, so these have to seem like caviar to his grape jelly.I listened to a few of my tracks with these (heavier bass Dubstep and a little Rap) and like them also.  But I can tell these will benefit greatly from a portable or desktop amp.  More power provided at lower listening levels will help these headphones out greatly.  Actually I'm charging the little Fiio up as I type this to test it out.As a final note, the replacement plastic pieces really add a little to these already fantastic headphones.  If you're on the fence, take a little leap as these are quite good.In comparison, my UE6000's do sound a little better but I assume that's due to the active noise cancellation.

VThese headphones are awesome. The build quality is top notch and they look very stylish. Love the case too! I have to warn you guys though, the sound and fit are subject of preference. First, the sound is inferior to similarly priced Bose headphones that my girlfriend owns. Secondly, the head band is tight on me. I have owned several pairs of Bose triports in my life, though, and every single pair I had broke within a year. These are built to last.

VUncomfortable on big ears; Chroma variant easily shows fingerprints
p3789
sg5
VI am no audiophile, but the Chroma Crossfade is exceptional; they are the best headphones I own and at half off, they are a steal. Because many audiophiles have already written extensive reviews, I will comment on aspects of the headphones that affect me personally, not on the aspects in comparison to other headphones.For people like myself with bigger ears or detached earlobes, these headphones will be uncomfortable for the first few weeks of use. Because these are not on-ear headphones and because I have such big ears, they compress my ears vertically. The discomfort also reflects the number of consecutive hours worn, and I must admit I have worn them for extended 10 hour+ gaming periods.Sound quality is undoubtedly the most important factor in any headphone and these achieve very high standards for noise-isolation (NOT noise cancellation; there is a difference). As a gamer, I listen to footsteps to anticipate the location of my enemies, and the shuffling I hear from 10 meters away in the game is an indication of superior noise isolation. While many reviews complain of the bass-heavy aspect of the headphones, I do not have an issue with it. I listen to a variety of music genres, but perhaps my ears are so accustomed to listening to bass-heavy music.With respect to aesthetics, these are undoubtedly bad ass looking headphones. However, I will say that the Chroma variant of the Crossfades easily shows fingerprints because of its metallic surface. That said, there is a micro fiber cloth included in the box which is useful. My general solution for preventing fingerprints is to hold the headphones by the ear cushions so your fingers will not come into contact with the metal plates.

These are perfect for my work where there's always people around talking and I need to focus. The earpads are extremely soft and luxurious. These are comfortable except when I'm wearing earrings and even then it's not that bad.  Perhaps a little expensive (but I'm a broke graduate student) and overall worth it.

p3807
sg5
VAfter 24hour break-in period, I feel that these are worth every penny. Make sure you don't wear these when your son or wife might talk to you, because you wont be able to hear them with music on 1/4 of the way...lol. I use these on my computer (video games), ipad (for movies), and PS4 (movies and games), and all sound awesome!! I have good sound bars for the computer and the PS4 and I really prefer these headphones. In fact I will no-longer use the sound bars now unless I have to share. lol  These were not comfortable within the first 24 hours, but now it just fits perfect and I can easily wear these for hours. These were a very solid buy and would highly recommend them over the Beats headphones (returned a pair after x-mas, as I thought the sound quality compared to these were not up to par)

VV-Moda is Quality.  Worth the purchase!
p3836
sg5
VThese headphones are great.  I spent a lot of time debating between these and Audiotechnica M50's.  I watched a lot of reviews via Youtube and when the holiday sales started posting I picked these up.  I tested out the M50's and loved the deep base they provided but wasn't completely sold on the style of headphones.  The V-Moda Crossfade LPs are exactly what I was looking for.  Durable, Quality build and slightly lower profile than the M50's.  Over ear pads was a must.  The stock pads that come with these will work but HIGHLY recommend picking up the XL pads.  With those added this set does not fatigue the ears, head or neck.  I will be adding a Modmic 4.0 to these to make for a really nice gaming headset.I did a 60hr burn in with music ranging from '60s folk rock to present Hiphop and Dubstep.  I like a little punch but no too much.  These headphones try to give an even curve across Highs, Mids and Lows but they are really deep on the Bass.  After the burn in the mids and highs actually came in crisper.  I would also recommend coupling this with a DAC to really make those mids and highs pop.  I plan on grabbing a pair of the XS version in the near future for traveling purposes.

The color of the headphones was not what I ordered, but I couldn't care less. They are beautiful and a joy to use. They are being used to listen to DVDS on my Mac while my husband watches football on TV sitting next to me. Love my V-MODA!!

VI don't do a lot of reviews unless something is awful or excellent. That said, I bought these for my 12yr old son that has just began to love music. I bought him some cheap on ear Skull Candies that I must say lasted for 3yrs until late. He's shown me h es responsible enough to take care of things now so I went with the V-MODA Crossfade LP bc of all the many stellar reviews. I'm an audiophile myself and I will admit I was blown away by the quality of build, comfort, light weight, durability of them. No the sound.... Wow... I'm not easy to impress as I have some much higher end sets and these ran a close second to a few of mine.  Bass, treble, mids and clarity are phenomenal! I'm going to buy my self a pair of the higher end bc I if these sound that good I can't wait to hear those... SOLID BUY- WILL NOT DISAPPOINT! 5 stars all across the board! Buy a pair and you'll see!

Batteries is not needed to cancel the outside noise.One of my complaints is that I cant wrap the head phones around my neck. I have a big head so and its too bulky to be carrying it around. So, I just have it on around my head not over ears when I'm walking around NYC.And at $150 and the warranty I'd pick V-moda over BEATs everytime.

The sides do smudge up, these come with a very nice audio jack you can pause and raise and lower the volume, and one is a plain backup still nice though. The case is awesome protects very well. I did a lot of research on headphones I decided on these I'm not one bit disappointed. Bottom line do yourself a favor and get these they are superior to beats and Bose, not to mention they are a lot cheaper.

VI bought these as a bday gift for my brother who is loving them. He said they sound great for music and hooked up to his ps4. Suroundsound works great. He said he's glad he didn't blow 200$ on a pair of beats.I just had to say that after playing some ps4 at my bros place with these on I want a pair of my own! I don't know what these things are doing but I've never heard headphones sound so rediculously good! I can't even describe it but the way the bass and suroundsound works make these worth every penny I spent on them. I hope they go back on sale so I can get myself a pair.

VSound quality is amazing. Crystal clear audio. Bass is sharp and on point! I was extremely surprised by a brand I have never heard of before. These are better than Beats or those HD Sony headphones.The box it came in was flawless and it had a secure ribbon that needed to be cut in order to take the headphone case out. The headphone case was sturdy and did a good job of protecting the headphones  inside. It came with all the cords too.

VMediocre Audio at Best - Buy Philips Fidelio's instead
p4006
sg5
VEdit:12-19-2014The first review was written after casually listening to some music on three headphones,1. V-Moda Crossfade LP,2. Philips Fidelio L13. Philips Fidelio M1Now, comparison to the L1 might be a little unfair - it's a semi-open design, and not as portable. But comparison to the M1's is justified. On first listen, I found the Fidelio's much "better" - I'll explain how.Setup: Audio - FLAC ripped with EAC from Original CD's. For a couple of use cases, I used1. My HTC One (M7) - no amp2. My MacBook Pro - again no amp.I do have a Schiit stack I could have used, and intended to, but then it wasn't required to settle the argument. I did burn these headphones in for 10-20 hours. There were claims by some that after 600+ hours of burn-in, it sounds better. I don't quite buy that - I shouldn't have to burn in a headphone for 600 hours, for it to sound good. (Your return period will likely run out ;) )I picked a few tracks, which in my opinion, have a wide array of bass, mids and highs. The Fidelio's are considered Bass heavy mind you. (including the X1, which I do not own. I'll probably pick an X2 up soon.)1. Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms2. Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing3. Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here4. Pink Floyd - Shine on You Crazy Diamond5. Led Zeppelin - Babe I'm Gonna Leave You6. Led Zeppelin - Fool In The Rain7. Led Zeppelin - Going To California8. Led Zeppelin - When The Levee Breaks9. Prince - Purple Rain.A note about my music choice. Yes, I do like Rock, and Classic Rock more specifically, but I listen to a wide array of music. I do listen to Pop and R&B.; I also listen to more classical music, and since I am from India, there is a whole lot of music from back there I consume as well. (A R Rahman, anyone ?)A note on how much of an "audiophile" I am - I do not consider myself an audiophile, but I did take time and trouble to complete Philips' Golden Ears Challenge - if you haven't heard of it, you should check it out - it is neat, and will widen your perspective on music listening.I'll not have to bore you with the details. I just had to listen to the first song from the list critically on all thee headphones twice to tell where this stood with respect to the other two. Here's my verdict.The Fidelio L1 blows this out of the water withi. it's wider soundstageii. it's got better mid's and high's - definitely much clearer. There were certain sounds that I did not even hear on the V-moda's because the Bass was overpowering.iii. The Bass is much tighter in the Fidelio L1 and the M1. (The L1 is superior to the M1 imho). MK's voice sounded really muffled on this headphone compared to the other two.In case you want to put it to test yourself, these are the things you should listen for,* The sound of drum strikes - it should have a crispness to it, and should not sound blunt and muddied.* The sound of cymbals should again be sharp and crisp.* The vocals are pretty much a give-away if you have listened to a song previously - it is obvious that something is wrong with the way the signer is sounding.In terms of volume, this was the loudest, followed by the M1 and then the L1. The MBP was enough to easily power all three to loud enough volumes where it was uncomfortable - so I didn't test it out on my Schiit Magni + Modi. On the HTC One M7, the L1 could have used a little more juice. It was loud enough mind you - just not enough to blow your eardrums.############Initial Review:############Audio Can be betterSound:I compared this to the Philips Fidelio M1 and the Philips Fidelio L1, and both the fidelio's seemed to sound better to my ears than these headphones.Fit:Fit wise, these are better than the Fidelio M1's. The M1's are over-ear and clamp like crazy!! at least for me. The L1's are equally well fitting.Appearance:I am not a flashy guy, and like a muted appearance. I like the Fidelio's better than this, but this isn't bad by any stretch of imagination.Cable:The cables are sucky compared to the fine-braided Fidelio cables. (Although I've heard a lot of X1 owners swapped theirs out for these)Case:This is one area where these headphones win it hands down!! The case is simply amazing. It is at least a $20 value that needs to be factored in. Philips, take notice and give us good cases.I'll try getting to a more detailed review once I compare it with a few favorite tracks of mine.######Verdict:######If you want a Bass heavy headphone that is very comfortable, looks stylish (which I don't care much for), has good construction and comes with a good travel case, go for these.If you want balanced sound, and have a wide genre of music in your collection, look elsewhere. The Fidelio L1 is a great starting point in my opinion. The Fidelio M1 is also good, but not as good as the L1. There are other equally awesome headphones - AKG has a couple which are considered more neutral than the Fidelio's. There's the Audio Technica M50's and M50x's, which are considered among the best in this price range. There's also Grado (although open back), Shure, Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic all of which have better offerings in terms of sound. (definitely they also have headphones which are worse than the V-Moda crossfade Lp's.)Take Amazon reviews with a pinch of salt. These probably sound "neutral" compared to some Beats headphones out there, but are definitely not neutral. Also, do read innerfidelity.com for their detailed reviews on phones.

p4018
sg5
VI needed a comfortable and nice looking pair of headphone to help me be productive in a lively (read: noisy) coworking environment.  This pair of V-Moda headphone delivers.  To begin with, its make shows meticulous attention to detail: the genuine leather, solid stainless steel components, and memory foam come together into a compact, sturdy and futuristic whole.  The cables that come with the headphone are made of some type of thick, weaved fiber as opposed to flimsy plastic, and are reinforced on both ends where the gold-plated connectors are.  Sound quality is good enough for my purpose -- online streaming music is so compressed that high end headphones (as in $300+) wouldn't worth it anyway.Love it!

VThese headphones are worth every single penny!! Received them a week ago and haven't taken them off. I've used lots of high grade hearphones prior to these and let me just say these are the best quality I have encountered! Very crisp, deep bass with perfect mids and treble. Use them mainly for electronic dance music and they work fantastic. Would recommend these headphones to everybody especially for their price!

VGreat Sound, Two Cords and Just the Right Amount of Noise-Cancelling
p4083
sg5
VI use these everyday when working out, sometimes when I work in the yard, and sometime when out shopping. They block most noise, even with something loud like a lawnmower, but they're not so noise-canceling that I can't hear noises around me at all. They're extremely comfortable, have incredibly sound quality, and are very comfortable even aftera wearing for extended periods of time. I always get lots of compliments about how cool they look as well.Pros:- comfortable design- comes with two cords should one break (one with and one without the mic)- great sound quality- they look great- durable so far after 1 & a half years of daily use

p4089
sg5
VI waited a year to write this review. Why? My three teenagers are murder on headphones. My oldest son particularly likes glamorous headphones, Beats, Skullcandy, they all died an early, painful, and yes, untimely death. So I researched. I read the reviews. Durable? Military grade? Kevlar cords. Okay, I'm skeptical, but hooked by the promise of replacement at 50% cost. The $175 skulls--couldn't even get a replacement cord--after numerous contacts with the manufacturer. You're one car door slam away from having a pair of slightly sexy, headphone-shaped paperweights. So what's the verdict? One year--three pairs of headphones--fully intact. Kids love them! So I'm buying another pair for the boys with the extra gamer mic. It's to replace the gamer headphones I bought last year that are currently duct-taped together. My youngest looks slightly mad with the headphones askew as he exhorts his fellow-players to kill whatever the heck it is they are after today. They all love them, but he was at first skeptical--no famous rappers hawking them or something. But then he heard the sound, and he liked it. Said it was better than the beats. They look great, and they're comfortable. But for me the biggest success is that I have finally bought headphones that lasted longer than 6 months. All the techies can argue the specs--but for me it boils down to duct-tape, or lack thereof.

VFantastic product for tiny heads
p4124
sg5
VDon't get me wrong it's an amazing product, as long as you have a tiny head. The head band barely allowed the ear cups to reach my ears and the pads are on the small side. They felt more like they were going for a size in between on ear and over ear. I loved the rest of the product, really high build quality and the sound was great. I just ended up going with the Bose Soundtrue over ear headphones instead since those are the only ones I can find that fit me comfortably. I don't understand why more manufacturers don't angle the inside of the ear cups so that your ears don't get crushed. These sound, look, and are constructed better than the Bose Soundtrue but a pair of headphones are worthless if you can't actually wear them. If these were larger I would give a 5 star rating.

I knew these headphones weren't made in China. I am so very pleased with them not only because music sounds great but also because background noise is blocked out. My main reason for buying these was to block noise from living in a noisy apartment.  I highly rrecommend these headphones. They are a jewel for the price!

p4142

VGo ahead skim through my review i know its poorly writtenHaving bought these over 4 years ago (yes 4 years its been that long) they still are my favorite headphones of all time. that being said i am sure that the m-100 (i believe thats the name) are are better but when you take into account that they are 3 times as much at the current price these are definitely the best option. They are undoubtedly the most durable headphones i have ever owned seen or even heard of. they have gone to hell and back and still sound absolutely wonderful. that being said the 3 button cord that came with it broke after about 2 years of VERY abusive use and i find myself using the also included buttonless 6 foot cord which is also of amazing quality.These headphones sacrifice nothing, looks, style, sound, durability, and quality and for the price (250$ at the time i bought them) i could not have underestimated the headphones anymore than i did.These headphones can easily be driven by my iphone and ipod and sound outstanding when connected to a quality headphone amplifier and DAC.^If you dont understand the above sentence dont feel like these headphones are too audiophile for you (if that is even a thing). they also serve great to the general everyday music listener that doesnt know what a DAC is or even what a headphone amplifier is they are stylish, absolutely heavenly sounding and affordable (without sacrificing any quality)When i purchased it included a case (discrete skeletal case that protects the headphones very well and has a loop for the included carabiner) a half inch jack converter (best quality gold plated one i have ever seen might i add) 2 cables both weaven sleek and wonderfully tangle free the headphones (duh) and a cleaning cloth. and also some papers and a card for registering them for their immortal life warranty (a warranty where for life they will replace them for half the price of buying new ones no matter how damaged they are) and a year warranty for i dont know whatThe sound: just as described above "heavenly". you really feel like the music is all around you. if you have ever had the experience of going from cheapheadphones to good headphones and noticed instruments never heard before in music i can almost guarantee you will hear even more with thesethe style: like the sound and durability of these headphones i cannot say enough good things i have gotten countless complements when wearing these in public with people constantly asking what kind of headphones they are and where i got them from. Like the title says they are the rolls royce of headphones... with a little more sexyOH OH AND YOU CAN BUT CUSTOMIZED SIDE PLATES FOR A GREAT PRICE FROM THEIR WEBSITE, LAZER ENGRAVED DESIGNSdurability: just go on the v-moda website they tell you the stats of how many times these can be dropped, flat bended (band put completely flat), cord bended etc. and just let me say mine have gone through more and are completely fine (with the exeption of the one cable but i believe that has gotten at least the predicted amount of bends if not more.Over all: Ask anyone these are the best for the price and beat any competitors bose, scullcandy, beats and more. though they (with the exception of beats)  make great headphones non can compare when it comes to quality and price.The only thing i plan on buying to improve these headphones is new ear cushions for the ones that came with have become a little worn down and i think the ones on their website and on amazon will provide a great replacement. you shouldnt have any problem with ear cushion quality for at least 3 or 4 years though so dont worry

VV-MODA Crossfade vs. Beats Studio 2.0
p4159
sg5
VThis is a comparison review between the V-MODA Crossfade headphones and Beats Studio 2.0 headphones. First the pros and cons of the V-MODA Crossfades:Pros:-Comes in an excellent case with room for cords-Sturdy construction-Does not need to be charged-Customizable plates-Cords are built to last-Options for mic-ComfortableCons:-Quieter than Beats - though I was not able to hear the TV or people talking with them on still-Music bleeds through (by this I mean other people can hear the music I'm listening to)-Bass can become muddy with some genres, will drown out vocals a bit - this was most noticeable when I listened to Apocalyptica, the cellos didn't have much definition.I know a lot of people say that the Beats headphones are overpriced, which I still kind of agree with, but I really do feel like I heard the difference between a $200 pair of headphones and a $300 pair. The beats came out on top as far as sound quality. However I question the durability of the Beats after seeing these headphones, can't express enough how nicely the Crossfade are built, along with the cords. I also HATE having to charge my Beats headphones, the Crossfade requires no charging.We bought these headphones for a teenage boy who listens to rock music. I think he will be very happy with them and be a huge improvement over his current pair of headphones. We did consider for a moment giving him my Beats (since I hate the need to charge them), but after listening to both pairs I opted to keep the Beats for myself. I listen to death metal and other genres that require a higher level of clarity and that was the deciding factor.In the end, we are satisfied with our purchase.

VI've had these headphones for almost a month now and I have to say they are absolutely amazing. After burning them in for about 24 hours of playing time they sound amazing. They are great for hip hop and EDM (which is mainly what I listen to). The bass is very good on these, but it doesn't drown out the mids and highs. I also love how they are fairly low profile, I use them when I lift at the gym all the time! They are build like an absolute tank and feel super solid. The Nero ones look so cool! All around these are amazing headphones and I would recommend to everyone.

VExcellent sound quality
p4195
sg5
VI find the isolation to be very good.  Excellent sound quality, like everyone already knows.  The only brand I can compare them to are my 3 pairs of KOSS Porta-Pro, and they sound quite a bit better again, of course... Loved my KOSS, except for the cheap cabling, that's why I have 3 pairs; 2 regular pairs and one with the in-line mic.  Each lasted about a year before the wires were done.  V-Moda's kevlar cables feel very nice, very well made, and I expect them to last for years.  Detachable cables are a great idea, and all headphones should have them and use braided cables, no excuses.Update after 5 days:  I truly can hear details in music that I haven't noticed before.  The ear pads are really nice.  I've noticed during periods of quieter sound, when I'm moving my head around, or making any motion that affects the joints in the headset, I can hear it creaking, moving, flexing.  It's not anything that would prevent my buying these, but it's something I didn't expect, and I can't recall ever hearing a headset creak which might be why it's standing out now.  It sort of reminds me of how a stethoscope sounds to itself.  /ShrugAnyway, I really like these.  They're easily the best-sounding headphones that I've ever had on my head.ps:  they're warm.

VThe base is not that great like everyone says
p4201
sg5
Vi don't know what all the hype about these headphones are. I feel mislead. The base is not that great like everyone says. the sound quality is basic. These headphones really hurt and give you a headache when you wear them for long periods of time, like an hour.I have beats audio manager installed on my laptop and its sounds great when I use the beats audio manager with them. the base then sounds goo.But alone, these are headphones are disappointing. The only reason I kept them is because they sound nice with the beats audio enhancer.They are well-made though. I like that there is a removable braided cable and it comes with two cords. nice packaging and I like the headphone case. Built to last.The thing I hate most about these headphones is how much the sound leaks. I cant even turn my volume up half way without it sounding like my speakers are on and everyone hears what Im listening to. Super annoying! I like to listen to loud music but I can't without people complaining that they think my headphones are not plugged in!

p4207
sg5
VAfter reading the reviews I might have been expecting a little too much with these cans.  My go to headphones for years have been Sennheiser HD580's that I have loved and have this great airy quality about them but I needed some closed back cans for traveling and at first sight of these "noise isolation" headphones I thought they were actively noise isolating but then read closer that they are just closed and don't really offer anything special in the way of keeping out noise but I knew that before buying them.I bought these on black friday for $99 from microsofts online store and that was an amazing price and I bought a pair of plantronics backbeat pro bluetooth and noise canceling headphones.  I decided that sound quality was more important than bluetooth or active canceling but that I would compare both side to side.Wasn't even close really, listening to Frank Ocean's Swim Good on the v-moda I was welcomed to beautiful base but muddy vocals and highs where the plantronics had a more natural base hit and nice highs that were just right.  Next song was Jeff Buckley Be Your Husband (live).  This song is a live recording in a coffee bar that was done professionally so it has this great sense of place and really is all about the vocals.  The v-moda did better here than with the r&b; music and had a little better soundstage than the plantronics but still didn't get that sense of live music and airy vocals that I get with the plantronics and sennheisers.These were just "okay" to me and not worth the money really.  They are going back tomorrow.

VExcellent clarity, deep bass and sturdy design make these a great addition to my phone.  The case is also sturdy and has survived being in my cramped carry on bag through multiple countries.  They cup around your ears blocking out noise much better than any other headphones I have tried.  I had some klipsch headphones and really liked them, but one of my kids messed up the cord.  With the V-Moda, the cord is extremely tough and can unplug from the headphones itself (excellent idea).  If you don't mind spending the money, I think you'll be more than happy with these.

However, after 3 days, I discovered that I WORE IT WRONG! YOU MUST CHANGE THE LENGTH OF 2 SIDES FROM YOUR HEAD TO YOUR EAR! Sound quality is really good, crystal clear, bass is strong, low, mid, and high are perfect. Solid build. 100% Recommend. (Sorry for any grammar mistake. English is not my first language)

VThis was a great buy. Sound is great. If you can get it on sale, do it.  The quality is on par w/ beats imo, while having unique sounds for bass/highs. I use it for gaming a bit too, which is bad because a lot of sounds are EXTREMELY loud. You ever tried being quiet when you hear a sion ult from across the map and then everyone's pinging? Goodbye eardrums. I beat these up a lot and that's exactly why I bought them. I wanted a durable muffs and i got them. If they break before a year, i'll complain. Until then, it's smooth listening.

VGood headphones - defective cable
p4307
sg5
VI'm reviewing these as a non-audiophile (I'm not able to delve into subtle qualities of the sound).  These headphones end up averaging three stars, but their score varies widely in specific categories.  Fortunately, one of the categories they scorely highly in is the sound.  They have good sound, that I would characterize as detailed, but mellow (not overly "bright").  They sound like hundred-dollar-plus headphones.  Now, on the other hand, one of the two cables (the one without the built in iphone controls) is defective, and doesn't deliver all of the sound unless it is bent in just the right way, and held there. I don't want to return the headphones just for the dumb cable, and I definitely don't want to wait for a replacement, so I bought a third party replacement cable.Other ups and downs include the build quality.  On one hand, they feel heavy and solid, and seem to be made of good materials.  On the other hand, I can see that the chroming process didn't seem to fully take on the edge of one of the metal pieces.  Continuing the inconsistent nature of these headphones, the design has its ups and downs as well. From a distance they look like KISS was asked to design a bike for Harley-Davidson, and then was asked to design headphones to match, but up close, the more subtle design elements become apparent, and are nice looking.Bottom line is, if you like the look and price of these headphones, you probably will be happy -- just order a spare 3.5mm cable at the same time.

p4319

VLove the sound of these headphones. Being an active person I routinely use these headphones whenever I exercise. After approximately one year, I noticed the left channel beginning to rust underneath the earpad. Upon removing the earpad, I observed the metal screen with a significant amount of rust and corrosion. This issue may have been attributed to perspiration and moisture that normally occurs during exercise. Although the sound quality did not suffer, I immediately made contact with V-Moda customer service and arranged to send the headphones to them. V-Moda replaced the left channel free of charge and mailed my headphones back in a approximately two weeks. Everything was good until I recently experienced the same left channel malfunctioning with intermittent audio output. Not sure what to do next. The headphones are obviously out of warranty, but I really enjoyed them when they worked properly. I have even considered purchasing a new pair of Crossfade LP's. I normally scratch a product off of my list after experiencing quality control issues. At a crossroads....

p4371
sg5
VHad them for over 11 months now and they are incredible.Sound:When I got them, I did a few weeks straight of burn in time on these and it really made these shine.  I use them everyday for many genres of music (through computer & iPod/ I don't personally think an amp is needed with these), for gaming, movies, and even for audiobooks; the LPs sound great in all of these applications.  They are bass heavy I suppose, but who doesn't like some extra bass...  I think the over all sound clarity is good.Comfort:These were slightly uncomfortable for the first couple weeks, but once worn in a bit they became very comfortable.Durability:Basically tanks.  I think I could run over these with my bike a dozen times and hardly scratch them.  I have stepped on them, sat on them, dropped them, and no damage from anything.  If somehow they are destroyed, they have the unreal 50% off immortal warranty.Design:Look great, everyone loves them.  Why get beats?!  These are so much better on every level.Packaging:Premium packaging, The case included is also very solid; I use it weekly.Overall, I love these headphones and would highly recommend them.  I picked them up for 75$ the week after black friday last year, however I would pay more than that for this quality product.  I'm thinking about getting the V-moda crossfade m-100 this year because of my excellent experience with the LPs.  Apparently, the m-100s are even better; I can't wait to try a pair.

VI love my V-Moda Crossfade LP headphones! They look great and I have customized shields with my logo. This is exactly what a boutique headphone company should be. I love that all parts of my headphones are replaceable and interchangeable. As a musician, I have a lot of old, expensive, worn out headphones laying around. Worn out ear cushions, yanked or broken cords, I don\u2019t have to worry about that with my crossfade LP\u2019s. These headphones have been tuned to allow loud listening levels. The pain frequencies are noticeably gone. These are not studio monitoring headphones, (although I occassionally use them in the studio) but I would definitely recommend these for any DJ and live performance or just everyday listening. They\u2019re lightweight and they feel great on your head. I can wear them very comfortably for hours.

VI really like these headphones, like others have said they need to be broken in.  The reason for the 1star rating is the phone mic doesnt work at all.  I dont know if my cord is defective or what the problem is but I headphones are worthless to me if I cant use them with my phone.  Will be returning them unless I can find a way to replace the cord.

VWorthwhile upgrade from any low-end pair of headphones.
p4484
sg5
VI upgraded from some $25 pair of Sony headphones, out of frustration of comfort. First thing I must say is that these are really comfortable. The first thing I realize when I put these on is how comfortable they are, then the sound.Having the case to carry around in my backpack as I go to school is really nice. It feels quite sturdy and makes me feel comfortable bringing them around. Along side the detachable cable, I don't have to worry about it getting jumbled up into my laptop charger cable.The noise-cancellation fits my situation very well. I work while listening to music, and needing to hear someone call you is mandatory. These cut out most noises and makes it easy to concentrate, but then provides enough outside noise to hear what is going on.Finally, the sound is wonderful. It isn't the best I've heard, but it goes well beyond the cheap pair I had before. The bass is loud and crisp. The mid's are just as warm, and the high's aren't distorted like my Sony pair. I almost forgot how great having a good pair of headphones was. Being able to pick out quiet sounds out of the louder ongoing sounds has greatly improved my listening experience.I would easily recommend this to anybody wanting to get out of the low-end and into the entry-level or is looking for a replacement for a low-level or mid-range.

p4526
sg5
VPrice really affects this review.  I mean, we got these things for like $60, and the sound quality is pretty decent for that price.  I find the bass to be a little weak, but the mids are really clear which makes them better for listening to spoken word than something where you really want to hear the bass kick.  I also find the sound a little unbalanced.  It's definitely stronger on one side than the other, which kind of ruins that deeply immersive sensation you want from over-the-ear headphones.  Just got them, so I'll reserve final judgment for a while.

VGreat audio quality, great fit and finish, looks great, sounds great... but smallish for my head size. Granted, my hat size is on the big side, but these fit like a vice grip when I got them. I finally took the recourse of bending the metal supports to get a reasonable amount of tension. Also, even at full extension, they're a tad short for a proper fit in that regard. I'm not sure what my hat size is but I think it's 7 3/4 or 7 7/8, so if you're anything at or above that size be careful.

VI love these headphones, let me tell you why!I'm not an audiophile by any means, But that doesn't mean I don't like quality sound from my headset. Here's to what I listen to:MetalMetal coreDeath metalRapR&B;Hip hopElectroHouseEDMBased on my favorite genres of music, I love bass as well as being able to hear the vocalist. These headphones do a good job of separating the highs, mids and lows. The "Crossfade LP" headset is a definite upgrade from what I'm used to (skull candy: ink'ed). A reason why I liked the skull candy "in ear" headphones was for the bass they provide. They did a good job for the price ($25). But, I really wanted to get the most out of my music. Though at a glance, spending anything over $30 on headphones sounds like a waste of money. But I'm here to tell you, you get what you pay for!The build quality on these are amazing! They are truly built like a tank. Never have I felt headphones built like this, never. I've had a pair of "turtle beach" headphones, they were amazing, but.... They were almost $300!!! To top it off, not even one month of owning them, they broke... I was looking to get a pair of "beats" by Dre, so I borrowed a pair from a friend, at $300 starting price, they didn't even meet my expectations(sound quality, build quality). I truly believe these headphones hit the sweet spot, price to quality wise, as well as sound.To top it off, "V-Moda" has a program called "Immortal Life program" that at in any moment if your headset should break or malfunction, you can easily send them in and get a replacement at 50% off the sale price! A definite five out of five stars!!!Going to buy two more as gifts for Christmas gifts.

VRecent Purchase, I made during this week, I must say the audio on these cans are great, bass is very strong, just be warned the bass blew my ears off and did not expect the bass to be so strong but damn these cans are loud as well. The sound leakage gets out of hand when your music is full blast people around you might find you as a disturbance if your volume is all the way up. The Build quality is hands down amazing, great structure and comfortable earphones for a long period of time, i have used these headphones daily, and i have to say its does block out noise, but not conversation on the person next to you, it isolates noise around you.And the great part about these cans are 50% immortal life, which will make you V-moda for life because of their great customer service. Their customer service is excellent, so helpful and the response time is quick. wire is made of kelvar  so don't be worried about your wire ripping because this wire is the strongest wire I have seen in my purchases of headphones. Con is if you crank the volume 65% you will get sound leakage, its not a bad thing but its bad for the people surrounding you. Overall i'm a very pleased with my purchase, it comes with two wires, one with 3 buttons and a plain wire just to plug into your headphones. The Case is also durable, and the box you get with these headphones are fancy. I did research on my purchase prior to this  purchase, i have found out V-moda has excellent customer service and this has justify my purchase. =)

p4591
sg5
VFor the price, these are excellent headphones.  I searched and searched for some noise-canceling headphones at a great price.  If I'm wearing these, listening to music or playing a game, and someone tries to talk to me, I can't hear them unless they yell.  So you're paying the non-noise-cancelling price for headphones that pretty much cancel out noise.  The audio cable feels very well made and solid.  It even detaches from the headphones through simple plug.  If ever I needed to replace the cable (and I don't imagine I will need to), this would make it very easy.  They are comfortable and I don't feel like my ears are squished inside.  Bottom line, if you're looking for headphones that feel like super high quality without the high quality price tag, these are for you.

While the headphones themselves look fine, the box looks like its been kicked around the block, front snap closure on the box is ripped off, a big tear down the side of the box plus other dings and holes.  I feel disappointed that the box that my friend will open looks so shoddy. I know he will love the headphones, I just wish the V-Moda box looked better, I feel like I am giving him a used pair of headphones that I got at a second-hand store.

VI have bought thousands of products on Amazon and never written a review until now.  I had to speak up about this, theseheadphones have so many bad features it is hard to list them all.  First, and most important, the sound quality at low-decibelrange is worse than fuzzy. And you pay a lot for it.  The earphone brackets are sharp metal and if they do not scrape youat some point they will fray the very cords that they support.  They are needlessly heavy. And before I Frisbee these thingsinto the dumpster and start looking for something better, in summary I would say that these are slickly marketed, fashionappealing, and quite useless.

VI'm in love. I was looking for a good pair of over-the-ear headphones with a mic and decided on these after reading several reviews for several different pairs. I'm impressed. I've been using them for only a couple days but so far I can say that they are extremely comfortable, sound quality is great, and the mic seems to work as it should. If you're looking for a pair of over-the-ear headphones that are solid quality but not hundreds of dollars, I highly recommend these to you.

VGlad I gave these headphones a chance
p4744
sg5
VWhat you'll often read in reviews for these headphones is that they sound great for dance, dubstep, and electronic music, but listeners of other genres such as jazz, classical, new age and such will find these phones disappointing.  Most of what I listen to falls within these "other genres" and I was disappointed, but I'm glad I gave these headphones a chance because they've turned out to be better than I originally thought.  And I'm not talking about the headphones magically getting better after some kind of "breaking-in" procedure.What I've found out about my LPs is what matters most isn't the type of music I'm listening to, but what I'm using to drive the headphones.  A common complaint you'll hear about this product is that the bass is overly dominant to the point where it intrudes on and overpowers the midrange, making that portion of the audio sound dull and recessed.  When I listen to music on my computer I believe that's exactly what's happening.  Like other vModa headphones the Crossfade LPs have an impedance of 32ohms, making them ideal for mobile devices.  My computer, I suspect, is driving the Crossfades with a bit more power than is needed, causing the bass to lose definition and dominate the presentation.Due to my initial disappointment my headphones have been relegated to serve as my gaming headset for the past year.  But my old Sony MDR-V600s which I use at work are a bit long in the tooth and have developed cracks in the left and right hinges, so I brought my crossfades in to work.  What's different about work is that I listen to music from my iPod rather than music stored on my workstation.  I wasn't expecting a different experience, but that's what I got.Night and day difference!Listening through my computer, half of my music library plays rather poorly.  When listening to my iPod, most of my music plays as well as if not better than through my old Sony's.  The bass is no longer dull and poorly controlled, but much tighter and punchier.  The mids are present, and the treble sparkles.  There is a small handful of tracks that struggle even on the iPod, but nothing to prevent the Crossfade LPs from becoming my new daily drivers for work.  For that its worth, I get equally pleasing results when listening to my Nexus 5 smartphone.All that said, merely saying they sound great isn't that helpful without some frame of reference.  So here's a little random before and after sampling, followed by lists of artists that seem to play very well with the iPod/Crossfade LP combo:Amethystium - EtherealCOMPUTER: The LP's present it in a wide sound stage, but some of the detail is a bit muddied, the piano is a bit soft  and the radio chatter at the end is significantly recessed.IPOD: Nice precussion punch.  Bass signature just a tad heavy overall, but plenty of detail, and the astronauts are right back where they were with my Sonys.Ganga Giri (CDs: Tribe Vibe, Manic Organic)COMPUTER: All I can say is Bass overload.IPOD: OMG, Dat Bass!!! Except now it's a bit tighter and restrained.  Almost too much but... wow!  Mids are slightly laid back from what I'm used to on my Sonys, but if I wasn't listening for differences I might not have noticed.Galbatron - Dragon DanceCOMPUTER:Too. Much. Bass.  This piece features some nice taiko work, but with LP's I wasn't so much listening to the drums as having my head inside of them.IPOD: Much better.  The drums are strong and tight, and I feel more like I'm taking in the performance instead of being part of it.Boston - More than a feelingCOMPUTER: Rendered with the sound stage of a concert hall, but the vocals were decidedly recessed.IPOD: Vocals have been brought forward quite a bit, though still back a bit from the instrumental work.Steely Dan - Do It AgainCOMPUTER: The music was great but with over emphasized bass, and lead vocalist sounded like he was in the next room singing into a pillow.IPOD: Oh, there you are Mr. Fagen, so good of you to join us!  Vocals and instruments are on the same stage, and all sound crisp.Clannad - Sunset DreamsCOMPUTER: No so good - Sounds like the bans is playing in a big concert hall, with Máire singing sowhere way in the back.IPOD: The iPod/Crossfade team rescued one of my favorite Clannad tracks.  The lead singer and the instruments are on the same stage and sounding crisp and clear.And here's my `good' list - a random sample of artists in my music library who's work ranges from really good to great on the LP and iPod combo:Acoustic AlchemyPat MetheneyAmethystiumCheckfieldClannadEnyaJean Luc PontyMannheim SteamrollerNightnoiseAndreas VoillenweiderLanz and SpeerLindsey StirlingTwelve Girls BandGanga GiriMediaeval BaebesThe Beach BoysBostonSteely DanSimon and GarfunkelHanz Zimmer (At Worlds End Soundtrack)Klaus Badelt (Pirates Soundtrack)303-ReactorDead Can DanceGalbatront r a n c e [] c o n t r o lUrchinZero One1812th overture (OMG Those cannons punch!)Hungarian Rhapsody #2 in C Sharp Minor (Berliner Philharmoniker)The Planets (Holst, Loren Maazel + Orchestre National De France)So what about those exceptions I was talking about earlier?  The headphones struggle with closely miked strings (of the plucked, strummed or tapped variety).  The artists below feature some Harp and Guitar work that the crossfades struggle with, even on the iPod.RosewyndeShadowfax (first album)That's not to say that all harps and guitars will be problematic - far from it, actually.  Note that my `good' list mentions Andreas Vollenweider, and Nightnoise (also mentioned above) features a good amount of guitars which get along just fine with the crossfades.  There are bound to be some tracks that won't get along with the Crossfade LP's V-shaped response curve.  But when hooked up to a good source it seems just about any genre will shine with these cans.

VAwsome headphones for chatting PS4 and for work!!!
p4750
sg5
VI love these headphones! I bought these during a sale last year in December (2013). I was looking for headphones to use for just about everything, from my Samsung S4 to using with chat on the PS4. Now when I was buying headphones, I was buying the cheap, but comfortable to use. I bought Maxell and Sony Street design headphones. The Sonys always get destroyed after about 8 months of use, but that is what you get when you purchase headphones below $25.When I was in the market for some really good headphones, I wanted really good well rounded headphones, for my many electronics. I bought these when they were on sale for about $70. Normally these go for about $200, but at the time I was not going to spend the $200 for headphones, when these came down in price I jumped on the opportunity. I used this for about everything. I would prefer to have sound that is purest to the sound, instead of having bass added to these headphones, but you cannot have everything. However, not being a sound aficionado I believe the sound that came from these was more the sufficient for I need them for.What I use these headphones for:- I use them for work and listen to youtube playlists. (Hence, if you are using these for this purpose, probably having the purest sound will not do much if you went with more expensive headphones.)- I use these with chat on Skype, on my Alienware M15x (WARNING: If your computer does not support both microphone and headset with one headphone jack, the cable that comes with the headphones/microphone will not work, unless you have a Y-connector that allows you to split the audio and microphone into two different streams of connections. My Alienware m15 did not have this, so I had to purchase a Y-connector as the microphone and the sound audio where with different jacks.)-Samsung S4, (Works perfectly fine with this android phone either chatting on Skype or regular calls. Though the product page says that the cable with the volume -/+ will not work on androids, only on iPhone/iPad. Which did not bother me.)-PS4 (Make sure you put the connection on the PS4 through the PS4 controller. I use this for PS4 chat on Final Fantasy 14 with keyboard/mouse/controller setup and it works flawlessly.)(ANOTHER NOTE: When I use these for chat I also use the V-Moda Boom Mic for Chatting either on Skype or PS4. You can purchase this from here for about $30. And it work better than the microphone that comes with these headphones.)PRO:-Fantastic Sound what they were worth.-Very good construction and durability.-Allow you to disconnect the cable from the headphones.-Carrying case.-Two cables (3ft other [comes with Volume -/+], I believe, 6ft [ does not come with Volume -/+]-Not much outside sound comes through when you have the headphones at a certain volume.-Noise bleed is fantastic as little to no sound can be heard from the headphone cups.Cons:-It felt a bit uncomfortable for long periods of time, however, when I was gaming or listening to music, adjust the headphones on your head a bit forward and this released the pain. I felt that the headphones would slip down my head. I put the headphones on the smallest setting, as being women my head is not that big. My guy friend tries these on his head, and he said that they were very comfortable. Though, he only had them on for about 15 secs.-The Cables! The cables that tend to come with the headphones, seems to fray after a certain amount of use. Not in fray, that the cable just comes apart, but the fibers protecting the cable frays, which tends to be a bit unsightly for my taste, but I'm cheap, so they work. The product page that these are kevlar, but I see they are very much strong on these cables that come with the headphones, however the fiber surrounding the cable are not. Even the Boom Mic is not protected from the fraying,-COLOR! I thought that these were pure white. Though it said on the webpage pearl white, I looked at the picture and bought these because it looked cool. However, when I received these in the mail it was not the color as pictured. It is not white like the SAMSUNG S4 or white iPhone. SO BEWARE OF THIS COLOR DISCREPANCY! More like the color of necklace pearls.-Price: It always seems that these type of headphones which tends to have a lot of bass to there line, and not have a much purer sound. I listen to mostly classical and movie theme music with orchestra bands. I do listen to rock, pop, and other modern music which is perfect for these headphones, but not for classical or much softer tone music such as piano or violin. BUT! I did not let that deter me from purchasing these over the Ars-Technica headphones. Those headphones seem they have purer sound, but they did not look as cool as these headphones.CONCLUSION: These are perfect for everyday use and chatting (if you have the V-MODA Boom Mic). Listening to music such as rock, pop, nightcore, and others will be perfect for this type of music. Classical not so much, but if you are not a particular on the sound, then these are the perfect headphones for you.

VI've had these headphones for a while now and I still love them. They are by far the best headphones I have ever owned. I listen to all kinds of music and everything sounds amazing through these. The bass is truly amazing and beats all other headphones. They are also very comfy and natural filling on the ears and head. The fact that it comes with an extra chord and an exoskeleton case is a bonus. The chrome finish also looks amazing in person and comes with a rag which makes it easy to clean. I highly recommend these if you're a music fanatic and looking to invest in quality headphones.

VI received a phantom chrome pair of these as a gift a little over a year ago. When I received them the box had been opened. While they still had plastic covering the chrome, the cord had obviously been used. There were places on the case where the rubber had been rubbed off. I thought I was given a used pair, but the person who bought them said they had selected a new pair. Sorry, I just had to get that out of the way.This was my first pair of quality headphones, and I fell in love. So much so I bought a second pair in white. Visually, they are very pleasing. The construction is phenomenal. After a year plus of everyday use they still look practically new. The blemishes on the case have obviously gotten worse and new ones have developed, but that's the reason it's included.They are bass heavy, and the mids and highs don't come through as much as some more expensive headphones that I have since purchased. Both pairs I own were purchased for less than 100 bucks. I'm not sure you can find a better sounding set of closed headphones at that price.The phantom chrome have been my go to travel set (even after purchasing a pair of Beyerdynamic dt 770 pro). While the Beyerdynamic undeniably sound more clear and open, they are much larger and have a higher impedance which requires an amp to power. The lower impedance of the crossfades is perfect for running straight from an ipod or smart phone, in fact, the amp doesn't improve the sound quality much. The V-Modas also bleed less sound.The reason I can't give the cross fades 5 stars is because after a year, of pretty heavy use, the sound is starting to get really loose and muddy. Side by side with my less used pearl white the phantom's sound far worse. It doesn't seem fair to compare with the Beyerdynamic's, which are more than double the price, or my Sennheiser's, which are open backed, but the phantom's are almost unlistenable with these competing. It's incredibly sad that physically the build is so impressive, but electronically they don't hold up. They were fiercely loved while in their prime.

VThe package has just delivered in front of my house. Terrible unboxing experience. The headphone box is ripped. There is no seal on it. I think this is a used pair. When i open the box, the case sit there without any plastic bag covering it. The user manual  has many marks on it with many wrinkle. I purchased a new pair, not a used pair. And why the heck are there Chinese on my box ? I have seen other's boxes, there are no chinese in the front.Put it on my head, I'm not impressed at the sound quality at all. Only the bass sounds good. I feel like its kinda dry.

VThese headphones have great sound quality and noise cancellation. I definitely felt like I got a good deal because I would normally expect to pay about $200 for a set of headphones like these. Also the 6 foot and 3 foot cable that comes with them is very nice because you can change out the cable depending on your needs. They also look very cool! My only problem with them is that they are a bit small on your ears so if you have slightly larger years, then they might hurt a little after an hour or two of wearing them.

VWhich I think is good. Certainly not bass heavy
p4832
sg5
VI have had these headphones for a few weeks now.  As far as the quality of sound, I find them very neutral.  Which I think is good.  Certainly not bass heavy, though not lacking.  Highs and mids are excellent.  What I find a small negative is the size of the actual ear pads - they do not completely cover my ear as I suspect they have tried to keep the size down.  Almost...just not quite.  Additionally, this is something I find a little odd that I don't think anyone else has commented on.  The cord is very sensitive to sound.  If I have the headphones on and listening to music, and the cord is "draped" over my shoulder....if I move and the cord moves...I can hear sound resonating into the headphones.  Hard to describe.  Think of a guitar string.  You pluck it and you get sound.  If you scrape the cord against your shoulder, you get sound.  Pretty loud actually.  If you are sitting very still, then you get nothing, but any movement with your head from side to side, or if you are fidgeting with the cord - you will get a pretty annoying transfer of sound.  Is this a deal breaker?  I don't know...it's close.

VXL Pads required, else great headphones.
p4838
sg5
VThe headphones are great.Accessories:The cable is detachable and is a standard 3.5 mm so you can use any cable you want.  As you can tell, you can replace the side panels with whatever panel/cover you want.  The headset comes with 2 cables, one is a short (3-4 feet?) with a microphone in the cable.  The second cable is much longer (5-6 feet?) and does not come with a mic.Durability:Seems like a solid headset.  Lots of metal.Sound:I'm no audiophile. That being said, I do appreciate quality.  These sound great.  The isolation is pretty high. I have a terrible A/C wall unit 4 feet from my head that runs constantly.  Although, I can hear the AC unit, it is very muffled.  The isolation goes both ways, you could crank the volume and not annoy your office neighbor.Cost / Comfort:The effective price of these headphones is $140 + $20 for the XL ear pads.  I am not happy about this.  The original pads enclosed my ears but were not deep enough to prevent the driver (hard plastic) from resting on my ears.  I wear glasses and this adds to the discomfort.  My ears appear to be normal and don't stick out anymore than the average person's ears.  With the XL pads I can wear these all day without discomfort.  The XL pads are required.  I removed 1 star because of this.  The headset isn't as large as it appears in the pictures.Dimensions:Outer XL Pad diameter: 3.75 inches tall, 3 inches wideInner XL Pad diameter: 2.5 inches tall, 1.75 inches wideDepth XL Pad: 0.75+ inches deepi will modify my review and measure the original pads when I get home.

p4868

VI'm still deciding whether to return this item in full.Firstly I have a defective part in the connection cable that has clearly not been tested.However my primary concern is the wiring in general.  Basically it is not shielded and will act like an ariel for an wireless signals from a mouse or radio in the vicinity.I'm using this with a wireless mouse for my PC.  This causes static to be picked up in the headphones and call me crazy but this seems like a rather poor oversight on the part of the manufacturer.  The rest of the build is fine and seems in line with the rest of the reviews.I'm not one to complain normally but static sounds such as this are actually worse with over ear headphones such as this.If I can't get a shielded cable I will likely be returning these as given the reviews they are not really what I paid for.If the manufacturer has social media monitoring and is picking this up I would appreciate a professional response.  If not then shame on you for burying your head in the sand.

VCouldn't Be Happier
p4879
sg5
VI've been using these headphones for nearly a month now, and I like them more and more every day. I've been using a long succession of headphones for the past 30 years\u2014 mostly inexpensive sets with noise cancellation. What a difference these V-MODA headphones are. They have convinced me to never buy cheap again and to forego noise cancellation. From day one I noticed that my music was sounding different, that I was hearing parts of the music I hadn't heard in years (or ever). Everything sounds bright and unmuddled!The design is solid and feels well built. They are comfortable for long periods of time. The patch cord is detachable and reinforced, which is a luxury no headphones should be without these days. I removed the extra straps and such in the middle of the case, giving me plenty of room to stash an MP3 player in the case as well.

VThe quality and thought behind these are almost there. Cords are high quality and they sound good until your ears are sore. I don't understand why they would make the ear cups so small. This seems to be a common complaint on these headphones. Nothing like having a great head phone set and having to go out a buy new cups because they are too small. Seems like they should have included the larger ones as standard

V(1 Year Update) Sounds Like Angels, Built Like a Tank
p4927
sg5
VI love bass. These headphones do bass. The sound quality is great, though the high highs aren't as well-delivered as the low lows. Hardly any noise escapes the earphones on full blast. Those wires can take a beating, but hey, "kevlar". You can even make out when a sound is intended to come from the front-left or behind you. I didn't even realise my songs had such depth and subtle beats in them untill they purchased these. Now... I just hope I never have to do without them. And with construction like this, I don't think that will be an issue.UPDATE: l've used these heavily for over a year now. I've dropped them onto concrete, I consistently step on/catch the cord and yank it out, I've blasted music in my ear so loud I could feel the earphones vibrate and developed a temporary ringing in my ear... I do that one alot. I've frikin sat my fat buttocks down on them, and so learned that the earphones pop out.I am a horrible headphone owner. And the worst thing I can say is that the adhustable right ear piece is a little loose, and there are some thin, teensy scratches on the metal earphone plates.These things are like luxury tanks. I love these, you should want these, they are well worth the price.

VThese are really good headphones. I've had them for a couple years now and the ear pads are still soft and cushiony. Still excellent sound quality and decent bass response. I also like the fact they give you two cords, the six foot long cord is a great addition. The sound isolation is fantastic too! I can turn on my music and not hear what someone in the same room is saying. My only complaint is that the headband is almost too good. After a couple hours of continuous wear, the outsides of my ears will start to ache from the ear muffs pressing against them. That being said, I can literally thrash my head while wearing these cans and they stay secured in place.

VVery Disappointed.If you like listening to your music on your home stereo with the equalizer adjusted with the bass ¾ the way up past centre curving down to the midrange and treble a bit  below centre (in an L shape) then you will love the sound of these headphones. Personally I find this sound very dull. It sounds like the singer, the snare drum and high hat are being played from the next room and the bass drum and bass guitar are right in front of you. I returned them and bought the Crossfade M-100's and could not be happier as they give a sound similar to setting your equalizer with the bass ¼ up past centre and the midrange at centre and the treble slightly up past centre.

The wire is nice and light so you dont notice the cable moving around as you move around (specifically at the gym) so it's not an annoying thing to have this wire bouncing around like typical headphone wiring.

VI've had mine less then 3 months and I swear these are fakes from China ! They sound OK but the material has already begun peeling off and my other vmoda headphones sound a million times better and only cost me 40 bucks? I knew I should have never trusted this important which wasn't amazon direct but was amazon complaint.  Spend the extra few bucks and get them direct from vmoda or you will be unhappy and miserable like I have been and my experience has been a nightmare because I know these headphones are not the real deal. I wish so bad I could return them but I think the 90 day return policy is over with?

VThese are just great headphones. Stylish, comfortable and they sound great. They come with a very nice semi-rigid clamshell case that holds and protects the headphones and all the accessories. I also love that almost every part of them can be replaced or swapped out individually so you don't necessarily need to buy a whole new pair if something breaks. I know that some reviewers have complained about the sound quality or that you need an amp to use them with an mp3 player, but mine sound excellent on anything that I've hooked them up to, including my ipod. They aren't noise cancelling but they do block out quite a bit of outside noise so you don't have to turn them way up if you're somewhere noisy (although I can tell you they get loud enough to drown out almost anything and maybe even blow out an eardrum!). I have only two minor complaints: First, they are a bit on the heavy side and some people may find that uncomfortable. Second, when they first arrived I found them to be too snug on my head to wear for very long. I do have a slightly larger than average head so that wasn't a huge surprise and the problem was easily remedied by leaving them on a head-sized box overnight to stretch a bit. I will also say that, while I haven't tried it, I am sure that you can actually bend the headband completely straight without damaging the headphones.There are other good headphones at this price, but if you're looking to upgrade your listening experience and look good doing it I would recommend these to anyone.

VREQUIRES the XL ear cushions - Telescoping mechanism should have been all-metal.
p5135
sg5
VI'd be inclined to give them a five star rating, but I've come across some issues that bother me... a lot. In fact I'm currently awaiting correspondence regarding sending them in for a little maintenance.Notes-Hold off on audio judgment. They wear like leather and the website tells you this: They will adjust over time to provide a higher quality listening experience than what you get from them right out of the box. To some this might be a flaw, but I feel it gives them a certain sentimental quality you don't get out of most devices.Pros-*Excellent build quality and materials with only a couple failure points.*Life extended by interchangeable cables.*Attractive design fit for even the fanciest venues.*Excellent audio for a bassheadCons-*Too-thin, lightweight cushions while pretty do leave your ears to deal with the pressure of the monitors themselves. This also leads to a bad seal which causes sound leakage.*Related to the above, I've found myself in the awkward position of having NO idea how to clean out the disgusting mess of dead skin, oils and most likely BLOOD that got trapped in the protective grate.*Telescoping mechanisms are bound together with plastic plates which leads to a compromise in durability.*Came with faulty cables. Not a big deal, but annoying.*Full length audio cable is a bit quieter than the SpeakEasy mic cable. Again this isn't a big deal.Overall I love these headphones and won't be switching off of the Crossfade series anytime within the foreseeable future, but if there is one thing I'd like to tell anyone scouting them out: Get the XL ear cushions with them... They're another twenty dollars but they'll save you a lot of pain.

VQuite disappointed - not sure what all the fuss is about
p5147
sg5
VI purchased these headphones recently during an Amazon Lightning Deal.  These were intended as a gift for my son; unfortunately, I had to return them, as I was quite disappointed with the sound quality.My background is that I've been using Klipsch X10 earphones for the last three years (which were also a lighting deal - $95 in 2011).  The X10's provide excellent, clear vocals, mids, and 'just right' bass (in my opinion.)The V-Moda Crossfade LPs, on the other hand, sounded 'muddy' (not sure how else to describe it).  I was prepared for strong bass, as mentioned in other reviews, but I was not expecting such low-quality mids and highs.Perhaps the Crossfade LPs sound better with certain types of music (rap?), but not with the kind I listen to (mostly electronic trance and industrial...)And yes, I did break them in - for over 24 hours continuous use, at 50% volume.  The sound did not appreciably improve.

VI've been a VModa fan for over 4 years now, I had a pair of the LP's in nero and now I have the Chrome and they are real shiney. I work for a company who sells multiple brands of headphones like Beats, bose and sennheiser. I've had a lot of experience with them all but I always come back to VModa. There comfy, secure, strong and still quite light for being most made in metal and obviously the sound is amazing, I listen to all types of music and I never feel dissatisfied. And for those thinking long term check out their Immortal Life Program for if the headphones give out. http://v-moda.com/immortal-life-program/

VFirst Over-ear Headphones
p5182
sg5
VStyle: NeroPrice: currently on Amazon, $128V-Moda website, $199I received these headphones last year from my parents for my birthday. I had been searching for a decent pair of over-ear headphones after entertaining the idea of learning to DJ, and these were the most frequently recommended for beginning DJs. They were the second most popular recommendation next to Beats by Dre overall. I had no intentions of paying the equivalent of a semester\u2019s textbooks for a brand name over my ears, and I wanted something that I could use for more than DJing. For the price, they definitely have better sound quality than the more fashionable options currently being advertised.Pros: Number one on my list of pros for these headphones is the warranty. They\u2019re guaranteed to withstand up to sixty drops from a maximum height of five feet. Whether I ever actually learn to DJ or I\u2019m just head-banging in my room, I can promise I will never drop these over sixty times. This makes the warranty a fantastic deal. Additionally, if the headphones do break\u2014even if it\u2019s my own fault\u2014I can send the parts in and receive a credit towards my next purchase with V-Moda.Another pro to these headphones is their build quality, starting with the braided cord that can detach from the ear cups. Each pair comes with two cords: one long cord and one shorter one with a built-in volume and microphone feature. They\u2019re extremely durable and they insulate the wires from wear and tear. Also, the ear cups are made of high quality hard plastic and a metal plate. The headband is padded on the underside and covered in a soft leather wrapping on the outside.As for the headphones\u2019 actual performance, they\u2019re fantastic. They isolate noise well when playing music. If you\u2019re looking for purely noise-cancelling headphones, these may not be the best, but for listening to music without interruptions they work perfectly. I\u2019ve sat in the middle of a crowded room and not heard a single person over the music I was playing.Greatest of all though, these headphones opened my ears to the rich quality in the music I listen to. Details that I\u2019d never heard before in songs that I loved were suddenly very apparent. Some of this was due simply to the fact that they are my first over-ear headphones. But it was also because of the headphones\u2019 quality. The bass drivers are powerful and most sounds are very crisp. Sometimes I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of percussion sounds in a song can muddle the quality, but I haven\u2019t noticed many other problems after a year of using these.Some other pros include the option to buy and customize additional metal plates for the ear cups if you want to create something more fashionable. As I already mentioned, they come with two detachable cords, as well as a sturdy hard-shell case for carrying.Cons: Sometimes I feel that these headphones compromise some of the mid- and high-level qualities when pushing bass-heavy songs. This may just reflect the recent fad of bass heavy music, and it only occurs with some songs. It\u2019s also obvious that these were designed with DJs in mind, because electronic music is probably the best sounding genre I\u2019ve listened to on these. However, it would be great if these were better suited to other types of sounds and genres. Heck, most DJs work with several different music genres, so their headphones ought to be able to keep up.As far as build, the main improvement I would like to see is some sort of locking mechanism for the headband. I hate bumping the headphones and making the headband slide out of place when they\u2019re sitting on a table or my bed. Adding a lock to prevent that would be useful and would take some of the hassle out of having to frequently readjust them.Do I recommend these headphones? Yes.These are great for anyone looking for a cheap pair of DJ headphones, their first over-ear headphones, or something that packs better quality for a cheaper price than a pair of Beats. These are great starter headphones that will set you on the right track whether you\u2019re a budding DJ, a budding audiophile, or simply someone who appreciates great sound. And if you\u2019re smart, you\u2019ll buy them on Amazon at a much cheaper price than retail cost.

VGreat sounding headphones for rap & some rock. These headphones sound good but not great. The problem is balance. I end up using my 50cent sms street more because of the well balanced sound. I use these mainly for rap. If thats your thing, these headphones should be fine.They are well made, come with braided fabric cords. One with mic and one without. A nice carrying case with straps to secure cords. Good range headband adjustment. Memory foam earcuhions and band. Very comfy. Not to heavy. Get a little warm, but thats expected with over ear headphones. Good for what I paid. 3 stars cause I just dont use them that much. I currently use my sms street & playstatikn pulse 1st gen headphones.

VI purchased these when my company moved me from an office I shared with one other person to a cubicle farm (not as punishment; it was a building closer to home. LOL)  I needed something to block out the sound of people around me talking on the phone or to others.  The timing was also good, since a few weeks before my Logitech over-the-ear headphones developed a crack in the band, so they no longer stayed on right.  I selected V-MODA mostly based on the reviews here.They do a great job of blocking out noise, even when my music is at a low volume.  In fact, when someone stops by they usually need to tap me on the shoulder before I realize they're there.  I didn't go for active noise cancelling since, aside from the price, in my experience they are good at blocking out constant background noise (such as on an airplane), but not as effective with voices or other random sounds.These headphones are comfortable, even after wearing them for almost 8 hours a day.  The sound is good (much better than my Logitechs).  There is also very little sound leakage; if I put them on my desk with the pads of each side together, I can't tell that they're on.  So even if I crank the music up, I don't worry about annoying my neighbors.  The build quality seems very good, and the cloth-covered cords don't tangle like plastic ones do.  I like that the cord unplugs at each end (you got 1 PC cord and another for phones), since I can unplug them and lock them in a desk drawer at night while leaving the cord connected to my docking station.  The case itself is sturdy and seems they would protect the 'phones well (though I haven't done any drop tests.)After several weeks of use, I'm still completely happy with them.

p5337
sg5
VThis is my first pair of over-ear headphones so I can't really compare it to other over-ear headphones, but I have been a long time ear phone user. These headphones definitely outrank any pair of ear phones any day. To be honest, I bought these headphones because I am tired of using ear phones and was looking for a more comfortable and high quality solution and this is it for me. I received these yesterday and I love them! I have an industrial cartilage piercing and for those who are concerned about this, it does get a little sore and tender after a while. It isn't unbearable pain, but it is to be expected if you have a steel bar protruding out of your ear. The bass does not drown out the vocals and the vocals are crisp and clear. These headphones are more biased toward electronic/dance music, but I think AC/DC sounds great with these headphones. These are definitely sturdy and do not feel like they will break at the slightest hint of a wrong twist or touch. These are not bulky at all. When I have them on, they rest comfortably on my head and ears and it does not feel like I have a bag of bricks sitting on my head. They are also very stylish! For the price, this is a steal. If you are looking to buy a pair of headphones, invest in these! These "shook me all night long." :D

VAmazing. For the price, these headphones perform way over what you'd expect them to do. Mid and high clarity, strong bass but not muddled. Great for electronic/big room music. Given how durable these are (i dropped 50 pound dumbbells on them and they suffered no damage) they are great for the gym (probably too bulky for cardio though) or any rigorous activity. Do keep in mind that the leather ear cups harden over time (6 months to a year or so) and they no longer are that comfortable, and would actually cause discomfort after a few hours. But theyre replaceable so no big deal. I've recommended them to half a dozen of my friends who all love them, and i'd recommend them to any one else too!

VA toss up, but a good buy for a specific role
p5384
sg5
VI have quite mixed feelings about these headphones. For one thing, the build quality is (on the whole) great; they feel extremely solid, the adjustment mechanism gives a satisfying click, and I suspect that these will last for years even if I don't use the provided case. They are fairly comfortable. The pads are a bit small in diameter but are pretty squishy. I do feel the weight of the headphones after awhile.The sound, however, is not nearly as good as the construction. They have huge amounts of bass, to the point that it sounds muddy in some cases and muffles other parts of the spectrum. Mids definitely sound recessed, highs are decent. It gets a little better with equalization, but the stock balance is too far out to really fix. The sound, though, is not what I bought these headphones for. I knew based on other reviews that the balance isn't great, but they aren't meant to be audiophile headphones. I was looking for a well built set of fun-sounding headphones that would last for years, and for that role, I think these do deserve four or five stars. The only solid problem I had was with the cords. Both supplied cords started to get fiddly after a few months, like they have loose connections somewhere near the plugs. I don't understand this, as the cords were specifically stated to be durable and are covered in a stiff-ish woven material. I'm a bit suspicious of a company that can't get cords right, but there are always some duds I suppose.I will say that I think these are overpriced at ~$125. I got them on sale a few months ago here at more like $80, and I think they are worth a bit more than that. If you are quite worried about the sound balance, it sounds like the LP2 model sounds significantly better, so another option is to wait for a sale on that one.

VBig Disappointment
p5425
sg5
VSo disappointed. This is my second pair of expensive headphones (the first were the Bose noise-canceling headphones. You know the ones that are like two or three hundred dollars and sound like crap). I decided that I wanted to really fork over some money and get some truly great headphones. I'm a writer and I spend a lot of time wearing headphones and listening to music while I write. So this seemed like a good investment.What crap. The fit, finish and appearance are fantastic. The case and all the hardware are also quite a bit above par. They look great, feel great, and feel really well built. But the sound quality and comfort just isn't there. Put simply, they sound no better than my $10 Wal-Mart ear buds. Yeah, I'm serious. Not only that, but they don't really fit very well and hurt my left ear (not both ears. Just the left one. Go figure). After just twenty minutes of use they discomfort was strong enough to really distract me.I'm not sure what I was expecting. I think I was hoping to hear totally new songs like so many of the reviewers of this item were boasting about. New sounds and nuances to my beloved music that I'd never heard before. New clarity and better comfort. And I guess the sound is different, but not really better. Actually, the vocals aren't as clear with the V-MODAs as they are with those well used Wal-Mart ear buds (which cost me, like, 8% of the total cost of these bad boys).So yeah, I guess I'll be returning these. They look great but the comfort and amazing sound quality that everybody brags about just isn't there. Don't waste your time, because you'll be returning these.

VTough and durable, with some pretty good sound. I'm not a huge stickler for frequencies, as I use apps with EQ settings that I change so it sounds good to me, and I am pretty happy with the sound quality of these headphones. What sells me on these more though is how solid the craftsmanship is. I've dropped these so many times and the cord has accidentally caught on things and ripped out of the headphones/phone even more times and they still are going on strong!My only complaint is that I have a small head, so the weight is actually put on my ears instead of the top of my head, which gets uncomfortable after a while. It's nothing a small strip of foam wouldn't fix, but if you add foam, then the headphones will not fit in the cool case anymore. If you have a normal to large sized head you're probably fine.Also, I got the red (Rouge) version, and I love the look of them!

VOK.  First the good.  They look and sound great!  Now the bad.  The call/volume controls didn't work.  Also, the headphones had a very tight fit and were very uncomfortable.  For my money (and for any headphones over $100) you have to deliver great sound (which these do have), great design/look (which these have), great reliability (which I found lacking when I received a pair with broken call/volume controls), and great comfort (which, for me, these were not).  Big head?  Think every thing should work?  Consider going elsewhere.

VTo start, I did not have any other 'almost top-end' headphone like this one, so I cannot compare it with anything else. But this has been a very pleasant experience thus far. I have listened to a lot of songs wearing this and when the audio quality is great this has the power to equally provide that remarkable sound. Though the bass for Pharrell William's Happy seemed really poor from all my sources. It did improve as they said it would after the 'breaking in' period but I wasn't blown away like some of the reviewers. Talking about comfort, it's one of the main reason I chose this in the first place after seeing such positive opinions....and I wasn't disappointed at all. Thank god. Comfort is a big thing for me and you can wear this baby for a long time. As someone mentioned already, the exoskeleton is for carrying it, so in other words, it's not quite comfortable to wear it around the neck when you are not listening to anything. The design is pretty awesome and gives you that premium feel that you would wish from it. Love the long protected wires. All in all, I love it and would definitely recommend it to others.

VThese headphones are extremely stylish and very comfortable. The memory foam earpads are a blessing. Construction is rugged and the kevlar-braided removable audio cables are fantastic. I also love the alien-looking case, which does a fine job protecting the headphones from damage. My only qualm is that the midrange and high end of the sound spectrum is a bit dull on these units. The bass is full and round. Overall, the sound is quite superior to any of the Dre Beats I've listened to. For the price I'm extremely happy with them.

p5532
sg5
VThe headphones feel very solid and seems like it can stand abuse.  The sound quality is good from what I can tell (I'n not an audiophile).  The packaging is very nice and makes you feel like you bought a high end product.  My only issue is that foam for the ear is not large enough to keep my ear from touching the inner part of the speaker.  This means after using it for an hour, my ears will become sore.The headphone set I used previous to this one was a Sennheiser HD 428.  As far as fit to the ears go, they were absolutely perfect (I could keep them on for hours without any soreness developing).  Unfortunately, my dog got a hold of them and I was forced to find some new headphones.  Since the HD 428s are no longer being made, I thought I would give V-MODA a try.  Everything about it was good except the contact my ear makes inside, which is a shame since I would love to use them for more than an hour at a time.

They handle high volume without distortion or even much leakage to the world around you. The tones are clear enough that you can differentiate individual melody lines and instruments. They have proven to be resilient and sturdy as well. I don't use them in my day to day walking around, but I do travel with them. I've had them for almost two years, since I moved to NYC (spare the roommates my late-night music and movie tendencies) and they have continued to impress. Highly recommended.

p5620
sg5
VWell, I would have given 5 stars two months ago, but then all of a sudden something happened. Suddenly, the fidelity and the amount of bass dropped significantly, leaving behind a hollow, $30 sound.I always kept them inside the case when not being used, never tried any of those silly stress tests, never frayed the cable, etc. They look like they are in mint condition, and they are. Therefore, I have no clue what might of caused this.So, I sent it in for repair (you do have to pay for shipping), It arrived there and was signed for. It's been about 6 hours and they have yet to open it up and e-mail me (which is how that process works), but that's fine. Then, I contacted them on Skype to get an estimate and they said it would take up to 2 weeks to repair it! Not just mine though, according to them, there are so many repairs that they are behind in their work and what would normally would take 3-4 days would actually take about 3 times longer!So, 3-4 days would have been fine, but if their equipment requires this much repairing, I'm not so sure the quality is as great as I once thought it was.Nevertheless, I suppose I will get them sometime mid-to-late August.

The design also makes it fairly easy to remove the head band. I bought a second pair that I took apart and placed inside my motorcycle helmet.

VVery, very nice headphones!
p5632

VI am, by no means, an audio expert. I can just tell you what I have experienced. The sound output from these headphones seems really good to me. The bass is very deep, and very satisfying. High vocal ranges come through clear, and everything in the middle sounds good to my non-expert ears.Additionally, I am a fan of quality materials used in the construction of things like this. These are made out of metal and leather, and some plastic and some synthetic fabric, but the majority materials are metal and leather. (Note, the leather earpieces can get warmer faster than fabric covered ear-pieces).I also like the extra-long cords that come with the headphones (with a nice braided cover as well), and the hard-case for storing them in. You can also order custom face-plate "shields" with stock graphics, or your own graphics -- which I thought was pretty cool (you have to do that directly with V-Moda, though, you can't do it through Amazon).My biggest complaint about these headphones, is that stock/out-of-the-box, they were TIGHT on my head, which would have given me headaches. Luckily, this isn't my first time to the new headphones rodeo, so I knew to stretch them out by putting a few books together and putting the headphones on the books to stretch them out for about a week. After that, they were golden.5 stars!

VThe bass is deep, the high and mids are rich and the cans are perfectly comfortable over my ears. I really can't say enough good things about these headphones and I have recommended them to many people. I'm not an audiophile so I can't give technical details about them, but to my ears they definitely sound better than ~the leading seller of consumer headphones~ with a much better price.

VGreat sound isolation for music and gaming - give time to be comfortable
p5643
sg5
VUPDATE 9/5/14 - I have now owned these for 2 months and they are more comfortable; the head / upper jaw pressure is gone for the most part, the center ear is more comfortable, but definitely the least comfortable part.  Im bumping from a 3 star rating to a 4 star rating.  I have also purchased the boom pro mic and use this for gaming as well as music / voice calls.  Huge difference (better) in gaming audio compared to my Razer headset!Would give 5 stars if not for the discomfort...Pros - Great sound isolation; stylish design; great sound quality and bass.Cons - Not very comfortable.  I have a medium size head / normal ears.  Pushes into my head/ upper jaw; and center ear cartilage hits the inside drum adding additional pressure.  I ended up ordering the XL cushions as they have a deeper space; they are noticeably more comfortable than the stock ear cushions; but still not comfortable.I have owned these for about 3+ weeks; they do get a little more comfortable as a I wear them more (head gets used to the discomfort).  I still can't wear these hours on end like some people say they do.

VThe bass on these headphones is brutal unlike anything I've heard, my ears literally vibrates on heavy bass tracks. The mids and high are meh. I think the primary focus is bass in these headphones. If you really want sound clarity then the m100 be a better a choice but at a cost, less bass.

VBest headphones on the market for under $200
p5661
sg5
VBest headphones on the market for under $200, and honestly they beat out most of the competition that are priced in the $250-$500 range.  I used to own HDJ-2000's ($300) and these headphones sound fuller, warmer, and pack more punch when it comes to the bass.  The only reason I didn't say that they were the best headphones for under $300 is because V-moda makes another model in that price range and I'm sure those must sound fantastic.I love the fact that they come in an awesomely packaged box with lots of goodies inside, including a hard case.  The hard case without a doubt saves your headphones from nicks, scrapes, and scratches from keeping them in a bag.  I will be buying, supporting, and spreading the good word about v-moda.  I hope they continue to keep doing business this way.

VNOT NOISE CANCELING
p5667
sg5
VThe advertisement for these headphones is misleading: They are not noise canceling, and the noise isolation is minimal. The quality of sound was so-so. I'm a classical music fan, but many of my favorites (e.g. rich symphonic works like Mahler's Second Symphony, and choral masterworks like Rachmaninov's Vespers) fell flat with these headphones. I would not suggest these headphones for people who want a quiet airplane trip or a rich musical experience.

p5673
sg5
VI purchased these headphones a month or two ago now, and I've loved them (and continue to do so) to this day.They are very sturdy and I cannot see any damage to them as of yet.They are extremely comfortable, I wear them for several hours just about every day and I have no problems.  They are a perfect fit for my head, my ears fit comfortably inside and the headband is very comfortable on the top of my head.The sound is great also.  They seemed to be working at their best straight from the box.There may be better headphones out there for the price, but very few look as stylish as these do.The only two negatives I can say are;The cable that allows you to answer phonecalls doesn't appear to be working with my phone.  When plugged in, I get a "this device is unsupported" message.  However, the secondary cable (without the ability to answer calls) works fine.Secondly, the metal parts of the headphones are very prone to fingerprints and smudges.  This is a small price to pay for such a good looking set of headphones.  The cloth supplied with the box cleans them off no problem, but you'll have to use it frequently if you want them to stay shiny.

VI got this for my son. I can't believe the sound this thing makes in your ears. This is a steal for the price given that the drivers are pretty big, delivers bass, clear highs. We've had this for months now and it still looks like we got it today. The cable being kevlar-covered has not shown an iota of wear. Same goes with the rest of the components like the strap, hinges, and foam. On top of all that, this thing does not look like anything that a lot of people wear - Beats. You won't look like a clone if you wear this. My son had a lot compliments from his friends, in apple stores (where they sell Beats). People tend to gravitate to it as it looks unique, cool, and just good-looking. Some of my son's friends have their beats die on them and got this as a replacement

p5757
sg5
VMy first set of quality headphones, my seinheisers that i recently acquired sound a bit more full through the entire range. However these heaphones are perfect for bass heavy tunes or if you just prefer a little more low end. That being said if you are stepping up from cheapo headphones these will make you rediscover a lot of songs you thought you already new and make you appreciate all that goes into the music.In addition these things are tanks. I throw them into my drawer at work all the time and they just take it. The cord is easily replaceable if you ever manage to tear it up. (tear both of them up that is since it comes with standard and one with play pause buttons)HIGHLY recommend; in fact a couple of my friends have purchased these since i have had them and they have thanked me for the recommendation because they did not realize the little extra money gets you a whole lot.

VV-Moda Crossfade LPFirst off, I\u2019ve owned the V-Modas for over a year but did not feel comfortable writing a review until I got my feet wet with more headphones.  Well, I\u2019ve gotten those feet darn near drowned with headphones since I got the V-Modas.A little about me so you know where my review is coming from.  I wear glasses so most on-ears are out of the question.  I have a medium sized head.  I mostly use over-ear headphones for home or office use as I feel silly walking around in them.  I work next to an airport so am able to test all of my headphone\u2019s noise isolation/cancellation.  I do use most headphones with an amplifier but use them direct when I do take them out.  I listen to everything from country to hip-hop to Polish folk music and need a headphone that can keep up with all of them when listening on shuffle.  On that note, onward with the review.SoundThese are tuned for accentuated bass but don\u2019t let that deter you audiophiles.  They do sound quite good overall connected directly to a portable player.  The accentuated bass gives it a \u2018fun\u2019 sound signature but the bass is not bloated and does not overpower the mids or highs which are still more accurate than most other \u2018phones.  Connecting through an amp does not improve much of the overall sound as these were designed with portable music sources in mind.  They are not completely flat in the EQ and are not really the accurate set that audiophiles crave like say the AKG Q701s.ComfortThese are comfortable while wearing glasses.  The ear cups are not circular bur rather \u2018diamond\u2019 shaped with the corners towards the middle of each side.  Though they are \u2018over-ear\u2019 headphones, the design of the ear cup does not match the shape of a human ear and thus do rest on the tippity-top and bottoms of my dumbo ears.  After a few hours, I need a break.  This may not happen if you have normal sized ears, however.  Sync by 50s are completely round and will more than likely press up against most people\u2019s ears.  The clamping force out of the box is adequate but can be adjusted by bending the headband.  Don\u2019t worry.  V-Moda recommends this as they are quite durable.  They still look brand new after a year too.  The clamping force on something like the Klipsch Mode M-40 is quite tight in comparison and that set cannot be adjusted very much.DesignThough most models are still a bit too blingy for me, the shields can be replaced to suit your style better.  The headphones themselves are pretty flush and do not stick out away from one\u2019s head like say the ear cups on the Sync by 50 or the headband on the Denon Globecruisers.  Those look awesome in their case but look like head gear on your noggin.  Unfortunately, these do not fold in or rotate flat but are already fairly compact and quite portable.These are closed back and provide passive noise isolation instead of active (requiring batteries) and do quite nicely at that.  When I took them out for a walk at work, the airplanes flying overhead were audible but did not distract from the music.  I think both the effective noise isolation and the bassier, livelier sound signature contribute to that.ExtrasThis set comes with a very nice hard-ish shell case that has Velcro-ed strap pieces where one can secure cables or other accessories.  As mentioned, the \u2018phones themselves are quite compact and the case is not very much bigger.  It comes with a carabiner to lock to a belt loop or other item to carry easier.  It also comes with two cables; one straight, longer cable that is for home use, and a shorter three button iOS compatible cable.  A 1/8\u201d to ¼\u2019 adapter is also included.Best suited forThose looking for headphones that sound good with all kinds of music, isolate outside noise quite well, and have a subtle yet edgy look all in a highly portable form factor.  These will sound good with an MP3 player or phone and can also hold their own in a higher end, home or office rig.Not forAudiophiles demanding the most accurate, flat response.  Everybody else will surely enjoy these and more than likely the newer M-100s.

VGreat Value and High Fidelity
p5822
sg5
VI was looking for a high quality headphone set for some upcoming travel I was embarking on that didn't set me back $300 or more. I was not opposed to the more expensive alternatives out there and can certainly afford them but am a firm believer in buying what I research to be the best based on other user reviews.With that said, I choose this product solely off the reviews from other users. It was among the highest rated; perhaps amongst the top 5-7. What set this apart from the others was the much lower cost.Upon receipt, I was impressive with the quality of the two detachable audio cables it came with, both have some type of thread braiding on the exterior which not only give it a higher quality look but also helps protect the copper internal wires better. It comes with a decent looking hard case, 3.5mm plug adapter, two cables already mentioned, and a d-ring (not sure what its used for). Along with the headphones, these all fit inside the case which is perfect for travel.I used for three hours straight on a flight from Houston to San Francisco. I was impressed with the sound quality, especially how these headphones hands the lower tones (bass) within the music being played. These do not have noise canceling but the good over-the-ear fit and high fidelity sound do a great job at drowning out the sound of jet engines when flying at 30k feet, seated in a window seat next to the wing. After three hours of use, my ears didn't hurt from wearing the headphones. They were actually quite comfortable and look forward to my next flight to where I can use them again.Would I recommend these to others? Certainly! If you aren't dead set on noise canceling, I would most certainly buy these. Even without noise canceling technologies, they do a superior job at delivering high sound quality.

VI have to start by saying I am no audiophile. This is my first pair of real over ear headphones so I don't have many points of references. That being said, I am very happy with the headphones. I did a lot of research before settling on this pair. The looks just won me over and the reviews are great too. I really wanted the M-100 just because it is more portable. But I cannot really justify $300 on a headphone when I am only using it to listen to music. The good thing is if my LP ever break (very unlikely anyways given the build quality), I will be able to purchase another pair from v-moda for 50% off.I am still a little confused about the whole burn in thing. Initially I thought I need to play music at highest volume so I did that for a while. Then I read that it was very wrong (really hoping that I didn't break anything at those volumes). I found some burn in playlist on youtube and played with pink noise, brown noise or whatever for a while. Then I got too lazy and just started playing different kinds of music on spotify/pandora/itunes library at around 60% volume.A lot of reviewers commented on sound leakage - here is what I don't get: I normally only play music at 30% to 40% volume and if I go higher I feel like I am going deaf. And there is absolutely no sound leakage unless you turn the volume up to 70% isn or higher. My definition of no leakage = when I put the ear pads next to each other after taking them off, I cannot hear a thing. But volume is a personal preference. For those who prefer to listen at high volume, there will be some leakage but they still sound minimal to me.The sound quality sounds great to me and meet my needs. I listen to everything from EDM, rock, pop to country and classic and I start to see why some say that this headphone is best for electric music.The build quality is great! I love the design (I got the pearl white) and the fact that I can comfortably wear only one ear pad when I need to. The metal plates look so good but they are fingerprint magnets.My only complain is about portability. I really wish they were more comfortable around my neck...

VSound is good, but not quite as good as I expected, but I mainly purchased for the unparalleled construction quality, as my big fat head keeps breaking headsets that use plastic connections between the headband and cans.

p5886
sg5
Vafter owning this piece for so long, i can tell you this, the crossfade LP is not the most comfortable headphone to wear, it is bulky, and very tight around the ears, it almost begins to hurt my skull after about 30-40 minutes and my ear cartilage begins to cramp so i have to change its positioning, this is the reason i have not used it much, on the other hand v-moda earbuds are superb...and aside from their uncomfortableness, the sound is absolutely amazing.

VFor a cheaper price you get better sound quality
p5892
sg5
VBought these headphones as a gift for myself and they turned out to exceed my expectations.  They deliver high quality sound where the bass does not override the treble so the music you hear is as clear as day.  I use these when studying to stay focused, flights, and lounging/dancing around my house with no shame what so ever.  They have a sleek design and are surely to turn heads as well as be the source of many compliments.  The case they came in is very durable as it is designed to protect the headphones.  Beats are made of plastic and are over priced.  For a cheaper price you get better sound quality, better material, which means it lasts longer, and more smiles and head bobbing.  Overall I am very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend this product to anybody who enjoys sitting down and jamming out to some beats.

VI should say I'm not a audiophile or whatever and this is the only high grade pure audio headphones I've owned besided a pair of dre's about the same price. The dre's wern't very impressive and these were a ton better in everyway. These are sturdy feeling and crisp sound. At first bringing it out of the box the sound was a tad tinny. But as people have said about breaking in headphones. I let them play all night and kept trying them on periodically. I don't think it even took more than a few hours and they sounded a lot better. I also bought a Fiio11 amp to go with them and the sound is amazing on my cell phone when I'm out for walks. I use these on my computer too when I'm working or chatting with friends and they are much crisper cleaner sounding than just about any gaming headset I've ever owned and I've owned alot of them. Except maybe my old astros that broke a few years back.Anyway all in all, very happy about my purchase. They don't even hurt my ears like others have said they did. I was worried about that though and bought xl pads too. Haven't put them on. So don't be worried about that unless u have freakishly big ears!

VI love these headphones. I've had them for about 2 months and they have been great. The bass is really deep, and that is what I noticed at first. The nice thing is the rest of the sound spectrum doesn't suffer. The highs and mids sound good too. The ear pads are nice and comfortable, the cords are really nice and durable. You get a hard carrying case and two cords, which is not something you would typically find with headphones at this price range. I did find that they kind of clamped tightly on my head at first, which made them a little uncomfortable early on. However, it didn't take long to get used to. Overall, when I was researching over ear headphones, I found these to be the best value. So far, they have not disappointed.

VI had a Beats Solo HD RED Edition set which I thought was a blast until one day after 3 months, the left side cracked! It had rubbish build quality. External noise isolation was excellent in the Beats and the sound was sort of too artificial with an exaggerated bass.Then a friend of mine recommended the V-Moda M-100 set. I didn't buy it because of the 300$ price tag. Instead, I opted for this version (V-Moda Crossfade LP) and it is a choice I will not regret.The build quality is superb. It has the metallic touch in it all over (especially the side shields which look awesome) and you can feel it is a well built and manufactured headphone set.It is very comfortable and you can spend hours without noticing you're wearing them. They are a little heavy compared to the Beats and other sets, but that's because they are built from good lasting material, not like the cheap plastic of the Beats!The case that comes with it is superb! You can keep other stuff inside it. It comes with two cables (one normal and the other is special for mobile phones with volume up/down and answer button). It also has an adapter to large size connectors. They also include a cleaning cloth which I suppose is for cleaning and shining the metallic parts of the LP set.External noise isolation is good, but not as good as the Beats (although the latter may cause some unease after wearing them for a while). The sound is crystal clear and with the right parameters (no bass exaggeration).For the price tag this set has, I highly recommend it.Well done V-Moda on such an excellent product.

VThese are the best headphones I have owned. They fit my head perfectly (which is small), they can be expanded a lot for those with larger skulls. The quality is amazing, from the case to the headset to the cords. It delivers great sound quality and better bass than my Turtle Beach or Skull Candy headphones.I use these headphones on my PS4, PC and iPad Mini. It comes with two cords, one for iPhones/iPods (sound control) and another which is longer. Both cords work on all of my devices. I also bought the VMODA Gaming Mic cord and have used it with my PS4 and PC.I highly recommend these headphones if you are looking for sound quality, bass, comfort, style, hardware quality and detachable cords. Not to mention it beats out every other headset warranty and industry standard for drop tests.

VI almost never write reviews just because I'm too lazy or the product isn't really deserving of one. The V-Moda Crossfade LPs are the greatest headphones I've ever owned. The sound quality is out of this world and I can wear them for upwards of 5 hours without feeling discomfort (I wear glasses so the temples are pressed into my head). In addition any friends that I've let listen to music with these on are blown away. They cannot believe how much better they sound than all of the other brands currently being advertised as the "best."Buy these right now. You will not be disappointed.(Side Note: I did burn these headphones in for about 24 hours before using them).

p5992
sg5
VI got these headphones on a daily deal and still felt like I paid too much for what I got.  Taking them out of the box they appear really cool and flashy and the aesthetics certainly won me over.  Unfortunately aesthetics have nothing to do with how they feel when they're on your head.I only use headphones when I am on a plane to watch movies, so the noise-isolating feature was a bonus for me.  Unfortunately halfway through my first movie my ears hurt so bad that I have to physically lift the foam away from my head to relieve the pressure.  Naturally, having to hold the headphones away from my head defeats the purposes of the headphones because a) I am now HOLDING my sound in my hands and b) I no longer have noise isolation.I should have paid more and gone with a reputed set of headphones.

VTLDR version:Don't waste your money on Beats, or Bose. If you want something that sounds good AND looks just as good, buy these. These are not only way cheaper, but their engineering and design is worth way more than that of the competitors. And they sound better.Actual review:A bit of background on myself, I worked for a couple of years at my university's theatre department as a sound designer and audio technician, so I have at least a little experience with audio. I presently work at Staples, with live demos of several Beats brand headphones, Monster, Sony, and the like. And I've been playing the electric guitar for nearly 9 years.Okay, so I was given a pair of these for Christmas, and have been using them since then as often as possible--in the winter they double as amazing earmuffs, too! I was skeptical about them, having never heard of the brand before, but after researching them, and reading several dozen reviews, I decided "why not" and my fiance purchased them for me as a gift. As I eagerly awaited the chance to play them, I ordered myself a custom pair of shields, just to make them "mine." While the custom engraving was $50, it truly made these headphones feel personal--something Beats and Bose can't compare to.Right out of the box these things are amazing. I plugged them in and listened to one of my favorite songs--the sound at least as good as Beats and Bose fresh out of their packaging. At the advice of a friend/co-worker, and several previous reviews, I decided to spend a couple of days putting them through a "burn in" routine. So may argue that due to the materials used in modern headphones that this is a pointless effort, my somewhat trained ears did notice a difference in the sound after my little science project. So I highly recommend burning them in before actual use.For those of you not familiar with "burn in," it's basically a process of exercising the new speaker diaphragms so that they don't tear--something like stretching before a gymnastics routine. Some people believe that this also leads to a change in sound as well--making them sound better than they already do. While this may or may not be a real thing, it appears that this was at one time something that had to be done with older speakers that used less advance materials.The headphones are constructed in such a way that they look very nice, and thin, while still being structurally sound--or rather, nearly indestructible. V-moda boasts that you can drop these things on concrete from 7 feet up around 70 times or so. While I'd rather not put that to the test (I like my toys to be shiny and scratch free) I have dropped them a few times already, and haven't incurred so much as a scratch. (I also accidentally run my head into things. I'm a little reckless.) The company also boasts that their headphones are put through military level quality testing--MIL-STD-810G to be exact. While this claim can be misleading because no agency really certifies compliance with these standards, just handling the headphones gives testimony to their build quality. (I'd love to know the specifics of V-moda's testing.) The V-modas are made of steal, but despite this, they are really light. And thin. Beats headphones feel really thick and bulky to me--and they're made entirely of plastic; with the exception of their "executive" headphones. (For $300 the Beats Executives should be made of gold or something, instead of the crappy aluminum that they use.) And while they have 50mm drivers, like the Beats, they are much smaller, and look less like a weird sci-fi helmet or headset.The stock ear cushions are like little clouds that make these headphones feel like wearing angles on your head. I have several piercings in both ears, and I have big monkey ears, so I needed to upgrade to V-moda's XL cushions--and for only $20 they were well worth the money. And they even come in different colors! I can wear these cans for hours at a time with little to no fatigue. I'm pretty sure Beats don't have replaceable cushions--I didn't see them on the website. In addition, these cushions (both the stock ones, and the XL) create a wonderful seal around the ear. Just putting these things on, even without music playing, cuts out close to 20db of background noise--this is what V-moda means by "noise isolation." These headphones contain no batter or mics for active noise cancellation, which, as far as I'm concerned, is perfectly fine. At about 40% volume on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S4) most of the world is gone except for the low droning of really loud engines. Who wants to charge up their headphones before they are usable (You have to do this with some of the Beats, I'm told)? Not I, said the little techie.The headphones come with two different cables--one with a mic and volume controls (mostly for Apple products, as the controls don't work with Android devices (but the mic works fine)). Both of these cables are detachable, braided, and reinforced with kevlar. KEVLAR?! Yes. These cables are thick--and strong. They don't tangle, and I highly doubt that they will break. And even if by some strange twist of fate they DO manage to break, they are replaceable. V-moda sells replacements (basic cable) for $12 in 5 different color options. Beats sells their replacements (basic cable) for $20--and they're your basic rubber coated cable (the ones you find at Radioshack for like $5). To make matters better, or worse for Beats, the audio device side of the cable has a 45 degree bend--an angle that seems to work out perfectly. If you drop your device, it's less likely to yank right out. But it doesn't bend awkwardly when it does so. This ultimately results in less wear and tear on the "weakest link." I had a little accident with my phone and cable, which resulted in me actually bending the metal part of the connector (not the tip ring and sleeve, but the part that sticks out after it's plugged in.) Still works like it's brand new.In addition to the two cables, hard shell case, 1/8" to 1/4" adapter (that Beats sells for $5), they come with a cute little polishing cloth to keep your metal shields fingerprint free, and a kick-ass warranty! Straight from their booklet: "V-moda's Rock On Lifetime discount policy offers 50% of towards any V-moda replacement purchase on v-moda.com regardless of how your headphones were abused or broken. Crowd surfing, drove over, snagged in and elliptical machine, anything." So even if you're not covered by their limited warranty, you at least get a replacement for half the price--something no one else does.Okay, enough about the look and feel of these bad boys. Let's talk about how they sound.Again, I mentioned that they sound really darn nice out of the box, and even better after about 30-40 hours of burn-in. (Which I accomplished with a combination of music; white, blue, pink, and brown noise; frequency sweeps; and more music.) V-moda boasts that these lovely cans have a frequency range of 5Hz to 30kHz. The average human range of hearing is 20Hz to 20kHz--but everyone is different. Older folks usually can't hear many of the higher pitches--the "mosquito note" that younger persons can still hear. Likewise, registry of the lower ranges also varies by age and from person to person. (I myself can hear something like 16Hz to 16kHz.) What does all this mean? Well, these suckers have a very wide range of sounds they can make. And while you probably can't hear most of them, you can certainly FEEL the lower end rumbling your head if you're listening to something that uses a lot of bass--that same feeling you get at a concert that makes your whole body vibrate. It's worth mentioning that the frequency range of most Beats are 20Hz to 20kHz--average hearing range--about the same as your $30 Sony headphones.The Crossfade LPs pack some power, too. A lot of it. All of the cheaper headphones that I've had experience with have had to have been cranked up closer to 75% of the max volume on my phone for me to really enjoy the music at a volume that wasn't drowned out by the ambient world. The V-modas on the other hand, I keep right around 25%--and this is too loud, sometimes. As I've mentioned before, at 50% volume, the rest of the world is pretty much gone--and that's without an active noise cancelling system.V-moda's driver design for the LPs here are boasted to be a "dual-diaphragm," which is supposed to segregate the highs from the lows and mids, giving these headphones a more crisp, clean sound. From experience I can say that these headphones definitely have a very wide range. The lows are deep and full. The mids are clear and clean. And the highs are crisp and vivid. From the sampling I've done of several Beats headphones, I can say this is not the case for Beats. Beats sound muddy, and bass-heavy--I guess that is what they're for: bass. Don't bother using Beats in the studio, or your mix will sound way off. Several other reviewers have said that the V-modas are pretty bass-heavy, too. And they are, with no equalization, but they aren't muddy at all. Many of the reviews, however, have addendums saying that after listening to them for over 40 hours ("burn-in" if you will) they even out, and sound absolutely wonderful. And if that isn't enough, just a little EQing goes a long way, hammering out the kinks and making these sound even better. So they really aren't any more bass-heavy than they need to be. But the can certainly thump if you want them to! I listen to a little bit of everything through these guys: metal, classical, electronic, country, and even a little rap from time to time. These things are truly wonderful.So far the only con I've found with these headphones--which is not even their fault--is that lower quality recordings sound like crap. You can truly tell a difference between a high quality audio file, and a low quality one with the V-modas. But honestly, that's a good thing.Oh, and they don't fold or rotate. So wearing them around your neck or shoving them in a pocket doesn't really work out. But that's why they come with a lovely case that has a carabiner attached.And you get all of this for HALF the price of Beats headphones! (Or 1/3 of the price of you manage to snag the LPs on an Amazon special.)So, to sum everything up:PROS:-Highly durable-Lightweight-Aesthetically pleasing design-Completely customizable-Vast range of accessories, many included-High quality audio: deep bass and vivid highs-Half the price of Beats or Bose-50% discount on replacementsCONS:-You haven't heard of them before, most likely-They aren't "popular." Yet-Low quality music sounds low qualitySo if you REALLY want to spend twice as much for a product that is inferior, go right ahead. That's you're money, and your loss. But I HIGHLY recommend the V-moda Crossfade LPs. And I plan on using these until they die--and then I'll probably replace them with the same model. (I really doubt these things will die anytime soon, though.)The above is just my personal opinion based on my personal experience and taste. This is hardly written in stone. So go ahead and try a pair of these for yourself, if you ever get the chance--they deserve that, at the least.In Art,Michael

VThese things sound great, amazing bass response, good sturdy build, very durable headband.  The detachable cable is really useful for storage.  The pads are a bit stiff, but I assume that goes away over time.  I actually had to return this product because it hurt so much to wear.  I don't have a big head (I wear small helmets when snowboarding) but these things would literally crush the sides of my head, after about half an hour of use, the pain became unbearable.  I settled on some Bose AE2s which i'm very satisfied with.

VI've had these for about a week now and have been using them every day. The sound quality is phenomenal for the price paid--nice deep bass, and crisp highs. If you like to blast your music, you'll be glad to hear that you won't get any distortion if you crank it up. Not only do these sound really good, the build quality is amazing as well. To be quite honest, I thought they looked fragile in the pictures, but every time I pick them up I'm amazed at how solid they feel. I compared these with my brother's Beats Solo HD's and the difference in sound quality was not significant (maybe I just don't have the ear for it), but the Beats feel very fragile in comparison. My overall impression of these Crossfade LP's is that they produce amazing sound, they feel like they're indestructible, and they won't break the bank! Highly recommended.

VI wanted to buy headphones that were stylish and high quality. The V-moda headphones definitely met my expectations. They are super comfortable with the memory foam and they cover my ears perfectly. The sound quality is great. A little heavy on the bass and not as clear as the V-moda M80 headphones but for the price it is worth it. Also one other minor complaint is that if you wear them for a long period of time the band may start to hurt the top of your head a little. Just because of the pressure. Otherwise its flexible and you get to have two cords. One that controls volume and tracks and one cord that is super long. Its a great headphone! I've had mine for a year now and still love it!

VGreat for Extended Wear
p6110
sg5
VI have for a long time had issues with headphones being too much for me to wear for an extended period of time.  These headphones have memory foam padding that lays around the ear which appeals to me as a glasses wearer.  Most times, headphones will press on the arms of my glasses and make it uncomfortable very soon after putting them on.  With these, I could wear them for a few hours with no problem.  They do adjust, but if you have a smaller head, they may feel too big for you.  If you are the kind to push the arch back to have them around your neck, please keep in mind that the metal connection from the arch to the ear speaker might dig into your collar bone.The headphones are very attractive and if you're willing to pay for it, the plate on the earphone and the v above it are interchangeable.  I have listened to music as well as played games and taken calls with them and I have had no issues.  Since they are noise-isolating, you may have trouble hearing people speaking to you.They come with a great hard case (that comes in a stylish box) with fabric-covered cords, one with and one without a microphone and volume control (i.e. 2 cords).  They also have a 1/4 inch headphone jack adapter, which surprised me upon opening it.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase of these headphones.  For the price paid ($69.99 on Gold Box Deal), I consider these headphones to be an excellent value!

VI have only had these headphones for about three weeks, but so far I am very pleased. They look and feel very solid, not cheap at all. The sound is incredible, especially with my HTC One that has Beats Audio. I like the cable. It doesn't get as twisted and tangled as many headphone cables do.Only two concerns:They are just a bit snug for my liking. I'd say I have an average sized head. I wore them for the better part of a three hour jet ride. There is a little pressure on the head while wearing them. However, the cushions around the earpieces help with the comfort and don't leave any indentations or marks.The wires that feed out of of each earpiece into the top of the headset concern me. I've found my fingers snagging on them a couple of times while putting on or removing them. I worry that I might accidentally pull one of the wires out and ruin them.

They have enough tension to stay put on your head, but not so much that you feel your blood vessels underneath throbbing like some others I've tried.  The sound quality is superior, I previously used a set of Bose on-ear headphones (not the QC15), and these take it to a new level.  I have been consistently amazed at the intricacies of my music that I've never been able to hear before.

VGreat Cans at the Right Price
p6176
sg5
VDisclaimer: I'm not an audiophile. I'm comparing these cans with only a few other samples to work with. I'm comparing them mainly with the Sennheiser HD 598. I also use casually a few cheaper bluetooth headphones, and a few earphones.Here's the ultimate difference with the Sennheiser: The V-MODA is more based-heavy, more punchy and focused on the lower end. However, overall, the Sennheiser has a more balanced, natural sound. More neutral, more airy, fuller and richer.And yes, I understand the V-MODA is a "closed" type of headphones, while the Sennheiser is the "open" type.The V-MODA definitely looks cooler, comes with an awesome case for traveling, but is also heavier than the Sennheiser.Ultimately, I will keep both, but for different purposes. With its travel case and cool looks, it'll be my travel headphones, while my Sennheiser will be the one I use mainly at home.At $70 on sale, it was too good to pass up or to return.

VLPs are good for the money but go for the LP2s
p6188
sg5
VI planned to get the LP2s as a close friend of mine has them and lent them to me until he gave me the heads up on the one day sale for $70 for the LPs.  In a side by side comparison there is a definite difference in musical detail between the two.  The LPs sound great the LP2s are a completely different musical experience and from what I've read, the M100s are the ultimate.  From what I have read and experienced, musical accuracy and balance across the hi, mid and bass is significantly improved.  The bass in the LP seems to be a little stronger but that may be because its a little sloppy and is not as controlled as the LP2.  As another reviewer wrote, it seems like there is some kind of filter keeping the sound and the fidelity in that is on the display in the LP2.  BUT for 70 bucks (one day sale) vs 200 here and on v-moda's website, the LPs are by far the best out there.  Both have their pros and cons, I listen to my music pretty loud to feel the bass but the highs of the LP2 keep me from cranking it as the treble hurts my ears at high volume. The LPs trump ANY pair of beats I've ever heard, just sold my $300 pair for half price just to get rid of them.  Not sure if I will be returning these and for the LP2 or M100s as I'm still debating the cost difference.  LP2s normally sell for 200 while the M100s are around 300.  Hope this helps someone...
