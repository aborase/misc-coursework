VI have begun to realized that Sony headphones always seem to have the best quality sound, that rivals some of the more expensive headphones (*cough*Beats*cough*) for a relatively low cost. These headphones sound really good! The open-ear pads are so soft too that I can wear them all day without any issues, unlike I have with other headphones. Overall, great product and worth the cost!

p277

VI wish I could return these headphones, but I threw away all the packaging. They worked for about 1 day before the bent connection plug messed up. I have to hold it a certain position or no sound comes through, so I don't even bother trying to use them. I wish they would have a straight plug--that might fix this issue. There is clearly some kind of faulty wiring. I am super disappointed with this purchase--a total waste of money.

VI'm giving these 5 stars only because they do sounds very good for the echeap price. Very flat, not much bass but great for acoustical music. Comfortable on the ears and the traditional "y" cord does not transmit a lot of noise when they are bumped or rubbed up against anything. Nice portable foldable design. I have about 10 pairs of headphones and these certainly do not compare to my AKG or Bose headphones, but again, for the price they great. My only complaint... No padding on the headband does start to hurt the top of my head but I will like just glue a strip of phone to the underside and call it good.

I've had no problem with these. They're fully adjustable, lightweight, and well padded around the ears. One note: I have very small ears, and they fit me well. I'd wonder if someone with normal or large ears might have some trouble with the size of the ear pieces.

VA bit disappointed
p393
sg5
VI got these headphones because my earbuds kept slipping out of my ears, and I was disappointed to find out how much sound is heard through the headphones. I thought it would only be heard if the music was really loud, but even when it's quieter than I want, it's still easily heard. Quite annoying.

VI like to hear low soft music while typing on my desk and my office-mate hates it. I got these and I love them supper comfortable, I've been able to wear these for good 6 hours in a row and they don't bother me at all.They are not noise cancelling but this is exactly what I need; I want to hear my music but still be able to listen if somebody says my name or the phone rings.Quality wise they are not Bose quality but definitely better than my laptop's speaker. Still reasonable sound definition for the use that I'm giving to them. I listen many kinds of music (i.e. soft rock, hard rock, new age, tropical music, R&B, hip hop and others and I think that they respond fairly well to each of the genres.

VDoesn't work on my PC, probably because it has crappy 3.5mm ports that haven't been used at all during it's entire run (3-4 years or so). Works fine on mobile devices though! Use it every day going to and from school. It's an on-ears headphone, not over-ears, so your ears get hotter a tad faster. But other than that it works relatively well.

VI love these headphones! I needed to buy a pair that weren't not in the ear style because I have a hearing impairment and I use a hearing aid. I'd rather not take it out to listen to music. I didn't have a ton of money to waste on headphones, so I scoured some reviews and found these in my line of sight. I ordered them after searching 3-4 other pairs. For the price, they are well worth the money. When I am listening to Bon Iver with these I get taken away on a road trip far away. When I am watching a movie, I feel like I am in a movie theater. I seriously can't recommend these Sony headphones enough! My ONLY con with these is they don't noise cancel, so if you're in a loud atmosphere you might get some interference. Otherwise you'll be fine!

p617
sg5
VAt the time, I've researched long and hard to find a real good pair of headphones. I needed one that'll at least cover my ears and I didn't want to resort to ear buds as they seem to not be a thing for me. When I got the Sony MDRZX100, I was really happy about it! I'm still using it as I'm typing this review and listening to music at volume 80 with EQ settings to my liking. Yes, I know, loud but I like it loud and I love the sound coming from this pair of headphones! Sony's devices never failed me and I'm always confident with their products and this pair of headphones is one of them. There isn't much bass going on and you're gonna have to set your EQ (equalizer) settings to your liking if you want a little bit of bass going on. Other than that, the sound is clear, it's really good. I would buy another one but I'm looking out for over-ear headphones now because I want my ears fully covered with the sound muffs and that I want to be engulfed with music and anything else really. But if you're looking for a decent pair of headphones and you're on the budget, then this one is for you. I've had mine for two years and it's still going strong! Although, the soft plastic-ish part has worn off and now it's like a soft padding but the headphones itself still works! That's how durable these headphones are!

I like to listen to audiobooks which are quieter than music in general, so i needed headphones that were loud enough for the gym, and these are great. Also comfortable and the cord is thick and sturdy.

p914

VAfter four years of use, I have not once regretted purchasing these headphones. I agree 100% with other reviewers who say that the sound quality rivals high quality Beats and Bose models. They do indeed, and in fact surpass some of them. Don't be fooled by all the audio techs on here giving fancy stats on fancy tests they ran- for someone who just wants to listen to music or use them for general use on a laptop, you can't beat them for the price- or for four times the price for that matter.The circumstances involved in my purchasing these headphones was a quick need for a decent pair. I had wanted a new top dollar pair, but when my pair of Koss phones broke I needed a shoe-in. So I bought these. And honest to the Lord, after using these, I quit saving up. The quality was stunningly good for a $20 pair of headphones.After four years and no small amount of wear to the pads, these phones still sound as crystal clear as when I bought them. I primarily listen to classical music and some pop, and they work equally well for both genres. The sound is crystal clear and immersive with a decent amount of bass. Sometimes you might have to press them against your ear to hear something in a little better detail. Soon I will be replacing them- with another Sony pair, of course- simply due to the physical wear it's incurred thanks to my less-than-stellar care of them, but I will still use them until they quit working.

p931
sg5
VI bought this to gently demonstrate to my middle-school-age son how overpriced the $100+ Beats that he scrimped and saved for were. When this pair arrived (promptly) I had him listen to his music on them and then asked him how much he thought they cost. He guessed $60. When I told him what I paid, and what these normally cost on the electronics aisle at Walgreens (maybe $20), he asked for a pair of his own. Sounds like a made up sales pitch, but that's what he said. The price is so good, that I had trouble justifying paying the same amount for a protective case for them, so they won't get banged up in my backpack.

Vcomfortable for 3 hours
p1026
sg5
VCan be comfortably worn for about 3 hours before the ear cushioning becomes flat and starts to hurt ear cartilage. I like that the plug is L shaped, it'll last longer. I'm not an audiophile, so I don't know the terms. Some sounds are like they're happening behind you, or like you're hearing it from another room depending on the song. Outside sounds, like sounds of shrieking children while you're wearing headphones, seemed to be amplified to a piercing sound to me. Or maybe they were doing it on purpose. Kids can be turds. Anyway better sound quality than a pair of gummy earbuds. I just wish they were comfortable enough to wear for longer. Maybe I need bigger cups to surround my ears instead of placing ontop of my ears.EDIT: cheap fix for more comfortable headphones is to tuck 1~2 stretched cotton balls into the pads. I think the reason they become uncomfortable is because they are much like bean bag chairs, that is, they're loosely padded. The cotton balls help so that you don't feel what I think is a screw. Doesn't seem to affect the sound in a bad way either.EDIT 2: foam works even better than cotton. I used 22mm stuffed into each earpad.

I can hear somewhat, but would like more volume/noise canceling.  Overall, these are a decent headphone for the price.

VShoddy Knock-offs - Buyer Beware
p1157
sg5
VBecause I have a pair of GENUINE MDR-ZX100 headphones purchased from Best Buy, I'm fairly confident in stating that the two additional pairs I bought from Amazon (albeit at a too-good-to-be true price of $14 each) are shoddy knock-offs. For example, they are Chinese plastic-toy-blue and only bear the name 'Sony' with no additional information, not subtly-tasteful Sony metallic blue-gray, the ear cups are cheap smooth vinyl rather than Sony's soft 'wrinkled' vinyl, and the cord/plug is laughably flimsy.Words to my son: Amazon had better start paying attention to the growing number of Chinese gray-marketers hanging out as 'third party vendors', because, frankly, it's becoming annoying to me and, as a long-term Amazon customer, I'm increasingly shopping online elsewhere (e.g. Target).The most I can say in this case is that I got what I paid for...no more, no less.These flimsy phones do play music, and not badly at that. So I'll use them until they inevitably break...which they quickly will given the crappy cords they're equipped with...and then I'll go to Best Buy and purchase some more real ones at a higher price.

VHonestly I've had these headphones for a little over a year now and not once have I been upset with the purchase I've made. The only Issue I have with it is that when its cold out side the wire becomes rigid and doesn't want to move all to much. If that the only thing I have to deal with and I've had this for a year I would buy it again. The sound quality on this product is great, these are my go to headphones. I am so happy that I made this purchase. I will be upgrading to the ones with extra bass and a microphone and I hope that I have such a pleasurable experience with those that I've had with these.

VI should have returned these and listened to some of the reviews. One guy said they were too tight and dont fit on head right and you know what, he is absolutely right! These are terribly uncomfortable. It is like they were made for kids? I dont get it, my head is so so small, the size of a kid, I wear kids clothes and shoes sometimes even. These headphones are not comfortable at all, too tight and too small, hard plastic that doesnt give on top of my head.  I ended up buying another brand.

V2 years theyve been beat, abused and humiliated. Their response? "That all you got bro?"
p1270
sg5
VOk. So these headphones I bought them for 10 dollars on a special in amazing about 2 years ago. So I use these for everything. Gym (not recommended for cardio). Studying. Gaming. Chilling. You name it. There are NOT noise cancelling headphones. I've seen some reviews bashing on them because they don't reduce ambient noise...duh! That's not what they're for.After DSILY 2 year use is when the Earp ads are starting to flake off but guys, they have been sweat on, wet, even dropped some mashed potatoes and coffee so I will pretend that this wear and tear is not even happening.How long do I use them for? Anywhere from 15 minutes to 8 hours and you don't even feel the weight on your head.Sound quality...xD one even get me started. I've worked on studio productions with beats Solo and honestly the difference makes me cringe due to the fact that my friend payed 180 dollars more for something that has more plastic...so yeah. THEY SOUND AMAZING. the sound has never distorted at any volume.For the price, you will NOT find better headphones so do yourself a favor and don't spend more on something that won't surpass this for the next 100 dollars in difference.

VNice whole sound is heard with these headphones. But with any headphones, my ears start to hurt after about an hour because of the pressure of the headphones. Has nothing to do with how good or bad this brand is though. Still like Sony :]

VIt has been AGES since I ordered these and they still work! Wonderful headphone, recently purchased another set (sony and they are huge) just for a personal project on painting them but I still find myself using these. Fit well on any audio jack ipod, tablet, desktop, ds, psp, etc.! Very easy to adjust the headband and the cables are no issue. Comfy headphones that do not bother me after prolonged usage. Even when I have my hair up in a towel or ponytail, they adjust easy and fit perfectly. A great buy and would recommend.

VGreat Pair of Headphones

V2014 CHristo as my Grandma purchased these head phones for me, they were great till late November of this year. The earpiece eventually fell out, but for such a cheap set, they lasted pretty long. (I pretty much use these everyday and commonly tossed them around) Sound wise, they're good. I would recommend them to everyone

VI like the sound of these and isn't that what we are looking for? I like the high tones as well as the bass and these give you both. If you like a lot of deep bass, these are not for you. I didn't give them 5 stars only for comfort which is not the best. They are more elliptical than round so they stick out on the sides making you look a bit alien-like. On the other hand, they are fine for cold weather as they fit easily over a cap or soft hat.

VI say closer to 3 1/2 out of 5. Great sound for price. Comfortable. Don't fall off durning workout or jog. The reason I don't score higher is this: cord does not separate from headphones, so if it goes, you have to replace all. Also, no adjuster on the cord. Overall I'd recommend it.

VThey're ~$15. They're better than you'd expect for $15, but the sound quality isn't amazing. But they're $15.I've had these for over a year, and here's what impressed me: they're durable. I got them to replace earbuds when I run. They get sweated on, rained on, jostled for miles on end, carried around. They also got pressed into service as my primary headphones. So these things are constantly being plugged, unplugged, shoved into gym/laptop bags, etc .They look and sound just like new, so I'd say I've gotten my $15 worth.They're also very comfortable.

VSo far I am pretty impressed, I was excitedly waiting for these to show up. When they did I instantly took them out of the package and plugged them into my new phone. Started up my music, my music taste runs from soft instrumental to heavily based rap and rock. I tried out each genre, at different volume levels. To say the least, I think they are better than the 80$ headphones my boyfriend bought. Though I am sure over time I may find complications and if I do I will update this; regardless I will still update this in 3 months, 6 months and a year. Just to give you all an idea of how well this are made and what they can withstand. (Hardest thing they will endure is Minnesota Winter when I walk .7 miles to work 3-4 times a week)

p1666
sg5
VThese headphones have reasonably good sound, especially for the price, but I find them too uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The fit is tight, and the ear cups are an awkward size - too small to fit over the ears, but too large to be considered on-ear - causing a kind of pinching feeling. Also, the cords have quickly become twisted and wrinkled after limited use. They might be good for children, or as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend them for your primary set of headphones. The Koss PortaPro is still my all-time favorite bargain headphones. They cost twice as much, but they're worth it.

If they were a little bit more bigger they would have comfortably covered my ears, but right now they put pressure on my outer ear.

VThese are possibly the comfiest headphones you can get for this price. But they are also crazy tough, I can't tell think of the number of times I forgot they were on my head and accidentally yanked the cord out of my laptop. And I haven't had any issues with the wires because of my abuse.They also deliver very great sound quality, not anywhere near Beats or Turtle Beach headphones, but for less than $20 they are the best thing if you want headphones.I find the little red indicator that tells which side is the right side very handy and thoughtful too.

VI've bought these headphones in-store at Best Buy well over a year now and they work just fine. I am so used to headphones around this price messing up or not working anymore after a couple of months but these headphones actually last for a long time. I took one star of for comfort, sometimes they hurt my ears after wearing them a long time but I suppose most headphones would do that now a days.

VAmazing headphones, especially at this price range
p1743
sg5
VThe more I try using other pairs of headphones or earbuds, the more I appreciate just how good these Sony headphones are. I\u2019ve been using them several hours a day, everyday, for over a year, and they\u2019re still as great as the day I bought them. The sound is clear and crisp, and the bass is strong without any cringe-worthy distortion. Everything, including voices, sounds like it should and not like it\u2019s coming from far away or underwater. The sound is balanced, and remains so even at the loudest volume.The only two complaints I had/have are: - They were a little uncomfortable when I first got them, but they quickly relaxed (or perhaps the problem was me and I just got used to them after a short time wearing them) and now they are extremely comfortable to wear. - They could stand to be louder, as I often have to turn the volume all the way up to block out tv/movie noises, but they do fine blocking out other noise.Even with these nitpicks, I still give these 5/5 stars. They are a fantastic value for the price, and I always come back to them after trying other pairs of headphones and earbuds.

VThese are perfectly serviceable headphones, absolutely nothing wrong with them. Just don't expect too much. They're obviously not audiofile cans. I bought them for my 13 year old son, so his stupid games on his stupid tablet don't annoy me (smiley face). For that, they're perfect.BTW, when I bought them I was feeling lazy, so Amazon it was. At the time they were $29. They're not worth that much, unless you're lazy like me. You can find low budget headphones at Ross or T.J. Maxx or whatnot for roughly $15 quite easily, which is what these are probably really worth.

VGood Headphones, but tend to fall off my head
p1838
sg5
VI snagged these from my husband a few weeks ago after getting tired of my ears hurting from wearing ear buds all day while I am at work. Overall I have to say that I do like the headphones. They are comfortable, have good sound (you do need to turn the volume up some to get the same level of sound as you would with ear buds, but that is expected), and have a reasonable cable length (I would prefer a few inches longer so I can reach my desk drawer without taking them off but that is trivial).  The reason I docked a star is because I have a problem with them sliding off... every time I look down or sneeze they fall off my head. I would say that it is likely just do to the fact that I am small and have a narrow head, but it is still annoying none the less.Pros:Good sound qualityComfortableDecent cable lengthCons:Tend to slide offIf your head is a little on the narrow side I would just keep in mind that they might slide around a little bit and not fit tight to the ear

After looking at it closely, I noticed that the one that came apart was missing all of the screws, 2 per earpiece, that hold them together.  Apparently, glue may have been used to hold them together instead of screws.  The screw mounting holes are concealed behind the ear cushions and may have been a problem during manufacturing.Other than that, they have adequate quality for the average listener.

VThis  is one of the few times where I've debated on commenting about a product because what might be good for me or bad for me...may not be for others. But here I go. They're okay but I wouldn't buy again...here's why:Cons:- not that loud. I like the type of headphones or earbuds that completely block out noise going on because of how loud the music is in your ears. I'm talking..my ears are ringing after I take them off. Obviously this depends on what I'm listening to but if I'm listening to metal or rock, I don't expect to be able to hear anything. I have the neurological disorder Misophonia. Because of this, this is something that's a must and these are not very loud.- not very comfortable. They are rather small and rather uncomfortable if you're going to spend a while with them on.Pros- sleek look- do have an ability to dampen outside noise without music- cheap for on ear headphones

VFor the money this was a great purchase. I don't care for earbuds, except for short periods of time, and I use these at work and they work really well off the computer listening to music on Jango. Headphones have evolved so much over the last few decades (yes, I am old!) and these are comparable to ones that I paid a lot of money for in the early 90's. I like these so much I am ordering another pair.

VSounds are well reproduced with full bass and high trebles. I can't really add to what other reviewers have said about the sound reproduction; they have done an excellent job. My only complaint is the lack of padding on the headrest. If you have a lot of hair, it's not a problem, but I wear a short cut and it tends to press on my head a little too much. I still like them a lot.

VThese headphones make me soooooo happy. I've been cursed with mutantish, small ears and have been very uncomfortable wearing the standard ear buds. They always fall out and they don't really cancel out surrounding noise. I have a particularly shriekish and loud cubicle neighbor whose screams often drown out my music. The total ear coverment that these provide will make it possible for me to only keep on rocking it even if she's been attacked, right next to me.

VThese headphones offer decent audio quality but are not comfortable to wear. They seem to be well constructed yet are really too heavy for long term wear (an hour is a long time to wear these). They add a lot of extra pressure on the ears. You may be better off choosing cheaper, traditional-styled, on ear headphones over these.

VGreat for the price. I liked the extra bass of the Coby CV215 more, due to a 40mm Neodymium Driver where these Sony MDRZX100 only have a 30mm driver. The speaker is basically just smaller so it moves less air. The Sony is lighter feeling though, and the Coby ones I had broke after 2 years due to the fold-flat piece not being constructed for abuse of packing for travel. I also liked the longer cord of the Coby model. The Sony seems pretty solid though.

I had a similar pair of Sony headphones for 7-8 years, and they lasted for ages. Hopefully this pair lasts just as long! So far I'm enjoying them.My only complaint is that they're not that great at blocking out external noises - on a crowded bus or subway, I have to turn up my volume almost all the way to hear my music properly. But again, they're not expensive headphones, so what can you expect? They get the job done.

I made sure I plugged them in as far as I could then I could hear from both sides.  Unfortunately the second I moved my hand away, I could only hear from one side.  Also seemed cheap when I removed the protective cover from the outside of the headphones and the paint pulled off with it.

VNot great headphones. I bought 2 pairs of head phone for a long trip to Asia. A pair for me and one for my son from two different makers for about the same price, 2dollars cheaper than other set. These were the worst of the two. We hooked up to a headphone splitter and the sound quality was very poor and quiet. The other set of headphones worked much better for the same price. These did not have any of the nice features of the other set such as volume control and mute. I would not buy again.

VI've owned a pair for over three years now. I've had zero issues with them. The wires have not broken, you know how a lot of headphones can be. You get that in/out sound, because a wire has broke inside the housing, but not with these. $20 was a great deal. They fit nicely on the head and the cushion sits fine after wearing them for long periods of time.

p2585

VThis is actually my second Sony MDRZX100 headphones. I love these headphones, they're good enough for my kind of use, so I decided to buy another pair so I can keep one at home and one on the go. My first pair was a dream to use, had no issues with sound at all. This one that I bought, quality wise, was still really good. But I had an issue with the plug. The thing is, whenever I have it plugged onto something, may it be my laptop, the treadmill, or my phone, just a slight jerking movement and it unplugs itself. It got so irritating that I gave this pair away and use my old pair instead.I still give it four stars though, because the sound quality is exceptional, and because the person I gave it to doesn't have any issues with the constantly unplugging plug. I would also note that she doesn't move as much while she's on the computer, while I would stretch once in a while or reach for something that I should stand up for.

p2728
sg5
VI only have 1 very minor issue but I'm still giving the item 5 stars. My minor issue is that no matter how I adjust it, the top part of the head band piece is somewhat straight and slightly presses against the top of my head. I would have liked if there was a slight gap or more of a curve. However, not everyone may experience this so I won't remove a star for that reason. It's tolerable and does not cause a major issue, it's just a minor noticeable thing. I really like everything else about the headphones. Sound quality is great, looks nice, great for the price etc...The ear part fits snug for me, some may like that , some may not. There is enough cushion so they are comfortable. The snugness blocks out the external noise which is great. Overall, I really like them and I'm happy with my purchase. Just be sure to check the length of the wire to see if it will accommodate the distance for your particular use. I always forget to do this, so I figured I would post the reminder if anyone reads my review.

It felt like it was falling apart after 2 months and after 3 months I grabbed them and theentire headphone had broken off the headpiece.-1 star for sound being too quiet and not as great. Sound is good but not great, descent base.-1 star because they broke after 3 or so months, with a 1 year Warranty..

p2781

VI have owned about 4 of this model over the years I use them like 8 hours a day at least and they have all lasted at least 2 years, they have excellent sound quality and outside noise cancellation and are rather resistant to damage indeed on all but one of them the cord at the adapter/plug end was the first thing to go (the 2nd pair I wore off the thick ear pads first and it kept working till the cord broke) so just don't let stuff swing from it if you can help it and you should get plenty of use out of them.

VI am really happy with this purchase, which I've been using for about a month since my Beats Wireless (which I've had for 3 years) broke. I was looking for an inexpensive replacement, and wasn't really expecting much at this price, but I must say I am SO please with these headphones! The sounds quality is very similar to my old Beats at only a fraction of the cost! I wear these several hours a day at my job; they are very comfortable for prolonged use! They adjust and are easy to transport, too. I would highly recommend this product!

VI've had these for over a year & they are great for the price.

Aside from that I would recommend these to be great for travel &/or primary use.

VFabulous sound - but replace every couple years
p3088
sg5
VThe sound is really not to be beat for this price.  My last pair lasted two years with fairly hard and heavy use.  Then a wire in one side loosened, as will happen, and they needed replaced.  But for $17, replacement every two years is completely acceptable.  I use them while painting, so they have to withstand movement as well as being splashed with paint occasionally.  My only complaint is that they make a person's ears itch a bit.  Others have said the same.  Odd.

VI purchased 2 of these headphones. One red and one black. They looked comfortable and were made by Sony which is a tried and true brand that I completely trust. From my experience I trusted Sony enough to purchase this product without any hesitation. Once again Sony has proven to provide a good quality product for a very reasonable price. These headphones are comfortable and have good bass that isn't tinny at all. Definitely will purchase again. By the way, I am writing this review 18 months after purchasing these (Feb 2014) and they are still running strong. And I use them for at least 3-4 hours every day.Pros: High quality. Comfy and cushiony ear pieces. Great sound! Very light.Cons: None so far after 18 months of constant use.

p3142
sg5
VSound quality is pretty good, jack plugs in easily to my laptop.These headphones are extremely uncomfortable to use for more than a few minutes at a time. The top is hard plastic and the shape I think expects the ears to be really high up. It presses into the top of your head no matter how you adjust it, which makes watching movies or multiple episodes of a show with them extremely unpleasant. Maybe wear them with a hat.

VRather Expected Performance, But Still Somewhat Disappointed
p3268
sg5
VAn Expected DisappointmentI got these to replace a set of Sony noise canceling headphones that were about ten to fifteen years old.  The cushioning on these old ones fell apart long ago. I've been wearing them with the hard, bare plastic against my ears because I can't find some after market cushions that will fit them.  Wearing them has gotten rather painful.  I have listened to a number of headphones in the stores around my area.  Rock'n Roll strikes again!  Almost all of them has that damn distorted, pulsating so-called bass built into them.  I kind of gave up looking for headphones that would clearly reproduce the various sounds in the music. I decided to get these cheapies from Amazon.  I figured that if they were no good, I would lose only $15.  Well, when compared against my old Sony noise canceling ones, these are pathetic.  There is no separation of the instruments.  The sound is flat and dull.  I'm going to  keep them because my ears are hurting too much from my earlier pair, and these $15 jobbers are very comfortable.  Also, at this cheap price, it would cost too much to send them back.  In closing, if you are looking for any amount of clarity and separation of the sounds of the various instruments, forget these. If these cannot reproduce a halfway decent sound from an mp3 or mp4, forget using them with a quality source for your music.  But lots of luck on finding a more expensive pair that don't have that manufactured distortion that younger people think is actually bass.  In short, these are worth $15, and not a penny more.

VI'm going to give these 5 stars for a variety of reasons...  I bought these to save my sanity  because my grandson would listen to Youtube videos and they were so loud that they were giving me a headache.  With these headphones there is silence.  ahhhhBut I use them also to watch movies online. The sound is clear and I can understand what's being said. They are lightweight which is good because that means they don't fall off my head or shift if I bend over which other more expensive brands have done.They are easily adjustable, just slide to make them larger or smaller so they can fit all family members heads. They are very comfortable to wear and I forget I'm wearing them.  With them on I can't hear the phone ring and I can't hear peoples conversations around me, and I didn't even hear the neighbor mowing his lawn when I was watching a movie online. Nobody can hear whatever I'm listening to either, but I don't use them at ear splitting levels. I use them to watch movies when I'm on the computer.  I can hear the actors lines clearly, and the background music isn't overpowering.  Best of all, it drowns out the sound from the loud tv that's in a room close to my computer.  Hubby swears he's not deaf.  I beg to differ... LOL  Overall, they're a great set of inexpensive headphones.  The blue color isn't bad either.  It's a dark blue.  I'm happy with my purchase.

VGreat, Inexpensive Over-The-Ear Headphones
p3423
sg5
VI used to have an older, little bigger pair of these, but I bent the jack pretty good and couldn't use them anymore.But these are a more than adequate replacement!Only minor quibble is that they sit on the ear, instead of covering entire ear.Bottom line: if you need an inexpensive, solid set of over-the-ear headphones, get these.

VI have issues with headphones and I seem to go through a lot of them but I've had these for several months now and they are really perfect to me. The issue that I usually have with headphones is ear related. Back in April of this year I developed an ear infection that developed from wearing my gaming headset too much when gaming. Ever since that happened I've been hesitant to put anything on my ears in general but the thing is I need headphones!Now to get to why these headphones are PERFECT to me! First of all they don't hurt. I usually have issues with headphones pushing too hard on my ears. I believe that's how I got the ear infection with my gaming headset. These headphones, however, are quite comfy. There is a cushioning on the ears that makes it feel rather nice. The ear pieces are not gigantic too and I really think that helps. The headphones that have ear pieces that cover the entire ear and press on hard can make it so there's no airflow between the ear piece and ear which (I'm thinking) is the recipe for an ear infection.So yes I'm going on and on about the ear infection but it's important because I know a lot of people that have had ear trouble and with a rise of the use of technology and things being put on the ears I don't think people realize what's happening. I can not use ear buds and I hate spending a lot of money on headphones so these are awesome!Now to the sound quality! AMAZING! Wow! I'm actually listening to Strobe by Deadmau5 right now and the overall sound quality is just amazing. You really wouldn't expect this great of a quality given how cheap these headphones are but they are amazing.Lastly I just want to say that these come with a nice sturdy cord. I feel that it's thick enough to last and overall this pair of headphones is amazingly built. Just overall everything is amazing that's why I HAD to give these a 5 start rating.

VFirst of all, I recognize this is on the cheap side of headphones so obviously these headphones are not by any means, perfect. They don't really block out sound. I can definitely hear SOME background noises cut off but if i was upstairs i can hear people downstairs talking. The quality of sound is okay. They sound like normal headphones that are cheap. These are the kind of headphones that if i wear them for too long on lay on my side it hurts my head. Also, these headphones make my head look "triangular" they make my head look huge. But all in all, it's an okay headphone for just casual listening.

VI got this headphones a couple of months ago and since then they've become my most used ones. These headphones are incredibly good. The sound is completely comparable with a highly priced pair of headphones. The bass is good. The sound isolation is not good tho since I can still hear noise around me when I use them, but is barely needed compared to the quality of the sound when playing music. I could notice sounds and instruments in songs that I've never noticed before with other headphones. And these are really good to watch movies.They are compatible with every music/sound device that I own like my laptop, phone, mp3 player and radio.The design is very comfortable and the quality of the material is acceptable. I like the way you can easily fold them to make them fit in your backpack or in a pouch for protection. As soon as I opened the box I put them in my head and I could notice that they are very strong and thanks to the material they are made of they adjust to your head very easily. I like how firm these are after a couple of hours wearing them while doing chores they still in place. They feel as equally comfortable around your neck as in your head.The quality of the cable is very good and it's made with a very strong material which is always one of the specs I look the most when buying headphones. You won't need to worry about them breaking only about the tangles. I do not like the "L" shape jack because I can't connect them on my cellphone while it has a cover on and I think these would be way better with a mic added.But overall they are really good and you definitely get more than what you pay for.

VThe cord is a bit short, but still a five-star rating because the fit is comfortable and these are good over-the-head headphones for the price. The position of the over-ear piece (I'm sure this has a name but I don't know it) is somewhat flexible, which provides a comfortable fit, and that this same piece folds down flat makes the headphones pack nicely.The padding is just right, and while these aren't noise-canceling, they do keep most extraneous noise out, even with music, etc., played at low-moderate volume.

VIf you like listening to things through tiny speakers attached to your head, this is a good pair of headphones for you. They're low priced, but get the job done. They're not very comfortable, and in a quiet room, a lot of that sound skills out, even at modest volumes. But hey, they were $16, so... ¯\u005c_(\u30c4)_/¯If you get you get your feels from music, and treasure the larger range of audible frequencies....maybe u wanna keep looking. I went from Bose QC15 noise canceling to these, so my ear was used to better. Overall, not bad though.

VI was given this model of Sony headphones for Christmas several years ago.  I only use them at my computer (BIG Pandora fan).  The sound is excellent!!  The only thing is that the right-angle plug-in has taken a beating due to my reaching for things.  The sound quality reviews for this model are much better than the replacement Sony MDRZX110AP ZX Series Extra Bass Smartphone Headset with Mic so I decided to buy a replacement while they're still available.  I will be using a 3-ft extension cable with the new headphones.

VGreat quality headphones! Using this product for 4 months now, and I can say that these are durable, stylish, and compact. These, so far, are my "go to" headphones when I travel. In fact, I've showcased this product to my audience, and now I see teenagers (on a budget) buying these. Thankfully, these come in different colors, and the quality of the music is crisp. One thing that I would like to fix, is the amount of Bass this set has. But besides that, these should be added to your cart or at least your wishlist for now.

VI was thinking  about spending around a hundred bucks on a set of headphones, because I was doing  some work on my computer where the sound reproduction was fairly important.  The earbuds I had just weren't cutting it.  And my previous headphones had a cord ripped out a couple months ago.  Sony was not on the list I was considering.  But I couldn't make up my mind between the Sennheisers, Audio-Technicas, and Shures, though I was leaning towards the Shures, having had an excellent pair previously.  While I was reading specs and reviews, I noticed these, and they had four and a half stars, and cost $16.  I figured, that's less than the difference in price between the ones I was looking at, so what the heck?  I always need a pair of decent ones for when I'm doing stuff outside, and I can't afford to use a hundred dollar pair that might get destroyed like the last ones.  The impedance is only 24 ohms, so they'll be plenty loud (32 ohms is fairly standard these days, which gives you less volume.  The lower the ohms, the higher the volume for the same amount of voltage.)  The frequency response is listed as 12-22,000 Hz.  Most cheap headphones and earbuds list 20-20,000 Hz, which is about the range of human hearing, and that is usually an exaggeration on their part.  In any case, the Sony MDRZX100s, while certainly not as good as the expensive Shures I  used to have, are a great buy for the money.  The sound is clear enough for what I needed, and while I still look forward to getting some audiophile phones, I am in no hurry anymore.  These are very adequate.  I would have preferred a longer cord (this is about 4 feet).  They are lightweight and very comfortable on my head for hours at a time, and right and left are clearly marked.  By the way, you will likely do less damage to your hearing using headphones than earbuds.  People tend to listen to speakers at a lower volume, measured in the ear canal, than headphones, and to earbuds loudest of all.

VThese headphones are budget friendly. Sounds decent, high, mid, and lows. Especially with equalizer application on android such as viper4android but requires root access. After an hour of wearing the headphones my ears start to have pain. I've had then over a year and I'm ready for an up grade. Would b a 4 star if they weren't uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses

VI've had two pairs of these for years now; I use them a lot in the office.  I've beaten the heck out of these things; sometimes throwing them in a stuffed purse, etc., and yet they still look good and function perfectly.  Super durable with no flimsiness.  The sound is quite good even on a crowded airplane; the padding around the ears is very comfortable, but also hasn't peeled or frayed.  After all of this time, these still look and work like new.  They are pretty light, but the padding blocks out some of the outside noise, which is awesome if you're trying to listen to quieter music without the additional sound of your co-workers in the background. :)

VSimple,basic, good sounding headphones.  They're nicely padded, fit well over my ears.  You won't get the noise canceling or clarity of an earbud, but you're not supposed to.  The cord is thicker than most headphone cords, they seem better made and higher quality than other in their price range.  These headphones won't blow you away, but they don't claim to be a $100 or $200 dollar headphone.  They simply do what they're supposed to do.

VOn my quest of searching for cheap but quality headphones, I always come back to this one.  For around $10 headphones this is still on top.  If you like heavy bass these aren't for you.  Some newer headphones can push heavier bass, but ZX100 is most balanced in my opinion.  They are also light weight and comfortable.  I can use them 4 to 6 hours and not feel tired.Still these are ten bucks, no way these can compete with more expensive headphones.  But if you want to spend some where under $30, might want to give these a try.  If used on a computer with equalizer, these can improve.

VNot the most comfortable and definitely not for audiophiles, but they get the job done and are great for the price.  I would not recommend them for music production or serious listening, but they are great at work or somewhere where you just need something that is functional and you do not have to worry about them being stolen as they can be replaced easily.

VOne of my favorite purchases on Amazon. I have had the worst luck with earphones, so I finally switched to headphones but did not want to make the commitment of paying a large sum for it. I tried these "economy" headphones, and WOW, there is no need to buy $200-400 dollar headphones, these work perfectly fine. Unless you are really looking for DJ quality, sound-proof headphones, try these out, I doubt you will be disappointed.

Veverything is perfect except for the soft fabric inside, on top of the speakers. it easily collects white strings of lint or dust, something and is hard to clean and ruins the soft felt-ish fabric when I pick out the dust. other than that, it adjusts sizes well, great quality sound, color is still going strong for years use, cushions are comfortable. perfect on every level except the inside felt fabric. price is worth it and pretty cheap, shipping was great

VA lot of bang for the buck -- low price but good value. Great headphone sound, block noise enough so that I can get work done, very comfortable to wear, and I love the blue color. The earpads rotate so it is more compact. This is a terrific value in every way. I actually bought a pair of these a year ago and have gotten a lot of use out of them-- I bring them to work in my bag and wear them on walks, to cut down on background noise, and for motivation boosts. I like them so much I just got a pair for my daughter!  No, they will not stand up to a side by side comparison to a pair of Bose, but it definitely outshines any other pair in the under $25 bracket.

p4611

VOne of the best and most reliable headphones in their price range. I have purchased two pairs now in the last few years, with careful use these can easily last you over a year. With somewhat rough usage, these headphones can withstand a fair bit of wear and tear before damage becomes visible. The sound quality is some of the best I have experienced with headphones under $20, you can get a fair bit of bass and easily enough volume to block out the noise around you without blowing out your ears.

VI bought these for my wife who types transcripts.The only complaint that she had was that they were very hot when in use for any extended period of time.If I had known about this condition , I might have opted for "monitors" with some sort of circulation feature which might have eliminated theproblem.

VThe Iron Man of cheap headphones
p4874
sg5
VWow, great quality for the price. I have 10 pairs of these headphones (half in black and half in white) and I am incredibly impressed. Not only is the sound quality excellent (again, not compared to Sennheiser or other premium brands), but they are also amazingly durable.The headphones I bought are primarily used by younger children. Daily, they are dropped, twisted, stepped on, wrapped badly, played too loud, and spilled upon. Yet even after 6 months of daily abuse, I have not had to replace a single pair. So either I am incredibly lucky, or these Sony headphones really pass the test.

VSounds great but a bit uncomfortable
p5221
sg5
VFirst of all, I would like to say that this was a great buy. I am on public transportation for around 4 hours a day and this muffles enough noise to where I can hear the music at 50% volume (which does not work well with Apple headphones). The music sounds very clear and the sound quality is great. The one con I've noticed so far is that it is not very comfortable for long-time use. I'd say if you listen to music for short periods of time it won't be a problem, but if you wear them for hours on end like me it might be uncomfortable after an hour or two. Still, I think these are probably the best headphones on a small budget.A small update: It's been almost three months since I purchased these headphones and one side has already stopped working. It was bound to happen one day but I was expecting a longer life time from the rest of these reviews.

VThe Sony MDRZX100 ZX series (white) failed after 3 days of use. The one I received through Amazon is white with the L-Shaped AUX plug. This plug section is poorly designed and requires you to hold and push the plug so both earphone speakers will work. The design on this unit I purchased is seriously flawed. I have no patience with Amazon as this is my 3rd time trying to buy a decent headphone for my 8 year old daughter. 3 times the failure with 3 different vendors.

I just needed a decent pair of headphones at a great price and these exceed my expectations.  Great sound, doesn't feel cheap, they fold up easily and fit into the smallest side zipper pouch of my laptop case.  I've had these for at least 3 or 4 months now with no complaints.  It matches my white Sony Vaio too which is a plus.

I suspect the primary seller for these is just making knock-offs. Shipping took a month since it came directly from China.

VYou want cheap, you get cheap, and these are cheap.  They're flimsy as can be.  I do like how the ears rotate and swivel, but I feel like they're going to break every time I swivel them.  The sound is ok...when it works.  The wire and connector are super cheap, so when either moves even slightly, the sound crackles.  It makes these headphones useless to wear when you're on the move.  When you're sitting still, though, they sound ok.Honestly, spend a little more money and get a nicer pair of headphones.  There are plenty of good options for just a few bucks more.

VKeep in mind that I'm not an expert in headphones \u2013 I love music and listen to it everyday, but I'm not exactly an audiophile or especially focused on quality. My grandma bought these for me about two to three years ago, and they've been fantastic. They're affordable and they sound good. You can wear them for a long time without getting a headache (also note that I have a big head and a lot of hair so this tends to be a problem for me). They're not the most stylish, and I've worn more comfortable headphones, but they're so great for the price. There are really no cons to them. The reason I had to "retire" them is just because the ear pads started to peel and flake, which is normal and bound to happen to any pair at some point. They look pretty busted now. But they still sound okay, so I'm really only replacing them (after two or three years!) for visuals and just to have something new, and that's not so bad when you look at the price. They're worth it.If you want some comparisons: I've found that the cheap white Targus headphones are more comfortable on the head (but they literally lasted a couple of days before they broke), those $100-something Sennheiser's don't sound much better and give me a headache after long wear (but do more in terms of noise cancelling), and Beats are more comfortable and noise-canceling but cannot be bought with a $20 bill.

VI don't know what I was supposed to be expecting, but these are some of the worst headphones I've ever used. The audio quality is really poor - worse than earbuds - and after a while I started getting a headache. And they aren't noise-canceling in the slightest. Weirdly, mine came in packaging with Chinese labeling, making me wonder if I'd received a bootleg or knockoff of some sort. In any case, I was anything but satisfied by these headphones.

VGreat bass sound. Very lightweight and comfortable on ears. Cord is short, maybe 3-4 ft.,so if you want headphones with longer cord, these are not what you want unless you have an extender cord. I always buy Sony brand because it works and these are put together very nicely, should see them last 5-6 years.

VI bought for my son to use during the time he watches the IPAD but it didn't last long enough. Very disappointed with Sony I thought it would be a great product but instead it worked fine for a few months and then out of the blue it just didn't allow sound to filter through. It lasted less than a year. Not recommend this to anyone!

VI was a bit disappointed I had a pair of the MDRZX100 and wanted another pair since my first messed up. I waited about a month to get these which is my own fault for getting the free shipping. The headphones which where shown in the photos are not the ones that I received, instead I got some knockoff which are not to bad for sound quality but are extremely uncomfortable I should have just paid 3 more dollars and gotten the real thing at Ross.

VToo Cheap
p5677

VI am not an audiophile by any means, but I have grown tired of earbuds. They have poor sound quality, and hurt to wear. I ordered the Sony MDR because of the many great reviews. My brother had a similar set of Sony headphones (I can't remember if they were MDR) and I loved them. The sound quality is great, but the build quality of this set is awful. The plastic is too thin, and the entire unit is flimsy.  The paint on the Sony emblem is already partly worn off on both sides. Furthermore, the audio cable is pathetical short (approximately 4ft). It barely reaches from my laptop to my head, and it goes straight over my keyboard to do so. The headphones themselves are comfortable on your ears, but the part that rests on your head is not. I should have spent the extra money to purchase headphones in which the audio cable only protrudes from one headphone. They are more comfortable and make cable management easier. Overall, these headphones are a waste of money.

p5927

VThese headphones have good sound but it feels really brittle and cheap when you handle them. When the top of the headphones make contact with your head for long periods of time it starts to hurt so I had to wear a beanie whenever I wore these. After two days of having them the right side of the headphones stopped working. If your going to buy these take care of them, if you don't then it will definitely break. I would not recommend traveling with these. This is a pair of headphones you want to keep at home.

VI bought these headphones as refurbished. When I received them they were in new-like condition. The cord is around 4 ft. in length but it is not bulky. The ear padding is good and very comfortable ( except if you wear glasses, they will push your ears into the frame which may cause discomfort but just take them off and you will be fine).I am not an expert on headphones, these are my first over-ear headphones but the sound quality surpasses any previous headphones that I have owned! On top of all that, the price is extremely fair! I could see this going for $30USD but I bought them for $10.49 refurbished from a well trusted company on here. I would recommend buying refurbished for those looking to save money, this was my first refurbished purchase and I will now do more refurbished purchases!

VThese headphones really are not great. Normally I just use the JVC Gumy earbuds (which are AWESOME and only cost 8 bucks. Seriously they are the best sounding earbuds I have ever used. The sound is very rich and amazing), but I was at target and they didn't have Gumy. So I decided to try these sony's. When I got in the car and plugged them into my smartphone, needless to say the sound was terrible. When you listen to music with them, plenty of the tones are missing. The sound is very low, and they amplify the bass to the extreme.These really are not worth it at all. I may return the,
