VGreat noise cancelling headphones
p26
sg5
VI was looking for a good pair of noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones. I've had a pair of Sony mdr nc7, nc8 and nakamichi nc40 (which I really liked but broke at a joint). So when I tried the Bose quietcomfort 25 I was very impressed with their noise cancelling! But no Bluetooth. I tried Bose Bluetooth headphones and was very impressed with sound and comfort but no noise cancelling. I heard Bose was working on putting both together but no date was set.What to do? Then I came across some used Bose Quietcomfort 15 headphones at a price I couldn't say no to!Very very comfortable and I love there sound. Build is decent but I also don't throw my headphones around and they stay in the case when they are not being used. The case is thin and tallish, easy to put in a briefcase. They are big enough for extra batteries, cords, adapters.I like having a removable cable and these have them but they are proprietary which I hate. Another negative is no battery, no sound. I consider this a big negative. This was fixed with the 25s.But wait - no Bluetooth!I was so impressed with the sound, the comfort and the price I just said, oh well. Then I discovered the BTunes Bluetooth headphone adapter. Works great. I'm all set now.I really enjoy these headphones. The sound is great, nicely balanced. The noise cancellation is the best available. Not the science fiction cone of silence but significantly lowers background noise mostly in the low range.I highly recommend these headphones. If they are close in price to the 25s I would get those headphones instead.

VBose QC15 vs ATH-ANC9 vs ATH-ANC7b - For once cheapest is best!
p31
sg5
VI got a pair of ANC7s, ANC9s, and Bose QC15s to compare. In my opinion the ANC7 is the best choice, and the cheapest too.The ANC9s are definitely more comfortable than the ANC7s, but in every other respect I like the ANC7s more. I found the ANC9s were not silent; there was a noticeable hiss when they were but no music was playing. In addition I found that the three modes that the ANC9 has did not make any discernible difference, so I prefer the simplicity of the ANC7s.I struggled at first to get the battery in the ANC9s. IMO they have a poorly designed battery holder which could get lost as it pulls out completely from the headphones; the ANC7 have a simpler and IMO better design where the headphone is simply rotated to expose the battery.I work in an open plan office with a fairly loud air conditioning system. When I turn the ANC7s on I get silence, unless someone is talking. Conversation is muted. The air conditioner noise is eliminated. What amazes me is when I take them off and I realize just how much noise the AC makes; you don't really get it because its a mostly white noise but it really is pretty loud. I can wear them for hours with no problem; I wouldn't say there is no discomfort (ANC9s win there) but they are better than most other headphones I have tried. In contrast, as I say, then ANC9s are *not* silent; they hiss, which is really annoying. I didn't feel the ANC9s were any better at noise cancellation than the ANC7s (the 9's are supposed to be 95% effective vs 90% for the 7's).The ANC9s seemed to have a slightly bigger and heavier case than the 7's, and are themselves heavier.I did not get to use the inline mic and volume controls of the ANC9s, which is a feature the 7's do not have. However, this is really just a feature of the cable, not the headphones; you could buy a third party cable for the 7's to enable the same feature.I also had a pair of Bose QC15s for a few days to try. They were even more comfortable (physically) than the ATs but of course quite a bit more expensive. They also didn't work for music unless turned on; the ATs do (but with some degradation in sound quality). The Bose headphones seemed flimsier. But the main problem with the Bose's is that they made my ears feel like they were suffering from a serious pressure equalization problem. Possibly a remnant from scuba diving days but my ears can be sensitive to this; I couldn't wear the Bose headphones for more than a few minutes without starting to feel pretty awful. I kept trying to equalize by pinching my nose and sucking/blowing but it didn't help; these suckers hurt and give me nausea.So in summary, very happy with the ANC7s - for the price these are fantastic. The ANC9s would be my second choice. The Bose are great if your ears can handle them (I can't) and if you don't mind running on battery all the time.

VNoise cancellation very bad, sound incomparable with Sennheiser and batteries don't last.
p89
sg5
VHello!I review this because I wanted to inform other users about the scope of the "noise-cancellation".NOISE CANCELLATIONHonestly, the noise cancellation doesn't justify the price for me.It will never cancel out people talking (high frequencies, low frequencies, people snoring). I haven't found any situation where it does that. What it does though is cancelling the ambient noise, making you feel like underwater, with still some crisp white noise coming to your ears, which I found to be discomforting.CASE, HOLDAnd sadly, nothing else justifies the price. The case, hold and feel are not particularly good.SOUNDEspecially the sound is just light-years away from the satisfaction you get from a Sennheiser.BATTERIESI actually thought they broke, which would have been good news, but it was just the AAA that had worn off. After 2 months of "non-use" (and before I had used them for 2 hours maybe).Sadly, just changing batteries did the trick. But this points out how you just cannot use those headphones without batteries, and how they run out of juice rather fast. Of course, I was not handling the headphones well by forgetting the batteries in them.I would love to have my money back for this, but as I won't, I could maybe tell you not to buy them. If they cost 150$ less, maybe.Friendly greetings,Lionel

VBest All Around Headphones Ever!
p106
sg5
VI've had these for just over a year and a half now and use them daily, and when I say daily, I mean at the very least once but on avg. 2-3 times for an hour or so. They are fantastic! I highly recommend buying them from Costco if you feel that they might fall apart like some other reviewers have said/shown. I personally have not had a single problem other than replacing batteries due to excessive use. ; )I'm no audio junkie, I couldn't tell you the exact Hrz that the bass feels like it's hitting at or the exact amount of OHMs. But what I can tell you is that I'm pretty picky about headphones and their quality of sound. If you only listen to music and nothing else, these are still good for you, but yes there are better. If you're like me and do a lot of everything, music, movies, tv, phone etc\u2026 then these are really good all around headphones.PROS: Excellent sound quality, rich full bass, extremely comfortable over my ears, easy to use, nice case to carry it in, well madeCONS: Some wind noise interference from strong winds.

ASK before you buy, what issues they have then might tell you!That was my 3rd one, the others had similar issues....very little use & they did not last. They want you to keep trading it in to buy yet another one. Better off renting one for the constant cost.

VThe sound of this headphones is great and the battery consumption is acceptable
p133
sg5
VThe sound of this headphones is great and the battery consumption is acceptable, however the quality of the materials and finishing is just terrible. After just about a year of normal use, which is about 1 hour every other day (or about 4 to 6 hours a week) the coating in the headband pad and ear pads started to peel off. This is just a cheap leather imitation with very poor durability. I am attaching two pictures as proof.Something similar with the cables, the plastic coating is ridiculously thin, which means poor durability in normal conditions of use. The cable with the remote control for IOS devices broke near the remote after just 5 months of normal use. Never was this cable pulled hard or anything like that.In comparison I own a pair of senheisser's HD 555 that I bought in 2005!!! and the earpads as well as the headband pad are in very good condition considering they have been under heavy use for the past 16 years!!!  They are a bit worn off but by no means peeled like the Bose QC15 and those are the ones that I use heavily for watching movies and TV series when my son and wife are asleep late at night. The cable of the HD 555 is thick and design for heavy use and to last.I wouldn't recommend the QC15, like I said sound is great but they quality is terribly poor. Off course Bose would blame the peeling of the headband pad and ear pad coating on use, but this is no excuse. For headphones this price I would expect them to last, like my beloved HD555.Finally I would like to mention that the Bose do look quite fragile at first sight, and that is why I always kept them in the carrying case that was included in the box. However this did not prevent the coating in the headband pad and ear pads from peeling off. On the other hand the HD555 didn't come with a carrying case and I always carried them in my laptop case in lots of traveling while working as onsite engineer and like I said they are still in much better condition than the QC15.I definitely wouldn't buy Bose anymore. Quality is too poor and the hype about their products is most likely due the excellent public relations department and billions spent in advertisement.

They seem to be made to cancel out white noise from airplanes vs. insert white noise to cancel out nearby conversations.  The sound quality for music is very good.  I've already had to replace the cord used for iPhone's that includes a microphone; my mic stopped working.  It's been an expensive experience.

VI have owned these since 2011.  Before you read another review, this is what you want to know.  Are these noise canceling, yes.  If someone next to me is talking while I am wearing these, will I hear them, yes.  How is the music quality, wonderful for you novice and intermidate audiophile.  How durable are these head phones, don't drop them, don't bang them around, don't immerse them in water.  I have treated these like these were super valuable and they have lasted 3 years of college abuse.  If you want the best ( yes I said it) passive noise canceling headphones, buy these.  The only other substitute is in-ear plugs with over ear hearing protection. Clean these with a soft cloth everyonce in awhile, if you feel your ears getting sweaty then take the headphones off and take a break.  The only issue I have ever had is if I don't them off for 15 or 30 seconds once every 30 to 45 minuets I will here a very slight different noise canceling sound ( which is clearly distinguishable when you been listening to the same noise).

VI've had these headphones for about 5-years now.  In that time I've had to replace the ear pads once (a simple and affordable chore with aftermarket parts) and I would like to replace the padding on the top of the headphones but I don't think that's possible.  The top of the headphones has been worn away so much that when I take off the headphones there are little black flecks of material left on my head.  It's more of an ascetic irritation and does not impact how well they work or how comfortable they are to wear.  I do love these things.  They are light as air, deliver great sound, and do what they are supposed to do which is cancel out annoying environmental sounds.  I originally purchased the Q15's so I could survive the terrible sounds of my neighbor running his gang of 4-wheel ATV's 24/7 (we did not know it would be like that when we bought our little piece of heaven out in the country).  After we moved (in an effort to regain a less stressful life) I began using the headphones daily to drown out city sounds while I wrote.  I love them for that as they work perfectly...almost too perfectly because there are times when my wife will be talking to me and I won't even know she's in the room because of the wonderful quiet offered by the headphones.  I highly recommend these with my only reservation being the cost.  I wish they would go on sale because I would get another pair as in case of zombie apocalypse!

What can't Bose make headphone yoke more telescopic to avoid the unwanted space?

VI have been using the QC 15 for over 2 years, buy only periodically.  Sometimes at work the noise level gets too much, so I use them to listen to streaming music.  I can still hear the guy next to me, even with the music cranked so loud that it hurts, and he doesn't talk abnormally loud.  The NR isn't as good as advertised.Also, after minimal usage the foam inserts have started to deteriorate, and don't stay attached; they fall out every time I remove the headset.I think they are way overpriced for the cheap quality of the product.

VI have had these for about two years now and they have really come in handy for myself and my wife.  They really do cancel out most background noise.  Great for long plane trips, vacuuming the floor, putting the other person's TV show off your radar as you browse the web, etc.  Pretty conspicuous for use in public places but when you have to have a break from what is happening with sound around you, these headphones work.  Sound quality for music is fine, as expected from Bose.

VAmazing headphones. Still doing great after 2 years
p277
sg5
VI have used these headphones almost on a daily basis for the past 2 years and they still work great. The ear pads are just now starting to wear down, and that's after very rigorous use. I would recommend these to anyone. I use them for listening to music or tv shows on my laptop, talking on the phone, listening to audiobooks, and playing videogames with friends. I can hear a lot more detail in games when I have these headphones on than through tv speakers. Also the included microphone cable works on a ps4 controller for party chats and in game chat. The buttons don't do anything on the ps4 but the mic works. The volume buttons don't work on my Samsung Galaxy S5, but the middle button works to play/pause music and audiobooks, and answer/end calls. There is a switch on the end of the cable that plugs into the headphones to make the input loud or quieter, which is great when plugging into something that won't turn down low enough to not still be extremely loud (like my old cd player)

VBose QC 15 headset quickly falls apart
p289
sg5
VWhy did I pay a first world price for Third world quality.  These are a joke.  First I had to replace the cable that goes from the headphones to the computer or smart phone twice.  Then the material on the headband started peeling off.  Now the material the enclosed the ear cups is splitting.  I have owned 3 sets of Bose QC headphones.  One would think the quality would improve as they roll out newer models but that is not the case.  In addition to the headphones falling apart the case that comes with them is flimsy and poorly designed  Fortunately I kept the original case which had pockets for batteries and is well made.Reading other reviews people explain how to order new ear cups to replace cups that are disintegrating.  Why should  I pay $35 for something when the original product was so poorly made.  I think Bose should replace these. IIn any case if they do not get on top of their quality issues they will no longer have the reputation for good products they have enjoyed in the past.

I bent my first one accidentally but got it replace easily.I'd gladly pay double for something this high quality. I hope the new edition lives up to this ones reputation.

VNoise cancelling is great, audio quality is good, replacement ear pads are expensive
p311
sg5
VThe headphones are great. The sound quality is not audiophile quality but it is good. The noise cancelling however, is fantastic. These work great with just the single AAA battery. Just don't forget to turn them off after using. (I forget every now and then.) If you're planing on using these occasionally or for a flight for vacation then you will love the noise cancelling. However, if you use these every day like I do, then a word of warning. I've already had to replace the ear pads early this year, and now once again have to replace them. Not a big deal, right. Well, not so much. The original replacement ear pads from Bose will cost you $35 plus tax and shipping (if charged). Having to replace them twice a year is spending over $70 after you originally spent $300 on for the headphones themselves. The pads are also ridiculously difficult to replace. Not sure why the clip system isn't simpler. Anyway, depending on how you use these, they may be the best choice or a good choice.

VPremium Comfort, Exceptional Noise Cancelling Functionality, and Reliable Durability
p329
sg5
VAs a college student who spends a lot of time studying, I was looking for a comfortable, well-functioning, and durable pair of noise reduction headphones that would not skimp on sound quality or break the bank. After trying several other brands, I bought the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones. I have now owned the QuietComfort 15 for over a year and have been very impressed with the comfort, noise reduction quality, and durability that these headphones have.One of the most important qualities of a good pair of headphones is comfort; two crucial components of comfort are padding and breathability. The Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones have padded leather ear cushions and a padded leather headset that together make the headphones very comfortable to wear and helps create a seal from outside noise; however, it does make wearing the headset for more than an hour at a time hard because the lack of air flow makes your ears hot and sweaty. This easily can be avoided though by simply taking the headphones off every hour to let them air out.Another important category is how well the noise cancelling functions. With just the noise cancelling feature on, most of the outside noise is cut out with only some sounds penetrating in. If light music is played in addition to the noise cancelling feature, almost all of the outside noise disappears. In addition, many noise reduction headphones produce poor quality sound but that is not the case with the Bose QuietComfort 15; both the sound quality and the noise reduction capacity are exceptional. Being a college student who often studies in loud areas, I could not imagine studying without them.One last category to consider is durability. Although the headphones are reasonably priced, they still are an investment and before buying them it is smart to make sure they will be able to withstand everyday use. The headphones are made of a thick plastic that creates great support but is also lightweight enough to not be a pain to wear. The earpiece joints are well braced and the leather is of high quality so that tears are unlikely. They come with a carrying case to help prevent damage when they are not in use and have a one year warranty to protect against malfunctions. I have used the headphones for several hours every day and they have not started to show any wear at all, resulting in me being greatly pleased with how well they have held up.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort 15 Acoustic Noise Reduction headphones deserve a 5 out 5 star rating for its premium comfort, exceptional noise cancelling functionality, and reliable durability. If you are looking for a great noise reduction headphone, I highly recommend giving these a try.

p335
sg5
VI will acknowledge most of my disappointment may be due to ignorance of the product.  I was desperate for headphones that would keep out sound, to protect me from the rude people at work.  I guess I did not research well-enough what "noise cancelling" means.  When I got them and put them on, I could still hear everything around me, but the sound had a different quality.  Due to laziness, I did not return in time so I had to keep them, and have made them work, by plugging in to computer and playing Pink noise.  At a high enough level all the idiots around me are drowned out.  But I would much rather have silence than static.  $2.99 safety earplugs work great to drown out all co-worker rudeness, and you can move around your workstation instead of being tethered to the CPU by these Bose headphones, but the safety earplugs are very painful.  Life sucks.

VA dream come true
p359

VI always wanted to travel the world. When I bought these headphones, which I saw were designed for airplanes, I always imagined myself on a plane going to some exotic place. I never had the means to go anywhere, nor did I have anyone to go with. Once I had enough money, I still didn't go - I couldn't go with anyone, I had to work, and I was also afraid of flying. However, years after I bought the headphones, an opportunity arose for me to go with my sister to Spain. After wanting to go my entire life, I faced my fear of flying, and I got on the airplane. When it took off, I put on these headphones and I felt like those people in the advertisements who wore these headphones and relaxed on the plane. I was finally able to do what I always wanted to do, and I was able to wear these headphones as I did, like I always imagined I would.+Sound quality is amazing+Noise cancelling works perfectly and sometimes I don't hear when people are talking to me-Requires a lot of battery chaning

p376
sg5
VMy friends always talk about the poor construction quality of these and how they have to by extended warranties to deal with it, so I've never thought much about them.  But I do have the 20i in-ear version, and I'm very happy with them, so when Costco started selling the 15, I decided to give it a shot.  If it breaks in 6 months, Costco will stand by it even if Bose doesn't.  Looks like I won't be waiting 6 months to return them, because the sound is garbage.  I've tried a variety of audio sources, and I never get anything resembling bass.It's so bad that I cannot believe my headphones are anything but defective, so I've been trying for a week to contact Bose customer support to see if I've missed a "Suck/Don't Suck" toggle somewhere.  Good luck with that.  It's normal business hours, but there's never anyone in the phone support center, and chat is perpetually disabled.  Now when I call I get a message that the entire company is closed for "departmental meetings".  It suggests to call back "later".  What is "later"?  5 minutes?  5 months?  What is up with this company?  And if it's so closed to its customers, who's out there taking pictures of Darelle Revis and Russell Wilson?  Maybe they could use some of that money they pay celebrities to pretend to use their products and pay someone to answer the phone or login to chat.When you buy this product, you accept that it will likely break the day after your warranty runs out.  Bose products often work well for a while but have such shoddy materials and construction that you can expect failure.  You know this going in and you takes your chances.  What I didn't expect was that the product would be such garbage right out of the box.

VThis is the first bose product I bought.  It broke within a year.  Not being a very smart man, I purchased 2 more bose products and they similarly failed within a year.  So how did this one kick the bucket?  Well it turns out most bose products are held together by superglue, tape, and wishful thinking.  This thing took a fall from my standing desk once, and the plastic part that swivels snapped apart.  This is unsurprising because there is a very tiny amount of surface area for the component that attaches the speaker to the rest of the headset.  Add the fact that the component can turn and swivel, and you've got a bomb waiting to explode.  I wouldn't recommend buying a bose product unless you are willing to apply superglue to fix it after it breaks.  For this product specifically, you might choose to superglue it to your head instead, to minimize stress on the moving parts.

For one, it is lighter than the Beats, The battery is lasting way longer . Since it is lightweight, able to wear longer than the other one. As for as Noise Cancelling and sound clarity , both were good.

They still work great, still sound good (I don't listen to music on headphones at home very often, and I'm no Audiophile) but when it counts, music/movies while traveling. You can't beat them. I haven't tried any other Noise canceling headphones. But have read many a review before I got these for my wife. (And she like beats! Has a regular Pink set) the noise canceling on the Bose is just amazing, takes you away from droning, the humming, and let's me feel relaxed while their on.

However, for other noises, i,e, voice conversions, music (at normal volume levels) Bose QC-15 does not meet my expectations at all - very poor in my opinion.  For benefits received, I believe the unit is way over priced and over hiped.  My experience was very poor and I am returning the product for a refund.

VThey did a fine job of noise cancelling
p547
sg5
VGenerally, I was very excited to get these headphones.  They did a fine job of noise cancelling. I bought them mainly for road trips with the family where I needed to take phone calls for work.  They worked well for this purpose!  They really quieted out the road noise and minimal chatter in the car.However, as I've read several of the reviews, apparently some "sensitive" people can get headaches, nausea, or vertigo.  Though I would have never considered myself "sensitive" (I don't get carsick, seasick or any sort of vertigo), I did find that I quickly get a sort of tension headache.  Oddly, I imagine more people probably experience this than they realize. The sensation is the type you get while flying sometimes if your ears won't pop. As many people use these for flying, they may just think the discomfort is from the flight.That said, I would say that you CAN discover this in the store if you use them for 10 minutes. It really doesn't take long to start to feel the discomfort.  Apparently, many folks aren't susceptible to this, and for those folks, I'm sure this is a fine headset.  I had a Sony NC set years ago, that had its own set of issues, but I don't recall ever experiencing this sensation, so it may be limited to this product line or Bose in general.  My wife felt the same way with this headset so unfortunately I'll be looking for a new set.My strongest advice is to try them in the store for about 10 minutes.  If you don't experience any discomfort, you'll likely love these!

VLester's Bose QuietComfort Review
p576
sg5
VI purchased this headset August 2014.  I have used this headset on 5 - 10 flights.  I purchased this item for plane travel only, this headset is only used for that purpose.  They work very well, the only drawback you cannot listen to any audio when the unit is turned off, other than that I am very pleased. I gave this item a 4 star rating, would have given a 5 star rating; however, the unit does not provide any audio when turned-off.  I believe the replacement headset does offer the ability to listen to music when the noise cancelling feature is turned off.  Other than that I am very pleased with what I got.  When not in use this headset is stored in it's case with the battery removed.I will state before I purchased this headset I read the reviews about the headset falling apart; after limited use I have not experienced this issue/ problem.

VYou don't understand what these do until you actually try them
p600
sg5
VWow... this technology is clearly remarkable. Yeah, they are expensive, but if you got the money, they are worth it. It's amazing how it cuts out nearly all repetitive background noise. They are perfect on a plane. You can actually hear your music/movie without turning it up so loud it blows your eardrums out. You'd be surprised how useful they are in the house even. There is a lot of background noise in my house that I was not even really aware of until I put these on. Air vents, fans, wind outside, running water, computer running, and so forth. It's all nearly silenced by these. It's even more interesting that on a plane, it cuts out so much of the background white noise that you can actually hear people talking to you better than before! I always figured it would cut out ALL noise so you couldn't hear anything outside of the earphones, but that's not true. It doesn't totally cut out voices. I'm not sure if that's a pro or a con. If you have an annoying gf/bf that won't leave you alone while you're trying to watch a movie, it might be a con.They are comfortable. I was able to wear them for 2 or 3 hours with very little discomfort. I saw one complaint about the durability of the headphones. I admit, they aren't built like a tank, but they seem durable enough. I'm guessing some loss of durability was needed to keep them lightweight and comfortable.They only work if you have a working AAA battery in it. But the battery lasts a very long time. I think I have run it 15+ hours and the battery still didn't die.So... if you fly a lot, get these. If your house is noisy, get these. If your significant other won't stop talking... well, you might want to go with something else.

At first, I regretted not getting the wireless version, but now I think I made the right choice, as wireless has issues of its own. This unit lasts about a week or so on a single AAA-battery, and let's you know the battery's dead with a sort of "popping" sound. Just keep a package of fresh batteries near your desk & you'll be fine.

VI bought these headphones 1.5 years ago & loved them. Then 1 day I changed the battery & BAM! No power light & they don't work. Researched it & found some ideas which I tried. Nothing worked. You can call BOSE customer service, but they are USELESS! You can pay $100 for them to fix the problem (which is an actual defect). You need to change the batteries on this quite often & they use some cheap ass connector wire to get the battery charge & there are TONS of reviews from customers saying the wire snapped or bent which caused it not to work. When you spend this much money on headphones you expect them to last for several years & all BOSE is doing is running a sweat shop operation charging customers $100+ to correct an issue that WILL HAPPEN AGAIN! BOSE just lost my business. So disappointing.

Noise canceling is a must as I can get distracted easily -- but this particular set stands alone in terms of noise cancelation. You flick the switch and can hear the noise mute. It's amazing. Music sound is good. Not great. Bass is s little crinkly at times but that's only a concern with hip-hop from my experience. It is labeled as "acoustic" for crying out loud. Couldn't be more pleased. Comfortable, durable, and sounds great.

VOne of the best purchases I've ever made.  I do not fly often, but when I do, they're very nice to have, as has been well-documented by others.  For me, though, these headphones are invaluable for work or studying.  If you're like me and easily distracted when working, these will help you immensely.  I put on some light breeze/relaxation music, and lose myself in work or studies.Furthermore, the sound quality is pretty great.  I use the Bose In-Ears as well, and both have their strengths.  The in-ears, to me, have a better bass response and perhaps an overall better sound, especially for pop, rock, hip-hop, etc.  These over-ears are perfect for jazz, and your favorite well-recorded albums.  You can pick out the individual instruments and identify them across the stereo field pretty well.  Getting these headphones made me go back and re-listen to several of my favorite albums and it's like hearing them for the first time because you hear new things you never noticed before.

VThese are great headphones. I will note one thing: The noise canceling by itself does not cancel out talking. But you know what? That's not what the technology was designed for! The noise canceling technology was designed for canceling out continuous noise, such as the noise that construction workers experience during their work. It cancels out background noise phenomenally. If you turn on a little bit of brown noise or music in the background, though, it does drown out talking pretty well, though. So don't discount the noise canceling. These work very well. In fact, when they're turned off completely the design of the headphones themselves still muffle sound really well. I bought these because they have the best noise canceling on the market, but they also have very nice sound for music. I consider that a nice perk since I did not buy them to listen to music.Just a recommendation, but if you use these very often like I do, keep spare batteries in the small pocket inside the case. You'll know the battery is dying when it starts turning on and off continuously. (No, it's not broken!) I just wind up the cord in a coil and stick in the case instead of putting it in that pocket so I can use it for that purpose. See the photo for what I mean.Enjoy the headphones! You'll love them.

p747
sg5
VA little weird at first.  When I first tried these on and turned on the noise canceling feature I felt like I was deaf so it through my center of balance off.  (you should be sitting when you first try these out) But after that initial shock, the head phones are great.  I used these on the airplane all the time.  It really kills the sound of the airplane engine noise.  It was the first time I got off an airplane and actually felt relaxed and no headache.  The sound is awesome, I find myself having to turn down the volume most of the time because the sounds are very clear and do not need to be raised to hear clearly.  The base and treble are extremely clear and very enjoyable to listen to.  These are worth the money, even if you go on a plane once a year.

VI read so many glowing reviews. I was expecting fantastic noise cancelling. I am not impressed.The noise cancelling is not that much better than my $70 Audio Technica earbuds. The construction of the earpiece mounts looks weak. The battery compartment seems flimsy. For as much as these cost, they should be better. I returned them for a refund.

VThese are spectacular. I sat through a 2 hour flight with a screaming baby behind me, an overly PDA couple beside me, and a loud snoring guy in front of me, but couldn't hear a thing with these on and music playing. I've had them for a year and the durability is still superb. I use them in Starbucks while studying, and they block out about 85% of the sound. I listen to everything from dubstep, country, pop, rock, rap, house, trap, Norwegian death metal, country, to classical music and these headphones produce great sound for them all.

VI ordered these for my boyfriend, and a pair of Audiotecnica noise-cancelling headphones (a travel model that folds up) for myself. These ones are far more comfortable, and seem to cover more of the ear and keep out other sounds much better, both of which are important on long flights. The other pair fits better in my bag, but if you're not backpacking, these are the better investment.

They don't work at all really with any device using the audio cord it came with, however when I tried them with a friend's BOSE audio cord (which is what these should have come with) they worked fine. Pretty dissapointing. Looking to get a refund.

p932
sg5
VI bought a new unit about a year ago and after a few hours of usage it started failing occasionally. Now it's completely dead. As I live abroad the only Bose authorised company is located at another state, too far from me. They instructed me on how to send the unit to them but it's an excessively bureaucratic process, and expensive too. And I can't send it to Bose in the US either because they won't send it back to me in my country - should it be repaired under warranty, for example. And now I'm stuck with an extremely expensive paper weight. Next time I have an opportunity I shaw get a Beats instead.

p949

VMy husband asked for a set of these and I was pretty shocked by the cost when I went to order them.  He travels a lot, though, so he insisted that he would get a lot of use out of them.  He absolutely loves them for travelling because they are comfortable and really do cancel the noise in planes.  When we recently flew to Spain he suggested that I use his noise cancelling headphones during the flight and, although I'm not a fan of bulky headphones, I thought they were worth a try.  I can't believe the difference.  I'm scared of flying and these are great becaause they really do make you feel like you are in the comfort of your home listening to a movie or music.  You can't hear any of the airplane noises or anyone speaking to you.  Incredibly, they also barely feel like they are there becaause they are so comfortable.There is a reason that American Airlines hands these out to Business Class passengers - they are incredible.  I would love to buy a set for myself too but I don't travel that often so instead my husband has suggested that I buy him the new generation of these headphones so that he can give me his.  Of course, I'll be trading with him on every flight but at least then we'll feel like it was money well spent, which these definitely are for anyone who travels often.

VI bought these for their noise canceling function and they are superb.  One flick of the switch and it's total bliss.  You will be surprised how much noise you have in your surroundings.  I've had noise canceling headphones by other manufacturers but they aren't as quiet and comfortable as these.  Some people have complained that they feel cheap because they are so light, but they make them light on purpose so they will be comfortable to wear for long periods.  The audio when listening to music is surprisingly good as well.  Not as good as my high end Sennheisers to be sure, but still above average.  I also really appreciate that I can take the cord off completely when I use them for noise canceling.  The only negative is that you have to have the phones turned on to listen to music, which wears down the battery faster.  Since I bought them for their noise cancelation I am not deducting a rating star for that.

Removes just about all loud/constant noises such as rumbling or whines of engines while leaving voices slightly muffled but still perfectly audible.  Wish it could silence crying kids on planes but I switch to regular earplugs for that.

The benefit to my hearing is worth it.I'm no audiophile, so couldn't tell you about audio quality, but I haven't noticed any issues either. They seem reasonably well-made.They eat batteries, so my coworkers and I (three of us have these) just keep a communal set of rechargeables and a charger. Then again, I do have them on at least 4 hours a day, 5 days a week. When the battery runs out, the headphones cut in and out, and it's really annoying.Other than that, though, great.

VWorks very well to reduce the noise pollution on commercial airline flights.  Because some aircraft have loudspeakers with no volume adjustments, located directly over the passengers' heads , these earphones are essential for modern travelers.

VAmazing sound. Fantastic noise cancelling, yet able to hear people speaking with me.I use mine in the gym all the time. The only 'flaw' that I can find is that they can be a bit on the bulkier side. When I am laying down on a bench, I have to make sure that they are secure to my head or else they can slip off.Use them in the gym ,on planes, or when working and I want quiet.Steep price, but worth it-they work!

Only complaint is the cord was weak with the connector toward the headset like all the other reviews said. I try to be very,very careful not to break it. The sound is little thin but one may say it is crystal. It is not a boom box!

They are fairly lightweight, and they don't leave your ears sweaty...it's just hard to sleep against the wall of the plane with them on because they are too bulky for that...and I can't sleep on my back.

VAmazing noise cancelling, mediocre sound quality
p1194
sg5
VThe noise cancelling ability of these headphones is simply unmatched, and I've tried many brands. However, the audio quality of these is positively mediocre, and I'm not an audiophile. I'm regularly deflated by it, but I use them regularly to demo quiet sounds on a noisy show floor and it excels at that specific use case so I'm still thankful for them.It'd be 5 stars if they did two things. 1) Improve the sound quality. 2) Allow audio pass-through if the batteries go out (currently you get no audio).And guess what! Those two things are solved with the QuietComfort 25 model, which I now also use for demoing. It's truly incredible what they've done. I would highly recommend getting the 25s over the 15s. It's easily worth an extra $50.

I bought my first pair in 2005 and they still work great and only the padding around the ear shows any wear and tear... I still use them everyday and only bought this pair as a gift.  I had tried several other noise cancelling headphones before shelling out the $$$ for the Bose and the quality/comfort just don't compare.

VGreat Headphones...But Not Perfect
p1511
sg5
VI usually like to have a product for a while before reviewing in order to not be swayed by the "honeymoon phase". I own a pair of V-Modas and Koss PortaPros but was inclined to get these to drown out the resident blowhard at work who also happens to be a former opera singer. Once I realized none of the headphones I had was going to drown out her incessant yapping, I got these. Best "peace of mind" purchase I've made in years.One of my biggest concerns with headphones is weight. These are light enough to wear all day long without any kind of head or ear fatigue/soreness. The sound is incredible, as expected...when playing songs, I hear instruments that I never heard while wearing my other headphones. The "whoosh" you hear when you turn them on is as psychologically comforting to me as the actual music that gets played through them; that lets me know that everything else around me has been shut out and I can focus on my work.I have one major complaint about these which I think is worthy of deducting a star (or at the very least a half star)...there is no auto shutoff. So if you turn them on and leave them on overnight, be prepared to replace the battery the next morning. I would think with all of the modern technology we have there would be some way to shut them off if there's no signal coming from a source. My thinking is that if you can add volume control for Apple/iPod users, you can add functionality to cut these off after 5 or 10 minutes of no signal.So, in summary:PROS:+ Incredible sound+ Well packaged (carrying case is low profile and offers pretty good protection)+ Does a very good job of minimizing background sound+ Comes with all the fixings (extra cord, airplane headphone adapter, etc.)CONS:- No auto shutoff- Eats through batteries- Clicking sound when battery runs down is annoying (minor)

VFantastic noise cancelling capabilities.  Any constant noise is eliminated.  Voices not as much, but turn on some music and you're in your own world.  I can't compare against any competitors since I haven't tried them, but the reviews when I bough this indicated it had the best noise-cancelling qualities.  I occasionally forget to turn off the switch and it runs through a battery, so I recommend getting some eneloop batteries and a lacross bc700 charger, so you don't feel like you're wasting money on batteries.

VTop Rated Headphones for a Reason
p1529
sg5
VHard to find a better pair of headphones to block out traveling noise, especially on an airplane, although I know two people who wear theirs to sporting events because of how loud it gets! Music and voice audio is clear and good quality. On an airplane, if the pilot is speaking, I have to take them off to hear the announcement. If you want good sound and want to block out extraneous noise all around you, the Bose QuietComforts are worth the investment. I had a friend who's Bose started cutting out after 6 months and when she contacted the company they replaced them immediately, so they come with excellent customer service. lmck

p1535
sg5
VOf course these are awesome.  Bose is the standard. I bought their first pair until they fell apart some ? 20 years ago.  Forget Dr. Dre and the over priced clunky things.  GO on any aircraft and you'll see the "elite" passengers with Bose.  Bose invented noise cancelling...period.  Always buy the "over ear" ones since you get the max power of noise cancelling.  I have had all sorts of short cut ones and been fooled by "noise reducing".  Never buy "noise reducing".  If you want real noise reduction buy ear muffs for a rifle range!  I once took my shooting ear buds and ear muffs on a plane - worked great with one on top of the other.  The whole point of ear protection on a plane is that you do arrive more rested - at least I do.  The constant pounding on your ear drums is more exhausting than you'd imagine on a 14 hour flight.  Most times I use only 15 cent construction equipment foam ear plugs.  But, my QuietComfort is awesome for great sound while watching a movie.  Go Bose or go home!

VExpensive, but effective.  I haven't found a better set.  Cancels most background noise.  It won't save you from someone shouting nearby.  The plug wears out fast, but is detachable and therefore replaceable.  I go through about 1 AAA battery a month.  I can't leave it on for extended periods because even when it isn't playing it is canceling noise.  I end up with a pressure headache.  Sound quality is very good.

p1565

VAfter using an old pair that a friend had laying around for a few weeks, I finally gave in and invested in a pair of these myself. Full disclosure: I have not tried any other noise-cancelling headphones, so this review is not a comparative analysis but more a straightforward assessment of this product alone.Sound Quality: 5/5These really have ruined all other headphones for me. The sound quality is great -- I listen to a pretty vast array of music and have always been pleased with their performance. Again, I don't have any other products of similar quality to compare them to, but coming from the traditional iphone earbuds, these are an exponential improvement.Noise Canceling: 4.5/5I am currently in grad school and stuffed into an office with five other (uncharacteristically personable and chatty) scientists. Generally, if I just want to sort of dim out the noise, I find the noise cancelling itself to be pretty sufficient. You can still here aimless chatter or keyboard strokes in the background, but it's so much easier to tune out. If, however, you play music (even softly), the noise cancelling drastically improves. I find that I can work away in my own little world for a few hours with much less distraction when I am wearing these. I have also worn these a few times on airplanes -- they do a great job of cancelling out the roaring of engines and whatever else makes airplanes unbearably loud.Comfort: 4.7/5That brings me to my next topic...I generally wear these for hours at a time and have not had any problems with discomfort. My only annoyance is that they kind of squeeze my glasses against the sides of my head, so I usually end up taking the glasses off after a bit. This might be something that is pretty typical of any headphone, though. I have a reasonably-sized head, and don't find them to be too tight or anything like that, and I have never experienced headaches or pain from these. In a typical day I will wear them anywhere from an hour to maybe four to five hours, and mostly just forget I have them on after a while. Additionally, after six months of nearly daily wear, they have not lost any of their "springy-ness" and still fit to my head just fine.Battery life: 4.5/5I use these a lot (almost daily) and change the battery every few weeks or so. Batteries are expensive and annoying BUT my personal feelings about them aside, I think these headphones have a pretty good power lifetime.Carrying case: 5/5Not sure how important this really is, but the case is small but with a surprising amount of space for other things. I usually throw a few extra batteries in the little zipper pocket, and sometimes even cram my phone into the case without any issue.In general, I use these as my go-to office or home headphones. As a daily-use product, I find these to be excellent.

VPoor Build Quality
p1600
sg5
VI purchased the Bose QuietComfort 15 to replace a three year old pair of Audio Technica ANTH-A7s. My first impressions of the Bose QC15 were that the build quality was sub par for a nearly $300 pair of headphones. They feel very weak and use cheap plastic where the earcups swivel. The case came with a business card slot that was full of Bose business cards, not sure what that was about, as if I was going to hand them out. The sound quality was good, however and far exceeded by Audio Technicas in that area. The noise cancelling was a mixed bag. It was far superior to both the Audio Technicas and a pair of Sennheiser 450 I tried. However, the noise cancelling made me feel nauseous. Every time I turned it on I immediately felt "pressure" on my ears and felt extremely dizzy. Not sure if it was a defect or if I was sensitive to the frequency they use for the noise cancelling. In either case I returned the QC15 and despite the dizziness I would not recommend these headphones due to the cheap build quality. They do sound good, but I tried a pair of the Parrot Zik's (1st Edition) and love them. They have Bluetooth, auto on and off, and superior sound quality to the Bose and are currently on sale for $299.

p1612
sg5
VQuality headphone and speaker brands that come to mind will often have Bose near the top of that list. The Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones definitely fall under the quality. The headphones definitely live up to their name in the quiet and comfort categories. You will hear mids and highs in songs that will redefine the word clear. Even the bass in these headphones is impressively done. It is not to the level of the competitor Beats by Dre, but it is also not so dull that it can hardly be noticed. A feature users will find impressive is the battery life. I have owned a pair of these headphones for a year and a half and have never had to replace the single, triple a battery more than once per month. The user has the luxury of being able to forget to turn off the headphones and then come back to them later without the battery having run completely out.Users will find this pair of headphones rather comfortable. They are light and fit nicely on the ears and head. The headphones are noise cancelling when music is being played at a comfortable level to the user; with this being said, sound does not leak so much as the competing Beats headphones do.The one negative a user may find is that the headphones are not completely noise cancelling unless music is playing at a decent level. What is nice though is that when wearing the headphones without music playing, sound is significantly dampened. It becomes quiet enough to where one could fall asleep.

p1641

VDeadens noise from external sources. I can detach my cord when only using them for limiting outside noise. That takes care of noise cancelling, almost. One additional item - you have to get accustomed to the active noise/sound being created that is exactly opposing the sound from outside the headphones. That cancelling sound creates a bit of pressure on the ears that was uncomfortable until I got used to it. I did get accustomed to it though. Sound quality is superior and I hear bits of sound in music and movies I didn't realize were there before. My impression is that I'm in the room where the music is playing. I like that. They are a bit pricey and you don't need noise cancellation but when I got used to it I have to say I stopped using my other pricey non-noise cancelling headphones. I recommend them.

VSuperb noise canceling , okay sound and I miss it
p1682
sg5
VI had doubt before I purchase it, but I am now convinced it is one of the best noise cancelling phones to use on flight. I did not write this review until I lost mine on a flight several months ago. It reminds me how much I miss it, so I wrote the review.  Aside from the noise canceling future, the sound is okay.I also have a pair of Harman Kardon NC Premium. It is not on par in terms of the noise canceling compared to Bose and Bose is also lighter to wear during long flights. One thing I like HK better is that it does not require battery for listening to music, but Bose 15 requires to be powered.  You can always carry extra AAA batteries in the case in that case.If you are looking primarily for the noise canceling feature, look no further. Bose has it.

p1736
sg5
VI received these as a Christmas gift and they are terrific.  Wonderful fidelity, and great noise cancelling.  My wife has had a set for several years and they have held up well.  I guess she got tired of my using hers.  Will really be appreciated on plane trips.  By the way, it does come with a case, which my wife didn't realize that and ordered a separate case.  The return (reviewed separately) on the case was not pleasant; they wanted me to mail it to China!But don't let that dissuade you from purchasing these headphones; they're great.

p1742
sg5
VI absolutely love these headphones! This is the second time I purchased Bose headphones with my first pair being noise reducing versus cancelling. Bought these as my old ones I had worn the ear cushions down where they flake the black soft plastic all over my shoulders and chest. Decided to upgrade to the noise cancelling instead of just replacing the ear cushions after 7 years of use and am so glad that I did! I work in a small office where everyone talks super loud and I have a more sensitive ear. I use these headphones almost every work day for 8-12 hours per day. They are also great for the car or if I want to listen to music instead of TV but still be near my husband while he watches something he wants. Even without listening to anything, with the headphones turned on, it significantly decreases the volume level of everything around me but where I can still be a part of the conversation, if desired. Definitely recommend these to anyone and everyone!

Vreplaceable battery was the main selling point, compared to other bose phones
p1753
sg5
Vone of the reasons I got this was for the AAA battery use.  I can carry spares and change them as needed.  no need to open the unit or send it back a year or two later.  I hate built-in perma-batteries!  this one uses regular old AAA and the LSD batteries (low self discharge, eneloop style) work great with this.  the battery hinge does worry me a bit as I can see it wearing out and breaking some time.  I've read that bose does not sell a replacement for the battery door, so be careful with it!  that's the one major weakness on this.  one minor complaint I have is that the volume level can't be changed once you insert the jack adapter in the phones body.  you have to remove it to change the hi/low volume switch.  that was a strange design decision!  the fit is fine, though, and I'm able to wear it for hours before needing to take them off.  sound is ok (not high end but not low end, either).  sound cancellation is good.  not best-in-class but still very good and quite beneficial.

p1765
sg5
VI can't recommend these headphones: They pick up a TON of interference. I can't use them in some environments because my music will be interrupted by the clicking and buzzing. They also chew through batteries like no other. Leave them on overnight and they'll be near dead by morning. Oh, and the cord is awful short.When they do work as intended, it's pretty blissful. Comfy fit, static is canceled out. The cancellation felt a bit weird to my ears at first, but I got used to it quickly.

VWhy I have to own both Bose headphones and Beats...
p1770
sg5
VHeadphones are expensive, but I use them everyday for hours on end. Based on my music tastes, I own both these Bose QC15s and Beats by Dre Studio.However, I understand that spending a lot money on one pair of headphones, nevertheless two pairs is quite the investment.So in helping you decide on what to buy, here's a breakdown of when I listed to these:Bose:- When using for long periods of time, i.e. traveling, in bed, at work. They are extremely comfortable and you can almost forget that you have them on. As far as comfort goes, these are tough to beat. I even fell asleep in them and didn't wake up uncomfortable like other headphones.- Traveling. Great for airplanes.  I couldn't hear a thing around me and it felt as if I were in my own world.  They certainly do drown out all of the surrounding noises.- When listening to more mellow, acoustic music. These seems to have a more, balanced sound and sometimes you want that, but sometimes you don'tBeats:- When listening to bass heavy music like hip hop, EDM, etc. Bose sound great, but lack a little on the bass side (if that's what you like). Sometimes (like when at the gym), you just want a loud, heavy bass thumping pair of headphones to get you through. These Bose wouldn't work as well for that.- For looks. Yes, that's an expensive price to pay if you want to look good in a pair of headphones.  Some call it vanity, but to others, it's important to also be in the mix of fashion.As far as customer service goes, Bose wins hands down. I've had to return a pair after 10 months and Bose sent me a new pair rather quickly.

VHigh Quality Headphones - But Understand the Noise Canceling Limits
p1787
sg5
VAwesome Headphones!Pros:- Very comfy to wear (soft and padded ear cups make it hardly noticeable even after long hours of use).- Sound very good with iTunes music (listening through my macbook)- Comes with a carrying case to use when traveling- Cancels out background noise - like in a crowded room or to cut down on distractions in the library- Can be used as a stand alone noise muffler.  you don't need the headphone jack inserting in to the headphones - just flip the on switch and it will muffle sound.  great in the library!Cons:- Battery seems to need replacing more often that I'd like (always keep 1 or 2 in the carrying case)- When battery gets low - the noise cancellation cuts in and out (like gently tapping on the outside of the unit makes a crackling sound, it also happens in louder rooms but the tapping simulates what it does)- Does not completely block out all noise (very loud rooms, like a cafeteria) - although it does muffle the sound well

Even if the headphones hadn't hurt my ears, I still would have returned them for this reason.

In combination with some hardcore metal however it does the trick nicely on all noises up to and including fire alarms.Fit is quite comfortable, I have worn these for hours on end (including international flights) with no issues. Battery life is OK, just keep a couple spares in the included case.

I'm not gonna cruise around with a bunch of batteries on me.I'm sure they were great at one time, but these are a thing of the past. Go for the QC 20i's!

p1955
sg5
VThese headphones are not for everyone but for what they do, they do it very well. The noise cancelation is superb. Our car is pretty loud does not keep out road noise very well so for long trips I sometimes just activate the noise cancelation. These cut out about 80% engine noise.  I was considering getting the QC 20s (Bose's earbud version) but the noise cancelation in the QC 15s are about as good. Battery life is about what I saw in the other reviews about 30 hours so if I carry a spare AAA in the case it works fine (I'm using some cheap rechargeables). If you are considering the QC 15s vs the 20s consider:If you REALLY need compactness I'd go for the QC 20s, it might be worth it for an extra 50 bucks to you.The QC 15s perhaps have a slightly better noise cancellation but it is pretty close.If you are a forgetful about recharging stuff the QC 20s might be your headphones. It's better to lose a AAA battery versus shortening the life of a $250+ pair of headphones.The QC 20s have an "aware mode" which allows you to turn off the noise cancelation, the QC 15s don't so if that's important consider the 20s.Overall very good headphones

VNot Bad, Not Spectacular
p2086
sg5
VVery comfy, and good - not great - noise-canceling capability.  These do NOT get rid of all the noise.  They merely lessen it.  They will eliminate the hum of a refrigerator or the roar of helicopter engines overhead.  They will not fully mute talking persons or screaming babies.  You need to connect the phones to your computer or ipod or iPhone and listen to music or something else.  I don't know if 100%-noise canceling headphones exist...do they?  I bought these for $229 right before they were discontinued.  That price was too high by about $50 (I would not buy them for the retail price of 300, sorry but they are not worth that except to richer people than I).  But, Bose is a very good brand so I'm sure they will last a long time.  The main reason I bought them was to drown out noisy coworkers.  I also fly fairly often and am sick of spending whole flights sitting near rambunctious and whiny rugbrats and colicky babies.  If I can't totally cancel their noise, at least I can mitigate it.  3 1/2 stars.

VShockingly Poor Durability For Such an Expensive "Quality" Product!
p2104
sg5
VI guess I can't complain too much because some of the reviewers here did warn me but given the overwhelmingly larger number of 4 and 5 star reviews I decided to take a chance and in this case it was a gamble that was bitter sweet.  Also given how I presume many of the reviews were written too soon after purchase I decided to write my review now after using this for a little over 2 years now.  From the start I had some sound quality issues which I found a little burning in time and using only fully powered rechargeables or alkaline batteries eventually eliminated.  I thought that I lucked out if that was all given the biggest pro of this product being its wonderful noise-reduction ability and very minimal sound leakage that I experienced over the next few months.  The sound quality isn't that great but I guess with the very good noise-reduction feature it certainly made up a lot for this as compared to passive noise reducers which while better sound quality wise may have that aspect compromised by external noises.Then by the sixth month the more serious problems began to start in earnest.  The on/off switch becomes pretty flimsy after repeated use and should be very carefully engaged to activate eventually.  The biggest letdown is that this product cannot be used without a battery or when it is switched off.  Once I forgot to bring along enough batteries and I had to endure almost half of the flight without it.  While the over the ear design is pretty good in that it fits my ears well and is fairly comfortable the ear padding material started to flake and quickly fall off exposing the foam underneath.  It eventually got so bad that about 6 months ago I decided to buy replacements which fit well and is still ok.  Then the headband padding starting showing signs of imitating what the ear pads have done.  Now, almost exactly 2 years after purchase the whole thing just decided to stop working.  As this doesn't work without being switched on it is just a very expensive dud now and is totally useless.If I was the inventor of such a brilliant piece of noise-reduction technology I would be so proud of my invention that I wouldn't settle for anything less than super quality for every part of my product.  Instead we get great technology that works for 2 years or so but a product that fails to satisfy on every other level bringing into question the entire value proposition.  If money is no object for you and if you fly often and so noise reduction is most important to you then by all means get this but if you are like me and would like to get a product that lasts relative to its price point then I wouldn't recommend this.  My very first noise-reduction headphones from Sony the MDR-NC20 lasted much longer (it still works although the ear pads have completely deteriorated but after extended and heavy use) and at a much lower price point and my other pair from Philips the SHN9500 is still working and will still do so even when the switch is off.  After so many years the Philips is only now starting to show some ear pad flaking but I'm left feeling given the price I paid that I still got great value.Look up the definition of "penny-wise, pound foolish" and you will see a photo of this product and the names of the people from Bose who are responsible for this product.  To summarise, this is a great product for about 2 years if you are lucky but with significant downsides that you have to put up with during its short life.  I've decided to use my Philips for flights and I just bought a Sennheiser Momentum for home use; maybe I'll review this after a couple of years but something tells me already that it'll last a whole lot longer than this Bose crap.  I'll try to cannibalise the new ear pads I bought for nothing now as it turns out and see if it will fit my Sony MDR-NC20.Not recommended for those concerned with value for money and durability!

VI work in an office right by a printer and what seems to be the popular place to discuss everything but work. This was an investment and it has paid dividends twofold. I love these things. They sound great and better yet the block out all that unwanted noise. Even without music playing it does a decent job of drowning out conversations and eliminates the sound of printers and ringing phones (the latter could get you in trouble tho). I would buy these again and again given my work situation.

p2151

VI bought a pair of these headphones for the first time as a freshman in college living in a dorm with 3 roommates and I can't imagine getting through school or life without them now. In fact, when my first pair was stolen out of my room, I went onto ebay and bid on a second pair because I was having trouble writing my papers without them.I can't claim to be a headphone aficionado, but I know without a doubt that these are some of the best noise canceling headphones you can buy. Not only do they help reduce background noises of all kinds to a faint sound, but they are incredibly comfortable to wear. I wear mine for hours at a time without pain in my ears or on the top of my head where the bar sits, thanks to the comfortable padding built into these. These come with a convenient case that is hard enough that you can keep them in your backpack without fear of these headphones breaking. I also appreciate that I can control the volume of what I'm listening to from the attached wire that connects the headphones to my computer or iPod.These are great for school (college dorms in particular), traveling on airplanes, and many other uses. Even though they are rather pricey, they are well worth every penny spent on them.

VI had been debating getting these for years, mainly due to the cost. I had some upcoming flights and finally broke down and placed the order, and I am so glad that I did. They really do an amazing job getting rid of the constant drone of airplane noise, which once eliminated, makes flying a lot less stressful.  In the past when flying I used to listen to music or audio books with regular ear-bud headphones. I found that I had to max out the volume just to hear what was going on, and still came in with lots of noise. The Bose Quiet Comfort's do an amazing job of eliminating the noise allowing me to hear my music or book and helping me relax while flying. I was on one flight and actually had to lift the headset off my ear to make sure the engine was still running while mid-flight :)

VI bought these to replace a set of on-ear Sony headphones. They work very well at canceling out background noise, and they sound great to me. They are also more comfortable than my old headphones for long listening sessions. I just wish they could still play music when active cancelation is switched off. (These are all or nothing)

VToo much hype.  Only works on SOME frequencies....
p2294
sg5
VI thought that "Noise Cancelling" actually meant noise cancelling.... not so.  It's more like noise reduction and the effectiveness of this reduction depends on the frequencies of the noise.I bought these cause they are doing construction on the outside of my building, lots of jackhammering.  The Bose QuietComfort 15 did almost nothing but a slight dampening of the sound.  If you were to play speed metal really loud you might be able to "hide" the noise, but no noise canceling was achieved.When do they work well?  When the microwave/convection oven fan was running these headphones did well to cancel out this low constant droning noise.  So what, the oven fan was never an objectionable sound that inflicted headaches.Maybe good for some as long as your expectations are fairly low.

VI see that a newer version is now out. But this version Quiet Comfort 15 does the job perfectly. This past Sunday at the Atlanta Football game I used these while watching the game on my sling box at home. The headphones blocked out the crowd noise and I could watch the football live in the stadium and listen to the game commentary at the same time in a noisy stadium.I tend to buy noisy smaller cars without bluetooth. These headphones are great on long trips to take out the road noise and to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. Believe it or not, I'm not as tired driving when using these. It seems just keeping the road noise blocked helps with mental alertness.In an office full of cubicles turn on the music and you have no idea anyone is beside you.There is no rechargeable battery feature but a single AAA battery will last over 30 hours.I bought a square trade warranty expecting them to break while sleeping with them ( big time snoring spouse ).  However, these are pretty sturdy. I've broken other headphones before but these have held up great.

VI am sorely disappointed in my Bose head phones. I am old and living on SS and have saved to buy one and it is sorry.  The volume control switch does not do its job of controlling volume; it is not noise cancelling as advertised; finally, I seem to have to put in a new battery nearly after every use. Ideally it would be recharged in the wall like my phone and then have Bluetooth from my computer to eliminate the wiring. So much for thinking I was getting the Cadillac of systems. Make sure you shop around and place no value on urban myths like Bose is the Best.

VI bought these in November 2012 but only used them a few times, for travel. Last summer, the battery insert 'door' stuck and they couldn't be turned on. I called Bose today (trip coming up), and they offered a replacement - for half price. There is no option to repair. Considering that this model is already discontinued and I bought them for $300, you'd think they would stand behind their product. Bad service, inferior quality. I won't be buying Bose again.

VWell, they were very nice - until the battery closure broke and the set no longer powered up. I'd used them maybe half a dozen times for traveling. Bose customer service was less than helpful. The website offers what appears to be all kinds of service options but the bottom line is that they don't fix their own headphones and they won't refer you to any dealership or store that does. The only option is to ship them back and get a new set - for a discount. In other words, you're paying for them twice - or once in a half. Considering that this company has a global reputation, one would think they would offer better service. There are many more options on the market now. I'll be looking for a non-Bose product.

VMost comfortable headphones I own. Does a great job of noise cancelling. Sound quality is pretty decent, but not at the level of reference grade headphones. Only gripe (and not even worth losing a star over) is that it *only* works when powered (ie. when the battery dies, so does the sound). That said, it gets excellent battery life, and the carrying case even has a convenient zipper pouch for a couple of extra AAA's.

VBest Set of Headphones Ever Owned
p2436
sg5
VThis review for my purchase of the Limited Edition "Navy" color set of Quiet Comfort headphones (Search ASIN # B008YUNK46 if your interested) two years ago (Nov. 2012).  That set is now discontinued but its IDENTICAL in every other feature (except the color).  My husband actually owns this silver version and his sound just as good as mine.--------------------------------------------------------------------I got a great deal on the V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-Ear Noise-Isolating for Cyber Monday... 74.99 instead of 125...  Noise Isolating? Hardly! Comfort - none... at all.  I had used my husbands Bose Quiet Comfort 15's before and the Crossfades sounded alright, but after wearing them for 10 min, my head was pounding.  I switched back to his quiet comfort, and the sound was 10x better in my opinion, my ears weren't sore, and the noise cancellation actually got rid of the ambient noise and static.Processed the return for the crossfades and coughed up the extra 225.00 for the Bose.Pros:- Comfort x10- Noise cancelling is great- Sounds great - People have reviewed that the base is poor on these, but I disagree.Cons:- Yes the are more expensive because of the name- Yes the feel much cheaper than than the crossfades but my husband has had no issues with his.  He has had them for 3+ years and wears them frequentlyI ordered mine yesterday at 5:45PM EST and the arrived at around 12:15PM today (Love Amazon!).  When I opened the box i noticed the regular audio cable was crimped so tight with the twisty ties that it appeared damaged.  Some have commented that Bose warranty/customer service is no good.  I contacted the Bose factory store and they advised they could not help because they were bought through Amazon.  Called the 1-800 number and someone answered within 5 minutes.  No questions asked, processed a free replacement cable and told me to throw the other away upon receipt.  He did not require my receipt, and because I was away from my product, did not bother with the serial number.  In my opinion, that's pretty dang good customer service.I definitely recommend these headphones for people who suffer from migranes and just want to casually enjoy music.  I bet they are great for travel and look forward to using them on airplanes.++UPDATE 12/10/14**I've had these now for just over two years and wear them frequently.  They are still excellent both in durability and sound quality.  These are by far the best set of headphones I have ever owned.  I HATE headphones... I actually look forward to wearing these.  I love the noise cancelling and NOT having a headache.  They are so soft on the ears!

VJust received these headphones.  I usually wear earbuds but even the squishy ones tend to hurt my tender ears after extended wear.  The minute I put these on I knew they were going to be a welcome change.  The cushiony pads don't go on your ears but around them, creating a very comfortable pocket for your ears to chill out in.  The noise blocking feature works surprisingly well. So far, using them in the city, I've been able to block out lots of noise walking around so that all I really hear is music.I tested these versus the earbuds I usually wear and the sound is better, they are more comfortable and they definitely block out a lot more noise. One of the great things about the sound blockage is that you can play music on a lower volume, thus reducing the potential damage of using listening devices on your hearing.Highly suggested for anyone with sensitive ears who want a great noise-blocking headphone.

VThis. is. it. 3 nights in a row without good sleep due to loud roommates and loud everyone in college led me to rolling out of bed, going on amazon, and immediately buying these noise cancelling headphones. Lets just say it was the best decision I have ever made on such little sleep while being less than half awake.It's perfect for loud roommates in college, for loud cats post-college, and basically for any little nuisance that may trigger migraines.I'm not done. These headphones are also great for plane rides. Crying baby? Buh-bye. Chatty neighbor? Buh-bye. That girl two rows behind you with an annoying laugh and her stories about her girlfriends' housewife-wanna-be drama? Buh-bye.My head cannot thank me enough for this purchase and "Bohemian Rhapsody" has never sounded so sweet. Just one listen of basically ANY classical symphonic piece- forget about it. You'll never go back to those dinky free Apple headphones.Only recommendation- the batteries that come with it die within 2 days. Just buy a lot of AAA batteries. Secondly, to save your battery life and the hassle of replacing batteries, become very disciplined of turning the off switch. Other than that, these are great !

VI'm no audiophile so see other reviews if you want that level of detail.  I will say that these headphones are life changing on a flight.  I've logged a lot of air miles recently, including two long hauls.  I usually have a headache after flying just from the noise - but not if I wear these.  I bought them for my parents as well.  Hard to believe that I've spent almost $1,000 on headphones this year but they are worth every dime!  (FYI - I had previously owned a pair of $50 noise cancelers from Sony and there is absolutely no comparison.)

Vthe next worst thing about air travel is engine and cabin noise
p2525
sg5
VFly much? If you do, then you must have these. Besides airports, the next worst thing about air travel is engine and cabin noise. They can make even a short flight a headache producer and ruin your entire first day off the plane. With these, you simply sit back, turn on some nice music, and the airplane noise disappears. Nothing can fix the uncomfortable seats or the cramped leg room, but these help make it bearable.

p2555
sg5
VI have used Sony MDRNC7/BLK for a year, and I am a frequent traveler. I used the Sony more often on plane, and here is the differences after purchasing Bose headphones.Here is some Pros and Cons for Bose QC15. I use it for about a year.-pros-* Very perfect on plane and it is reduce the engine noises as well as babies crying for about %80.* Definitely very comfort for you ears and you can use it more than 6 hours* Sound quality is amazing* Have all the adapters you need, such as case, two cables one with mic & audio, and the airline adapter* Floded ear speakers, which make it much flexible.* Ear-pads is replaceable-cons-* Easy to take off the cable if you walk away while your cable plugged-in into you laptop (that what ruined the phone cable) it did not work any more.* Anything that touched the headphone cover from outside will left minor scratches or visible marks makes it like an old headphones.*battery not staying for longtime, keep your backup battery close. you can use the headphone for one battery for about 24-30 hours.* Any cable will not work, because the headphone has its own design shape so you have to purchase Bose cable only, and they are a bit expensive.* Last but not least, this headphone is EXPENSIVE $300.-------Compare it with cheap $60 sony headphones-pros-* Battery hold for 48-60 hours.* Sound quality is fine.* Folded headphone* Cheap and you can buy it for $60-cons-* The noise canceling not working as I expect it at all (reduce the noises about 20-30%) it did do anything on plane.* After using the headphone for 2 hours my ears hurt me so bad.* People can hear what you listening to.* No mic for phone (you cannot replace audio cable)* No case* Ear-pads not replaceable and not comfort at all.* The ear hight adjustment will lose the tightness after using it for 4 months.Bose is way different, and you should try it by your self.

VDead after 14 months.  Of course it dies after 1 year warranty.  It worked great on planes.  Greatly reduced noise.  But for a headphone I seldom used and it dies in 14 months for $300.  This is one of the worse electronic buys ever.  It's in awesome shape.  It just would not turn on and I even went out to buy a brand new battery.  Very poor quality.

VGreat! They are very comfortable and helps me keep sleeping in the morning when there is a lot of noise going on. Case provides extra room also! If you are okay with replacing the battery once in a while and good at not leaving devices on, this is for you. The quality is not like sennheiser but it is not like a pair of headphones from the store where you will be dissapointed. Not bass heavy but does have some bass. Mid's and highs are great. It allows you to enjoy the music more because you don't get to hear the world outside.

VI actually purchase these headphones in November 2009 and finally decided to write a review after years of use. These headphones were breathtakingly amazing when I first heard them in the Bose Store, which is what prompted me to purchase them without delay. Being my first $350 pair of headphones at the time, I expected them to last until the end of time but I guess that was asking for to much. After only a few years of very light use the padding in these headphones started falling apart. When I say light use I mean using them once every 4-6 months on my long plane rides. At least the sound quality is still somewhat there. Thanks Bose for giving me 2 soild years.

VI got these for my partner and he LOVES them. I am so jealous, now I want a pair for myself. He uses them all day long while he is in the studio to keep out the sound of the stuff going on outside his curtain, and they work really well. They do run through batteries quite a bit if you use them that much, but well worth it. It can also be hard to remember to turn them off after you are done for the day, so keep an eye out for the red light. If you can afford them, THIS IS THE WAY TO GO, so stop looking and wasting your time reading reviews.

VWonderful to drown out unwanted noise
p2679
sg5
VI have been using these headphones for several months now, and I love them. I work in a science lab, with my desk space out in the open by my bench space, and although I love my social co-workers, sometimes I need to tune them out to get work done. The noise cancellation feature dampens the ambient noise, like turning down the volume. In the lab, I can't hear centrifuges buzzing or quieter conversations. The headphones will not block out people with loud piercing voices, but at least their voices are easier to tune out when semi-blocked by these. They definitely work well to tune out the louder engine humming on airplanes, so these are also great for travel. If you want to listen to music, the noise cancellation feature also helps increase the fidelity of the transmitted music by allowing you not to have to process random ambient noise.

VThe noise cancelling part is fairly effective and the headphones are reasonably comfortable, though far from the most comfortable I've had.But I had to get a replacement within a few weeks because the first one broke for no discernible reason. Further, though I imagine it is nice sometimes going cordless, most of the time it just gets annoying how easy it is to accidentally rip the cord out of the headphones. There should be some sort of locking mechanism or a  bluetooth adapter or something. It's really aggravating to move a couple inches and suddenly have the cord come flying out the headphones. Something you pay three hundred dollars for shouldn't have this sort of aggravation.

VAs an owner of the QC-15's for over two years, I can say the sound quality is good overall.  When the ambient noise is too great to overcome, the constant popping on and off is annoying.Additionally, the ear pads are falling apart, the cords are breaking, and the sound quality has diminished over time.  I started noticing the degradation about a year ago.  Keep in mind though, I've used them a LOT.  Not worth $250, but they are decent.  I'd try as many as you possibly can before settling.

VMy BOSE acoustic noise cancelling headphones are leaving black material all over my head, ears and neck, even though  I have used the product only about 20 times.  The only offer from BOSE is to buy a new product from them.I have purchased four BOSE Products over the years - two home acoustic wave systems and two noise cancelling headsets (in ear and around the ear).  I just hung up from a BOSE technical support person who informed me that even though these products cost hundreds of dollars, the material on the headset and ear pieces will deteriorate and last at most a couple of years.  The policy of BOSE is to then sell you a new headset rather than replace or repair the issue.  In fact, the representative and supervisor on the "technical support" line informed me that there is no such thing as a customer service department at BOSE.  My experience is that the technical support line is really a sales line, as their primary focus is to sell you a replacement product.  Even replacing the remote control for my acoustic wave sound system is only possible (according to the supervisor) if I purchase the replacement.If you expect that a premium product includes after-sale service and customer satisfaction, then don't buy these headsets.  You will be extremely disappointed.

VI use these headphones mainly when I fly.  For that purpose, they are excellent.  The sound quality is fantastic, and it knocks out the noise of the airplane engines almost entirely.  I never could sleep on an airplane before getting these headphones, but now, I sleep for hours.  The noise cancellation works a bit less well for voices and other irregular sounds, but it still reduces them somewhat.  The headphones are quite comfortable, and I can wear them for hours without any problems.  The construction quality is very good, and I have not had any problems in the time since I bought them (Really, I think this is the second best product I have ever bought - my clock radio being the best (but that is another story).

VI did a bunch of research. There is no one perfect headphone in this catagory. I went with the most popular for sure, and enjoyed them on several US-Japan trips. I like them for the length of a movie, but they start to bother me after much longer than that. I need a break from them. The sound is "OK" but not as good as high-end canceling sets.

p2836

VOK fit...but the sound came through very congested, and did not open up after 20 hours of "burn in". Clarity and detail were also a bit muzzled compared to a pair of Sony MDR 7506' I use for mainly at home listening. I was also getting a low but noticeable hum when connected to my small tube headphone amp. Fit and comfort were fine, and the noise cancelling circuit worked as far as cancelling noise. I suspect it is also interfering with the signal path of the sound. These are being returned and I will go back to my standby Etymotic 4's for air travel.

It was not clear to me when I purchased this, but you cannot listen to music without turning these "on" and using the battery and the noise reduction feature. It's all or nothing with these. The noise reduction alone is very good, but when you play some quiet music, the effective noise reduction is almost total.

Vwhen i first got them they were great but after awhile that changed
p2871
sg5
VI've had these headphones for about 3 months, when i first got them they were great but after awhile that changed. about a week ago i put them on and only one of the sides worked, i freaked out a little because i payed so much for these headphones. They came with two cords, one with the controls on the side and one with out the controls. I figured out that when i put the cord with the controls in only one of the sides would work and the controls wouldn't work either. But when i put in the other cord without the controls, both sides worked fine. So i was a little disappointed about that. I originally got the headphones because i was about to take a long flight across country and during the flight the headphones worked great. The battery also last a really long time (the box said 35 hours) but i'm a music producer and have used them for more then 35 hours and the battery is still going. I find that the noise canceling on these headphone works better when i'm producing because i can't here noise thats surrounding me. My last complaint about these headphones is there a lot of sound leaking when i have the sound up over 50%.

VI decided to give this Headphones a try just for flying in airplanes.I am not really a frecuent flyer, but every single time I flew I got a headache, just for the noise of the turbines: big international aircrafts frlying two hours, small planes flying one hour and a half, you name it: always headaches and that "stun" feeling.That was until I tried this headphones.Of course, don't expect to be in a zero noise environment magically, but they will reduce any aircraft inside environmental noise to the noise of a bus.They are comfortable as well, used them for a 4 hours and a half flight, followed by a 1 hour and a half one, and my ears were not sore at all.Highly recommended.

VI love these headphones.  They do the job well at cutting out noise around you and allow you to totally focus on your music/shows.  I use these exclusively when I travel and when I am at home and just want to be in my own world.  They cut down the engine noise of a plane dramatically; in fact, after wearing them for a few minutes I take them off to make sure the engines are still on!  It's amazing how I traveled so much WITH OUT these headphones prior to buying them.If you are a nervous flyer then you will definitely love these.  My wife uses these to combat her in-flight nerves and they work like a charm.  They cut out all the unnecessary noises and just allow pure focus into what you're listening to.While they cut out engine/road noise they do not cut out people's voices completely.  If you have people sitting next to you that are loud then you'll hear them but it will be dulled down.I have tried the Beats and these are far superior.  The Beats I think are just a fashion statement and are ridiculously inferior to this product.My only complaints are that they are uncomfortable after a long period of time.  Now, this may be just me (that's why I didn't take off any stars) but I feel tightness and pinching when wearing these for more than 30 mins.  Usually after taking them off for a minute or two I am good to go for another 30-45 minutes.Also, with these you cannot walk or run in them.  They are only made for sitting down and relaxing.I would buy these again in a heartbeat.  Well-worth the price tag even if you do not fly a lot; like I said, I use these more when I am at home relaxing.

VBest headphones ever!
p3011
sg5
VI compose electronic music. I needed a studio headset because I was releasing a CD, and needed to hear every detail.  I bought these for many reasons.  They feel so soft on my hears.  The way the padding on the ear piece and especially the padding on the top bar, most headphones pretty much suck in this aspect.  Also, after trying out about a thousand different headphones, when you turn these on, they REALLY do drown out any noise at all! I have had these for about a year, and I am still amazed at the wonder of these headphones!  I have tried wearing these with lawnmowers running outside, high traffic....it is that quiet!  So while I bought these for music making, I find myself using these for just about everything else.  They come with a really nice sturdy zipper case, and adapter and two different cords.  Both sound equally brilliant. I think the only draw back is the cord will pull out of the headset pretty easy, which is minor considering if you were to break the cord, the headset would be useless.  ALSO it DOES require a 3A battery, so if you don't remember to turn them off when not in use,  or pass out on the sofa while relaxing to music, you are out of luck.  Still, I would recommend them to anyone, I like showing these off to my friends and family, because they just can't believe how great they work!

VMy first encounter with the Bose QC15 was recently on a flight back home. The man sitting next to me had them on. Despite the fact I was forward of the jet engine he offered me to try them on. No question, I was sold. From what I could see,there wasn't not enough change in the QC25 too warrant paying the extra price. My order came today and I'm floored at how this totally drowns out sounds. They are so soft on my ears and gentle on my head,you barely know you have them on. As much as I hate flying these days, I actually can't wait. WOW I could have had these so long ago.This investment was worth it all. Despite it all, I'm still kicking myself for not getting them sooner. I'm not a "fashion guy" so I didn't need to spend another $100 for custom colored ones.

I hardly ever use them as headphones when on an airplane (often, too much maybe) and sometimes want to be able to completely attenuate the too loud conversation of the guy behind me or the kid two seats over playing his gamething at high volume, or the 20 something in front of me with earbuds cranking out 105 d.

He swears by them, I can't tell a difference and the noise cancelling doesn't work for me. But he sleeps with them on every night and says he can't without them so yes, he got a new pair. :)

VThese headphones are great! Perfect for traveling, whether you're road tripping or in a plane these are really worth it. I've used them in a plane to watch movies, listen to music and the noise cancelation feature will keep outside noises out. I even use them at home when I watch Netflix or cable TV. I recommend buying the 20' extension so when you're home you can use it a lot more.

VIf you find these headphones cutting out at slight bumps, make sure that the spring on the battery lid does not bend on the battery when the you close the lid. if it does, fashion a paper-clip or something to keep it in pried down while you secure its position over the battery. I've bought these headphones twice. My first pair was destroyed in an apartment fire. They were quality enough to purchase again.

VWhat a difference! Cutting out the airplane noise makes the flight so much less stressful. I listened to the movie on the lowest volume setting instead of having to crank it way up as I had to do using normal ear buds. I can't compare these noise cancelling headphones to other noise cancelling headphones, since this is my first pair, but if you haven't tried noise cancelling headphones, don't hesitate, it's a modern miracle. These were comfortable even after several hours of wear, the sound quality when listening to music was very good and the carrying case was very well-designed. I used the regular audio cable on the airplane headset jack and the iPod/iPad/iPhone on my iPod shuffle. The inline controls on the iCable were handy and worked nicely. I can't comment on durability, the the first run with these is way beyond my expectations.

VAmazing Product
p3215
sg5
VAmazing! These are the first set of noise cancelling headphones I have bought, so I can't compare them to the others out there but I can say they are fantastic.  I bought these for two main reasons: One, I was about to take a series of long flights economy class and, two, to use at work.  On the six different flights I had to take, I was always fairly close to the engines.  These headphones are amazing in how they distinguish between sound and noise.  The engine noise went from a roar to barely audible, without affecting the sound quality of the music or movie I was listening to.  They even eliminated the noise of a crying baby. (There's always a crying baby).  Yet, I could hear and speak with the flight attendants and hear the announcements without removing the headphones.  When I ordered these, I was a bit concerned aout the comfort of over the ear headphones as I wear glasses and headphones sometimes uncomfortably push against the stems of the glasses.  However, I was able to wear these through most of a 10 hour flight.  When I wear these at work, all the background noise is eliminated, yet I can carry on conversations without problem.  The only improvement I would like to see is the ability to customize the noise elimination for specific environments. As far as I am aware, there are no noise canceling headphones on the market that do this.

I have been using these for almost 2 years now and no problems whatsoever. The case also which comes with it is pretty sturdy and travel friendly and has internal pockets for storing batteries which comes handy. I gave it four stars because I felt that they could have made the cords a little bit better. I saw that the new QC 25 has better quality cords so looks like they have heard it already !

VGreat sound, TERRIBLE build quality
p3239
sg5
VI have to add my voice here to those complaining about the horrible build quality of these headphones. I've owned QC15s for quite a few years now. On my first pair, the cushioning on the ear cups started really breaking down and flaking within a year. I eventually purchased replacements for those (no standard coverage by Bose). Then, before too long the headphones just stopped working in one ear. I was outside of my one year warranty for the headphones (One year for a product that is supposed to be state of the art? You've got to be kidding me). So Bose offered to sell me a new pair of QC15s for $119.Unfortunately, I took the offer. I figured I had already invested $300, so I might as well put a little more in and keep going with the Bose instead of moving to a higher quality product. It's been just over a year now, and the new headphones just completely stopped working. I'm not about to pour another $119 into a set of crappy quality headphones that break in a year.Overall, the sound quality and noise canceling in these headphones is wonderful, but they are not worth the price tag for a product that breaks consistently in a very short period of time.

VThis is one of those times that you are DEFINITELY paying for the name. Don't get me wrong, the sound quality and the noise cancelling is unparalleled. They are Bose. BUT,.... you have to understand, these headphone are NOT portable by ANY means. They are bulky, they are fairly heavy for the size, and taking them on a plane is difficult at best. This is something that if you plan to take anywhere, you have to either A) wear them around your neck ALL day, or B) find some way to carry a large, bulky carrying case. If you put these in your carry-on for the plane, you need to put them near the top, and hope you get an isle seat. You don't just reach in and grab them, this is a big carrying case! You have to take down the whole bag, and hope you don't drop them.

VThese are good for noise canceling as I compared them to the Beat's one at the time which were the same $300 at Best Buy.  Problem is build quality is crap.  The phone muffs have frayed off and Bose wants $35+ to replace it.  For $300 I expect something to last a little longer.  I don't even use them that often.  Occasional flight and some occasional listening at work.  :(  I will be shopping around more carefully this time.

VThese are awesome. I've owned mine for 2 years now and I use them constantly. With a little bit of music flowing through them the kids can be screaming in the next room and I don't hear a thing.  The sound quality is great and the build quality is very high. A single AAA battery runs them for about a week of heavy use.  A friend (who doesnt have kids) came to stay with us for  a week and started using them to read and escape the chaos that is a house with 4 small kids in it. He loved them and I bought him a pair as a gift (it was a rough week and a big gift).  They are very comfortable to wear and I have no issues at all.  These are the second pair of noise cancelling headphones I've owned and while the first set were pretty good these are much better. They also come with a replacement cable for when the dog or a kid inevitably cuts/chews through it.

VBest headphones I've ever owned
p3416
sg5
VI was given a pair of these for work use and liked them so much I bought another pair for home use. First, they're very comfortable. The cups are both soft and durable, which is a rare combination in my experience. The headband is also comfortable, never cutting into my head like some headphones I've owned. I wear these all day without a problem. The pressure is just right, and only rarely do the arms of my glasses cause me discomfort.The sound quality is great. I won't pretend to be an audiophile or anything, and I'm mostly listening to MP3s, but they sound great to me. These won't melt your brain with bass or anything. They'll just give a good, authentic sound.The noise cancellation is good. If you're unfamiliar with noise cancellation, it is not magical. It will not silence everything. It's mainly good at cutting lower frequencies, like the white noise of machinery (bring them on your next flight and thank me later). The cups are enclosed, so you also get some passive attenuation as well. They're better than conventional headphones of their size but not as good as magic. This isn't a flaw with these in particular, just a limitation of noise cancellation.They come with lots of excellent accessories. It includes two different cords, one with a mic and iPod controls, one without. You can also use the headphones without a cord at all for the noise cancellation alone. It comes with an excellent, well-made rigid case to keep your headphones protected, and it has a small pocket inside for storing extra batteries or small adapters. It also comes with one of those absurd airplane audio adapters, which I have never, ever encountered a need for in decades. Nice of them to include it I suppose.Battery life can range from terrible to great. It all depends on how vigilant you are about turning them off when not in use. I've trained myself to hit the switch on the ear cup every time I'm removing them from my head, even if it's only for a moment. If you're good about that then one AAA can last you weeks. Leave them on overnight and you'll only get a day or two. I highly recommend picking up a set of Amazon Basics AAA rechargeables. I keep a few in my case and recharge them every couple months when they're drained. One bad thing is the light on the ear cup will blink most of the time (indicating a low battery). That does not mean the battery is dead, and if you are good about turning it off when not in use you'll still have many days or weeks remaining. What's REALLY TERRIBLE is when the battery is close to dead you'll hear these VERY loud clicks through the headphones. It startles the crap out of me every time. I think they make the noise loud so you'll hear them when they're not on your head. If you swap out the battery earlier you'll never run into this problem.It should be noted, these headphones cannot be used while turned off. You'll not just get no noise cancellation, but you'll get no audio either. I had some other noise cancelling headphones without this requirement and wish these had the same flexibility. So keep some spare batteries around.These would be the best headphones I've ever owned even without the noise cancellation. Treat yourself to a pair.

VBest Noise Cancelling but Average Sounding Headphones out there.
p3502
sg5
VWhat's great about it: Quality, The Perfect Everyday HeadphonesWhat's not so great: The price is a little steep. Above average sound.I'm very picky about sound quality and these are perfect in my opinion for the fact that they offer above average sound with excellent noise cancellation. Exactly what I was looking for, these are one of the very few sets of headphones out there that will match (or beat) the sound of a good set of speakers/surround sound. I took awhile to look at some of the other headphones in the price range, hoping to maybe find some just as good for a little cheaper, but found none. Dr. Dre's headphones have a lot of bass, but its took much and doesn't sound good, it gets that vibrating booming bass. Not these though, perfect bass, plenty of boom but its the perfect sound, not too much.Vocals sound amazing on these, much easier to hear, perfectly crisp and clear. I find myself enjoying acoustic songs on these headphones just because they sound so good.Comfort is perfect on these, usually I can't listen to headphones for too long because they start to get annoying. Not these, I found myself wearing these for over 8 hours the other night when I was caught up in a work project. After all that the only thing was they were a little warm on my ears because they completely cover them.Theres a Hi/Lo volume switch on the cord that goes inside the headphone and hides away nicely. This is good for times when you don't want the volume to go too loud. When on the Hi setting they do go very loud, sometimes you get those headphones that just don't go loud enough and they can be really annoying.With these you don't really need to crank up the volume due to the superior noise cancelling feature. Just put them on your head and flip the on switch, and you'll hear it work the noise cancellation magic. They block everything out, even sounds that you didn't realize were there like the fan on your computer, the buzz, the plane's engine rumble, the vibrations etc. You're in your own little audio world. One thing to remember, these tend to block out the highs and lows, but the mids and the vocals around you will be still audible to some extent. Based on my experience this is only a pro as I can still hear someone trying to talk to me while wearing them and I do not go deaf completely.My only two complaints are very minimal. For one, the battery doesn't last that long in my opinion, although I do use them a lot. I've had them for about a 6 weeks and I've changed the battery twice. The battery is supposed to last for about 15 hours according to Bose and mine comes very close to that. Luckily I have rechargeable AAA batteries lying around at my disposal, thus no need to worry about spending a fortune on spares. The second complaint is the price, $300 is a lot to shell out for headphones. Although I don't regret the purchase, they are worth every penny. Go buy them, you won't be disappointed.P.S - Your sound is only as good as your audio chip and the quality of the music file that you are playing. So your mileage may vary. Use it with a headphone amplifier to bring the details out if possible. Otherwise they are still a great sounding headphones, but not the best out there.I would recommend this to a friend!Type of Listener: AudiophileMost Important to Purchase: Noise Cancelation.How Often Used:Daily

VI fly quite a bit and I wanted to make flying more comfortable and one way to do that is noise reduction. I know several people who own and like these headphones and I read the reviews here as well as elsewhere. I am also familiar with the acoustic principles at work, so I decided to give them a try. I found that they irritated my eustation tubes, inner ear and sinuses. I also feel a bit of vertigo and nausea wearing them. My wife reported the same effects. I thought perhaps the symptoms would be masked while in the air due to pressure, noise, etc. The symptoms were strong enough that I didn't want to wear them even while flying.I assume that headphones were functioning properly and they may not affect others the way they affected me or my wife, but that is why I gave 3 stars.Noise Canceling: I didn't expect complete silence and found that the noise canceling worked remarkably well. Active Noise Canceling works well on continuous noise like fans and machinery. It doesn't work well on intermittent noise like barking or talking.At home: I tried them on at home, where I work. I have, at times, quite a few computers running and the fans can be quite noisy. The headphones all but removed the fan noise while I had them on and activated. We also had construction going on in the house with, at times, a circular saw and impact drill into concrete. The headphones significantly reduced the machine noise particularly on the low frequency end.In the airport: The headphones substantially reduced the background noise in the terminal--the constant noise from people talking, walking, etc. I could still hear the announcements over the PA and talk to my wife.In flight: While these headphones reduced the engine noise a great deal, there was still quite a bit of noise outside the covered frequency range from the engines that was now quite pronounced and overall, the noise reduction was not, in my opinion, a significant  enough amount to warrant the purchase price. I still had as much of a hard time hearing the sound played through the QC15 headphones (music, movie dialog) as I did with my regular over the ear headphones.Comfort: I found these headphone quite comfortable. I wore them for several hours at a time at various points while I had them. They are light and don't press on my head. My head could loll around on the headrest with out hitting the cups unlike my much bulkier Plantronics or Senheiser head phones.

p3637

VLet me start by saying that I travel extensively for work and you can't beat these for noise reduction!!!  There is nothing on the market that will reduce airplane noise as well as these QuietComfort headphones do!!  With that said, I have used these for over 4 months now and will assess the good and bad.  First the bad: I was surprised at how cheap they feel (hence the 4 star rating).  When I received mine one of the interior ear cups was off exposing the internals.  After spending this kind of money, I would expect better quality!  I felt OK about it after I stuck it back where it was supposed to be and haven't had any issues with it after that. The good: Once I put them on and turned the power switch on I was immediately happy with my purchase.  I was testing them in a room with my 15 year old daughter watching her "teen shows" and once I turned the power on I was completely immersed in music and couldn't even hear her noisy show.  As I stated at the beginning, I travel a lot and was anticipating my first flight with these headphones.  I was blown away when we took off and I plugged in my iPod.  All ambient noise was drastically reduced and I was in musical heaven.  The fit is very comfortable and the cushioning is great.  Sometimes I forget they are on after a while.  Overall I would highly recommend these for any traveler who wants to submerse themselves in music instead of airplane noise.  I'm sure there are other headphones out there with deeper bass, crisper mids and highs, but if you are looking for noise cancelling, this is as good as it gets!!!

VI fly out of state weekly for business and get asked frequently 'ARE THEY AS GOOD AS THEY SAY?' or 'ARE THOSE THOSE ONES I SEE ON TV?' - they are and their better when you hear them yourself!The noise canceling is the best on the market - and this is statistacally proven, period. When Im allowed to turn them on at 10,000 ft. the sound of the engines nearly vanishes! You can still hear people talking. In fact you can hear the captian talk over the intercom better than if they were off. These headphones were not made to cancel the spoken word, but white, grey and I think pink noise (such as a fan or swamp cooler and such). The sounds that make your ears ring (tinitis) after a while. The saddest part of flights is when your ears get adjusted to the quiet and you have to shut them off for a landing - when you take them off the engines sound 2x louder.Sound quality is more important to me than any feature. Honestly I bought a pair of $200 Sony headphones that ended up getting returned. I spent the extra $100 for these due to the fact I could HEAR the difference. If you enjoy classical, or any high fidelity audio then these are made for you. Roubust BASS, clear trebel and mid tones. You also hear every nuance so much deeper in audio tracks that were lost with such lousy sound equipment. You will want to re-listen to a lot of your music after getting these. THANK YOU BOSE!

VSo I was carrying them around in my backpack in the carrying case.  Went to use them and they no longer worked, (and yes I tried replacing the battery.)  Called Bose support line, Gave them my name, address, when I bought the headphones, and the serial number of the headphones, and they're sending me a replacement headphone., soon as I drop off the broken ones at UPS.  You read that right, they send the replacement, when I drop off the broken ones at UPS, not when Bose gets the broken ones.  Also the replacement headphones comes with their own 1 year warranty.Gotta love Bose, they are the definition of you get what you pay for. Their products are far from cheep, but they are very high quality, and if something does go wrong they take care of you.

p3708
sg5
VThis is the s***!!Pros -1. Nothing, and I mean nothing even comes to the noise cancelation on these things. By far the best pair of ANC/ANR headsets out there.2. The sound diversity is also pretty awesome .. so highly recommend it if you listen to a wide variety of music3. The construction is actually pretty rugged unlike mentioned in some of the comments. I use mine pretty much everyday 3-4 hours for working out, commute, etc.Ignore4. It is one of the lightest pair of ANR headsets .. This begins to matter a lot as you wear them for long durationsCons/Areas of improvements -1. It has a look which I call "Uncle Dad". It's very basic in it's aesthetics. They could definitely do more on design2. The bass is definitely better on some other headsets in the Monster family (i.e Monster & Beats) .. so if most of your music is HipHop & EDM you might like them more3. The form-factor is good, but again the Monster family has been able to do a better job with their foldable form-factor4. There is no passive mode!! This is a big letdown as you might be left stranded without any music/audio if the batteries are low. Also as batteries get low the ANR suffers due to the lower voltage supplied by the battery and can create irritating feedback loop.5. Rechargability is another big let down. If I am paying 300$, I expect state of the art tech. Putting a little rechargable battery would be not that hard and can easily solve problem 4 as well

VGreat Comfort, Fantastic Noise Cancelling
p3827
sg5
VThese Bose QuietComfort headphones cannot be beat on an airplane:  they are comfortable to be worn for hours, and the cabin noise is almost completely blocked out.  They are lightweight, too, so they don't drag on my ears.  I love that they come in a compact, hard case, and that they include two audio cables, one of which can be used for smart phone calls, and an airplane adapter for the few cabins that use the two-prong format.  The Bose headphones don't eat up batteries an old Sennheiser noise cancelling set did.  Still, I always travel with an extra set of batteries.Of course, none of the preceding matters if the sound quality is lacking -- and it's not.  The highs are crisp, the mid-range clear, and the lows  well-reproduced.  I find the sound balanced, with only a slight lean toward bass.  The best part is that vocals and instrumentals are clearly distinguished and not muddied.Because the earphones fold flat and are protected in a case, the Bose are great for travel.  They also do well in the home or office, although, obviously, it's overkill to get these if you don't plan on listened through them in a noisy environment.  For ear-covering headphones, they couldn't possibly get any smaller or lighter.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

They are spendy but seriously worth the price.  It seems that the Sennheisers do a slightly better job at reproducing the original sound, but not while noise cancelling is on.  There's good sound on these with phenominal noise cancelling.  I highly highly recommend these.

V"WHAT DID YOU SAY?"
p3874
sg5
VGot these for my mom.  She loved them.  So she got me a pair.  Now I love them.  And now we have to wave at each other when one or the other of us is talking ("What did you say?" *takes off headphones).  I use them at work to tune out all the ambient noise around me.  I use them on the plane to tune out the crying babies and engine sounds.  I use them for conference calls so I can actually concentrate on what people are saying.  The quality is as you'd expect from Bose.  Some people are not a fan of Bose generally, as they do add sort of a softening element to music - maybe dims the highs and lows to a point that certain types of music are too equalized like you're listening to U2 but with nerd balls on your ears -  but I've had great use from these and will continue to use them for a long time.  The carrying case is sturdy and a great asset.  Wish my non-Bose in ear headphones had something like this, but smaller.  Alas, no. That was a wish.  Note to Self and others: DO turn them OFF when you put them in the case, or the battery stays on. There's a little green indicator light for on.  I forget sometimes and go through single A batteries quickly.  But that's not the fault of the headphones, but of what's between them.  Durp.

p3886

VThese work amazingly well.  I used them in the office to quiet out loud conversations nearby and normal office noise.  I'm not an audiophile so I won't comment on music reproduction, but they seemed fine to me when I used them with CD and radio.  We tested these with people talking directly at me, and that person was muted to a dull whisper.  With music on I could not hear any office noise.One thing to note- when you turn on the noise cancellation, the headphone will create the sensation of pressure in your head, sort of like the sensation on a plane when you descend before your ears pop.  This isn't terrible, but I couldn't wear them for more than a couple of hours.  Several people in the office also tried them and they all experienced the same pressure sensation.  Again, it's not that noticeable at first but after several hours of it, it's a relief to take the headphones off.  This only occurs with noise cancellation turned ON, it's not the ear cups.

VBoth a friend and I bought these `phones, so this is a combined review. I will discuss three areas of the headphone performance. The Bose QC-15 is excellent in noise reduction, but only fair in sound quality and comfort. Those shortcomings can be corrected, resulting in an excellent headphone.Noise cancellation:  The Bose QC-15 was excellent in reducing external noise to near silence. My friend said that when he wore them on his riding mower that it sounded as if a neighbor 300 feet away was mowing.  He set the music level when the mower was off, and didn't have to raise it while mowing. I used them on two airplane flights, and the noise reduction was considerable, allowing me to listen to quiet Enya music at normal levels. At home, contrary to other reports, I found that the headphones attenuated TV sound (music and conversation) enough that I could enjoy the silence, or listen to music.Sound quality:  The Bose QC-15 headphones have fair sound quality, but it can be improved with a little work.  Out of the box, the phones had flat bass down to about 33 Hz, better than any other phones I have had. The bass sounded as though it had a Q of 0.7, which is tighter than a ported speaker, but not as good as a sealed speaker with an ideal Q of 0.577. The response was pretty flat through the vocal range, but had 1 dB dip at 2KHz, and a big 3 dB peak around 3KHz, and several ripples in the higher response. Consequently, the phones sounded harsh. This can be somewhat corrected by using the equalizer in the mp3 player to reduce the peak around 3 KHz. More accurate frequency compensation can be done using a computer to pre-equalize the music prior to recording it to the final file.  The curve I used is shown in the list below, and it makes them sound much closer to audiophile headphones.The headphones have an input impedance of over 1 megohm, due to the electronic circuitry, and thus are not affected by the output impedance of the source. So no audiophile headphone amp is needed.The headphones are fairly insensitive to wind.  I found only minimal interference with winds of 10-15 mph. Other noise canceling phones do much worse. I was able to listen to music outside on breezy days with no problems.Comfort:  The Bose QC-15 was not comfortable for me.  I found that the headband pressed hard on the top peak of my head, making it sore.  The phones are built for someone with a relatively broad, flat head, and mine is narrow and more pointed. I added tapered foam pieces at the side, which distributed the pressure more evenly over my skull, and that fixed the problem but ruined the styling of the headphone.  On the other hand, my friend had no trouble with comfort at all.  So I suggest you buy these phones from a place that will refund your money if you cannot make them comfortable.Out of the box these are three star headphones, but the fixes make them much better.Frequency compensation:<30 Hz  +4dB33Hz +3dB40Hz +1dB60Hz +1dB100Hz 0 dB130Hz +2dB150Hz 0dB1.6KHz 0dB2KHz +1.5dB2.7KHz 0dB2.9KHz -3dB3.9KHz -3dB4.5KHz 0dB5KHz 0dB6KHz -2dB8KHz 0dB9KHz - 20KHz +3dB

VExcellent to create an isolated work environment
p3897
sg5
VI do love these and I use them daily at work to create an interrupt free work environment.By themselves, they do not totally eliminate any talking in the vicinity.  Even conversations out in the hallway still come through.  The affect when I switch them on is quite amazing and impressive none the less.  Add in music on top of the noise cancelling and they are extremely effective at providing a sense of isolation in a noisy environment.The cord does seem awful flimsy but, I have snagged it on the arm of my chair multiple times, ripping the headphones off my head, or more preferably yanking the plug out of the headset and they have survived so far.What I really want is a stereo bluetooth module that plugs seamlessly into the jack in the headset.  It seems such an obvious add on.  Hopefully someday Bose will provide that.  In the meantime, there are a number of Youtube videos of people having a go at building their own and I intend to attempt one myself.I'm not much of an audiophile so I have no idea if the Bose quality justifies the price.  I can wear them comfortably for hours which is saying a lot.

p3913
sg5
VThese are great when they work, but this is the 2nd time that mine have broken. I was extremely careful with them this second time and they still broke after 5-6 uses. For my iphone and other sound sources, only part of the sound comes through. For example, with music, I can only hear certain elements of the song, not all. It makes them unusable and now unfortunately I am out of the return window. Otherwise they are great but I would discourage anyone from buying them because they are prone to malfunction.

VSuperb noise canceling, poor durability
p3978
sg5
VPurchased these headphones as the best in class for noise canceling. And that's quite true, noise canceling is really superb. Also they are very light and comfortable to wear.However, since the day one I didn't feel like they are worth the price I paid for it.In overall they feel very tender and you definitely don't want to carry them around without case. Cable is quite flimsy too.Finally, after 2 years of using them - padding on the headband wore off as well as on the ear cushions (up to the foam). Maybe it's OK for 2 years of quite modest usage, but doesn't feel right for me for the price asked.In the end, switched to V-moda crossfade m-100 - that aren't active noise canceling headphones, but good enough for noise isolation, have brilliant sound, military grade build quality and coming in the case twice smaller than these Bose QC15 (which is much better for travel).Verdict: brilliant noise canceling and sound, with very poor durability and overall bad value/price ratio.

VThese are a MUST have for air travel. They are expensive but by far the most comfortable headphones I've owned...and I've owned over 20 pairs of headphones in my recording studio over the years.The noise cancel feature must be turned on and batteries working in order to get any sound out of the headphones which is a limitation, but they do work well.  When you use them, you'll notice a lot of the room noise get canceled out, mostly the lows.  You're left with some high end "white noise" sounding left over however when running music or whatever, you don't notice any of that.Battery life is great, I've yet to have to replace any batteries in mine and have run them for a full 24 hours now.I can easily wear these all day, it's amazing how light weight they are, almost feels like they're not on your head at times.

p4007
sg5
VI'd like to be able to review the quality of manufacturing separately from the quality of sound, but since that is not possible I'd say the average is about three stars.  Sound quality is superb, but materials are horrible.  The padding for the ear pads and the head band start to shed after about a year of use causing your ears and head to have little black rubber bits on them.  This is highly annoying and you have to always check in the mirror after wearing them.  I have always kept them in the case when not in use as well.  This is the second pair of bose headphones I have owned and the first pair did the same thing.  Overall great sound, but I'm sure other similar level brands are comparable.  This issue may sound minor but once they start shedding, it isn't.  I will not buy these again.

VAs of today (Sept 3, 2014) these are obsolete.  Bose has just announced (for the same price) the QC25 headphones.  Besides the audio and design improvements, a major benefit is that music will still play when the battery dies...you just won't have the noise-cancelling feature.  Bose offers (for $100 more) a color choice option, enabling buyers to design their own headphones in the colors they want.  An already great pair of headphones is now improved dramatically.  They also fold more compactly too.  I noticed big discounts the past week or two on the QC15s...now I know why.

Besides the obvious use on an airplane, I use them at home for watching Netflix on my Ipad  as well as music off my phone and ipad.  A must have!!!!

Sound quality is also great. I listen to different kinds of music (electronic, hip hop and what not) and I like that its not too bass heavy as the beats by Dre. A big plus is also that they are not pressuring on your ears. 5/5 would buy again

p4290
sg5
VLike some of the other one star reviews, I loved these headphones. 9 months after I bought them the battery portion failed, and the headphones are useless without an active battery connection. Since still under warranty, they replaced the head phones. Now, two months after end of warranty the second pair of headphones failed just the way the first set failed. You would think that at these prices a simple battery connection would not be such a significant problem.

VAwesome Noise Canceling Headphones
p4331
sg5
VThe head phones are awesome and reduce and astonishing amount of back ground noise (street and subway). You can still hear people talking a bit but it's very muted and greatly reduced from having no headphones on. I am very pleased with the sound quality, especially with the bass, but that's because I'd been wearing in ear headphones for the last several months. Basically the sound quality is more than passable.I have an exceptionally large head and they fit better than I expected. They do make my ears very warm, but that's expected. I'm also not sure they'd stay in place if I were to exercise, but walking 10 blocks and riding the metro for 45 minutes, they are great.

p4412

VI have been very happy with these headphones. I'm not a sound connoisseur, but I think the headphones produce an excellent sound. I think the noise canceling is very effective. They are also very comfortable around your ears. I found that many other headphones left my ears sore after use. I never have that feeling with these headphones. I've had them for two years and no part of the headphones have broken (knock on wood). I was initially turned off by the price, but I've used them so consistently for the past two years that I feel my investment was worth it.I would highly recommend this product.

VMake sure you get a real pair of QC15s
p4489
sg5
VCAUTION. I originally purchased from an Amazon 3rd party seller and received a very convincing pair of fakes. It is worth paying the extra money to buy directly from Amazon. I inspected the headset for a serial number upon arrival, if I hadn't I never would have known. If you do buy from a 3rd party seller, make sure there is a serial number inside the right earcup and another quality inspection tab in the left earcup with colored marks. Also, a real headset, the cord plugs very easily and smoothly into the headset, the fake ones don't. The fake ones also do not have totally flush plasic on the bottom of the ear cup, the real ones do.The light is brighter on the real headset as well. I did not try to noise cancelling or the sound quality of the fake onesThe Bose QC15 is pure awesome. I have a pair of Sony noise-cancelling and Audio Techna noise-cancelling. As far as noise-cancelling goes, these are the best. Value, not so much, but if you are looking for the best, this is it.I use these in a single engine airplane with the UFLYMIKE setup and these block out noise just as well as my Bose X headphones

VBest headphone to use on a long flight
p4501

VBest headphone to use on a long flight!Having owed it for quite awhile now I have used the Bose QuietComfort 15 for different occasions and come to learn about its pros and cons.Pro:1. Very comfortable over the headSince I sometimes go on flights as long as 16 hours, some headphones have proved to be very uncomfortable and I have to take them off after an hour or two. (I will not name them here..) But this is not the case here. I have put on music through the on-flight entertainment system and fall asleep with these headphones countless times on long flights now. They can twist on some parts making it not too rigid for you to move around and twist your head to sleep on pillows and windows.2. Awesome noise canceling abilityIt is true that this headphone does not filter out ALL noise, but it does a very good job with it. When you wear it, it is still possible to hear people talking around you, especially if they're right next to you. However, it filters out extremely high and extremely low frequencies, which is usually what bothers people. When I get on an airplane, I turn the headphones on, BOOM! No more loud humming on the flight engine, no more small chatters from the passengers around me, baby cries are usually filtered out unless they're right in front or behind me.3. Portable and convenientIt comes with its own zipper hard case that has a little zipper bags attached inside. I usually keep spare batteries inside in case juice runs out.Pros:1. Bulky to carry aroundSince the top headband does not bend, you have to keep the headphone unfolded in its case, which makes the case rather bulky to carry around. When I travel I usually have to keep all my personal belongings in a handbag, including my passport, traveling documents, laptop and various other stuff, and the headphone case usually make my bag almost un-closable. I guess I can definitely bring a bigger bag but that would mean my belongings cannot fit at my feet but in the overhead compartment, which makes it easier to be accessible by other people.2. Unnatural for phone conversationsSince it cancels out background noise and does a good job with it, when your surrounding is normally quiet and you're trying to use its microphone functionality, you won't be able to hear yourself like you normally do. It might be hard to imagine that being a disadvantage, but it is a effect called Delayed Auditory Feedback which is known to delay thoughts. It should be okay when you're just having a normal conversation, but it will not be great to use it when you're on a phone interview..Tips:1. Buy rechargeable batteries and keep them in case so you will never run out of battery!2. Always carry headphone inside hard case provided to prevent damages!This is a pair of great headphones! I will not hesitate to buy again if I have the choice.Hope this helps! :>

p4564
sg5
VI am always the lucky one who gets seated on a plane next to that family with the newborn and restless 2-year old who wants everyone to know that he/she is there. Well, no more restless plane rides with these babies. It completely cancels out all outside noise. These aren't earplugs, so if you're not listening to anything and just have these rested on your head, you will be able to hear outside noise. They are very comfortable. I have a large size head, so most headphones leave me with a minor headache after a few hours of use. Not these. On my last international flight, I wore these for several hours with no problems. The case is a nice size. Not too big. You can stuff a few other things inside it besides the headphones and its accessories. I'm really happy with this purchase and these come high recommended!!

Just got back from using them on different airlines flying 6 hours to Brussels, then to Munich, Budapest, Bucharest to Frankfort and back to Toronto.  Lots of hours and I didn't have to listen to the engines or the babies crying.  Worth every penny!!!

I hook up to my iPhone and have a playlist created called "Mowing" and just mow for about 4 hours straight.  Saying Bose says it all.  The quality is in the name as well as the product.

VLove them.  They are my new favorite headphones.  Noise cancellation works great.  Sound quality is great.This was my first pair of noise cancelling headphones.  Purchased these on the recommendation of a friend.  Like these a lot more than my wireless Beats by Dre.The wire can be disconnected from the headphones and sometimes I wear the headphones while not listening to anything simply to enjoy the silence.  In a world where there is constantly noise, it's nice to have silence sometimes to rest the ears.Love the carrying case too.  It's high quality and slim so it fits well in a small backpack for use on a plane and travelling.  I've heard great things about how these work on planes and I look forward to using them on my next flight.

VThese headphones are great. The noise cancelling works well, they have good sound. I bought them 3 or 4 years ago. My biggest complaint about them is the cord. If you buy this headphones, make sure you keep this link handy (http://www.amazon.com/Bose%C2%AE-QuietComfort%C2%AE-15-audio-cable/dp/B008F5JZVC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top). It is a link to a replacement cable. I was just about to order my third replacement cable since I've owned the headphones. The sheathing around the headphone jack comes apart and exposes the wires. Same place every time.

p4640

VThese are exactly what I need at the office. I work in a space with several co-workers. From time to time, they will have conversations with others at their desks. This gets extremely distracting. I need to stay focused on my work and noise really makes it tough for me. Plus, we have an HVAC system that is constantly making some type of fan noise. Throw in a few desk fans in the summer or a space heater in the winter, and it just all adds up. I honestly didn't notice how much of an impact all of this noise was making until the first day I wore my Bose QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones. I couldn't believe now much more focused, relaxed, and energized I was. I went home and told my wife that these things were saving my sanity. OK, that may have been a stretch, but they sure made the workday less stressful. I haven't even talked about the quality of the sound I get from these babies. These are definitely full range speakers. The fullness of the low end, the crispness of the highs, all make for an immersive experience when I am listening to my favorite tunes. I am thrilled to finally have a pair of these. I hope they last as long as all of the other Bose products I have owned over the years.

p4657
sg5
VI am the owner of a Bose QC3 set of headphones for some years. The quality of the sound is excellent, but after a  year or so the padding that goes over the ears started fraying and detaching itself from the speaker. I felt the only shortcoming in that otherwise great product was that one shoddy piece of construction. I finally put down three hundred bucks to buy the QC15 expecting the same outstanding sound quality. I was not disappointed. If you want to listen to music shutting out as much ambient noise as possible, there is not a better product. There are cheaper ones, but none better. I was hoping the construction of the earpiece padding would have been significantly improved, but that does not seem to be the case. I have taken off one start for this reason.

They're perfect, too, for watching a movie or whatever and yet hearing the register of the flight attendants.

VAttitude improvement headphones
p4722
sg5
VNothing will cancel out the sound of a crying baby or yowling cat, nor will noise cancelling headphones prevent turbulence or keep the person behind you from kicking your seat or shaking your headrest.  The only thing that will save you on travel "days" that keep you in the back of  planes for over 24 hours is a good attitude.These headphones improve my attitude considerably.  I can actually hear the movie on the plane without risking shattering my eardrums (when the entertainment system is actually working).  I can hear the movies and music from my iPad.  When I think to bring the cord to use with my phone, I can even take call in the airport.  When I'm not listening to anything, they reduce the roar of the engines to a murmur.The most important thing about these headphones is that I don't have to worry about lost parts. I'm sure that a lot of headphones are of great quality but being able to get replacement parts quickly is essential for qualifying as a great overall product.  Both Bose and Amazon have been amazing on cord and adapter replacement.  Despite short turnaround times, I have never been long without functioning headphones and I've never thought to buy spares.  This has made me a Bose Believer.  I recommend these to all of the newbies stuck traveling with me.The only drawback to these headphones is that, when in the protective case, they are rather bulky.  Some of the people I travel with carry the headphones without the case.  I am not that brave.  However, the case is spacious enough to be able to carry extra batteries (it has a little zip pouch) and other assorted small essentials.

VSimply Amazing, 100% Worth It
p4727
sg5
VLove these.  Very comfy, and I have a big head.  Most headphones get uncomfortable, I think urban ears were the last ones I used prior to purchasing because of this.  I could wear these for hours, and I often do for travelling or studying.  Sound quality is great, and the noise canceling aspect is fantastic. I can study in a busy room, and it cuts out all of the murmur (sometimes I only use them for this, with no music playing).  Because they are actuivr, they are great at this, but if someone calls my name, I can usually hear without them having to shout. This is a big improvement over passive/sound isolating headphones I had used previously (mostly the sealed in ear style).  These work great in loud environments like on airplanes where previous ones I had tried left a lot to be desired.  They aren't the cheapest, but the quality (sound, function, and build) is simply top notch and worth every penny. My entire family each bought their own pair after trying mine.

VA little pricey, but the noise canceling quality is the best on the market.  Did a lot of research and initially bought a cheap pair of sony noise canceling headphones.  They don't compare to this.  Bought these for movies on airplanes.  They only cancell noise when you have them on and are listening to something ie music or movie.  If you turn them on and don't have them connected to a computer or iPod they don't cancell any noise.  I have had them for a year and still love them, and bought one for my wife.

VI've owned these for a very long time.  They are exactly what the name describes.  It is probably the best in noise cancelling technology.  It doesn't magically block everything, but it does an excellent job.  It is also very comfortable, not like other cheap headphones.  I can wear these for hours and forget I'm even wearing them.  The battery does die over time, but I use rechargeable batteries.  The sound quality is good, but not what I expected from Bose.  They are very good, just not the best.  Also, if I wear them for a long time without any music playing, I start to hear almost a ringing in my ears, but I am very sensitive to those kinds of things. It is only after a very long time, and shouldn't bother most people anyway.

VThese are, in their own way, a small superpower.  Put them on and whatever vile cacophony surrounds you fades to the background.  Have at this point used them on several flights, he better part of a day waiting at LAX, when the leaf blower guy or gal comes across the street, and for nearly all my phone calls.The AAA battery may seem silly in an era when you can't even replace the batteries on your computer -- but if you're on the road for a few days or just are not on top of every device that needs charging, it's just right.I broke the cord with the mic and went to the local Bose store to buy a replacement.  They simply replaced it (though there is no formal policy).  The framework seems to be Apple type prices and Apple type service.I happen to like full ear headphones, and of course, my roomies 100 dollar Sony phones are a little better on some audio.  But if you have to focus in noisy environments, these can't be beat.  When these finally die, I will be replacing them with as close to the same thing as I can get.

Vthe right tool for the job.
p4884
sg5
VMy father always stressed to me the importance of the right to for the job. I figured that was an absolute. It's therefore surprising to see how many negative reviews of these headphones are written by people who use them in an application for which they were never designed.Let me first say that these headphones are built for a specific purpose.  That is to actively cancel the background white noise typically found in commercial aircraft.  In doing so, they allow the user to experience their music at a much safer volume than would be required with a "normal" set of phones.While they sound OK.  They are rather "flat" sounding and have a surprisingly weak bass response out of the box, especially compared to other Bose products.  Unlike my other Bose products I find myself having to EQ these phones quite a bit to get an adequately rich sound.In a quiet environment, I prefer my Sennheiser PX-100ii or my Koss PortaPro any day of the week.  The Sennheisers and Koss phones simply sound better with little or no EQ required.  They are also a fraction of the cost of the QC-15 at roughly $59 and $39 respectively.However, when used in a noisy environment, those light weight headphones with their on the ear design and open back are entirely inappropriate.  You would need to drive the volume so high on those phones to drown out the background noise that your ears would be begging for mercy within an hour.  I know...I've tried.  I never truly appreciated my QC-15's until I took them on a 12+ hour flight overseas and noticed just how much less my ears were fatigued.There is one reason AND ONLY ONE REASON to buy the QC-15.  That reason is if you frequently find yourself in an area with high background white noise and you wish to cancel out that noise.  For that, the QC-15 absolutely has no peer and is worth every penny spent.  However, if you do not require the active sound isolation that these headphones provide, you will find much better sounding phones at a fraction of the price.

p4931

VI have owned my pair of QC15's for about 2 and a half years now. I use them daily in the office, and on flights between Australia and the UK.Construction:Initially I was surprised by the plastic materials of a $300 pair of headphones. After lots of use, I am very comfortable with them. They are not light weight, but are astonishingly comfortable.Comfort:Holy sleeping airline passengers Batman! I have worn those nasty on-ear headphones you get on flights before, and used in-ear headphones to sleep on flights. These are not just in a different league, I suspect they are playing a different sport. (Obviously they are - NC vs no cancelling!). My ears did not hurt from being pressed back against my head, as with on-ear headphones and the inner ears do not hurt as with in-ear headphones. I wear them at least 4 hours a day, sometimes up to 10 hours a day at work. The only issue is that when the company "saves" money by not having the aircon going, I tend to sweat in them (this is not a sexy look).Sound:I am not an audiophile. I have tried various over and on-ear headphones in stores, and cannot tell anything between them. They all sound good. The GC15 is no different.Noise cancelling:I think the key term here is "noise". They do not cancel voices, they soften the background noise. Jet engines, keyboards, aircon, general hustle and bustle in the office away from where you are. Occasionally ring tones of my phone (I wasn't ignoring you, honest boss!).Also, I took a Qantas Dash-8 on an internal flight recently and was in for a shock. I basically sat down and put my headphones on - got rid of the cable to show that they were no plugged in. Took off, all good. Love those propeller planes. Half way through the flight I turned my headphones off to the hostess. Actually jumped at how noisy the inside of the plane was in comparison to what the Bose was reducing the ambient volume to!Battery life:I use Duracell AAA batteries. I get weeks at a time with them, with the use specified above. The pouch has a Velcro holder for the airline plug and for additional batteries. I have read reviews which state they get less from their QC15's. Only thing I can think of is that they use cheaper batteries/rechargeable. And whilst they probably have better economy as a $/minute use, I think you cannot complain about battery life if you do that.Changes:A few things I would like changed. Bose, goodness sake stop pandering only to Apple customers with your leads and sound systems. Android has a huge fan base and we would love to have controls on the phone line.I would love to see an add on for the headphones: a Bluetooth attachment. I have seen DIY versions, but nothing which I would be happy to have dangling out of my ear. Yes, it would probably need its own battery, but please just make one. These headphones would be brilliant to walk around with then. (ps: I know I have just asked for a lead, and then a thing to take the lead away, but in answer to that inconsistency: Shhhh.)Get rid of the tacky "Bose greeting cards" stored in the pouch. You have a marketing department. They should know better than this.Summary:If you travel on planes (ignoring those freaky quiet A380s - seriously they are amazing), or work in a noisy workplace, or just like getting away from the background noise, then get these.

VWhat I Expected:  Fair noise cancellation with compromised sound quality (acceptable but not great).What I Got:  Amazing noise cancellation with surprisingly good, rich sound.I had listened to other noise canceling headphones in the past - some Bose and one other.  So, I wasn't prepared for the quiet of these headphones and the sound that came from that "quiet-as-black-velvet" background.I listen to everything from audiobooks to demanding music - orchestral, pipe organ, jazz, and classic rock.  The sound of these Bose headphones isn't as good as my Sennheiser 598s, but try using those open phones anywhere but in a quiet room - it's almost impossible to enjoy your music, and in an airplane - forget it!  My trusty Sony V6 phones have a good seal and great sound but constant sounds are still there to spoil the listen. The Bose QuietComfort 15s sound almost as good as the Sony V6, they're just as comfortable - but the quiet - truly astonishing.Quiet - Comfort - Sound - - it's all there.  Worth the money, period!

VNot for me.  These headphones have great sound quality and at first I really liked them.  I bought them to primarily help cancel out my kids shows as I watched videos to help me prepare for an exam.  The noise canceling on these headphones is great at canceling out low frequency noise (like jet engines), but not for canceling out talking of little ones.  This is not the reason I returned them though.  Every time I put them on I felt like I was underwater and it was kind of disorienting.  I had to return them as this feeling started to give me headaches every time I wore them.  Build quality was very good, so I can't say the product was bad, but it just didn't work for me.

VMy husband bought these headphones after trying many others. He loves them! They are so noise cancelling, I literally have to tap him if I need to talk to him. He uses the 20' extension cable with the headphones to watch TV. He can have the TV on as loud as he wants and doesn't disturb anyone else in the house! Works great!

VThese are perfect for flights. The only cons I have for this right now is that the price is high, it requires 1 AAA battery for it to work, and the quality of materials do not seem to be top of the line, which has me a little concerned with the long-term durability.With that being said, I'll tell you why I love these, and why I think you should get them if you are the market for some noise canceling headphones.They cancel all the jet noise in a plane. Other over-the-ear headphones I have had issues hearing my devices on 100% volume, even ones with a battery powered noise booster. With these I have my volume about 50% and can hear clearly.The sound quality is great and what you would expect from Bose.The ear and head padding are very soft and comfortable even when wearing glasses.It comes with two detachable cords, one that is compatible with 'some' iPhones and iPods, which has a microphone and volume control inline. Although it doesn't specifically say which ones it does not work with. The second cord is just a plain cord.It comes with a very nice hard storage case to prevent them from getting damaged. The case is large enough to hold both detachable cords and a few extra batteries in a mesh zipper pouch that can be removed or repositioned with velcro.I am surprised I spent so much money on headphones, but these are amazing. I would recommend them to someone in the market for excellent noise canceling technology.

I have sennheiser  hd 650  for big system...the Bose are better for computer, phone, but sound good a big system too.  I use Bose for travel and any portable use which is a lot. I wish they made the ear cover leather skins a bit thicker so they would last longer. Very good headphone and still awesome for quiet even sound. Noise canceling works great...nine better out there.  With recent price drop and free shipping now is the time to buy them.

I am slightly hard of hearing anyway, but the noise cancellation on the $50 Sony's was really hard to detect. Once I put on these Bose headphones and turned them on, it was as if I was in a silence chamber and the sound from my iPad came through loud and clear, even on the plane. I am very happy with these headphones.

VGreat headphones, you pay for the name. But thats not really a bad thing.
p5058
sg5
VThese headphones are really a great buy. They aren't perfect, If there was a 4.6 out of 5 I would rate these cans as such. I will go into detail on 3 differentiating factors that make these headphones exceptionally higher than other pairs in its price range.#1. The Noise canceling. The active noise canceling is absolutely unreal. The way they just completely shut out the world around you is astonishing. I frequently ride a bus to my classes and my QC 15s with music playing completely silences the white noise around you. The only con with the noise cancellation is the issue with the battery in my unit. When the bus hits a pot hole my headphones battery will slightly come lose and then re-power, consequently completely stopping audio playback followed by an annoying click noise. Other wise, noise cancellation is an easy 9.4 out of 10.#2. The design. The design of these headphones is very conservative and classy. They achieve a certain level of simplicity but still remain functional in their own right. The headphones have a very clever way of becoming portable, I was coming to Bose from a pair of Beats Studios which collapsed and fit in a small carrying case, The bose headphones ear cups operate on a swivel that allows the headphones to achieve a surprisingly portable form factor. They fit in my bag perfectly with my MacBook air and books. The one and only con of the design of these headphones is that they feel cheap in the hand, now I know that you normally don't hold your headphones in your hand for too long but when I take the phones off the just feel flimsy and cheap. Overall a 8.9 out of 10.#3. The sound. The sound of these headphones is a very flat and even sound. Bose accurately reproduces sound that will be more than satisfactory for the average consumer but audiophiles may feel differently. The Bose QC15s are not for bass heads and thats totally ok. They have phenomenal highs and rich treble, and while the bass isn't rumbling it presents just enough punch to make hip-hop or dub step work. These cans do their best work for me when I listen to Coldplay, Ed Sherran, or Daft Punk. The headphones have a tough time with most hip hop, dub step, and modern pop. The headphones are also absolutely sublime when listening to strings. Overall a 9.5 out of 10.And that does it, a pair of headphones that cancel noise like nothing else, sound great, but are overall poorly designed from a durability standpoint. These are more then good enough headphones for the 99% of people out there in the 300 and up market.

p5063
sg5
VAfter trying several other brands I finally gave up and bought the QuietComfort 15 headphones and have not been disappointed, except for price.  Apparently Bose tightly controls the retail price of its products since there is almost no deviation regardless of the outlet.  Noise cancelling feature works well and headphones are light and comfortable but seem a little flimsy, especially compared to some of the less-expensive competition.  Still, appears to be the best product for travellers looking for an over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphone.

p5069

V. . . were wearing these headphones.I use these every day at work so that I can concentrate on writing code because I have the operations manager right next to me. Why they would have a programmer sit next to someone who talks all day long? I guess she likes me. But she's nice, and so are these headphones!These headphones also work well at home. I have an upstairs neighbor who I will name Thumbelina to protect the innocent. I cannot understand how such a tiny girl can clomp around like a Clydesdale every moment she is home. Do these work to drown her out? The short answer is 'yes'.Now, I don't want to pretend that these headphones totally cancel out an unruly neighbor. That would be like saying a positive attitude will fix all the problems in your life. These headphones just make things better than if I wasn't wearing them, much like a positive attitude will help you do everything better than a negative attitude will. So with these babies, I can watch a movie and not think about Thumbelina the horse upstairs.So what do you get?1. AMAZING noise reduction for periodic noise, such as the hum of an air-conditioner or the engines on an airplane.2. Good noise reduction for the Clydesdale who lives above you.3. Good noise reduction for the chatty-Cathy who sits next to you.For me, these headphones are a game changer. They're comfortable, the fidelity is good, and they do a reasonable job at noise cancellation.So . . . why only four stars? They're a little flimsy. I am extra, extra careful with these because I want them to last. Even so, I suspect they will only make it about a year or two. I'd give them 4.25 stars if that was an option.How about the cost? I think these were about three bills when I got them. Yeah . . . they're worth the cost. I would totally do it again.How about the battery consumption? Not bad, actually. I would say I replace the single AAA battery every other week or so.Fidelity? They aren't studio monitors, if that's what you mean. They're good enough for me, but I am not an audiophile. I listen to radio program podcasts that are 56Kbps.

p5080
sg5
VI did not buy these headphones from Amazon as I wanted them right away and did want to wait for delivery.These noise cancelling phones are the best. They totally block our office white noise, which is at a very high level. The sound quality is wonderful, typical Bose quality. Yes, they are a little pricey, but they are worth it. When you are listening to digital music you start first with the sound closer to you and spend your money there. As you get further away from the sound in your ear you can afford lessor quality components.  I highly, highly recommend these headphones if you really want noise cancelling and high quality sound.

p5085
sg5
VI've been thinking of picking up a pair of Bose QuietComfort 15 for a while now. And while it doesn't silence every noise (I can still faintly hear coworkers talking nearby, for instance), it wipes out nearly all ambient noise in the office. We've got a very loud fan on just a few feet away that one of my coworkers calls the freight train. Even when there isn't any music on, these headphones silences it.The music reproduction is OK--you won't get the same type of bass out of a set of Beats, for instance--so if audio quality is your thing, you may want to look elsewhere. But you're looking for a little more solitude, these headphones are awesome. I can't wait to try these on my next flight.

VSo,2 years ago, I tried these with a 30 day free trial and absolutely was blown away by the beautiful clarity and"MOST COMFORTABLE" headphones I had ever heard. Then they were $300. Well, even if I loved them so much at the time I just couldn't afford them after the trial. Now,2yrs. later, they came down on price a little and I bought them through BOSE.So,they arrived in about 5 days,free shipping, and I was just as blown away as the first time, except this time they're mine!! If you want a great pair of headphones for music or the noise canceling, or both these are what you invest in. Also, if you can't afford the total price at once, go through the BOSE website and call and order you a pair and they will even finance you them for $23 a month for12 months. Trust me, you will not have buyer's regret.

VI have had a pair of Beats before and they just pressed on my ears after a few minutes of use. These headphones are wonderful and you get what you pay for. After a few minutes of use I forget they are on and can last hours without getting a headache like the Beats did. The only downside is you must have the noise cancelling on to listen to music, but that is hardly a kicker, just one small thing. It comes with a great travel case so carrying extra batteries is always an option. At times I will use the headset also to double as a nice noise canceller for sleeping on an airplane, studying, or just wanting some quiet but not the music.

VI rarely use these for audio beyond an occasional books on tape so I will not comment on the audio quality. Instead I bought these for a period of time I was going to have to work from home and I needed to be able to tune out the background noise.I never knew my house could be as quiet as these headphones made it seem. At first it was actually a little unsettling how quiet it was, like watching a clock without hearing it tick, but you acclimate quickly. To be clear these only eliminate the annoying low level background sounds (think running water, buzzing ceiling fan, humming AC unit, and road noise) and they dull, but not eliminate most other noises (think people talking in the other room, the phone ringing, that annoying cup that keep bouncing around in the dishwasher). But everything is reduced to the point where you can easily focus on your work.I have also used these to allow me to comfortably sleep on a 4 hour bus ride and a transatlantic flight. At least comfortably when it came to sound, unfortunately they do not do anything for the seats for find on busses or in coach.My only regret was not purchasing them earlier, now I keep them in my desk for moments when I need to focus.

VThese headphones muffle steady background noise such as the whine of the jet engines or a screaming baby, yet you can still clearly hear the crew announcements. They are comfortable for a three-hour flight and you can actually hear your music or movie soundtrack without cranking the volume way up. Flip on the switch and most of the noise falls way into the background. As for the sound, they are not the tip-top high-end but they are quite good. The sound is well balanced and musical. If you appreciate jazz, classical, or pop singing, you will like them. if you are looking for pumped-up, head-banging bass, look elsewhere. They come with a volume control/microphone on the cord for use with a wireless phone. I would buy them again.

The fit is extremely comfortable, have fell asleep a full night to find the headphones still in my head without leaving any marks or pains. I only wish they would drop the price, but I guess you will get what you paid for.

VExcellent noise cancellation, great sound with a couple annoyances
p5235
sg5
VThese are built well and do an astonishingly great job of cancelling noise especially when you flying transatlantic in a loud 777. The amazing thing is that they remove the noise per se but a person sitting next to you doesn't need to yell at you to be heard. The relevant sounds still come through with ease. Not sure how Bose does it but they do it very well. Well the exception being that if you're listening to death metal djent cranked up high on your audio player then nothing can help you.The packaging quality is great and it comes in its own case that is very handy (caveat*) if one were to carry these around during travels and such. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that I wish these worked without the need to switch on noise cancelling every time. Without switching the headphones "on" these simply produce no sound. And I feel that is quite lame. Heck I may sometimes just want  to listen to music while working in my quiet office where there may be no need for noise cancelling. Then why do I need to use up battery just to be able to hear music. Quite lame Bose....stupid actually.My other gripe with these otherwise great headphones is that I wish the spatial real estate they required was a little less. Yes it comes with its own carry case and such but I wish Bose had developed some better fold-able ergonomic wherein you could fold these in to make them more compact so they could fit in a smaller pocket or something. Right now with the way they are they require a decent amount of carry-on baggage space. Wish they could be more compact. That's all.PROS:Excellent sound qualityGreat buildCrazy good noise cancelling capabilityCONS:Read above

p5240

VIf you can get past the price tag and the somewhat average build quality feel (I say that, but I've never damaged a pair), these headphones perform very well. While I've used other high-quality headphones, I keep coming back to these for their very good sound canceling technology, reasonably balanced audio (not base heavy), and comfortable fit. As a person with large ears, it's nice that they fit comfortably without sacrificing portability.If you really don't need noise cancelation, these may not be the headphones for you -or- there are other better options out there at a much more reasonable price.

VNot the Audiophile Type of Headphones - SOUNDS LIKE GARBAGE!
p5316
sg5
VI've had these headphones for around three and half years as a Christmas present. Now I will have to say that once you start using it, the sound quality and noise canceling are great. But through all this time I've been using them, I cared more about sound quality and I could careless about the noise-cancelling (best noise canceling headphones I've ever used) because I prefer the IEMs more than I do with cup headphones. The thing with me is that I've used Klipsch IEMs and I loved them because they filled my ear canal with their oval ear tips and the sound quality was the best I've heard so far; however they broke all the time and it's been annoying. But now I'm starting to research on the higher end headphones from Westone. Now these Bose headphones are durable and comfortable, I will give Bose credit for that. But if you're looking for some high-end, detailed headphones with great all around sound from highs, mids, and lows, these are not them. I play a lot of genres and most of my music has been produced with a lot of bass response, with nice mids and highs, but I'm experiencing now that I'm becoming an audiophile. If you really care about your sound from your music, don't avoid just these headphones, avoid all the Bose headphones and other products from Bose because I even have a car speaker system made by Bose and I cranked the bass all the way up, the bass response is still HORRIBLE! Bose cares way too much about their money and becoming a marketing pioneer. In fact these headphones don't even sound like $300 headphones; sound more like $130 headphones. Also, these for right now are my back up headphones until I get a professional pair of IEMs from Westone. I can't wait to buy new headphones because these ones can't offer me appalling sound quality. I'll never buy Bose or any headphones that are marketed.Go for the sound that you want, not of what everyone else has because it's POPULAR. If you go with everyone else, you're wasting your money and not hearing what you really want. BOSE stands for Better Off with Superior Earphones

My last set of Bose had an issue where the material around the ear pads started to fade out and get on my face. I haven't had any issues with these, the sound quality is absolutely amazing and noise cancelling technology gets rid of background hum and people talking which is great for the office or on the plane.My only complaint is you can't listen to anything without a aaa battery. So I always make sure I've packed away extras in my case so I don't get stuck somewhere without the ability to use them. They've become an essential productivity tool for me since I can just pull them out anywhere I go and zone out to get work done.

VI've been using QC3's for a few years now, they've always been my trusted head phones for flights - lots of them The downside was the cable needed replacement every year or so and the ear pads every couple of years - not a big deal to me. Finally, the left ear phone lost connection, I could wiggle the cable to get it back but not get it to stick.  Came home into DCA the first flight this happened and bought a pair of Parrot ZiKs. Incredible sound but they're super heavy.  The top of my head hurt after an hour or so. Decided to try the QC15. So for, so good but haven't been on a long flight with them yet. I like that they use off the shelf batteries. they feel light. Not sure about the rest yet. Will update as I get more time in the air but so far, I like them.

VI love my Bose QC 15 NC headphones!  Man, they really shut out the world, if you need a little peace and quiet!  I wear mine at airports and on planes.  Once, in an airport gate lounge waiting for a flight, a woman on the escalator right in front of us tumbled her luggage down the stairs and then herself after them.  I was completely unaware of the whole episode while peacefully reading my book while under my Bose set.  My husband told me about it later.  He was amazed how unfazed I was during the whole commotion.  I was in blissful quietude.Also, I've almost been thrown off a plane once for objecting to the parents of two toddlers who were allowed to throw screaming tantrums in the row behind me for two solid hours straight into a cross-country flight.  The mother didn't like my "attitude" about her kids and came after me on the plane physically.  LOL (in retrospect).THAT is when I decided to invest in the Bose QC15's.  Never been a problem on any flight since.  Screaming babies and toddlers?  Just turn on the NC and turn up the tunes or the movie and it's just quiet cruisin'.  LOVE my Bose 'phones!!  Also, so comfortable, I often fall asleep at night in bed when watching TV on my iPad under the Bose.  Stays so quiet I don't hear any early morning noises.  Don't use the NC if you need to keep an ear out!

VFive star performance, 4 stars for the Amazon purchase experience.Performance: I bought these for travel and they are fantastic for so much more. They are comfortable on my small head, block a ton of ambient sounds - great for long flights. The chord can detach from the headset so you can wear them on their own with noise canceling turned on to quiet a crowded environment. Sounds quality is awesome. I've used them on several trips and they've made life on a noisy plane much more enjoyable. I've listened to movies on my Kindle Fire, music from my iPhone, and spent days at work with them plugged into my laptop blocking out various office and outdoor interfering noise. I recently traveled with my 7-yr-old and they were great for helping reduce her anxiety during the plane ride after a long day of crowds and travel.Amazon purchase experience: The four stars is based on the off smell of the unit when it arrived. These must have sat in a tobacco smoke filled room for days to acquire their initial scent. If I hadn't needed them immediately for a trip, I would have exchanged them. I wiped them down carefully with a diluted alcohol wipe, then sprinkled the case with baking soda for a nice. Even tried sachets of active charcoal, lavender and cinnamon to at least freshen. I've had them for several months and the smell has dissipated, but my sensitive noise can still faintly detect smoke if I sniff the headband.I've read that you can exchange them at a nearby Bose dealer if you have the receipt and all packaging. I would have done that in a heartbeat had I been near a vendor at the time of purchase.Amazon, please take note and make sure your warehouses and shipping methods are non-smoking!

VI've tried cheap to expensive NC headphones and I'll just say these make me smile. I a bit an insomniac and often times it's noises that keep me from sleeping. I can fall asleep with these on.The only negative for me is while there's no equal in noise canceling headphones, the audio production is just not as supreme. Don't read this as bad! It's job is to null noise!I have two other set of cans for getting down & dirty I have some V\u2022MODA and a set of Grado SR-80s. They bring the fidelity: that's the bottom line.I hope nobody reads this to mean my Bose NC headphones don't accurately reproduce sound. I use them for just that very often. Maybe Grado driver/Bose NC hybrid may be heaven.

VI usually listen to music at my computer in my den.  Unfortunately, the wall next to my desk is shared with the laundry room.  When the washer or dryer are running, the hum of those machines always intrudes on the music I'm listening to.I had Bose QC2s which served me well for years, but finally died.  I couldn't bring myself to spend the $300 for a pair of QC15s, so I tried Grado SR80i headphones... good sound, comfortable, durable, but didn't cancel out the noise.  I tried a pair of Monoprice noise canceling headphones.  The packaging and construction were first-rate, the noise canceling worked "okay", but the sound quality just wasn't up to the Bose standards.  Even a pair of Bose AE2i headphones I received as a gift just didn't quite cut it.  The sound was good, of course, but the lack of noise canceling (and the seemingly inferior bass level) still left me wanting.  I tried a few others, too, looking for something with the noise canceling and sound quality I wanted.Finally, thanks to a used deal here on Amazon, I was able to pick up a pair of QC15s.  Life is good again.  No more noise from the laundry room.  No more hum from my computer.  Without music playing, blessed silence is all I hear.  I'm alone with my thoughts.  With music playing, I hear every detail of the music and vocals, without the addition of the rinse cycle or the monotonous hum of the dryer.I know that there are audiophiles out there who knock Bose for one reason or another, and while I respect their opinions and the reasoning behind them, the Bose QC line has always been the gold standard for me.  My music sounds great, and the noise cancellation is superb.

VOk these are expensive and I can absolutely say that they are completely worth it.  It's funny that these come with cards for the product in the case so you can hand them out.  They are reall that good.I've looked, and tried many other noise cancelling headphones.  I'm always on the lookout for something better and cheaper.  I have not been able to find any other noise cancelling headphones that are as good as these.  They work on planes and in my office building(that sounds like a plane due to the air conditioning).I can clearly hear someone if they talk directly to me, but they tune out all other noises.  I travel from the US to India occasionally and these are life savers.I only wish they had a cordless bluetooth version.Hope I don't ever loose these, but if I do, I'm buying another pair.

VIt's Magic
p5609
sg5
V"Wide range of frequencies" is what's written in Bose QuietComfort 15 documentation. Much of this high-tech headphone is proprietary, I don't think even patented. But the price difference between a $30 noise canceling headphone and this one has a lot to do with this "wide range". The former could be canceling a single frequency, and still call it "noise canceling"--legally. But you can simply hear the difference (or not!) I think the QC15 goes beyond calculating the inverse of a frequency to zero noise. It actually listens to the music you're listening to and doesn't cancel the frequency that is part of the music. That's why I can't detect any reduction in quality of the music while all the noise has been silenced. That's also a lot of signal processing done very fast. I tested this thing right next to a loud air conditioner and I still heard the loud silence the moment I turned on the headphone. It's remarkable and almost magical because I don't fully understand the technology behind it.

p5615

VI travel a lot for work and pleasure by all modes of public transportation. I have a particularly busy 1st quarter travel schedule, so I bought these for myself as a christmas present. I got a good deal on a Like-New set and am still so impressed by their ability to cancel out white noise. Air planes, buses, and trains - I can always plug in, turn on, and focus on any reading or work.I will sometimes even wear them turned on without listening to anything just to drown out other sounds. The biggest difference these make is in the airplane with the engine noises. You flick the on switch and its all gone in a heartbeat.A+ in my book for these headphones and their noise cancelling abilities. I do wish that the base was more substantial and that the headband didn't feel cheap.I knew those going into the purchase, so luckily for the headphones my expectations weren't high.Overall, great purchase for noise cancellation. I will buy a new pair if anything ever happens to the ones I have.

VDecent balance of Noise Cancellation and Sound Quality
p5638
sg5
VI had one primary importance in purchasing noise cancelling headphones - noise cancellation.  Secondary was quality of sound.The Bose QC15's excelled at noise reduction more than anything else I'd heard. Five stars here.The sound quality is decent though I wouldn't say they were bass heavy as some have suggested. It even appears weak at times. The upper mids can be harsh. Because of the noise cancellation, sometimes music can appear to have poor phase relationships between channels which feels disorienting. (Noise cancellation works upon the principles of inverse phase relationships and phase cancellation. Essentially Bose is sampling the external environment via microphones, inverting it's phase and mixing it with your music. ) 3.5 stars for quality of sound.Build quality, appears cheap and moderately delicate. Bad for what are essential mobile headphones. Time will tell.Overall they are a good balance of noise cancellation and sound quality. There are alway tradeoffs when trying to reduce noise and I think Bose has done a pretty good job. If your primary goal is noise cancelation, get these, if it is purely sound quality then seek regular headphones.My judgement experience - Professional recording engineer for 20 years. Pragmatic audiophile. Cranky Bastard.Current headphones I own each with their own merits - Sennheisser HD580s, Beyerdynamics 770,  AKG 270, AKG k240, Sony 7506, apple earbuds.

VWhile as I said - noise canceling really works, the overall sound quality is not the greatest, especially for this price.Most of $100 range headphones (without noise cancelling) sound better (in my opinion) than Bose.Specifically, low frequencies (bass) seem to be gone.But it's something I'm willing to compromise, since the noise canceling features works me.One other thing - I often forget to turn the power switch off, and next morning the battery needs to be replaced.Should have auto switch off.Also, without the battery they don't to seem to work at all. I was expecting (and remember reading about it in the user guide), that even without the battery they would still produce sound, but noise canceling wouldn't work. Well, it's not the case. Without the battery they don't work at all.

VFirst let me say my Bose In The Ear Headphones and Regular non Noise Cancelling Headphone are things I would not leave home without.  I was hoping to get even better from the Bose 15.  First off even though the noise cancelling is perfect It leaves you with a Big headache even when on the ground like after you've been on a long flight on an airplane.  Second Off it takes 1 AAA battery and won't run without it.  third there I no switch to turn off the noise canceling and not have to use the battery.  those are the bad though I would get it out of the way first.The sound quality is just okay for $300.00 I though the sound quality would be a lot better.  the big reason to get these headphones is if you need the Noise Cancelling part and don't mind the headache  for that reason because they are the best at keeping sound out they get three stars.

VBest Birthday GIft Yet!

VBought this for my husband on his birthday and he has been using this for half a year now and loves it! He can't thank me enough for this headphone. It's the best I=gift I've ever given him - and it takes the noise out of everything.I can see how well this works because when he has to work remotely from home while our toddler is fussing over her toys and her shows, the dishwasher running, the dogs barking at the mailman and I'm doing laundry - he does not hear a thing. NOTHING. He can't even hear me talk. :)

VNever fly without them!
p5754
sg5
VThese will forever change the way you fly. Engine noise, crying babies, annoying talkative (but friendly) passengers, etc. all gone. It's like you're in your own world. When you take them off after a 2 hour flight, you realize immediately how great these headphones are.A few things to note:-Carry extra batteries with you. The headphones will not work without batteries. You have to turn them on for any sound to come out. Battery life is excellent. You'll be able to use the same batteries for multiple flights, but you just don't want to be stuck without.-It can be difficult to sleep with these on. It's not very comfy to put your head against something, and if you do, you could get unwanted noise and vibrations. With just the right positioning, it is possible though, or if you can sleep without your head having to be to the side.-Noise cancellation essentially recognizes the repeating pattern of a sound. So something like jet noise is easy to cancel out because it's the same sound over and over. Sounds like talking are not easily cancelled. However, those types of sounds are greatly reduced from the noise isolation of the over-the-ear  style headphones, and the sound of your own music usually drowns those other noises out.-The volume does not need to be up all the way. I don't like blaring my headphones, so I usually have the volume at about half on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3). And that's plenty to get the full appreciation of the headphones.-The sound quality is good. Decent highs and mid-range tones. If you prefer heavy bass, it may not have enough, but the main reason you should be buying these headphones is for the noise cancellation.

p5766
sg5
VThese headphones had a very plasticy smell when I first started using them.  It helped to leave them out of the case when not in use.  They work well to drown out background noise.  I work from home and sometimes need to have silence when my in-laws or nanny are watching the kids in the house.  Also works great to drown out construction or airplane noise.  If I do play music, then I rarely hear anything.  Very expensive purchase, I'm happy I have them, but I don't think they are sound-proof.  Playing music does help to block out noise, but then you have to listen to music.

VThere are items that are only popular because of their brand name, even when they don't deserve it. I was an enormous skeptic of these headphones, but tried them finally in the store, and was surprised. When I finally got them for christmas (THANKS HONEY!!) they surpassed my every expectation. They are truly brilliant headphones.The sound is well defined, the noise reduction is solid without being isolating, and they are remarkably comfortable to wear. Right after I started using them, they started tearing down the building across the street from my office. Daily, 9 hours a day, it was jackhammers and bulldozers. But, I would put the headphones on, and the noise just disappeared. Perfect functionality.If only I could get these with a headphone plug for my office phone so I never missed a call, I would be in gadget heaven.

Hip-hop (in different languages) R&B; ( in different languages), pop, rock, foreign music.. etc. So, anyhow, I was able to test the headphones with my device at my local target store. There was NO difference from my current BOSE headphones and that is even with the noise cancellation feature.. I could get the headphones for a fraction of a price through a friend, but it is not even worth 300.00...

p5806
sg5
VI give the headphones 5 stars for several reasons. Let me write about a few of these reasons, and also let me tell you a few complaints I have with them.Sound Quality:They sound very good. Nothing sounds distorted. The base, mids, and treble are all very balanced, and nothing sounds overpowering or too strong. Of course, for 300 I am certain you will find better sounding headphones. These are by no means the best sounding headphones on the market. In fact, I think you could find headphones for $150 that sound just as good. The only reason they cost $300 is the name and the noise cancellation feature.Noise Cancellation:Here's the deal. They won't cancel out high-pitched sounds or voices. Anything low or constant will be turned into silence. This feature is obviously very useful for people that travel on planes, trains, etc. Just don't expect everything to be cancelled out. However, even with a little music, you won't hear anything. Since I only plan on using wearing them while listening to music, this is not a problem.One caveat. The noise cancelling created extreme discomfort at first. It felt like a heavy pressure on my eardrums. After a few days it had reduced significantly. Some people say they don't notice it. I do. When the music is on, it goes away. I imagine your body just needs to get used to the idea that sound waves don't always produce a noise.Durability:These headphones don't seem incredibly durable. In fact, I think that sitting on them might break them. However, they don't appear as if they will break through normal use.Comfort:They are light and soft. I wore them for about 4 hours straight without any sort of discomfort. They are definitely something that I could wear on a 10 hour plane ride. I imagine this is why they have achieved such a high degree of popularity.Other Notes:AAA Battery - This is a good thing. I'm sure many of you think this is a bad this. I disagree. The case that comes with the Bose QC15s has room for 1-2 extra batteries. They last 35hrs, and you can always use rechargeables if you want. The last flight I was on was an 11 hour flight from Athens to New York. The outlets on the plane did not work.If your headphones die the music stops. Being able to replace the battery and resume listening immediately is certainly a positive quality. Also you don't need to worry about some Lithium Ion battery losing its capacity 4 years from now.Proprietary Wire - This is bad. The wire is flimsy and in my opinion a little long. Nothing wrong is with it now, but I don't like not being able to use a cable of my choosing. A small but annoying issue.Not Being Able to Turn off the Noise Cancelling - This is also bad. I wish I could turn of the noise cancelling to save battery life. I can't. Oh well.Overall a good product that you need to try for yourself. Really these headphones are for a specific group, people who travel frequently. Everyone else might want to stick to less expensive regular over ear headphones.

VI keep forgetting to press button on headphone to turn the device OFF and so batteries are gone in 1-2 days... what a stupid design. Why cant they detect when it's put on the ear and turn batteries off by itself.UPDATE 12/2015: Used it maybe 20 times and already broken. The door to the battery compartment has a wire connection for the battery and it broke when I was opening the battery door to replace battery. Just pure bad design on their part. Called them up to see if they could do something and unfortunately they only have 1 year warranty. Wont ever buy Bose headphones ever again.

p5847

VI don't like to spend money. Therefore, when I say I'm glad I threw $300 of my hard earned money at these headphones, I hope it carries some weight.I'm using these right now in my office with the windows open while someone is running a gas powered pressure washer about 200 ft away. I don't hear even the slightest hint of noise outside of my music.I originally bought these headphones because I was commuting 3 hours a day on the train and earbuds just wouldn't cut it anymore. I put these on and it would cut out 80% of the train sound. Turn music on and it easily drowns out the train sound. I would fall asleep with these on and wake up when the train would stop at the end of the line. When I was at work people would have to tap me on the back or kick my chair because I would have no clue they were behind me talking.Sound quality is great. Bose has this way of working with sound that gives your a great mid range without overpowering bass or treble. I love it, some people don't. These won't rattle your brains with bass, but I've never felt them lacking. The great thing is because the sound begins balanced, you can easily adjust what you get with an equalizer app on your phone.They are very comfortable, although if you are coming from smaller headphones or earbuds it will take some getting used to.Overall they are well worth the cost. If you have a commute on a train, or fly often, these are a must have.

VBest pick over Beats Executive
p5875
sg5
VI was in the market for a set of headphones with noise cancellation, but just didn't want to pay the premium price. One day, I saw Target have an open box of the Beats Executive headphones, which are normally priced exactly the same as Bose QC15. I got the Beats set for $200 instead of $300.After about 1 week of use I took them back and bought the Bose. There were a few problems with the Beats that I had.1. The Bose headphones fit perfectly on my head with room to play, and they are very light. The Beats headset was significantly heavier in weight.  Beats was incredibly uncomfortable. It was tight and I felt like it was squeezing my head so much that my eyeballs were going to pop out of their sockets. I thought maybe they would relax a bit after use, but it wasn't so. Also, they didn't fit over my ears well. I had to tilt them forward so that they would fit over my head properly. Bose was superior in every respect.2. The Bose headphones are far better for a broader range of music, and provide a much more neutral music experience that allows me to use the EQ settings on my phone or other audio sources to get the sound I want. Beats was nearly impossible to do this with. Beats definitely has great bass, but it comes at a cost to about everything else. I suppose if you listen to hip hop or rap music, it works well, but I found the Bose was better for Rock, Classical, Jazz, Soundtracks, Metal, Latin, etc. I listen to a broad range of genres of music, but not hip hop or rap. I will say, I do have some older Mariah Carrey stuff and it sounds great on the Bose head phones.3. The noise cancellation of Bose is indisputably better than Beats. Don't get me wrong, Beats was decent, but there is a noticeable hiss in the background, that resembles the sound from speakers that have the treble pumped up too high and the volume up high. This might play into the fact that Beats seems to exaggerate the low and high frequencies on purpose. It's not terrible, but quite noticeable. With Bose, it was so quiet, I thought there was something wrong with my ears at first. The noise cancellation from Bose is just superior.4. Distortion. Again Bose was better on this front. It seemed that the Beats had some unnecessary distortion with the Metal music I was listening to. This might be due to the boost they do with certain frequencies to get that heavier bass. Bose, not the case. Very clear, and this is especially nice when I listen to orchestral music.So, to sum it up, Bose is the clear winner for me. These headphones are at the same price point, so it becomes even more clear which is the better value as well.*Note, I was able to find the Bose headphones for $279.

p5880
sg5
VI am normally a try-before-buy shopper, however I was at my wits end and needed a quick solution at work. I am a programmer and  struggle with distractions and my productivity was suffering greatly due to a loud group of coworkers near my cube. I think these headphones saved my job. Not only at work have these been a tremendous tool, but I have also started using them while meditating. To be honest, I rarely leave the house without them any more.  A couple items to share for the questioning shopper:- These are not wireless headphones. They require AAA batteries because they use Active Noise Canceling technology. This means that the headphones have external microphones that capture sound and broadcast the captured sound's negative  through the speakers. For most small sounds and white noise the technology is perfect. For louder sounds and some higher frequencies, the technology is lacking. Combining this feature with music tends to drown out almost all noise.- The headphones come with a very compact and shock resistant carrying case. The case has a small pouch that has enough room to hold a couple extra batteries and audio adapter.

I find that it helps me arrive at my destination far more refreshed because I don't have the constant noise of the aircraft or the people around me.  Not only do these headphones work, they are super comfortable, which is a win/win.  You won't regret this purchase.

The noise cancellation is fantastic.  What I don't like is the sound leakage.  If I have my volume at 50%, my wife can hear everything coming out of the headphones.  Everything.  So while traveling it may be great to have the external noise cancelled out for me, I feel like I will be constantly worried that I will be causing noise pollution for those around me.

VBought these in a Best Buy airport vending machine kiosk, and the machine said to call the Bose number for info on a risk free trial. The Bose operator told me I would be able to return the item within 30 days for a full refund.The noise cancelling works great and if that's all you care about these are for you. However, the sound quality is not worth the 300 plus tax. Sennheiser, Beyerdynamics, Audio Technica and probably others all have models with much better sound for around that price. Read the head fi reviews.Went back to my local Best Buy to return them and they refused as their internal policy is 15 days. Called Bose and they also refused as I hadn't bought the item directly from them. The Bose operator specifically said I could return it to any authorized dealer. When I called Bose the second time, the best solution they could offer was store credit.So, readers of this review should make absolutely clear what the trial period is, get the operator to make notes on your account etc etcI personally will not be buying from Bose again. The customer service were entirely unsympathetic and seemed suspicious of my motives for returning the item.

VI was going to return these because they are just so insanely expensive. I've been putting them on to the test around my house (which is hell loud) from the traffic outside. Trucks and cars bang and slam into pot holes while they go by all day and night, it's constant. I bought these with little hope of alleviating the problem. My jaw was literally on the floor when I put these on and stood at the window watching the cars slam by and heard nothing! I wore them outside and you can still hear the traffic but at a much lower decibel level. I wanted to hate these so I could get my money back and yes, they wreak like cigarettes (must be the packing material) but the noise cancellation is beyond my dreams. I have left the music on the lowest sound and been able to relax. My mind and body! I'm not all tense and wound up since I can't hear the traffic. It's a whole different world with these on. While I'm going to struggle paying them off, I definitely feel like these are a necessity if you live in a loud house or apartment. They drown out street noise and bassy-type noises. I love them! UPDATE- after a few days of using them, they pick up sounds I didn't even know were there watching tv; I keep taking them off to see if it's an "outside" noise. These headphones are outstanding! Plus they have already paid for themselves in noise related anxiety reduction alone. I wish I hadn't waited so long to get these.

VI have never like Bose as a company. I have had terrible customer service and I seem to run into proprietary design that does not allow me to do what I want. I hate Bose....And, I keep ending with their headphones because they hit a sweat spot for me. I had the QC3. They were slightly more comfortable than the QC15s and the sound seems comparable. The QC15s seem a little more cheaply made but the noise canceling is better.I am not an audiophile but I seem to like pretty good headphones. I also don't seem willing to go much over $300 for a set of headphones. I have found some that sound better for more but not good enough for my ears. In this price range I have found nothing that has the QC15s mix of good sound, good noise canceling and comfort and I tried quite a few.My daughter has the new Beats. They feel stouter but the sound is not as good nor is the noise canceling although the price is comparable. Of course these don't look as cool or so my daughter tells me. My wife has a comparably priced pair of Audi Technica (or Senhauser? - can't remember). Hers are a little more comfortable and seem stouter as well but again sound and noise canceling are not as good. I managed to try about 6 different headphones in this price range and the QC15s came out on top.I guess I am stuck with Bose for another few years and believe me I would much prefer another company.

VI got to try a pair of these last time I flew. The guy next to me let me try his out and what a huge difference! Instantly muffles the drone of the airplane engines. So, with an upcoming international  (13 hour) flight, I took the plunge and purchased a set for myself. I've been using them in an office environment and they have been much more effective in that context than I thought they would be. People now have to come tap me on the shoulder to get my attention. WIth the headphones on, I can barely hear conversations in the cubes next to me. Add some music, and the external world sounds just go away. It's been great for helping me maintain my focus an concentration without getting audibly distracted every 10 seconds. Definitly recommend.

VI was hesitating to get such a product for long time, but I am glad that finally I got Bose® QuietComfort®. It has a decent noise cancellation power which is helpful when I am reading in a noisy environment, or when I simply want to listen to an audiobook or music in a more relaxed ambiance. I also found it handy that the noise cancellation function can also work while the wire is detached.On the down side, the wires sometimes seem too long to handle, I already lost one (the pack comes with a 2nd one with mic for Apple products).

The Bose is base happy and I can assure you that it has plenty of it for most music.  The low- Hi position has very little affect on the sound quality, but the sound volume decrease noticibly in Low position.  The sound quality is very acoustical but hi and low is a bit exaggerated making mid range some what deparessed.  Nothing wrong especially whten all this is accomplished with noise cancellation function on full time.  I love it!  Above it is light and fatique free for the head!!!

VI'm a software developer who works in a cubicle world with the heating system droning on above the ceiling (we're on the top floor of an office building - the HVAC is on the roof).  These headphones provide an oasis of silence!  The noise cancellation *seems* to be a cut above the others I've tried (Beats Studio at Target and a Sony set at Costco) although it's not really fair to compare as I didn't try the Bose under the same condition as the others (i.e. in a noisy store).How good is it?  The droning AC noise is completely gone.  Voices I can still hear - until I play music.  Even at low/moderate playback volume, voices are barely audible.  People have to pat me on the back if they want my attention.Comfort is excellent.  I wear them on-and-off all day without problems.  I imagine people with big ears might be less comfortable.Power: the headphones use a single AAA battery.  Keeping in mind that I maybe play music for 2-3 hours every day, the battery seems to last 2-3 weeks.  As others have noted, these headphones will not work (i.e. play music) without power.My one nitpick (and the reason I can't give it 5 stars) is the god-awful chord.  It's some cheap plasticky material that I continually have to unravel by dangling the headphones by the plug end and letting the headphones rotate.  It's really quite pathetic to put such cheap cr$p on $300 headphones - shame on Bose for not correcting this.  Is it really going to affect your profitability so much you can't do something like the $20 Apple headphones that come with every iPhone (they're more rubberized and don't seem to get raveled).Update for iPhone/iPad/iPod users: with iOS 7, Apple introduced a new way to invoke Siri (Apple's voice assistant) - instead of holding down the home button (or center button on the headphones) until you hear the Siri confirmation sound and then asking Siri your question and then waiting for Siri to accept your input, with iOS 7, you can keep the button pressed until you're finished talking - and avoid the delay Siri normally waits to know you're done with talking.  It's a very useful feature.....and, it doesn't work with the Bose inline chord button :-(  Not really Bose's fault, I guess, but I thought it worth mentioning.

It took me about two years before I finally bought these and I wish I hadn't waited so long.  Highly recommend these to everyone.

It really does live up to it's name quiet comfort. Fantastically amazing battery life, just don't forget to turn it off when you leave work for the day.

VI bought these as a gift and did not notice that this model is for Mac users. The recipient decided to try it anyway with her PC, since she was desperate to block out background distractions at her open layout workplace.  So this is second-hand feedback: with lots of intense programmers with lightning fingers and clicky keyboards, plus hummers, chatters, and finger-drummers in a small start-up, collaborative space, these Bose headphones did the trick, allowing focus and relative quiet.  I don't think they block everything, but with added music at a quiet to moderate decibel level, it's pretty close.

p6005
sg5
VMy wife bought these for me for Christmas because I work from home, and our new home does not have an extra room for my office.  Since I have to work in the loft area, there is a lot more noise to contend with.  The noise cancelling feature on these headphones works so well when I have music on that I cannot hear the kids standing 3 feet behind me arguing with each other, or sneaking up on me to scare me when I least expect it - hence the heart attack.  The only way I can tell if my office line is ringing is by making sure the phone is in my line of sight so I can see the LED blinking.Sound quality-wise, I am not an audiophile, but to me the sound is perfect.  Great bass, great treble.  Unless you are Dr. Dre, take what you are reading about sound quality with a grain of salt, because you have to be an expert to detect some of these issues that the audio geeks are writing about.  I am a normal guy and based on the sound quality and the boise cancelling, these are perfect to me.  On top of everything else, they are very comfortable for long term wear.  I had a pair of Sony's before this that would start to make my head hurt after an hour or so.  These I can wear for hours at a time.Very happy with this purchase.  NOT happy that the kids are not getting tired of sneaking up on me.

VTested out the new Beats Studio and thought they sounded great with good noise cancellation.  But then I tried a pair of the Quietcomfort 15 and was blown away by the difference in NRA and sound quality.  Even without the music playing I could immediately hear pure silence (aside from muffled voices) and when I took them off I was amazed at much low end noise there is in my office from the HVAC system and my space heater.  Music quality was also very clear without the heavy bass influencing the songs like the Beats did.  The only negatives I have are that the plastic quality could by better and have a rechargeable battery like the Beats.  I did get the Brown limited edition version and this helps to make it look a little more like the $300 price tag if carries.

p6034

VThese are my second pair of Bose I've owned. I had the QC2 before this pair, and I can tell you, BOSE ARE THE WAY TO GO! The quality of music, every tap of a drum, ever breath the artist takes, is so crisp and sharp. You don't have to blare your music anymore to hear how good it is. The noise cancelling is great at cutting out chatter for people and particularly good at removing the rumbling noises from jet engines while flying and the road and engine noise while in a car or bus.Really though, I cannot recommend Bose headphones enough! I love them more than my 5.1 surround sound from my computer. In all seriousness, if you're willing to put down $300 on headphones, you'd be a fool to get anything other than these. There are some very small companies that have better systems, without the noise cancelling, but for more than twice the price, not to mention, if they break, that's on you. With Bose, I have had only one issue over the past 6 or so years of owning a product from them, and I can tell you that their customer support is phenomenal. Immediate replacement of my headphones, no cost to me. No questions asked.If you are willing to spend $250 - $450 on a pair of headphones, there is no better option in that price range than these QC15's. They are truly a remarkable piece of technology and I cannot stress enough just how great both the build and sound quality are.

I arrive at my destination less tired! I have no trouble conversing while wearing them (although I usually take them off to do so, out of politeness). They won't cut out the screaming baby behind you, but do reduce the general ambient noise on a plane and make your trip more pleasant. Comfortable to wear too! The only problem I ever had is that the plug that connects to audio equipment doesn't stay in if I get up and walk around. My solution, since I don't usually listen to things, is to take it out and stow it. Almost lost it once when I went to the restroom on a plane!

VAmazing headphones

VThese are the most comfortable, most effective noise cancelling headphones, and the audio quality is amazing. Here's why I recommend them.1. I totally disagree with the negative comments about this not having enough bass. As I write this review I've been listening to One Republic's Counting Stars, Adele's Rolling In The Deep, and Lady Gaga's Telephone, all of which have lots of hard driving bass. They sound great--and my iPhone 4S volume is only at the half way point.The music sounds clean and crisp--no muddiness at all. Every instrument on my jazz and classical favorites is clearly articulated, and with no tinniness or excessive treble. Bose is known for a very mellow, smooth sound. If I close my eyes I feel like I'm at the Blue Note or Lincoln Center in Manhattan depending on the selection.Note: If you don't require noise cancellation and want headphones that are much less expensive and sound great, I recommend theJBL J55i High-Performance On-Ear Headphones with JBL Drivers, Rotatable Ear-Cups and Microphone - Black2. When I travel and just want to sleep, I turn on the White Noise app on my iPhone. With the Bose noise cancellation and that app it's like being in a cocoon. I don't hear any noise on a plane or the radio in the car.3. This comes with two sets of audio cords--one for Apple products and the other for non Apple products. The Apple product cord lets me easily control the volume on my iPhone 4S and also make and receive phone calls. When I called my wife she said my voice sounded nice and clear. No tunnel sound at all. And of course her voice was crystal clear because it was coming through these headphones.These run on a single AAA battery, which is included and is very economical.4. Bose customer service is amazing. I had a ten year old pair of Bose Quiet Comfort Q2 headphones where the earpieces had become ragged and part of the headset clip was taped where I had broken it. I also had no receipt. I brought them into the Bose store and asked about replacing the foam earpieces (which cost $35). The Bose salesperson said that for $129 I could trade in my old headphones and buy the brand new Q15 complete with a new warranty, which I did.So if you have any prior model of the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, go into a Bose store and you can upgrade (at least for now) to this latest model for $129.Bottom line: Bose products are not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth. I love these headphones, and bought another pair on Amazon for a family member.Note:  I don't recommend using these at the beach or poolside because they are too hot to wear on a warm day. I use the Bose SIE2 Sport Headphones - Green.I also don't recommend them for the gym--too bulky and not water resistant, so your sweat can zap them. For the gym, especially for running on the treadmill, I recommend the Avantree Jogger Pro Sweat Proof Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Stereo Headphones / Headsets with microphone for running / sports - Black/Grey.

VDon\u2019t Buy - Broken plastic headband and cushions flaking apart
p6139
sg5
VHuge disappointment: you think you are buying a high quality product (1st generation) which will last but in the end it\u2019s a poorly designed low quality product. The sound and the noise cancellation may be ok but what if the plastic headband breaks after less than 100 hours of usage and all leather cushions are flaking off leaving your face with black specks of leather\u2026 STAY AWAY

VBest headset ever!!
p6144

VThe best headsets I have ever owned! The noise cancelling feature is awesome! One point though, you cannot turn off the noise cancelling feature, it will turn off the headsets and you won't be able to hear anything. I have not had my battery die yet but I'm guessing that when my batter dies I won't be able to use the headset until I put in a fresh battery. Other than that buy on!!

VThese are the best invention for planes since the jet engine. I didn't realize how wearing the engine noise is until I started wearing these. Now I get off the plane with more energy. Whether you listen to music, watch movies, or just turn them on for the noise reduction, these are also a godsend for travelers -- especially in the company of a screaming baby. If you travel regularly, you can't afford not to have these.
