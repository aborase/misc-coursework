VGreat sound and can't hear anyone talking to you with them on. I will say I did replace the padding about 1 week later cause it wasn't cushioned anymore. ( I got memory foam ones)  I have 3-4 (can't remember different cord lengths which is great. I would recommend these to others

VSmall Plastic Pimple is the Gremlin
p158
sg5
VI do love these headphones, sound great, fit great however this entire headphone depends on a small plastic pimple that prevents the ear piece from going too far back forcing it to fit over your ear. Yes a small plastic pimple that gives way and what you have left is a non-functioning, useless $169 piece of junk. So now I am in the market for new headphones and I am afraid to shell out $169 for another headphone that may end up being another useless piece of junk. For sound I give this 4.5 Stars, they are quality but A plastic pimple? Come on now that is not right. Now its taped up and uncomfortable.

sg5
VIf you were to make a list of truly good headphones... scratch off the over-hyped fashion statement schock and high priced toys designed to make portable music players "sound good" - you will end up with a small list of truly good headphones sold at fair prices. These headphones WILL be on that short list, and will be around when the over-hyped "star studded" brands are in the landfill.Just remember that "garbage in / garbage out". Don't expect these quality headphones to make your smartphone and MP3 files sound like audio nirvana. With the mild exception of a slight "v" shape pleasing tonal balance - these are accurate and true to the master recording if you feed them a good signal.

VGood headphone/great power/decent sound/decent comfort/amazing value
p176
sg5
VGreat Headphones - in fact, maybe too "good."I am a headphone fanatic, with at least 8 headphones to my collection.  These are one of the best overall headphones I have, but I feel that the 50mm drives the base too hard.  I actually sometimes take the earcups off just to give my eardrums a break.  So they work, and they are powerful.  I use E5 Headphone amp along with these, and they are powered quite well using the amp.The reason for not giving these headphones 5 stars (ideally I would give it 4.5 stars) is that the overall quality of the sound is not 100%.  They headphones are slightly low-frequency heavy and don't have enough emphasis on the mids and the treble.  Overall sound quality is good, not great.  The build and everything else is great.  One other small critique would be that they are slightly tight so after wearing them for an hour I need to take them off.  overall these are about the best headphones for the money

VI love these headphones. They are perfect for me.  Well-built and I like that they include different cords.  Sound quality is very nice.  I'm no audiophile but the music sounds rich and not over processed.  The cans are relatively light and do end up hurting the tops of my ears after a couple of house (mainly due to wearing the with glasses).  They are becoming more comfortable over time, so maybe that won't be an issue after a while.

p283

V(Note, I bought my pair of ATH-M50x directly from Alto Music of Orange County, who is an authorized retailer, and not through Amazon, as I wanted to ensure that I received a legitimate pair)Excellent headphones, bought them to accompany my foam-modded Sennheiser HD558, but where I thought I would be regularly switching between the 558 and the M50x, I ended up making the M50x my main headphones, simply because I prefer the sound they give. That's not to say that the HD558s are inferior; they're, to my ears, about even in sound quality. It's just that I prefer the sound signature of the M50x more, especially the much more prominent bass. Then again, it could be what I like to call "New Toy Syndrome", and I'm sure I'll be yearning for the wider soundstage of my HD558 soon enough. As it is, though, the ATH-M50x has given me the exact sound I was looking for, and they'll be replacing my Sennheiser Momentum in-ears as my portable headphones for sure.The only thing that I didn't like about the M50x is the comfort level. I have big ears, and a big head, and it took me an entire weekend of tweaking to make the headphones tolerable on my head and ears. Ended up stretching out the headband to relieve some of the clamping force, and put a few halves of cotton balls into the top of the ear cups so that I could slip my ears into them, rather than having the ear cups pressing against my ears. The first couple of days saw the tops of my ear lobes getting raw and red. They still cause some discomfort after hours of wear, but I can tolerate it enough that I can wear them all day despite that.Attached with my review are pics of my new ATH-M50x, and a pic of them alongside the HD558.

VATH-M50x - Good and 'Accurate' for the price, but...
p324
sg5
VI own another cheaper pair of Audio Technica headphones and am impressed with the sound for the money, that's why I decided to try these. They are good headphones for price but honestly I expected better performance at this price level. The sound is good and 'Accurate', but If you are looking for Great Base these are not the ones, the base is only 'good', I was looking for "Accurate" and these Are Accurate, though at high volumes they distort, but so do other even more expensive headphones at those volumes. On my system they begin to distort a little at just beyond 50% volume and would be noticeable to Anyone at 70% volume. I have Sony MDRs that I purchased around 1990 that don't begin to distort till around 70% volume but I wanted to replace those old things. I sent these back. Looking for better.

VLove the sound quality. How ever, if you have big ears you will seem to feel uncomfortable in about 10-15 mins in listening. There's no pads for these of ears that will keep the sound quality and comfort. Also when listening its hard to catch the beats with music with these headphones. Also it need a bit more bass for me to feel the beat of the song. I like to feel the song when I'm listening, but these aren't the one that do that. Don't get me wrong though, these are high quality headphone to invest in. Though if you have big ears and wanted more bass boost. I would go for the Sony MDRXB950BT wireless headphone because I've tried them on and I was so amazed how comfortable it was. Sound quality is amazing like this one, but it has the quality that this headphone don't have. I will picking one up soon, and do a review on it.

VBest headphones I purchased
p348
sg5
VBeast absolutely a beast! Best headphones I purchased, way better than Beats and I mean the $300 Beats. The sound the clarity absolutely phenomenal. You will understand once you put then on.Downside is it comes with a 2.5mm female Jack that has a locking device in the headset, because it comes with a detachable cable. So you can't use any other cable, they do sell a third part cable with mic but it's horrible.The good thing is this can be easily modified by purchasing a male to female Jack that you can purchase here on Amazon for about $4.00 then you open your headset unscrew the interior pin, remove it and screw it back on and insert the purchased Jack and presto. Instant 3.5 conversion. Did this on mine sound the same and I can now use any other high quality cable with mic. Plus you can make this to become Bluetooth as well. I use these for music on my phone watching movies and as a gaming headset, best purchase ever. I highly recommend these over anything else.

VWhen I decided I wanted to nice headphones, I discussed it with a friend who knew a lot about this topic. After I told him I wanted Sennheisers, he let me listen to everything he had, and I eventually decided on the Grado sr80. When I went to Crutchfield, Jon was very helpful and knowledgeable when figuring out what I needed. Since I was using these in an office setting, we decided the Grados were not the way to go since they are open backed. I didn't want to spend much, so it was between the Sennheiser 280 and the Audio Technicas. After listening to them, there was no way I could go with the Sennheisers. The sound was just very lacking, but that seems to simply be the Sennheiser style, which may work for certain settings and music. The M50x cancels out sound pretty well, doesn't leak much, and has great sound quality. They're comfortable, and it's nice they come with 3 different cords (short, long, and curly ones). I'm really satisfied with them, and I'm really happy I spent the money on them.In the future, I will absolutely buy the Grado sr80 for quieter listening and whatnot. The sound quality is just incredible. But when in need of some closed back cans, the Audio Technica M50x is the way to go.Pros: Sound quality Comfortable Blocks out sound well

Works great when editing or when out with my phone. These are always on sale so grab a pair!

VIt is amazing although here are my comments and suggestions
p400
sg5
VLook elsewhere for reviews - whatever I have to say is nothing compared to the pros. It is amazing although here are my comments and suggestions. 1. why doesn't the 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch adapter work on any cable? I understand you wanted to make a screw lock, but include the ability to attach it to any cable without the lock, or your cable with the lock! DURRR 2. Why isnt there a mic cable? I understand most people dont use this on the go, but many others do and that would be a cheap addon or even sell it separately!! cmon guys - innovation!!! 3. The ear cup pads are not very durable. 4. okay this one bothers me a bit, but I understand why - the fact that the locking part of the cable is 3/32 (which is smaller I get it, but that) renders your cables unusable for other things, and even third party cables (and those weird DIY Bluetooth things) incompatible with your headphones. Plus the proprietary locking connector makes it worse. Maybe include a 3/32 locking to 1/8 inch adapter or something.Well that's all folks!

VThese are just so good. The sound is amazing, but beyond that, they are the only headphones I can wear for hours on end. I work in a relatively noisy environment and these block out a nice amount of sound by simply putting them on. Furthermore, the soft feel of the cushions is just so good.I recently got a second pair of these for my home office and while the leather on the cushions is still being worn in on that pair, they are just so comfortable to wear.The cord is detachable, and three cords are provided: long (good for connecting to the rear of your PC and having room to roll away from your desk), short (for mobile devices), & coiled (like an old telephone cord).

Vsound terrible and sound leaking is a real problem.  sound is distant and mediocre.  I was told that people could hear my music from many feet away while i was listening at a reasonable volume.  I thought they would be more comfortable for air travel, but they do not block out noise (at all really) like I had hope.  Using a Fiio e6, I couldn't get enough volume out of it to overcome the background noise of an airplane.  I removed the headphones and went back to my IEM's within an hour of taking off.  I returned them as soon as I got home.  Perhaps I got a bad unit, but I doubt it.  I think the style of headphone is just not for me.When i play video games i use cheap logitech gaming headset of a similar style, I believe the logitechs have a much better sound than these AT's.  It's a shame i was really looking forward to them, I have typically liked AT's but this is my second bad headphone from them and I think I am done with the brand.They are very pretty though!

I will hold on to them for a long time I'm sure, taking well care of them. Thanks Audio-Technica and thank you to the amazon retailer I received them from. Arrived quickly and I very much appreciate them.

VI ordered these headphones due to all the glowing reviews they've received. I was very disappointed when my headphones developed an issue within less than a week since I got them. The right ear would intermittently cease to function with no reliable way to solve the issue. Switching between the 3 provided cords provided a temporary fix until it the right ear stopped working again. For full disclosure, I've only tried the coiled cord and the short straight cord but if 2 of the 3 cords don't function reliably, I won't bother trying out the 3rd. I really wanted to these headphones to live up to the high expectations I developed after reading all the positive reviews but I guess I was unlucky and got a faulty product.

p699
sg5
VWhat can I say. After weeks of looking at so many headphones from so many companies. This is the best. Looked at wireless and all the different Bose, Beats, and others but the value was right here.So far works great as over ear for sound reduction. Works well with Samsung VR. Amazon Prime Music sounds true and not excessive base as others sounded when trying them out in person.Sure you could pay way more, but sound and detachable cords (multiple included), easy to fold and carry, make this so easy to pick in the end

p711
sg5
VGreat headphones. Great accessories. Great quality. Tighter and a tad less comfortable then my M40fs's, but still decently comfortable. Fits over ears nicely. (I have small ears). More suitable for DJ's with the over ear/closed back design and enhanced bass register. Probably wouldn't use for mixing or referencing though as these definitely enhance the low's and color the sound. My trusted ATH-M40fs's are still my favorite reference cans. Sony MDR's are awesome too. I was hoping these would be an upgrade but they are a different beast. Still good tho. My only gripe with Audio Technica cans is that the earphone cover and headpiece cover almost always degrade into a flaky mess..funny thing is without the plastic surface they're WAY more soft and nice. Nice heaphones just know they're bass heavy and not transparent in my opinion. (25+ years, producer, musician, engineer, DJ)

VI was really disappointed with these out of the box. I got them to replace my Siberia V2s. The sound quality is superb, easily the best sounding headphones I have used, but they are very uncomfortable, especially compared to the Siberias which is like the gold standard of headphones comfort. The cables are also very bulky at the source end so they're really hard to plug into a phone.I made some modifications which made the headphones a lot more enjoyable.1. I removed the proprietary cord locking mechanism. It's really easy, just requires removing a few screws. You can find tutorials on youtube.2. I got a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter so I can use standard cables3. I replaced the earcushions with Brainwavs Replacement Memory Foam Earpads. These earpads are much bigger than the stock ones so they leave much more room for the ear. The stock cushions pushed up against my ear which was very uncomfortable.f4. I taped on a battery powered bluetooth adapter. This made a nice wireless conversion. When I want to use it wired, I just unplug the bluetooth adapter and let it dangle, and I plug in the new cable.They're still not as comfortable as the Siberias but they're a lot better than before.

p747
sg5
VI bought these when I was recommend them as an alternative to my Sony MDR-V6's, while they have a fuller sound than the V6, I feel like the bass on these is slightly overshadows the rest of the sound, which is fine. They sound pretty good, and I really like the detachable cable. The reason for the two stars and ultimately why I did not like the headphones is because they have a lot of clamping force compared to the V6 and hurts my head. Maybe I have a larger head or perhaps I'm a wuss, but either way it made the headphones unwearable for me.

p753
sg5
VI use these for both gaming and music. When I use these for music I feel as though I can hear every amount of bass that I wanted to. I hear just about everything clearly and can really get "deep" into the music. I also love these headphones for gaming. When I'm playing a stealth game where I have to listen for sound in any given direction it really helps and I feel like I can hear everything that is surrounding me in-game.Although I haven't used all of the cables that have come with it I love the fact that the cables lock into the headphones. Getting the cable stuck (like wrapped around the arm of a chair, etc) will probably cause the cable to rip out of the headphones and do some damage so you have to watch out for that. The pouch that it comes with is great for carrying the cables that it comes with, but isn't for the headphones so you will need to get a case specifically for the headphones if you want to carry them around safely.The headphones cover my ears very comfortably and I feel like I could wear them all the time.  I would definitely recommend them to others.

Vthey are what people say they are very flat with a slight bump to the highs. they have almost no physical bass its heard but not felt. they have good detail and surround i can close my eyes and accurately point out where a sound come from but asides from being great studio monitors its not great at much else. it does play nice with a eq but turning up the bass causes extreme distortion. they work great on a phone but amp really well with the fiio e6 almost to a fault since it can be really easy to distort these headphones. my biggest cons tho are comfort . the pads are thin and get very hot for long hours of use causing my ears to sweat. the top padding could have used a little more padding and the way the cable connection juts down from the left ear is annoying since it makes it hard to lean my head left also the mobile cable not having a 6.3 connector set up like the other cables is dumb since ii not have a mass of excess cable on my desk. another minor thing i dislike about them is the have lost alot of their clamping force on my head to where if i lean my head back they will fall off my ears or the band will slip backwards

VBEWARE OF FAKES BEING SOLD ON AMAZON
p871
sg5
VI've listened to my friend's old M50 and they sound astounding.But I wanted to quickly wrote this review to warn people that fake M50x's are on the market and being sold by Amazon stores. Be sure to check Audio-Technica's website to see if you're buying them from an authorized dealer.http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/site/1e22eec97c088a8b/http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/features/49ef9d703e98ba93/I know because I bought mine here and had to send it back because the sound quality wasn't as great as I was expecting.It's very difficult to tell the difference between a fake and an authentic one. I could only tell because I have well trained ears from mixing music. But most might not even be able to tell a difference... Or even care. But if you're spending $150 on headphones I would think you would want to get your money's worth.

VHoo boy. When I got my first pair of M50s back in 2011, that was a whirlwind of good sound. A few years later, when I had sold them to a friend, I decided to grab a pair of M50x's.I am SO glad I did! The sound is as good as ever, and a removable cable inspired me to make some modifications. I added on velour earpads, a braided cable, a microphone, and a wool headband.Get the M50x's if you want fantastic headphone sound at an affordable price that you can easily add on to!

VExcelent headphones, the best for the price, the quality of the materials is pretty good and the sound is the best i've heard in a long time, the cables are thick enough to be durable and the headphones are confortable for long sections. this headphones surpass the beats completely.

VThis headphone set offers great sound. It is very versatile with reproduction from classical to pop/hip-hop. The swivel on each ear can be a pain at times. I wish there was a lock to fix it when the swivel option is not wanted. I also wish the cable wasn't so proprietary with the cable locking component. I have yet to find a small enough jack to fit in it that is not made by AT (or they make a cable that has a mic and offers android/iphone controls).

VATH-M50x >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Beats Studio
p943
sg5
VI'm not big into headphones and I don't know too much about all the choices out there and how they compare with these, but I know one thing for sure: I absolutely LOVE these things. The sound quality is so great, I've never used any headphones that come close to how nice these sound for the price. I use these for listening to music, watching movies/TV shows, gaming, and use them when playing guitar so I don't bother my housemates or neighbors. They just don't fail to impress me.BEATS COMPARISON: At one point I wanted to hop on the bandwagon and succumb to the Beats marketing machine like the millions of mindless drones out there and get a pair of Beats Studio headphones. Well... just get these. You'll be glad you did. There's not really any other way to suggest you get these over Beats other than to call you a fool if you go with Beats. I borrowed a pair of Beats Studio headphones from a friend, and they just felt like cheap pieces of plastic. Sorry Beats fans, compared to the M50x they sounded like garbage. They will never find their way back onto my head. Their only strong point, and this is being generous, is in the bass they offer. After listening to just about every genre I could think of, I was just not having a good experience with them. And they required batteries...? I don't want to pay to replace batteries all the time to power a little more bass, I already had that problem with my childhood Skull Candy headphones.Overall: These headphones are amazing, you will not be disappointed!

VPerfect for a music lover-anyone really!
p954
sg5
VThese headphones are the real deal, clear crisp sound that will have you hearing new details in old music. These will work with an iPhone or similar devices with a 3.5mm jack. As other reviews have stated, I do believe these headphones have a little bit of extra bass added. However, it is in no way obnoxious, it adds just enough bass so that songs will powerful bass (e.g. "Radioactive" by Imagine Dragons, "We will Rock You" by Queen, etc.) sound better than ever, but songs with more variety, like soundtracks or other instrumental pieces, sound undistorted and beautiful. Outside nose reduction is amazing; with music playing, you will not be able to hear a conversation. I imagine that it would work very well on a subway or plane. As to construction, they seem to be solid, they are all plastic save for a metal strip in the headband; however, this is not toy store plastic but very rugged and thick plastic that will last for a long time. The materials for the earpieces and headband are comfortable, sturdy and the coverings are constructed from imitation leather. It does come with three cords, two 3.5mm jacks and a larger 6.5mm jack. You insert the cord into the headphone by inserting the mark on the cord to the left of the mark on the headphone, and then turning the cord until the marks align. Having a removable cord is nice because it prevents damage to the headphones from a cord being accidentally pulled. Because these headphones are not cheap, I suggest a quality hardcase for them. I got this one, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LZ3VFW8?keywords=headphone%20case&qid;=1452646323&ref;_=sr_1_1&s;=musical-instruments&sr;=1-1 which fits the headphones perfectly. In short, I recommend these for any music lover of any genre, you really can't go wrong with these.

p1008

VThese headphones are ok, but I don't understand some of the raving qualities folks have about them.The build quality on these is solid, the padding feels great. I loved how you could get these to fold up into a small space usage piece.These are not very neutral (emphasis on treble in the mids) and they're a bit forward, bad recordings really are hurt by this. The lows are almost non-existent. I don't need Beats (nor does anyone) but I do want to hear more than a basic thump. The soundstage is non-existent and the music feels very limited.I would actually say, TV shows/movies are what sound great with these headphones. Watching a drama the vocals come through great, in watching Selma, the intonation of the actors really was great. But these are headphones that I would largely use for music. Not a fan.

VGreat sounding pair of cans. Had to buy a new DAC/Amp combo to take full advantage of the amazing clarity, tight bass, and shimmering high end. The only thing I don't like about this product is how DARK the Dark Green actually is. I could actually call this Off-Black lol. Also the bag for the cables and headphones is quite small and I don't like squishing everything in there. This can be solved by purchasing the Geekria EJB-0039-02 headphone cases. And if anyone cares, the DAC/Amp I bought was the FiiO E10K. I highly recommend this product to music lovers and people who wear headphones also.

VThese headphones are top notch in my opinion.When I wear them for long periods of times, though, my ears start to get a bit sore from either the size of the headphone or how tight it pushes against your head - however these qualities aren't bad things. I just have large ears.The quality is phenomenal. If you have everything set at full volume, with these around your neck with the ear cups pointed up it sounds like you're wearing the headset. That's how good these are.If you're comparing these to anything else under $200 these are probably better.

p1098

VAs someone who doesn't usually spend this much money on headphones, when I saw these I knew I had to get them. While many audiophiles on the internet say that you can get even better headphones out there for a similar price as these, I'm not going to lie, you probably can, but NONE of them will look as good as these, which  embarrassingly I do care about. I've dropped these a few times, and they're still doing great so its safe to say these are pretty durable headphones. The sound you get out of them is amazing, in my opinion, and as someone who likes to listen to hip-hop and such, these have great bass.NOTE:Out of the box, the pleather ear pads these come with are just alright, making your ears sweat and just a little bit uncomfortable because of its shallowness. To fix this, you can either put cotton balls in the ear pads, or as I did, buy Duck Weatherstrip Seal at Walmart or something and put them in there. Not only does it make the headphones more comfortable as it pushes your ears away from the drivers, but for me, it fixes the sweat problem and also even boosts the bass up a little bit.

p1116
sg5
VThese are perfect (I DID say perfect) for any professional recording engineer or DJ who needs recording studio quality in a headphone. I'd even go as far as to say, if u didn't have your near field monitors around, these will work very well for you. This closed ear design is great and thisAudio-Technica ATH-M50xDG  model is designed for the person who wants to hear more of what was actually recorded and nothing extra, also the audiophile who wants headphones for chillin' out, because you will experience (at least, very close to) that flat response you're looking for your pro recordings or mixes.I would NOT recommend these for mastering. I'd recommend open-ear design in that case.

I have had the experience of many headphones and these are by far the best pair I have ever experienced.I decided to plug in the mini headphone amp it I bundled it with....It was one of the greatest music experiences! The amp made the music sound unbelievable! High quality sound that flowed like a river of music through my ears giving me a flawless symphony of sounds. I did not want to stop the music, I am still listening now. You can increase the bass with the little amp and boy does it work!! Highly recommend the bundle! would by again

VThese headphones are absolutely awesome. Audio quality is the best I've ever experienced. Theyve got a bit of weight to em and feel like they're very well built. Pads are very soft. The sound stage is very "in your face". It's definitely not like sitting in a concert hall but more like sitting on stage with detailed clear sound of everything that's being played.They are a bit tight out of the box. So if you've got a big head I'd suggest to stretch em out. Also  when I first used them I felt like the bass was a bit overpowering but after putting over 45 hours through em it's toned down and feels alot more balanced.I love these headphones and while I got em on sale here at amazon for a crazy price I would gladly pay twice that.

VI really do enjoy these headphones. For build quality, I think that they are pretty sturdy. I am very careful with how I handle them and I purchased a case for them as well, so I can't speak for drops and rough use but for general use from day to day, they are good.Sound: for the average person, I think they sound amazing. They are closed back headphones, so they focus heavy on centering the music on your ears and this create a "noise canceling" appearance, though they aren't noise canceling. I think the mids, lows, and highs are pretty balanced. Me personally, I can turn the volume up on most songs and it not get distorted. I will mention that these are not bass heavy, so for those wanting that, look elsewhere.I've had them for a month, and so far I'm impressed. Still testing them but i don't think I will return them.

VExcellent build quality. Can wear comfortably for hours without any pain on my ears or head. Band adjusts which was great since I have a big head. Ears can get a bit sweaty after prolonged use. Came with multiple cables for different connections to amps and such. Came with a free amp when I bought it so that was a nice bonus.

VThese headphones are fantastic. I researched headphones for about a year before finally buying these. I am an audiophile and love music so I needed headphones that I could bring with me all the time and that sounded incredible. I found them. My roommates and friends have tried these and have been thoroughly impressed as well. I can't say enough about these. If you're looking for headphones go with these. You won't be disappointed. They sound so much clearer and better than the Beats and the Sonys. Great price too!!

Clear, Accurate, comfortable. I am going to purchase a 2nd pair so I'll have one for home and one for the office.  I know that I would greatly appreciate the super high-end headsets, and I'm sure they're superior... in most cases.  But for the money, get these.

V... Bose AE2 headphones for several years and I was happy with them
p1210
sg5
VI used a pair of Bose AE2 headphones for several years and I was happy with them.  They were getting worn out though so I decided to do some research and find a nice replacement.  I visited several headphone and audiophile sites to see what was out there for what I wanted to spend and the ATH-M50X headphones were consistently lauded as some of the best (if not THE best) headphones in the $100-$200 price range.  Now I know why.  I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile but I am amazed at the sound these headphones provide.  The sound is clear and consistent from low to high and I am picking up subtle sounds in the background of movies and games that I never picked up on with my Bose headphones or my speakers.  Music sounds great and I am completely satisfied with this purchase.I will say that the Bose headphones are lighter and more comfortable but some of that I can attribute to having worn them for so long.  The ATH-M50X is not a good choice for listening on the go but if you plan to sit in a comfortable chair and watch a movie, listen to music, or play a game these are a great choice.The product comes with a nice bag for storage and three types of cords.  Both 3.5mm and 1/4" jacks are included - the larger jack is removable and can be used on all three cords.  I like that the cords can be removed from the headphones (e.g. if the cat chews through the cord it can be replaced).PROs: Amazing sound for the price, great for a variety of media, sturdy construction, nice extrasCONs: Not ideal for travel

VHeadphone is a little large for my ears but still very cool outlook and very good sound quality. I like the locking feature. Even though the headphone doesn't block out much noise but it isn't a noise cancelling headphone so I don't blame it for it. I used to have bose qc20 headphone, it is a lot better than m50x for noise cancelling but m50x is better when I am in a quiet environment. I bought both this one and the navy one, I prefer this one.

VThe ATH-M50x headphones are the most expensive headphones that I have ever purchased. The price was WELL worth it. Crisp highs without making your ears bleed and great lows that is very well balanced. The "spinning ear cups" are a great feature as is the folding headband to be able to have one on ear and one off. I hear no "bleeding" into my vocal mic (AT-3035) even at high levels. I had been using the M30's for many years and this was a pleasant upgrade. Audio Technica gets two thumbs up for this product!!!

VThe wire jack on these headphones protrudes so far that it rubs against your neck and shoulder when you move your head.

VNot Impressed By the Sound Quality, Especially for the Price
p1264
sg5
VI am sorry to say that I was not impressed by these headphones. I wanted a pair of AT headphones ever since I was in high school. I watched countless reviews stating these were the best sounding headphones for $200 and under. I intended to use them daily as headphones at home for watching and listening to different forms of media (including audiobooks) and I found them to be no better than my apple headphones. I don't know if there is something I need to do to make them sound differently on my MacBook but I didn't bother to look into it because they should sound great without any effort on my part. I also found them to hurt after wearing for a short period of time (under an hour). I would recommend finding out if you can test them anywhere before making the purchase, then buying on here if you get a better price.

VThese headphones are absolutely awesome. I never realized what a great set sounded like, and I'm half-deaf in my left ear. They are crisp and clear, and they have a nice deep bass. I used to listen to a sound bar and thought it sounded excellent. But now that I have these, whenever I switch to the sound bar it sounds tinny and lacks depth. 10 stars if I could, I will never purchase a sub-par pair of headphones again.

Comes with a little carrying bag (not a case, just a bag).As I stated above, these are good value as the sound quality is equal to headphones costing at least $50 more.

VA court reporter's take on headphones.
p1323
sg5
VI am a court reporter.  So I need good headphones to listen to my audio when I review and edit my transcripts.  Sometimes hearing the smallest faints noises can make the biggest differences in the finished transcripts.  These are the best that I have ever used.  I can hear so much clearer with there headphones than other ones I have used.  They are also the most comfortable for long periods of listening.  During videotaped depositions I will take these headphones with me and plug them into the videographer's camera so that I know I can hear everything clearly.Do yourself a favor get these headphones.  You will not be disappointed.

VBest headphone's I've ever used, bar none.
p1353
sg5
VHere's my review after one year of using them. These headphones are the best headphones I have ever used. I don't use them for a professional duty but rather just for an everyday listening experience. For teenagers, the go to headphones are the Beats which empasize bass and nothing else. Which is great. If you listen to R&B; and rap and nothing else. However, go out of that and suddenly Fleetwood Mac doesn't sound as it should. For people in my age range (teens), for the same price as Beats, I highly advise getting these headphones.The sound quality as said before is absolutely pristine, and will simply blow anyone away in this price range. Also, the build quality is very good with metals and durable plastics and cushy leather. I can wear these for hours upon hours at a time and they are still comfortable. When one slips these on, they will know they are putting on serious equipment. They also fold up quite nicely as well. On the downside, my heavy usage has made the earcups wear down after a year with the leather cracking. However, replacing the earcups is simple and costs just $20.So, for $180 or so I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these headphones - they might have been the best $200 I've ever spent.

But they sound a heck of a lot better than a pair of $50 - $60 cans, AND you don't need to beat yourself up if you accidentally leave them somewhere.Bottom Line:  If you want a pair to pair great sound and reasonable price (see how I did that?) these should make the short list.

Bass is rich and present but not overpowering, highs are crisp and clean, all while keeping the mids crystal clear.Comfort is also a plus with these. I'm able to wear these for long periods of time (2-4 hrs) and not feel uncomfortable or fatigued.All around these are the best I've experienced so far in regards to sound quality and wearability.I highly recommend these to anyone looking for sub $200 headphones.

VIncredible headphones. Period. I'm not a professional music producer or anything, but have heard enough headphones to know just how good these are. Best headphones under $ 200? Absolutely. Sound is very crisp, bass is tight, and they seem to be pretty durable so far. They do get a little warm on my ears, but I only notice it when I take them off so it never bothers me. I did get the white ones for a couple reasons but the white is definitely a little much as I feel kinda weird wearing them in public. They aren't noise cancelling, but they do create a seal around your ears so I would say around 75% of noise is blocked out which I feel is a great balance because you can hear enough to tell if someone is talking to you.

VIn. Sane. Insane. These headphones are insane. I listen to a wide variety of music, from vocal, to classical, to acoustic, to classic rock, to alternative, to heavy metal, to hip hop, to trap, to dubstep. These headphones excel in absolutely everything.First off, they're loud. They can get about as loud as any ear buds on max volume, which is impressive for on-ear headphones.Next, they are comfortable. Personally for me, three clicks on both sides fits like it was tailored to me. The top head band has a soft leathery feel and it's usually not noticeable. The ear cups have a soft plush feel too and they seal sound well.Lastly, and most noticeably, the quality.. THE QUALITY. Best quality I've ever heard. The tone is extremely accurate. Because of this, super bass heavy music may underwhelming you, because it's not going to be boosted. However, music with huge dynamic range like trap or metal sounds amazing. All music has exceptional clarity, which is noticed with vocal music and acoustic music.Overall,perfect headphones. Honestly couldn't ask for r more.

VThe sound quality of these headphones is astonishing. I've spent the last few years buying 50 dollar headphones and never really found any I was happy with long term. These headphones change everything, and I am so happy I coughed up the extra dough to buy these.Pros:Sound good on a phone:These headphone are the first full size cans I've owned that actually sound excellent when played through something like a phone. With previous cans I always craved more bass when playing through my phone, and smaller earphones were the only ones sensitive enough to provide that. But these cans solve the problem in two ways: 1. Detailed, accurate sound makes everything sound clean and wonderful including the bass allowing me to run these at much lower volume and be completely satisfied. 2. These have very high sensitivity allowing them to produce the same perceived volume as earphones when set to the same setting on my phone.Another benefit of these cans is they are tuned perfectly (to my tastes) for music listening, which means EQ adjustments are not needed. The bass and treble are boosted just enough for music listening while still maintaining a very balanced sound across the board. This is in contrast to some cans which may provide a very flat even sound across the frequency range, but the lack of bass and treble make EQ adjustments necessary for the best music listening enjoyment. Since I plan to use these with all my devices including some which have very limited/zero EQ options, this is a huge plus for me.Very good build quality:The pictures do not do these cans justice, very high quality feel to them with a little bit of heft to them. These cans feel very solid and I am confident they will last. I love the low key understated design, not flashy and no glossy surfaces. I was worried that the use of plastic would make these feel cheap, but that is not the case at all.Very comfortable:The articulation on the ear cups on these is perfect, the tightness of the headband is just enough to provide great sound isolation without being uncomfortable.Cons:Would have liked to seen standard 3.5 jacks on the headphone, unfortunately it looks like you will be stuck using the cables included with the headphones as these are not compatible with standard 3.5 male to male cables. With that said, having 3 cable options included is awesome and they feel like durable cables (time will tell).Overall I am thrilled with these headphones and recommend them to anyone looking at full size cans. If you can't afford these now, it is worth the wait to save up and buy these, as these sound SO much better than cheaper cans and I suspect they will last much longer too.

VI'm comparing these to my Sennheiser 200 earbuds. The M50's heat up my ears so I have to let my ears breath from time to time. The M50's sound better than the ear buds but the M50's don't block noise as well as the 200's. They are decent for $120. But there are Sony's that are the benchmark I wish I would have checked out first. I've listened to both .flac and mp3's with mostly jazz and classical equalizer settings. I should have paid more and bought something from Bose.

VI got these headphones to mainly use with my electronic keyboard, and they have been amazing.  Normally when I listen to music I get some sort of headphones that usually have an equalizer in them that tries to make the music sound slightly better, but these headphones don't have a built in equalizer, it is just straight high quality sound.Using these headphones with my electric keyboard is a great test because I can easily tell the individual sound quality of all ranges from the 7 octaves of the piano.  Both the lows and highs sound great with no muddy sounds of washed out sounds.  After testing the sound on my piano I decided to test it listening to music and I was just as pleased.  The sound quality is incredible and for the price of these headphones it is definitely worth it.The headphones come with 3 different cables which is also neat since I need to use a 1/4" cable to plug into my piano, but a 1/8" cable to connect to the audio jack of my music player.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.

VLovely my old M50 (the older version) I tended to step on my headphones a lot cuz I'm not tidy at all and the connection to the head caps from the arch broke and it was not a big deal because the sound was still good and i just had to tape it up (not an attractive-walk-on-a-street-with-this-chuky-headphones anyways) But the jack though it looked pretty strong metal piece, it wasn't a malleable  material at all so it broke off after nearly a year of use. I'm glad in the new one, the jack is replaceable (i mean if you break if just get an aux cable right? ha) which is a lovely dash to these lovely headphones, sound is slightly better I believe but I actually think they basically have the same spec. The old ones were really big it didn't fit perfectly on my head which made the choice of extending the arch pointless for me,but the new ones seem to fit perfectly. and now I can use expandable arch for when I wear hats and etc. As always I love this product, lovely cost efficiency, and long lasting, really sturdy (I mean my old one broke but it is totally fixed in this one with the two way aux cord) I am in love it them. Totally recommend this product.

VOld cheap headphones, died, got a recommendation from an audio-phile friend that these had excellent sound AND were comfortable to wear all day which was a priority as I work in a multi-tenant office and use music to drown out the noise.Love these headphones, not a single complaint.  But be warned, they require a proprietary locking cable connector on the headphone side of the connection, so don't lose or break your cables or you need to buy from them.

VObviously I've been on YouTube before and just as anyone else I've heard about these headphones and while they do sound good I'm just not too impressed.  I've used them straight from my iPhone and from my Mac with an amp and dac and I'm just constantly trying to figure out what people are constantly praising them for.  They aren't really monitors even though they are generally balanced they are still bass heavy.  I know these are supposed to be what people buy instead of Beats but I just don't see any reason to buy them instead of Beats (besides price point) because while they sound better they aren't as perfect as people make them out to be.  If you are really buying headphones for Studio monitoring pick up the ATH-M70xs because they have a truly balanced sound.

Thiugh they don't have a passive noise cancelling feature, they block out enough physical sound to be compared to the other noise cancelling headphones for the same price. They came highly recommended by a DJ I know, and I can see why.

VI bought these as an inexpensive alternative to the ATH-MR7 headphones, which I bought a few months ago. As much as I love the MR7s, I'm not sure I'd want to ride the New York subway with them on. In addition to being much less expensive, the ATH-M50x has a much more flexible design that allows them to be folded into a more compact form for travel. That said, they use a non-standard locking 2.5mm headphone jack that requires use of the proprietary cords that come with the headphones. Designed as a studio monitor, these phones were not intended for use with a smart phone and the supplied cords lack even a microphone, let alone controls. Suitable replacement cords are available from third parties, however, so that is not a significant issue.My quibble with these cans, however, is in sound quality. Although I would agree that the sound is exceptional for the price, There are other headphones in the price range that are nearly as good, and with a frequency response that is more to my taste. The high end of these is much better than most of the competition, but it's not in the same league as the ATH-MR7s. I find the bass response of the ATH-M50x, however, to be excessive and boomy - not something I was expecting from a studio monitor. Don't get me wrong - these are excellent headphones, but not nearly as exceptional as all the reviews would lead you to believe.

VMy son is studying to be recording engineer and was looking for a good set of reasonably priced headphones.  He wanted a set he could use in the studio, at live events and for post production work.  Now I am not going to say that these are the best out there for all of these applications, rather these are a great set for any application at a price that won't break the bank.Sound - brilliant highs and full lows without being "boomy". The mid-range is a bit weak, but not too much.  So these are not entirely flat (which is optimal) but they are very close for a student just cutting his teeth.Isolation - They also do an incredible job isolating ambient/background noise.  These are not noise cancelling, but they do a remarkable job at blocking out outside sounds.  The full ear coverage, tight fit of the ear cups and the comfortable headband all combine for a snug, insulated fit; even when wearing eye glasses.Comfort - Again, these headphones really perform in this area as well.  Yes, the ear cups are snug fitting, but there is no binding or undue pressure anywhere.  You can wear these phones for hours and there will be no irritation.  Yes, they can get a little warm, but this is true with any full coverage set.Construction - These appear to be well made and should hold up for the long run. I can not find any areas where A_T cut any corners in construction which might become a cause for breakage.  Take care of them and they should hold up just great.  We really like the detachable cord - this is the weak area in any headset and the fact that you can replace a damaged cord easily is a real plus!!!Plus - this particular set looks great too boot!

The build quality is superb and it matches up with the sound quality that is delivered with these studio headphones. I love almost everything about it, the only thing I dislike about it which is a give-and-take is the swivel cups. The swivel cups are great for so many reasons but most of the time they kind of flip on you whenever you put them down, so whenever you pick them back up you have to adjust them. (this is not really a con it's just something to keep in mind)

VForget Seinheisser, Sony (Bluetooth style), Skullcandy, Monster, Bose, and especially those darn Beats! This is what SOUND is suppose to sound like. It picks up lows and highs. Jazz and pianos play so smooth. Techno music bangs out every zazz and you definitely can rock out as if your in the studio with the band listening to rock music.My husband and I have a background in music, video, and sound production. Either in the studio or out in the field. Both of us have keen ears and can pick up on things that people usually don't hear. What the Sony MDR 7560 don't pick up, this will. I brought him both depending what he is working on, you need to hear a different to e, pitch, no bass/bass, etc... The clarity of instruments and counting beats, ear comfort for long time use, longevity because you can lock in your cord and not step on it and yank it out when you step down out of your chair. It's genius! I want to buy me and my dad a pair as well!!! :-)Search no more. These are IT!! The blue and caramel is more beautiful in person and the caramel color is not too bright and still looks masculine.

VI'm not a major audiophile but do know and appreciate the difference a good pair of cans will make for enjoying my music.  After intensive research I chose the M50x upon receiving a pair of tinny Bose that hurt my ears both inside and out.  Everything from any genre sounds clean, balanced, crisp, and excellent with these.  Volume changes nothing in quality and they are extremely comfortable for long sessions.No amp needed on these if it's the music you want to hear.  Mids, highs, lows, all outstanding.The removable, interchangeable cord lengths are a huge plus that came as a surprise to me.  Make no mistake, more money really won't get you a better experience.

VTakes Some Time To Adjust To Them
p1680
sg5
VI bought these on Black Friday for $95.  Coming from Beats Solo 2 and hearing about all the hype of these headphones, I knew I had to get them.  Upon unboxing them, I was surprised at how large these headphones actually are.  They are definitely made for an adult, and even thought I would say I have a big head, these are pretty big.  They are almost a lot more durable and comfortable then the beats, however, I noticed that they do make my ears kind of sweaty if I wear them for a while.  As for sound quality, I was expecting these to be amazing, and when I first heard them, I was kind of surprised on what I heard.  Coming from beats, they were really flat sounding and lacked a lot of bass.  However, after about a week, I was able to get used to it and now, when I hear the beats, I think they sound nowhere near as good as the m50s.  These are really clear sounding headphones with really good sound isolation.  Also, probably my favorite thing about these headphones, are the cables they come with.  The short cable is great for when you are listening to you phone, and the 10 ft straight cable is great for office situations.  The coiled cable is also great, but I hear it can eventually uncoil if you stretch it too much, so I've been trying to be careful.  Overall, I would say if you give these headphones enough time to allow yourself to adjust to them, they are truly amazing headphones.

VBought Dark Green, "copper hue" metal on headphones is silver in person
p1685
sg5
VI bought the 2015 Special Edition DG / Dark Green. The metal rings on the outside of either ear and the labels indicated L and R are silver.. they're not copper looking at all. When you have a 3.5mm cord with gold tips sitting right next to it in extremely bright sun, a colorblind person would almost certainly even notice the extreme difference.There's zero indication they were tampered with, no scratch marks where someone would pry them off and replace them with the standard silver ones found on cheaper models. And I did buy them directly from Amazon.  So I assume this happened at the manufacturing plant. Either way, it's not what I paid for./// Overall Review ///As for the rest of the headphone set, it looks exactly like the picture. The dark green is almost black and the brown is a nice rich brown. The leather feels like mid-grade quality, better than most at this price range.As for the audio, it sounds great (which is why I dont think these are knock-offs). And the plastic isn't the type I'd expect to easily break if you dropped them. Be warned, if you have a medium/large head that you might need to get used to these for a while but it's better they sit firm than constantly falling off.And these over the M40x's does show that there is more base, although if you can get the M40x's for $65 new as they were yesterday (Christmas Eve) then those would be far better as paying double for extra base isn't remotely worth it imo.The cords, however trivial they may seem are a nice touch. I like using the coiled one for my computer and the short straight cord for walking around or gaming on the sofa./// Conclusion ///I'd give these headphones 4 stars if it weren't for the pretty big issue with the metal not being what it should be. I'm knocking off 2 stars because it kills the look not having the gold. If you imagine the rich brown, dark green, and an aluminum look it's simply not the same as it with the gold. It's also a $37 difference compared to if I would have got the White or Black pairs.

VSuper excited about receiving these headphones only to find out that right side did not work!  I have just returned them.. After looking at the negative reviews I saw quite a few that had the same issue. In fact even in the Audio-Technica web site there are reports of the same problem (12-10-2015).  Some had the issue after a few months. I am not willing to buy another pair and have to worry that after a few months they will not work.  That is not a way to enjoy music! Quite disappointing to say the least.

VThe sound quality is purely amazing, however it is nearly impossible to listen to your music in a moderatly quiet place due to how much sound it leaks. Its not even a "hum" from the outside you are able to hear everything, almost similar to open-back headphones. They are made for quality and have a great price for the sound, but only listen when alone or in a noisy area.

p1714

VGood headphones. My only complaints are the padding and size. Size wasn't a big deal, it was just hard to carry this thing around anywhere other than a bag or around my neck. Padding caused earaches for me towards the second year of usage and i had to regularly repuff the cushions by squishing them around so the lumpy piece of metal inside the earphones wasn't completely crushing my ears.My pair's already broken but that's because i'm pretty rough with all headphones i buy (i sleep with them on and wear them practically everywhere, so I essentially get 24/7 usage out of them. i know, i shouldn't sleep with headphones on etc). Then again, it wasn't even the sleeping-with-headphones-on that broke my pair. I dropped mine on concrete and the plastic rotation piece snapped exposing a wire, and even then it still worked for another solid half year (with some help from a bit of super glue).Considering getting another one with some christmas cash, might look around more. But if i can't find anything I'm definitely coming back to audio technica. Great sound for half the price of Beats, replaceable wires, incredible durability. Just don't drop these things on concrete.

VTruly unbelievable!!! Sound is Crisp and Clear with good Bass outstanding for this price
p1738
sg5
VSound is extraordinary. Using it with Fiio Amplifier even with full volume it never distorted. Sound is crystal clear. These headphones are very powerful. You can hear the sound coming out of these beasts like a mini stereo speakers at high volume when the headphones are placed on table. But at the same time when you put this back on head it isolates the sound very well. There is no sound leakage and the noise isolation is way better than other closed headphones. It is portable and you can use it on public transit without disturbing others sitting next to you.BASS is punchy and deep when it driven from good audio source and amp. Bass is heavy compared to open back headphones at the same time it not over emphasize the mids and highs. Very clean sound. I always use and prefer my 200 rupees AWEI Q3 in ear headphones if i only want to hear bass heavy tracks.Sound stage is not that good. I am also using Sennheiser hd 598. Those are open back headphones not bass heavy but having wide sound stage. After hearing hd 598 these headphones are not up to the mark when listening the music involved with lot of instruments. Instrument separation is lagging but it depends on each taste if you like to listen bass heavy genre like EDM , Rock or Trance these are very good. If you are the type of Classical music listener hd 598 is very very good.This headphones are not that bassy headphones which surpass the other part of the music. It is well balanced. Flat response like it is made for studio monitor headphones but still bass heavy. I like the high volume crisp and bass on this headphones. HD 598 is good on Wide soundstage and instrument separation. Over all i am very much satisfied with both these headphones. Advantage of M50x is it is made for all type of music.Do not crank the volume always try to listen with good audio source and volume at <60%Comfortable is good. Build quality is very good and Sound quality is way more worth than the money we paid. Three detachable cables are very good options with leather pouch but package is disappointed comes with open box not sealed. Since i do not want to affect the product review rating i gave 5 stars. Overall Bang for Bucks...

VOk, So I have been looking at these headphones for quite a while. Many people (Including MKBHD) had recommended me these headphones and I finally bought them now that I had enough money. Before I was using Philips earbuds that cost about $10.First off, these headphones sound INCREDIBLE!Every frequency sounds excellent. Crisp highs, deep lows, great bass response, and overall awesome sound.Between the earbuds, the difference in sound was literally night and day!The noise cancellation is pretty good also. So if you are in a quiet public area, you don't have to worry about everyone around you hearing what music you are listening to.These headphone are also very comfortable. They also feel very light while still being well built. So it will feel very nice for long trips on trains, airplanes, etc.I can't recommend these headphones enough. These are THE best headphones anyone can buy for this price range!

VI got this as a Christmas gift and this was one of the three over-ear headphones I was asked to choose from (the others were the Sennheiser Urbanite XL and the Bose SoundTrue Around Ear) under $200. I got this today and I've been loving it ever since. I just had no idea what I was missing when I listened to regular in-ear headphones that usually came with my smartphone. I highly recommend this. The only setback--which I knew about before I made my choice--is that it doesn't have the capability of answering calls and what-not. I chose to have amazing sound quality over that small feature--and I totally don't regret it!

I ran them thru the paces with many SACD, bluray, and HDDVD audio tracks thru my Onkyo receiver,  and while not bad by any means...I found them lacking across all musical genres.  And you had to listen to them at a fairly loud setting to really get anything worthwhile from these cans.  I don't understand all the glowing reviews....Ive had some nice cans in my time with clear, level, crisp sound...and these are NOT it.My search continues for a great set without breaking the bank.....

VI had these in my wish list for quite a while. Finally saw them at $117 and grabbed them. They are as good as the other reviews say they are. Crisp, beautiful sound. Awesome design. I've had other brands (for about the same price or above), and none even comes close. Listening to your music with these is another whole world.Note: I did feel them a bit tight at first (because these are studio headphones.) If this is your case as well, you can just work the headband to loosen off the tightness by holding and stretching out the padded area (padded area only).All in all, five stars all the way.

(Better than beats).  Now that being said. There will be times you need to listen to music as it was intended to be. ....not to be drown out with over powering bass.... these are the most balance soundings headphones  for under 200 bills.

VInitially loved these headphones. Feel good, sound great. I even bought a second pair Unfortunately, my first set stopped working after only 4 months. I am trying to figure out how to get them replaced, but it hasn't been easy. Very disappointed. If I get them replaced or fixed, I will update my review. Until then...  1 star it is.

VThese headphones are by far my favorite headphones I have ever tried! Be warned they are not super base heavy so if you are looking for that I would look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a pair of headphones that are very well balanced and sound crystal clear then these are for you! They also are super comfortable! I will wear these on huge editing sprees 8-10 hours without a break and these have never one hurt my ears and are extremely comfortable the whole time. The fit and finish on these are amazing no flaws from what I can tell. For just personal listening around town etc. I end up using the shortest straight cable for the studio I end up using the slinky cable. I recommend these to anyone who is looking for a pair of super comfortable and great sounding headphones!

VAwesome but not 100% new
p1909
sg5
VI am really happy with the headphones. They work really well and come with everything it says thay is included. But... When i got it i noticed that it was not 100% new. The box was not sealed and the box had a big dent in it. Maybe it wasnt from the seller but when it was being shipped. The headphones does get dirty on the ear pads and on the part that goes over your head. But i expected that but it really isnt a problem because no one else sees the parts thay are dirty when you are wearing them. When i got them the compression the headphones have on your ears make your ears or head hurt but after using them for hours you start to not notice. Also i notice really little markes on the headphones. When i got them. I feel like the headphone were used but only for a couple days. Overall im suspitious about them not being new. I would give it a five because the headphones are awesome and work really well but they werent 100% new so yeah. Hope this helped or answered any questions someone has on these. I think i mostly just talked non sense the whole time, sorry.

V3.5 Stars  I agree with others that the high's can be a bit sharp on some songs and others it sounds just fine. Depending on the artist I have to adjust the treble down on my DAC as it does pierce my ears at normal to higher levels. That being said, I love the build quality on these. They are a sturdy hard plastic and on the bottom of the headband it has clearly mark the (L) left and (R) right position, so you can quickly put them on without having to look too hard. I'll need to try and wear these for a long period to see it they'll hurt my head or ears. I'm looking to make these my travel phones because of the price (black friday) and compact form they come in.

VA Headset to rely on
p1921
sg5
VHaving owned the original M50 since the spring of 2013, I enjoyed the phones for the longest time. Their sound was punchy and robust, with well controlled bass, but had spikey treble at times. However, the ear cups had become so cracked and petrified over time that it was time for an upgrade.That's where I bought these. Having received them, these things hands down have done nothing but improved. The ear cups are made of a newer, plusher material, with what appears to be a different type of pleather, which I hope in time holds up better than the original M50 pads. The plastics are of the same material, but to me the greatest feature is the cable option. Now I can use these phones with the 3.5 meter cable to use these phones around my campus.As for the sound, it's better than ever. I have noticed that not only is the bass more controlled, the treble is still sparkly, crips, and detailed, it lacks sibilance. These are so beautifully toned that equalization is not even necessary if all you want is true to life sound.Proud owner of the ATH M50 for over two years, and for many more to come.

VBest headphones I have owned to date. Great frequency response and very clear tones. The bass hits hard and the treble rings true. Comfortable to wear all day and does not give me the headache some others will. The ear cups are very soft and do well at isolating you from the world. That is a feature for me, but others are not a fan. I can block out the loudest of people without having to max the volume. The variety of cord lengths mean you have choices for wiring options when traveling compared to a more stationary setup.

VAll the reviews I saw had nothing but good things to say
p1981
sg5
VI purchased these headphones back in October off a lightning deal, after I decided that my Skullcandy Aviators were no living up to what I wanted out of them, and I certainly did not want to go down the path of over-priced bass-centric Beats. I did my research on this pair of headphones as well as a few other pairs, and with the lightning deal bringing the price down to $119, there was nothing even close to beating this pair. All the reviews I saw had nothing but good things to say, and they're also one of the best looking pairs in my personal opinion.When I first opened the box, I was extremely pleased. While packaging has nothing to do with the quality of the product itself, it always adds a little bit to the joy of opening something new and expensive. The packaging on this was great, and kept all the components well protected during shipping. I put on the headphones, and everything seemed to go quiet. Even though they don't have active noise cancelling, the noise isolation went well above and beyond what I had expected. As someone who flies quite a bit (often in other countries/continents) this takes away the need to worry about charging my headphones for the active cancellation, and I don't need to worry about bringing charger adapters as well, however with these I still don't need to worry about the noise of the plane drowning out the sound of my music or movies.Two months in and I use these headphones just about every day. Usually they're plugged in to my computer, however they often find themselves plugged in to my guitar amp. Luckily they came with a 6.5mm cord that works perfectly, so that's yet another adapter I don't have to worry about. These headphones really are great at just about everything I've put them through; just about every genre of music, videos/movies, and noise isolating. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a high end set of headphones without getting in to the audiophile range of products. Audiotechnica, keep making great products.

VThese headphones are incredibly sleek-looking, sturdy, and comfortable to boot. I wore them for a good three hours straight today and had no problems with head pain or pressure on the ear as I normally do with headphones. I have an oversized head, so for a guy with a plus-sized noggin this is a huge bonus. The sound quality is excellent - good ranges, no crackles, and clear as crystal. The variable length cords are an awesome addition as well; I like the coiled cable personally, but the straight ones have their merit. If you're going to go high-end for headphones, I would definitely recommend these ones. I cannot personally speak to their ability as studio headphones, but they certainly an immersive experience when gaming.

VThe Best Headphone for Audio Lovers
p2009

VIf you are a true audiophile and love to hear rich sounds within the music and other media than these headphones are a must for the listener. i ordered my pair through Amazon and it has been delivered quick, in a little of three days or less. Now these headphones are very durable and can maintain it's original form always. I've had these headphones for over a year and they look perfect as just out the box(mainly bc i like to keep my stuff neat and safe). they are quite flexible, though i do not recommend twisting them. They may feel delicate, but it is well crafted and well made with good material for everyday use. The headphone fits perfect and is not to tight, but almost relaxing to wear. however, the cups around the ear may get your ears warm and feel hot, nothing bad but noticeable. It also comes with three cables of different lengths which is pretty nice and useful, it also includes a carrying pouch, not very useful as a hard shell case, but almost like a shield from being scratched. Now the sound is excellent, which is why i write this review. With these headphones, you hear a song perfectly, the sound is rich and even hear sounds not hearable in other headphones. i mainly listen to classical songs like the Beatles, Queen, Elvis Presley, etc and with Audio Technica ATH-M50x the song is only more pleasing to listening, Not just songs but also, anything you can listen to and you notice the details and fluent sounds. However, they do not have much base as beats or V-Modas but base is perfect as it is, hip-hop and R&B; can be enjoyed excellent. Finally, these headphones are a must get, they are worth more than 5 stars, just to good. But do keep in mind they are studio monitor headphones, mainly used in computer for editing, this is nothing to worry about at all, as they offer great quality sound to the listener.

VThese are absolutely incredible and you should pay no attention to the meaningless one and two star reviews. Absolutely fantastic headphones! Crystal clear highs (never heard better!) and super punchy bass for Reggae or Metal music. I have tested them with vinyl on my Audio Technica AT120 (with Shure m97xe cartridge) and truly blown away. I will say there was a slight adjustment period for my ears after years of using a pair of Sony MDR700 DJ headphones which I still do love (although I doubt they will see much use now!). I found that each day they were sounding a little better. A few vinyl sources sounded a little bright but I think that was based on the recording quality (Stones Hot Rocks vinyl one of them). I also tested them on my Ipod classic with Fiio E6 amplifier with excellent results.Only had them a week and so far testing with: Pink Floyd Animals, Eric Clapton Crossroads Festival, Dire Straits Brothers In Arms, John Mayall Blues Alone, Judas Priest Painkiller, and many others. Wow..is all I can say. They handle anything you throw at them. I will edit my review with a comparison of the Sennheiser HD598 which is a totally different style, open back headphone once received. I heard too many great things about the Sennheiser's not to try them. My first impressions are that the Audio Technica ATH-M50x crushes the Sony MDR700 (still solid). Most likely I will use the ATHm50x for rock, metal or my Ipod and use the Sennheiser's for my quiest man cave vinyl set up but we will see!UPDATE- no doubt about it, the Sennheiser HD598 is a fantastic headphone. I am very glad that I have both of them. Bottom line, i think most people would want the A.T. because they are portable, still sound fantastic, and are top notch quality. I would say if you have a dedicated listening area in your home with no noise you might want to try the Sennheiser. Can't go wrong, they both rock!

VThese headphones are amazing!!! After spending a few months gathering specs and comparing headphones, I decided to give the M50x a try. The headphones came in a nice package with 3 cables, 2 adapters and a leather pouch (leather pouches are the standard nowadays). I want to point out that the warranty sheet must be filled out within a few days of receiving the headphones --Make sure you keep that receipt--. The first time I tried them was in a live event, I was blown away since it doesn't add to any of the frequencies and it made the equalization more precise and much easier.With the M50x Professional Studio, I wouldn't go near the Dre beats. --I KNOW--- hard to believe but is the truth.

VHonestly, I'm a little underwhelmed. I've plugged these into multiple sources, from phones, computers, to high-end desktop audio interfaces. They sound good and clear, but bass response is extremely lacking. Honestly I feel like the bass is intentionally rolled off below about 200hz or so.Build quality is good, and they're comfortable.

VI like the head phone set a lot. The only thing I am really disappointed about is that the shortest cord stopped working after I caught a sit in the bus accidentally with it and to get a new one is going to be about $20. But I keep using the set with a coiled cord which is a little long.

VAmongst the Best Headphones Money Can Buy - Yes, I Am Serious!
p2147
sg5
VI am a former musician and longtime audiophile who has a large collection of mostly little-used equipment. Money is not an issue, as I am a relatively wealthy person thanks to a successful business that I lucked into. I was a high-end stereo/appliance salesman in my teens and early 20's. That experience taught me that price is often NOT an indication of sound quality. For instance, these ATH-M50X's actually sound better in some ways than my friend's $6,000 electrostatic setup; they have  a deeper, more real-world bass; a livelier treble; and greater comfort. Do not be fooled by the ATH-M50X's low price, as any professional musician who hears them will tell you that they are the real deal. I use them with an ancient 250W/ch Sansui power amp and separate preamp, which gives them Earth-shattering dynamic headroom and clarity. I also own the Sennheiser HD800's, Sony MDR Z7's, Grado PS1000's, Grado 325e's (I like these more than the PS1000's!), and several other models including the "lowly" Grado SR80's, which are true audiophile phones, contrary to popular myth. But the ATH-M50X's are my ultimate headphones of choice because of their unexpected transparency, definition, detail, frequency response, comfort, wear-abilty, outside noise blocking, and outright fun factor. They are just so practical and addictive that I cannot stop wearing them. I must admit that in terms of prestige and accuracy, the Sennheiser HD800's rule the roost and I love showing them off, but behind closed doors I prefer the the M50X's, despite their expected minuscule imperfections, which all h-phones have. The latter are also a great choice for my portable devices and even my lowly iMac 27" headphone jack (you would not believe how powerful they sound, thanks in part to their low impedance.) Keep in mind that these phones are only as good as the source material and amp, etc., so do not expect great sound from lousy amps, recordings, etc. I can only laugh at the negative reviews from self-proclaimed experts who use pseudoscience to evaluate these and other headphones. Do you actually want to enjoy music the way that it sounded when it was recorded -- or measure everything by meaningless, zero-evidenced, nebulous criteria invented by profit-driven manufacturers and the naive "experts" who have been brainwashed by them?

VThese are great headphones. I produce music in Ableton, and I got a set of these to use as my monitoring headphones. Great headphones. I will note, however, that the sound is a bit on the bright side. I think these headphones over-accentuate the high frequencies and leave out a bit of the low. I have to be careful when mixing to keep this in mind, otherwise my tracks come out a little bass heavy/muddy. Its not a huge effect, just slight, but i wanted to note it for those of you out there looking to use these for music production.Still a 5/5 since i got these on lightning deal for 120.

VFor me these didn't work out.  2 reasons, first they were very uncomfortable on my ears and second after owning Sony MDR-7506's for so many years the sound simply did not float my boat, the Sony's in my opinion just flat blow these things out of the water.  I did give them a chance, listened thru a high quality Amp and Dac with Lossless Music.  Such a huge 180 from my Sony's.  Reason I bought them was they are rated so highly and I had simply wore out my old Sony's.  In the end these went back and I ordered another pair of the 7506's.  Other than that these Headphones are built extremely well, look great the whole sha-bang, to each's own. Good Listening.

They're fabulously comfortable and look great. They come with three different cables to accommodate all of your uses.Again, if you want headphones to bump and thump to with your hip-hop or house music with heavy bass, I'd keep looking for a different pair.

I don't usually like to talk to other people while I play but these are great quality headphones and are perfect for gaming. If you have money to blow and you want a big name then go for it but I will stick with my Audio-Technicas.

p2265
sg5
VI'm not a fan of these overall, despite liking the sound (for the most part.) For Gaming they are great if you find them comfortable, I don't after an hour or so. For music they sound good to me except when I listen to Led Zeppelin which I mention because though I have a varied and weird taste in music the songs I know inside and out are by zeppelin. They just don't sound right to me making me think they don't have a neutral sound, which to me is a mark against them. I would rather listen to what I feel like rather than what suits my headphone. Also that proprietary 2.5mm jack makes me hate you as a company. These are good sounding phones though, great sound-stage for closed back, great sound when gaming and certain music I like, when on sale at $100 great deal, great headphone, normal price try first and not a bad experience if I didn't go insane and start buying other headphones trying to find my perfect pair.

I listen to a lot of EDM using these headphones and find the bass to be quite immense and punchy, which is more than sufficient for me atleast..i would definitely recommend these to people looking for an all-round, beautiful sounding, "bang for the buck" kinda headphones.

VI've been using these for several hours now and I wanted to love them, I really did, but there's a discernible difference between the sound on these and the sound from Sennheizer Momentums. I was so excited to buy these after the tragedy that was my Bose QC25 Noise Cancellation headphones, but something about the sound quality is falling flat of perfection. I'm not an audiophile, don't know much about frequency or the science of each musical aspect, but I've been playing musical instruments at a professional level for over 11 years and have been classically trained to know the difference between good sound and great sound. These are just good sound.

VThe construction of the headphones is quite robust thusfar, and the headphone's detachable cord does have the ability to lock in place, should you not want it to ever detach.As for the sound, they're quite clear. They deliver a much more present mid-range than most headphones. Consequentially, these headphones are not tuned for overwhelming bass, though they'll still deliver a reasonable amount - it just won't make audio mixed with heavily boosted low frequencies to sound so muddy and overwhelming, if that for some strange reason is the reason you're looking for a headphone.They're quite comfortable to wear, lastly.

VI purchased these along with several other models to find the best headphones for my needs.Here are the highlights of my testing:Pros:Extremely clear, highs and mids are very well balanced. Bass is clear and great for many different types of music.Gloves for the ear: Very comfortable! Soft leather, over-ear these feel really good.Build quality: They feel solid and well made.Cons:Quieter than many of the other models, (This is because they are higher impedance). They aren't as loud as i'd like them to be on my phone, but  laptop or other audio equipment can power them into the loss0of-hearing range. So while this is a con, it's not too bad.Bass: although clear, they don't have as much bass as I would PREFER. The bass is tuned to match the mids and highs well.Unique cords: They come with 3 pairs of cords, but they are unique to these headphones. Its nice that they lock in place so they aren't going to get pulled out, but after you go through all 3 pairs you cant just throw any other cord on (again, not a big deal).Overall, they are an excellent pair of headphones. The cons were all miniscule.

p2360

VWonderful headphones.Audio comes through clearly and the different frequency ranges are well defined. Bass is present but not overpowering, and the mids sound good, as well. I would say that the highs aren't quite as clear as I'd like and some of those notes tend to sound a bit "muddy" to my ears.As far as build goes, zero complaints. Every piece seems made to last and feels like it'd take extreme carelessness or malice to break. There is one downside to this, however. The headphones actually fit pretty tight. I've owned them for a year and a half now and I can say that they've only slightly loosened their grip on my markedly average sized head.They're also nice and easy to run. You don't need a mic amp or any special hardware to power these headphones. Just plug them directly into either the back panel or front panel of your computer and you're good to go. I even had them plugged into my old Galaxy S3 at one point and they worked just fine.Pros: Good lows and mids. Build quality is phenomenal. Easy to run.Cons: Tight fit doesn't seem to ever relent. Slightly muddy highs.

p2384

VI decided to give these a shot after my new puppy ate my second pair of Sony MDR-7506s, and I must say, I'm impressed. While I will say I do not think spending double the money for these vs. the 7506s is quite worth it, there are many things i do prefer about these that might sway your own purchasing decisionThey have about the same sound quality, maybe a bit crisper than the Sony headset, but they fit tighter. Also, the fit is a lot nicer due to the fact that the ear cups swivel so it turns with your head to provide a better seal. The fact that you can disconnect the cable from the headset itself is also a huge bonus. The headset also comes with 3 different cords (one short straight, long straight, and coiled) So it beats the Sony in that aspect as well.All in all, between the two, I will probably buy these again if i ever need to instead of Sony's unless I am short on cash. The 7506 is a FANTASTIC headset, these just offer some nice quality of life upgrades in comparison.

I've had these for about 9 months now and they continue to be my daily headphones. For reference, I listen to music ~5 hours/day.I will mention that I replaced the original earcups with the Shure HPAEC840 ear cups as those are a little thicker. My ears would press against the hard plastic on the inside of the earphone but these thicker ear pads helped with that.Do I wish it came with a hard case? Yes. Is the soft pouch good enough for carrying them around? Yes.Sound quality: 9/10Build quality: 9/10Comfort: 8/10 - Made better (for me anyway) with the new ear cups.

p2468
sg5
VThis is my first time using actual headphones instead of gaming headsets I've bought over the years. Listening to music with these is like hearing all of my favorite songs for the first time again. The sound quality from these is truly astounding. I knew that it would be better, but I wasn't sure I was going to be able to tell a difference. I am not an "Audiophile", but let me tell you the difference is night and day. In addition to that, they are super light weight, comfortable, and form a perfect seal around my ears. I have big ears and a small head, so I was really surprised at how comfortable they are. They also feel really really sturdy. I've paid they same amount of money for some of the "best" gaming headsets. They completely pale in comparison to the build and sound quality of these. In addition to ALL of that, they were also packaged very well (the box is really nice to open if that is your thing), and they come with 3 different cables to fit your preference.I can't believe what I've been missing out on all of these years. If you are looking to replace your gaming headset and happened to stumble upon these, look no further. Pick these up with a generic Mic. Once you hear how these sound, you won't be disappointed.I do not work for or am in any way affiliated with Audio-Technica or Amazon. I am just a REALLY happy customer. They have earned a new customer for sure. They will be my first choice down the road when I look for a new set of headphones.

As a father of 3 young children, these headphones allow me to enjoy my music without disturbing the rest of the house after the kids have gone to bed and they block out background noise really well when the kids are whiny (wife not pleased about that last part).  I had been researching different cans for a while now and I'm extremely happy that I chose the M50x.  Great performance at a competitive price.  Would definitely recommend to others.

VMy "Non-audiophile" opinion. Good sound. Tight fit, much better when stretched.
p2491
sg5
VOpinion of a "non-audiophile". Only ever had $20 headphones from Sony and Panasonic.Sound is fine, but did not amaze me.The M50's are certainly different. It seems more clear/crisp/distinguished? However, there is not such a huge, significant difference that it blew me away or anything. Sound just seems more polished/refined. I even started wondering if I maybe preferred the sound of my cheaper headphones. Could be I got used to my old ones and this new sound is strange to me. Could be my music files. I'm not sure yet, but these do seem to sound a touch or grade better.Comfort: They are tight, stretching suggested.The pads are soft and smooth, much softer than my old stiff and cracked ones. Also, I don't have a big head or anything. The headphones still clamped down tight, started to hurt after just a little bit. Got a bit of a headache and felt discomfort around the ears. HOWEVER, I looked online, and it is suggested that you stretch the headband for a few seconds on multiple forums and even the official site. They say the tight clamp makes for better noise isolation, which is more for a DJ in a loud club for example. For anyone just using them casually or wearing them for long periods of time, stretching a few seconds definitely helped A LOT. Do note that it will permanently make the headphones looser this way. Before stretching, I preferred the fit and feel of my old headphones. After stretching, they're just fine, comparable to my old ones that don't clamp at all. I should note my old ones have no noise isolation though. Just putting the M50s on will muffle your surroundings.Other ThingsI like the look, nothing special but pretty nice. The pouch and three types of removable cables are nice. I'm really just wondering if they were worth the upgrade (got them for $90). Not that they aren't great.  Sometimes high-end things are just wasted on someone like me. I don't get excited/amazed/hyped by many things, I suppose. If you're like me, these headphones are great. They work. But $20 might do just as well for you. I suggest going somewhere where you can try headphones on and see if if impresses you enough to be worth it. This is just my honest opinion. For those with more refined tastes, the other reviews may be more helpful.

V4.5 / 5.Got these for $115 on near the Black Friday / Cyber Monday madness and these babies are well worth every penny. I wanted the blue ones badly but they were $70 more.Sound quality:I compared these to the M40x side-by-side listening to Ten Years After's "I'd Love to Change the World" and My Digital Enemy & Rob Marmot's "African Drop (Tom Staar Remix)"; two songs on the opposite spectrum. One's a very "classic" rock with beautiful high-pitched solos and one's electronica with deep bass and synth galore. The M40x is audibly flatter. Whereas the M50x has about 5 dB up in the lows and tapers down, the M40x is pretty much flat all the way through. The highs and lows were more pronounced in the 50 and the 40 sounded slightly more boring. This was evident in the floor toms from "I'd Love to Change the World" and the bass rift from "African Drop" However, I'll admit, if you started me off on the M40x with nothing to compare to, I probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I'm not an audiophile and don't even have an amp.The detail on these are just amazing. It's like every instrument and note is stratified and individual. Coming from a Sennheiser HD 439, which I reviewed as a newbie trap, these are just on another level.Build quality:the material is plush, soft, and conforming. No complaints there. Time will tell if the white will hold up well. I both like and dislike how the folding mechanism is much stiffer than the M40x. It's less easier to activate but also need a bit more attention to not snap the hardware.Ergonomics:Here is where the 0.5 is deducted. They don't have enough clamping force for my head shape. I found this out the hard way on the flat bench. Every time I laid down to rep, they would slide off. And putting them around my neck felt like choking. Obviously, everybody's built differently so this may not be your case.Recommended?Absolutely. Believe in all the other rave reviews, folks!

Fortunate; as my DJs would have been angry at me to have to use these headphones and their hearing damaged by the gross over emphasis of bass. ... A person has to turn up the headphone to considerable loudness to get clear midrange. You can see this in online reviews and frequency response graphs. This ath-m50x have a broad bass boost with a 7+ decibel peak around 80hz. or so......They were returned to the music store. (yes  - they were broke in for an hour or two before I tried them)

VWonderful headphones with excellent sound quality
p2643
sg5
VAfter having been a Bose-only headphone user for years now, I picked these up on a whim and I've not looked back. The sound quality is absolutely great and the headphones are very well put together. I would say that these surpass the pair of QC 15 headphones I've had for a few years now and, while not truly noise cancelling, the quality of the sound itself goes a long way to create a pseudo-noise cancelling effect. Everything about these headphones are great and I can't imagine finding anything better for the price. Only thing I wish they would change is the not including the cord that you can control the music with. You have to buy a separate cord for that. But these are a wonderful pair of headphones and I'll be recommending them to anyone I know looking for something like this.

VFor the price, these are no doubt the best headphones you can buy. I actually owned all the beats products. The Pro, Studio, Mixr. Thinking that the Pros were the best headphones I had, I recently got these m50x for just $115. I was blown away. These headphones destroyed my beloved beats pros. Sound quality on these is definitely next level compared to those. The only downside is that the quality of materials chosen is very very cheap. Other than that these are flawless.

VBeautiful sound at an amazing price. The color was actually different from the one depicted in the image but it in my opinion looks even better in person, looks like an extremely high quality leather but its not haha. Feels super comfortable on the ears and the headband is extremely soft. Kinda sad my head is crazy big it stretches the headband so the covering kinda scrunchs together :( oh well, its the sound i'm after anyways. The earcups dont really sit around the ear but is kinda like a on ear design for me at least, very soft and comfy but might be hard to clean up after alot of usage. There's three major cables included which is amazing and the coiled one is perfect for desktop usage.These headphones are super easy to drive, mobile devices can make them super loud even without portable amp, but when these are on a dac/amp it's an inexpensive beast of a machine.

VThe box that it comes in is neatly packed and provides all the neccesary parts and papers. The headphone had excellent sound from the bass all the way through to the treble. My initial thought was the treble was very crisp. The bass wasnt as punchy as i would have hoped but these are studio headphone and not DJ headphones, so if youre after a very deep bass with alot of punch these may not be for you. After trying a freinds pair of beats solo back to back with these, these just blew them out of the water for half the price. Overall a fantastic pair of cans, and with an extra leather bag and 3 cables, you can't beat it for the price.

VThe M50x is not a bad headphone is just not what I expected, the sound is clear but is doesn't have enough bass, is good for songs like polka, instrumental music etc. but for songs like RB Hip-hop or Reggaton it would not deliver what you expect in those songs because of the bass, I'm not a bass enthusiastic is just I expect to hear a song a is intended to sound and the M50x is not for all genres. That's why are so many headphones out there I guess for each type of genre.

p2744

VAbsolutely fantastic sound at a great price! I returned my Sennheiser HD280 Pro's after doing a side by side comparison. The best way to explain it is that these breathe the sound more and are less choked with perhaps slightly more of a sound stage. The HD280's seem more punchy because of the taper in my opinion. For example, if compared to an EQ, it is as if the lowest and highest frequencies are trimmed a bit for a quick roll-off and the 1.5k to 3k is boosted a bit for a quick snap. When using these for a Roland TD-10 Expanded drum set, the difference in switching to the ATH-M50x was almost like taking baffling/muffling off the drums.Very happy with this purchase!

VFirst off this is my first professional monitor headphones I purchased and I am amazed with how pristine and balance of the sound quality for the price I paid for it. I've used other brands including beats bluetooth wireless which was one of my most expensive headphones and quite honestly the bass was impressive although at times it muddy out the highs. On the other hand audio technica ath-m50x just blow me away. The lows where tight responsive. Mids where warm clear flat sound. And the highs where crystal clear. It's one of those where you have to hear it to belive it. It's now my favorite headphone. Glad I decided to buy these over the other more expensive brands.

Not to mention they feel very comfortable around the ears! I can listen to music for hours and hours. I strongly recommend these headphones!!

Vupgrading from M30 to M50x...
p2792
sg5
VThese are very comfortable over the ear studio headphones.  The product came with 3 different detachable wire lines a coil wire, long straight wire, short strait wire, travel pouch, and a 45mm driver.  I like that in order to attach/detach the wire your need to plug it in and twist it on securely into the headphones.  Make sure you get a portable bass driver with these headphones if you want to use the most out of them.  They don't come with an in line volume so make sure your source you are plugging into has one.  Also if you are a console gamer these do not include a mic.  You will have to go through a few extra steps to add a mic and this will be costly.  They quality of the headphones is really nice and worth the upgrade from my old beat up m30 which happen to still work.  If your not trying to splurge too much on a headset then I heard the at m30x is just as good.  But like I said I love my upgrade from the old m30 to the m50x.

VReally! I compared this to my V-Moda and I'm returning it.
p2810
sg5
VReceived this today and after listening to Vmoda all these years  I could tell the difference.  I compared this Audio-Techinca to my "2012 V-MODA Crossfade LP Over-the-Ear Headphones (Gunmetal Black)" by listening to jazz, reggae, classical music, hiphop, various acoustic songs, and even slack key guitar songs.  Right away I had to bump the volume for Audio-Tecnica (AT) after listening with my Vmoda.  The AT is softer and the bass as less pronounced.  This might be good if your listening to a person just talking.  After listening to Human Nature by Michael Jackson, the AT produced a high pitch sound that's painful.  I did not experienced that with Vmoda.Audio-Technica -  feels cheap,  Mostly plastic, comes with a pouch.  Vmoda is on a different level (higher end compared to this).I'm returning this.  I'm going to replace it with Sennheiser Momentum 2.0. I also own these: "SOUL by Ludacris SL300GG High Definition Noise Canceling Headphones (Gold)",  Bose QuietComfort 25 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphone, bluetooth earbuds, and the apple standard earbuds.

VThe cord will stick ur shoulder :'(
p2822
sg5
VGlad they didn't change the sound. I find these much nicer for mobile use than m50 due to cord design and options. Glad they made the cord end small for phone cases. Sure wish these didn't clamp so much though, and some different ear pads would be welcome, I had to order third party velour ones. Also, the lock end connector is too long causes the cord to stick toward my left shoulder too much, but I think I can get over it. I find the sound on these less harsh and analytical than the Sony mdr v6 for music LISTENING, and more punchy, energetic, and satisfying than the Beyerdynamic dt770. I need closed cans due to my noisy home environment and I find these work great for that. Otherwise I'd get something else for better soundstage and detail. I run these with high quality FLAC files on Android smartphones with the JetAudio app and keep my music library on microSD. I find that having the high bit rate files and good cans make the biggest difference, I don't need an amp or anything to get decent sound, as long as I'm using one of the flagship android phones with decent audio chips. Of course, I get better sound if I plug into my computer's Soundblaster Z card with integrated amp, but it's actually not too much of a difference.UPDATE 12/5/2015: Had to return because the lock cord connector is just too long and sticks into my shoulder all the time, and I have a long neck too.... Hate to return them because otherwise they are close to perfect.

VApparently, I won the lottery with my monoprice dj headphones.  I have been using them for years (they break every 18 months or so) and I really cannot tell a large enough difference between them and the ath-m50x's.  I spent all day a/b testing flac files with them through my retina mbp regular audio jack and on my pc that has a dac  (mac sound is ok to listen at full vol. pc is painfully loud at 75%).  Every sound can be heard just as clearly on both, there were no revelations of hearing drums or cymbals roll off longer.  There was no greater immersive sound.  There was no new noticeable breathes or finger slides on a guitar.  The monoprice cans have a touch higher highs but I really had to listen.I started freaking out in the afternoon that my hearing was broken because thousands of people think the ath-m50x's are incredible. I ran tone tests through both headphones on both systems and heard and didn't hear the exact same things on both.Either the ath-m50x's are just ok, or my monoprice headphones are incredible.  I doubt I got a dud pair as they sound fine, no crackling or hissing, the artwork and molding all look like any pictures I have found.I was expecting a huge jump or some really noticeable quality difference and for my ears these are no better.I am sending them back.

VAll your old music is now new again
p2852
sg5
VAn amazing pair of headphones. My previous set of headphones were about 10 years old (they were theSony MDR-XD300 Stereo Headphones) and they were finally starting to give out. The Sony headset was actually quite nice. One of the few problems I had with it was that inside the earcups, there was not enough space for my ears.The M50x completely fixes this problem. There is ample amount of space for your ear. I've done some 2-3 gaming sessions and it's been completely solid. You'll most likely forget that they are on. As others have mentioned, if you are in a warmer space, since these are completely over the ear, you might have some sweaty ears (this hasn't been the case for me so far).My favorite thing has been listening to songs that I've listened to dozen of times before. The same song will give you a new experience as the headphones bring out the minute details. It sort of ruins other speakers and headphones experience from the standpoint of not hearing the same amount of details.My only complaint is that the headband could use a little more padding. I found that if you get the headphones adjusted for your head, the weight of the headphones distributes nicely across your ears and the top of your head.

VDon't believe the 5 star reviews - I'm a live sound engineer
p2858
sg5
VBuild quality and comfort are great on these headphones. The downside came when I listened to them. There is a HUGE peak in the frequency response at 10khz. It's very obvious to me, and it is not a good thing. This, along with some other obvious frequency response problems caused me to do a bit of research. Response issues can largely be fixed by digital equalization.  I came across a graph of the freq response by sonarworks, and the graph showed exactly what I was hearing. Ive attached a picture. I was able to use their graph, along with Au Lab and sound flower for mac to create a systemwide EQ that flattens the response out. Sonar works also sells a flattened EQ that I would suggest using if you plan to do any audio mixing with these. Here is their review :http://sonarworks.com/2015/05/audio-technica_m50x_headphone_review/Once balanced out, the headphones sound pretty amazing. The low frequency extension is impressive. The downside is that I wouldn't dare use these with my iPhone or any other device that didn't have an EQ. The frequency response is just too offensive to my ears.

VThey fit well to your head and the ear-pads are really comfy; however, the lock mechanism they added to the detachable cords is lengthy and somewhat annoying.  Sound wise they were good; I wasn't blown away like other reviewers.  Thinking of returning them, but maybe I'll warm up to them.

VGreat non-bleed heaphones
p2882
sg5
VBeen using these at work for awhile and I have to say they are pretty awesome for closed back headphones. The sound does not bleed out (which is good for a quiet environment), the build quality is very good, and the general ascetics are very appealing in my opinion. While I think that people who use headphones as a fashion statement (wearing around your neck) are completely stupid, I would not mind having these around my neck in public. The sound quality is pretty good although I would say that there is a little too much bass in my opinion. I prefer my Philips SHP9500 headphones that I use at home over these Audio-Technica ones for purely sound reasons only but the Philips are open back meaning the sound will bleed out quite a lot. So for the circumstances I need them for the Audio-Technica headphones fit the bill. The price reflects the build, design, and sound quality quite well.

VShort version -> Awesome HeadphonesI had the original M50 headphones for years and still love them. Got this updated set because it was on lightening deal and comes with the 3 detachable cords. This is a great headset for any audiophile. You hear music as it should be and not over bassed or digitized sound like some popular brands.These are not noise canceling, so if you looking for something to cancel out all sounds, these aren't for you. Since these are over ear, they do a good job of blocking outside noise while playing though.They fit very comfortably and stand up to time. I've had the old set for many years now and no real wear / tear to speak off. The headband still looks new, minus a few wrinkles from stretching to head. Ear pieces still look and feel brand new.This is the headset I recommend to anyone....esp if you find a sale on them!

When you listen to high quality music like FLAC's or Apple Lossless they sound absolutely incredible.  I have some high fidelity downloads as well that sound incredible.  I highly recommend these headphones.  Some of the best I ever experienced.Comfort: 9/10Sound: 10/10Looks: 10/10

p2983

VAmazing over-ear headphones! These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever tried and also they have great sound all throughout the different ranges.Deep and clear bass that does not distort at higher volumes. Also since they are over-ear they have very minimal sound leakage and while they are not noise-cancelling they still do a good job of keeping out ambient noise.Would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a pair of over-ears for under 200 bucks.

VGood for casual listening, takes some getting used to
p3025
sg5
VVERY IMPORTANT: These headphones take some getting used to. Every person I've had try them thinks they sound weird at first. This is because of the extremely broad stereo image. Things to the left side sound much further left, things to the right sound much further right. One person described it as the difference between sounding like you're standing in front of the stage listening to the musicians, and standing ON stage in between the musicians. I've used a variety of over-the-ear headphones and have never heard this feature quite so accentuated before.At first this was very distracting, because things don't sound like you're used to. It's much easier to hear the individual parts because there's so much space between them. Spare and empty tracks sound emptier, while very dense tracks are much easier to parse out and make sense of.  After taking time to get adjusted, now I think they're amazing. I can enjoy the music on a casual level, but when I turn my brain on I can listen very deeply into the mix and hear every last detail. The sound isolation is also very good, so you can take these on a bus or train and not annoy your neighbor or worry about them annoying you.  The build quality is superb, and they're very comfortable, although I was slightly disappointed in the head strap. It feels harder and less comfortable on my head than other headphones in this price range. I wish they had gone with a softer, more flexible material rather than make it very rigid with a shallow cushion. Despite this I can listen for hours at a time with no problem.HOWEVER, if you're a studio musician who mixes on headphones like I do, then I personally do not recommend these as your main source for monitoring. The bass and the treble both sound artificially accentuated. Again, this is great for clarity and hearing detail, but I don't believe it's very accurate after comparing it to other monitoring headphones I've used. The sound is not what I would call "natural". Also, again because these headphones are so unique in their stereo image, any track you mix on these is going to sound different coming from almost any other source.This review is based on my own subjective experience, and others may have different opinions. One thing is for sure, if you're looking for the best pair of casual listening headphones you can get (and who would take headphones that cost more than these outside the house?), that are extremely clear and flattering to almost any genre of music you could name, then please get these.

I was looking for great headphones for soloing channels and checking monitors. These headphones are what I was looking for and they look great! I love these headphones more than the older version because the cord is detachable, so you don't always have a 10ft cord. These headphones are also great for daily use, like mowing the lawn. They really block out the background sound.

VTop quality phones. Quite attractive and very comfortable. I can wear these 10 hrs and feel no ear fatigue or pain. Most headphones will hurt my outer ears after 2-4 hours, not these. I fell asleep wearing them one time after 6hrs use, woke up and forgot they were on and resumed my work for another 6. I had them on a good 16 hrs.Very good sound. Clean and accurate. Bad source is bad sounding. No mercy for bad input and cool with it. MP3s sound good on these or as good as they can with only %25 of the original file content in an mp3. Hi rez formats will blow you away with the detail. Classical, rock, hip hop and even youtube all work well with these headphones. No artificial coloring. I dont need it, I have controls for that on my big Yamaha.They shine brightly with my KT-88 tube amp (0-100k freq response) and my  ATH-M50xBL is up to the challenge. You will happy with these.Nice extra cables. They are proprietary. The connection at the headphones is unique. Comes with three cables and they are good quality so no issues forseen there. The ability to disconnect at the phones is nice too.Top quality Audio Technica. Can't go wrong.

VSo I've never had a pair of over ear headphones before, I've tried on some mid range Bose noise cancelling headphones and thought they sounded OK, but I didn't like how the noise cancelling sucked up major battery.  I watched some youtube videos about the best headphones and stumbled upon the audiotechinica  ath m50 and m50x's, mostly from mkbhd on YouTube.  I was super impressed with their design and what looked to be great build quality.  I heard that they had great overall sound and that's exactly what I was looking for.Now the problem.was, as a poor college student, to buy the cheaper m50s or get the m50x.  It took so long going back and forth about whether the twenty bucks more was worth it.  I finally went for the m50x and am so glad I did.  The removable cables are awesome and in three different lengths you can use the small one when you are walking around with your phone, the medium one when you are on your computer and the loooong one for when you want to dance in your room freely.now for some review-ish parts:SOUND:FANTASTIC for the money. Rich bass, clear treble. Vocals sound amazing with a bass background and overall extremely pleasing to the ear. IF YOU WANT MORE BASS, just change your EQ settings on your phone or computer if you want the BEATS experience(all bass and little of anything else)COMFORT:These things weigh a bit but if you are not bending over to pick up all the money you saved from these off the floor too often, you'll be fine.  These things won't stay on your head if you hang upside down, I'll put it that way. Other than that, these things are like pilllows on your ears, oh so comfy.OVERALL:A phenomenal headphone not only for the money but as an intro headphone to anyone who loves music and wants to hear every note without breaking the bank

After long use of Sony Monitor headphones, Bose (can't recall the model, cost about $99 several years ago... recently damaged in flight leading to this purchase) I find this set to be extraordinary. I read the criticism that there is not mic or volume control... I think that stuff is gimmicky when considering the purpose is to listen to music. I love the white... it matches my several M-Audio Axiom Pro's. The coil plugs will be great with live performance use as a keyboard player.

These headphones really deliver in bass, detail and overall sound. I'm definitely going to enjoy them.

VGreat sound, with a head hurting deal breaker :(
p3114
sg5
Vinitially I was very impressed with these.  materials are ok. build quality seems good.  Sound is solid.  But when wearing these for extended periods of time (for me this is during workday use) these things will HURT the top of your head.  They have a really odd design with the headband.  It appears thick and padded but 80% of the pad is on the OUTSIDE of the band.  The padding on the inside is super thin and since it's super soft there is very little protection to keep the very hard internal piece from pressing on your head.  Also the material is sewn in such a way that the seams for thin ridges on the front and back of the inside of the band as well.  I don't get it.  Why put so much effort into everything except where most of the weight distribution lands?  Why the crap is there more padding on top then underneath the band?  I suppose if you had a head that was super wide so that it pinched your head firmly enough to take the weight off the top of your head you'd be ok.  ...assuming it didn't then hurt your ears.  Anyhow I otherwise love these headphones but If I can't wear them for more than 30min before my head hurts, that's a total deal breaker :(

p3120
sg5
VA quality upgrade from low-quality headphones the general populace is so accustomed to. I'm not sure it deserves a perfect score, but it certainly deserves consideration when purchasing an entry-level closed headphone.The  headphone is low-key, well designed, and comes with a nice set of interchangeable/detachable cables for convenience and tidiness.The sound-stage is pretty poor, but that's to be expected from a closed headphone. The bass response is generous, but anything above mid-range is weak and lacks detail.Comfort is decent although swapping out for velour earpads can help if you do not like the pleather earpads it comes with.

VI had purchased some Sennheiser HD 598's, I've always been a big fan of Sennheiser......although in this case I was very disappointed in the sonic quality. Distortion was pretty evident at modest listening levels which was bad enough but there was no real bass or warmth to the sound.  So I sent them back for the AT ATH-M50x's.  Love the sound, no issues there at any level of listening.  One irritation.....I do not possess big ears but the ear cups are very snug and occasionally rub my ears.....and they create a fair amount of warmth when wearing them for any period of time longer than 10 minutes or so.  If they could improve that issue they would have a real winner all around.

p3155
sg5
VI initially purchased this and then had the dreaded "buyers remorse" for not buying the V Moda LP2, which had awesome reviews.  So I ordered the LP2.  Well the LP2 is about 5X more sexy-awesome cord, awesome packaging, seems more robust, but the sound is muddy compared to the ATH-M50X, and although I realize others disagree, to me the bass is actually not better-and if you are buying a headphone it is not about the packaging, it is about the sound quality.  I am critical, have probably $ 10-15K in stereo gear-Perreaux amps, pre-amps-lots of vinyl, etc. so maybe I do not represent the typical buyer.  The AudioTechnicas are accurate, at least for an inexpensive headphone, and I would highly recommend them.  Period-end of discussion.

p3161

VA great set of headphones. Sound is well balanced and provides great quality for listening to music. A couple improvements that could be made are; 1. Find a way to shorten the stiff portion of cable that comes from the bottom of the phones. Its so long that it has a tendency to jab my neck/shoulder area if I tilt my head at all to the left. Also, the clamping force on the side of my head is high making these slightly uncomfortable to wear after an extended period of time. I guess that is a good thing though!

I spent $430 on some beats pro a few weeks ago and I returned them because I was thinking I would go deaf sooner than later. The bass was overwhelming, it was just too much! I saw the many reviews these had and I decided to make the purchase. So far these are great.-great subtle bass-great form and fit-light-they look and feel really well built-the color pops!

When doing other things at my desk, I often forget to take them off when the music had ended.

VDon't get me wrong, these are a great pair of headphones. However, if you're looking for something bass heavy that adds that "umph" to your listening experience, you should probably look elsewhere. The sound from these are flat, which is what most look for in sound monitoring headphones. Sound isolation is good, but at the cost of the rather tight clasp these headphones have. Overall, I'm pleased. If you're looking for something that will blow your mind away with a dominating bass, look elsewhere. If you want something that will give you the most accurate sound for the money, you can't do much better than these.

Since then, you have to get the connection just right (wiggle it, push hard into the port, etc) in order for the left earphone to work.  I understand that it's my fault that they fell off my head, but I figured that they would be just a little more durable than that for the price.

VHeadphone sound is a very personal thing.  How do you tell whether the AT's are the best for the price?  Youtube!  Lots of videos on independent tests and a user blind test.  Electronics articles.  AT's are rated among the top choices by almost all audio writers and professionals.  So, I took the plunge, looking to upgrade from MMElectronics open headphones to a closed system to block out extraneous noise.  Frankly, the MME's have very good sound for a reasonable price ($40) and I will continue to use them when outdoors or using an iPhone. But the AT's are an order of magnitude above these entry level phones.The M50x sound quality is superb.  Clear sound over all frequencies.  Perhaps a bit bright in the HF's, but most of us like brightness.  The bass is full but not booming.  These aren't Beat Studios with their bass attenuation.Overall, I don't think you could ask for a set of headphones in this range that will do any better.  They reproduce what is recorded very accurately.My favorite test is Faltemeyer's "Axel F".  About 50 seconds in, there are small clicks that have a tendency to  get lost with less responsive headphones.  The AT's provided clear definition.

VBeats Wish They Sounded This Good
p3307
sg5
VI came to this headphone after having used and loved a pair of Shure SRH-440 for the last few years.  Those headphones impressed me with their flat-tuned response, nice sound stage, comfort and durability.  After my 440s were stolen from my desk where I work (word of advice: don't leave your headphones out over a weekend for the cleaning crew to steal), I decided to step up and go with the ATH-M50x.  I've only had them for 1 day, but they are outstanding right out of the box.  They have a more curved eq response overall than the SRH-440s with more defined bass, but certainly not to an obscene degree and not at the expense of any higher frequencies.  The sound stage is rich and wide - much moreso than the SRH-440.  They are reasonably light and fit comfortably over the ears with very good outside ambient noise isolation.  They are a little tight at first, but I know from prior experience that they will loosen up over time a little.Having previously spent over 10 years working in the consumer electronics industry, I can confirm that these are among the best and definitely a nicer-sounding set of over-the-ears than Beats.  These outperform Beats and most other headphones in a similar price range on pretty much every level and, at least to my adult eyes, look classier too.  Easily the best pair of over-the-ear headphones I have ever owned!

VAbsolutly hated them at first. Burn in +EQ!
p3360
sg5
VWhen I got my m50x's I had high hopes cause of all the posative reviews and youtube reviews. I took them out of the box and listened to them and after an hour I was going to return them, cursing all the posative reviews.....I had a pair of m40x's for about a week and loved the balanced clean audio but wanted to upgrade cause of the 45mm driver size vs the 40mm to get more detail and richness that 40mm drives just didn't have. I was upset why the m50x sounded terrible, but then I did some research and discovered "burn in time" the audio technica Web site says they are good out of the box, other reviews says you do need to burn them in so the sound opens up....I decided what the heck, let's give that a try. Over 2 weeks I let them play music while I was away and listened to them as much as I could and after 2 weeks the sound has absolutely transformed and opend up.....the muddy tone that was drowning the music from my s5 had got cleaner...but...It got alot better but they still had too much bass that over powers the clarity and detail, yes it is true, but I found that if I download an EQ I can further transform the sound to be more balanced and flatter. I sat side by side with an 40x and the m50x and listened to the same song over and over for about an hour or 2.I got the m50x to match the balance of the m40x by adjusting and reducing the lower frequencies of 60hz to 230hz..also dropping a little off of the higher frequencies 3hz to 14hz just a tad according to the picture of the frequency spectrum of the m50x via Google images. That flattens out the sound alot and the 45mm driver size brings out clarity and detail better than the m40x, so basicly I transformed the m50x into a much better m40x and to me a much better version of the m50x. Now I love them and I have the versatility of adding bass back if I want to.Alot of the negative reviews are people like me just plugging them In and going off of the sound that is already their, with some burn in time and a simple eq download I can quickly and easily make these headphones sound alot more balanced if I want to and get rid of the muddy bass and bring out the clarity alot more. Their very good headphones now! My next step is a DAC to make them even better. Sometimes in life you have to make things work and work at them, you can't expect them to just be perfect right away and give up. Hope this helps anyone reading this.

VGreat pair of headphones when you plug them into a good amp. If ur planning to use these with your phone or some other low fi audio source it's gonna sound pretty plain.In a good amp they sound really good, very warm. The mid bass is ok it could be tighter and punchier but that's asking alot of headphones.The speakers are only so large.I do like the isolation these provide put them on and the room db drops tremendously I instantly feel relaxed when  I put them on

He likes how the ear piece cushions around his ear and said they are very comfortable.  He says that the sound is very good.  He also liked the color choices.

VTested these out and they put out some nice sounds.  I own two pairs of Creative Fata1ty Professional MK-II gaming headsets which I've been soldering for the past few years (due to cord breaks--long cords), and I really enjoy those gaming headsets.  The one thing I enjoyed about the gaming headsets was the amount of bass.  Even without a bass boost, they sounded like they were boosted, though the highs weren't as clear.  The Audio-Technica M50x is more even on the clarity of both highs and lows.  It doesn't over drive the lows and the highs are clear and crisp.  If you enjoy a little more bass than these will normally put out, boost your bass level on the device you're connected into.I tested the bass on these with a bass sound file and it was nice and smooth.I can hear things even with these covering my ears all the way, but they're not noise cancelling, so I don't expect these to mute everything around me.

VMy search for the "perfect" headphones is over..
p3443
sg5
VMy initial pair of headphones span back many years to those that were made by RadioShack in the 70s. I would like to consider myself an audiophile. Ok on to the review. Before I purchased these headphones, I read tons of reviews about others in its same category. I ended up purchasing the Grado 125e. Please understand, that every individual has their own requirements for what they want to hear through headphones. While I don't like a lot of bass, I do want to know that the base is there. The Grado 125e headphones are really good headphones, if you want opened type headphones. To me, and this is just my humble opinion, the stage presence for me, was no better than other comparable headphones.Now on to these headphones. These headphones have a wonderful stage presence, a very punchy bass without being Dr. Dre driven, and they have very clear highs. Yes, these do have a closed end design, which filters out incoming noise, and also prevents leakage. The bottom line, is if you want headphones that have the above prerequisites, punchy base, crystal clear mids and highs, and you want a very personal stage type of listening experience, I would highly recommend that you purchase these headphones. Once again, nothing against Grado's. But, for what I want, these headphones more than fit the bill.

VI have been using  Audio-Technica  M50 headphones for almost two years now and it is the best headset I have ever owned. Noise cancelling and capable of delivering impressive sound quality for music and movies. They can be worn for hours comfortably.  When my wife tried mine on during a recent vacation flight she was sold on how it blocked out unwanted noises. At her request I bought her this upgraded version of the M-50. She is very pleased and reports that they provide excellent noise cancellation and is giving her a much needed break from unwanted distractions at work. WINNER!

VLet me preface this review with my previous sets of headphones so you can get an understanding of my level of audio appreciation.I currently own and have tested:Marsboy Bone Conductors, V-Moda M-100s and LP Crossfade 2's, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, M-Audio Studiophile Q40's, Skullcandy Hesh, Crushers, and Ink'd, Astro A40s.Now lets break this down into categories.1. Accessories and packaging.It does feel pretty cool to open these bad boys up.  there's a front panel containing a soft carrier, and some warranty info/addn'l paperwork.  But when past that we get to the meat of value with the headset itself surrounding 3, again...3 different types of DETACHABLE cords.  It's not quite Dr. Jones finding the lost ark, but it feels pretty good.2. Build quality.Expected, for this price range.  It feels good, not too heavy.  Feels like some strong plastic was used to mold these into existence, and the detachable cord is for me an absolute necessity when considering durability of any quality headset.  They're comfortable and I wear glasses as well, not excessively tight but not loose either, and the bands snap into the settings nicely.3. SoundAbsolutely exceptional for the price.  I've paid $300+ for headphones and the are in the competitive range of those as well,as far as sound is concerned.  They've got the bass you want without sacrificing the mids and highs you need.  If I had to rate them with all the previous sets mentioned above I would say that they are probably 2-3 best with Beyerdynamic taking the kings chair, but those are also $50-70 more depending on what price you get them for.4. NuancesFlexibility:  The cups themselves can rotate up to 180degrees and also can collapse into the band making for a very movable jointed unit.  Allows for a free flowing but fixed type of feel.Detachable cord:  The mac daddy of durability.  If your cord breaks, your set is NOT forfeit!  I can't tell you how important this is unless you've experienced the pain of a "deadset" due to a cord failing.  HOWEVER.  This is also the place where the M50x almost loses a star.  Because, yes the cord is detachable, but it also features a distinct locking system allowing only the M50x cords to be used (unless there is an adapter out there that i am unaware of.).  Sucks right?  No off brand cords for us.  So why not kick it down a star?  Because they give you 3 cords.  I don't think it's unreasonable of consumers to buy a cord from the company after we wreck like 3 of them.Recommendations:Buy a better case for these than what they give you.  Protect your investment.It's probably time to buy a portable amplifier (FiiO) if you're at this level and above for headsets.Know what you're buying.  There is a newer model of the MSeries out there, so these are the cutting edge of Audio Technica, but for the dollar to value line, these are probably the best buy.

VGreat Headphones, Awesome sound!
p3467
sg5
VThese are great headphones for audio mixing or video editing. I also really enjoy listening to music with them as well. They have a very clean crisp sound to them. Really good highs and mids.I wouldn't recommend them if you are really into music with big bass, these have more of a punchy bass.Ergonomically these are the best headphones I could find. I was using the Sony MDR-7506 for a long time, but I would always get annoyed with how the coiled cable would tangle up and the exposed wire by the earpiece swivel would always get stuck or damaged. With these you can choose your cable and length. If it gets twisted up you can unplug from the ear piece and quickly untangle it and plug it back in. Also there are no wires by the earpiece swivel so you don't have to worry about the wire getting stuck. Also the pads over the earpiece last a lot longer than most headphone.

VI must admit that I was not blown away by the comfort of these headphones. They have larger ear cups, but my old $20 Monoprice set fits better for long periods of use.That is all I have to say negative here. The overall sound quality absolutely dwarfs the Monoprice unit. As you'd expect for the price difference. Be sure to get the most out of these headphones with a proper DAC and AMP. If your output device produces a hissing sound (like my laptop does) these headphones will only make that hissing sound come through crisp and clear. Use the DAC to clean up the audio, then you can begin to enjoy the experience.While many do not believe in a break-in for headphones, I found a couple days break-in to do wonders (A mix of my normal music and pink/brown noise.) Only after that did I go in and adjust all my EQ values. Worth the wait.I also played with the overall EQ in my DAC, maxing out each frequency to see how the headphones respond. Impressive on all levels. Bass is killer on these headphones - you'll never experience this bass when the EQ is flat, but with just a tiny bit of EQ bump in the DAC I was able to turn off any other system bass boosts. I try to keep it tame, not too much thumping tunes these days, but when I need a quick fix, these headphones deliver.Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. If you are also in the market for great sound (in a closed sound-stage for privacy and courtesy to your neighbor) and you have a little more than just a few dollars to spend, I doubt you'd regret this purchase. Just remember, good headphones/speakers like these will not mask a bad audio source, if you do not have a clean and quality audio track, you'll know it.I am ok with 320kbps MP3 format with these headphones, but 256kbps and lower have noticeable degradation. Time to re-rip my music in a lossless format. 7 year project, here I come.

VHad these headphones for quite some time. They do exactly what they say provide music in a flat clear eq range if your looking for a lot of bass don't get these. However if you like a medium mixture of bass and other frequencies try these out. One other thing I love is how easy the 3 chords it comes with can be detached and reattached it really adds flexibility.

VLove the sound, beautiful headphone, and I'm glad I purchased the limited edition. My only problem is that the headphone is a bit tight and heavy on my head and the earpad is not as soft as I want it to be. Otherwise, everything is great.To be honest, I don't care much about the low bass for this headphone simply because I mostly listen to soft music. This thing is not noise cancelling for sure. I did replaced my bose qc25 to get this. What I want is nice music for my tight budget, and the ATH-M50x fulfilled all of that.

VI'm a working musician, producer and designer. I've used a lot of the headphones that are out there (sennheiser, sony, AKG, bose, etc.) and I had favorites for each occasion. I found myself more partial to one pair if I was cutting a vocal but then I'd use a different pair if I needed to mix with headphones. These are hands down my favorite pair I've used. I use them for everything, even on an airplane. Just like studio monitors, finding the right headphones really comes down to trying a few different things and going with your preference. Also worth noting, the 3 cables choices were such an excellent touch...

VI listen to music all day at work. I have a 2 hour period every day where I can have both ears occupied with headphones. I've been using Skullcandy Titan's for the last couple years. I've always wanted a good pair of over the ear headphones so I can completely zone out my surroundings and get lost in the music.I did a lot of research and kept on finding myself back to these. I did want the 50x over the 50's for the detachable cord.When I first put the on and listened to the music through them I felt they sounded great, but didn't feel like the quality was overwhelmingly better than my silly little earbuds (boy was I ever wrong). I got to work the next day and first thing I did was throw these bad boys on and listened to music for 2 hrs (it was amazing). For the rest of my work day I take calls out of one ear and listen to music out of the other ear. I stuck my earbuds in and listened just for a comparison. My earbuds sound like garbage.. Seriously.. listening to them back to back, the difference is night and day. The quality these things posses is MILES ahead of my silly little earbuds. They are super comfortable for 2 hr+ listening sessions as well. And when everything is said an done, they fold up painlessly and fit in their little bag great!While I do like that they came with a carrying case, I will most likely get a hardcase to transport these in eventually. The case is good for what it is, but the headphones take up a lot of space and it wouldn't protect them in the slightest if they were to take a tumble in the case.I love them though. Very impressed!

VI'm the type of person that always stuck to buying to cheap headphones. As long as they're comfortable and sounded decent, I had no issues going cheap.But, being someone who has headphones on for the majority of the day (partially for work, partially for leisure), I thought it was about time I tried a high-end pair of headphones. After reading the reviews (and seeing the cool color choices), I decided on the Audio-Technica ATH-M50 and I'm so glad I did.Going from a $20 pair to this is truly night and day. I honestly cannot believe the gap in quality coming from the cheap-Os to a professional pair. The sound quality is absolutely breathtaking. I can hear things in my favorite songs that I never even knew existed.These headphones are insanely tight when brand new, but as you wear them they become "broken in" and feel a lot better with time. Even though they technically aren't noise cancelling, the seal that the ear cups make around your ears are so snug that it does actually block out a bit of noise around you. Speaking of the he ear cups, they and headband are very, very comfortable. I wear these for hours every day and I really am impressed.The Audio-Technica ATH-M50 are the best headphones you can buy for under $200.

VThe best headphones I have ever owned. Its so good you can hear they filmed commercials in a small recording booth..thats how good it is, you can hear the difference in quality from youtube vs mp3 vs pandora and spotifyBought this back in December 28, 2014  and waited all this time to write a review, pretty good headphones downsides listed below.pros: good quality sound and headphones, rather light and foldablecons:The quality cord they give you is so high that you have a hard time finding a replacement if it were to break, I game with this headset and needed to plug in my mic to it, the cable my mic uses is of a lesser quality than that of audio-technica's so I lose quality sound as a result :( if you use the cord it comes with you will have no problem with quality sound.The headphones are VERY uncomfortable to wear for more than 2 hours at a time, i modified my headphones using one of the many comfort mods on the internet, basically a little home made pillow between my head and the headphones. it is now comfortable to wear for 14+ hours a day, still messes up my hair. if you dont want to mod it i suggest getting Sennheiser's HD598 or one of their other comfortable brands, same good quality I hear.. (I HAVE NOT TRIED THE Sennheiser BRAND HEADPHONES) i just know they are comparable with these headphones and are more comfortablecord is made specifically for this headphones AND REPLACEMENT ONES ARE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND  they do give you 3 cords when you buy it but if your like me who needs to plug a mic into the headphones then it can be dificult...theres a mod I did to it now it accepts all 2.55mm jacks just used adapters and DRILLED into my headset... it looks good still and now it works with all 3.55 cords  (Sennheiser headphones also use special cords that only work with their headsets )cord is a locking type cord and as stated above ...very dificult to find...if you ever trip over your headphone cord or get it stuck in door handles or trapped under wheels... you should consider getting another headset OR use the mod i did,, if you get it stuck it will pull the headphones off your head instead of unpluging because the cord LOCKS INTO THE HEADPHONES.Quality is so good that I find myself looking for better quality music sources. this is a con because its now annoying to listen to low quality music now that I know what good quality sounds like.

After build products such as seinhaise game 0 , hyper cloud2 and still series I was staidly disappointed , not only by in game sound quality but comfort wasn't there at all ... Took me long while and finally received a pair of m50x , didn't take me long to realize that the sound is so perfect for cs go , soft and clear but the comfort of it makes me even better player then I already am. For all of you you fps games out there stop researching and go with m50x

VI really wanted to love these headphones after reading about them on many different audiophile and gadget websites which sang their praises. First of all, I will say I love the look of them and the construction and parts feel really sturdy and well made. And as has been widely reported they sound incredible. The main problem is that I find them very uncomfortable to wear. They just never seem to sit on my head properly. And if I ever need to let them down and put them around my neck there is just absolutely no good way to do that as they fold up in a weird way that prevents them from resting comfortably. They also get really hot which I realize is a side effect of the quality sound insulation but it just adds to the discomfort I get from them. As a result, I rarely end up actually using these.

VAs a self-identified audiophile, I care a lot about the quality of my headphones. As someone who has to always wear classes, I care a lot about the comfort of my headphones. This pair is the absolute best of both worlds. The quality of sound is top notch. I've rarely had a complain on the sound quality of a song, but when I did it was the quality of my audio file, not the quality of the headphones that was sub par. These headphones have a sound quality far beyond their price tag and I will recommend them to anyone who wants to hear their favorite music, without breaking the bank.

VThese Headphones are crazy awsome. I've worn them all day without Irritation etc. They are extremely comfortable. When you have them on the music is very clear. If you're looking for a headset for music with alot of base you might want to get something else as in V-modas, but if you are normal like me and listen to music with lyrics these headphones will make you jizz your pants from excitement. They seem to be very loud when you have them on, but once you take them off to see if other people can hear your music you'll notice you cant hear a thing. When i had bought this product it was on sale for $130 i was kinda regretting it expecting terrible headphones, but once I received them I was amazed by how great they were. If you want over-ear Beats by Dre suck up your ego and go with these. They are ALOT cheaper and have way better music quality. Another great thing with these is that I can use them as a speaker for when i sleep. I would just turn out the thingys and turn the music volume all the way and it will act as a speaker. I'm not sure if it'll damage the headphones (they prob will), but i don't care i love music and i got no speakers so yeah.

VThis product is amazing. The sound quality is great and looks really good and is extremely comfortable and cool looking. However; amazon screwed up with my order. At first they gave me a pair that had been clearly returned already and the short cable didn't work. I sent it back and they sent a new one quickly but it was delivered to my neighbor which I guess is usps fault but they wouldn't let me say I couldn't find the package for 2 days. Thankfully, my neighbor was nice and gave me my package. The new headphones that came were amazing but have a noticeable scratch which is annoying but doesn't really matter. Bottom line, amazing product, bad service.

VThe best set of headphones I have purchased. I have tried a range of headphones going from the apple generic ear pods, skull candy headphones, Bose, beats, and now the Audio-Technica. Has the best sound clarity, nice highs and lows, and decent bass.  Night and day difference from the Beats headphones. (easy comparison, as everyone has heard Beats headphones before). Also works well to remove the outside sound, not noise canceling, but very close.

p3678
sg5
VThese are maybe not the most flat or accurate headphones on the market- there's definitely some added low end but it stays clear, and most importantly they SOUND GOOD.  I bought them primarily for a "second opinion" tool for mixing music - my main monitors are KRK Rokit 5s.  They help highlight some low end issues, so the added energy down there is actually quite helpful for me.  They are comfortable for about an hour then they feel pretty warm, but  it's good practice to give your ears periodic breaks anyway so no complaints there.The all white looks super dope too.

VLOVE THESE!  I've had these headphones now for about a year and they are still going strong.  I primarily use these for music on my phone and watching things on the iPad and have no complaints whatsoever.  The sound is GREAT.  Very crisp.  I also used them at my old job and would have them on for most of the day (about 7-8 hours) and never had any sort of discomfort.Not much sound leakage on these, but it all depends on how loud you listen.  If you have music all the way up, yes, people will be able to hear you a little bit.  I would have the volume up a good amount, and wouldn't have any issues.  Nobody every seems bothered by me at work.While these aren't true noise cancelling headphones, they did quite a great job at getting rid of any outside noise.  I can barely hear anything other than music when I have these on.  That was a big plus for me.  I also loved the detachable cable on the M50x, especially for the fact that if I ever need a replacement, it's very easy to get

p3708

VWhen I first got these I didn't really like the audio quality. I found it a bit harsh in the highs and didn't sound anywhere near as good as my IEMs (granted they are VERY high end IEMs costing considerably more). After a few more listening sessions I/my brain became accustomed to the new sound signature. I no longer disliked it. It actually pretty good.I would not consider these flat, I belive they are a bit v-shaped (boosted highs and lows with recessed mids). I suppose it's not boosted enough to be unusable for some audio mixing. I still find the highs a touch harsh. I think the M50/M50x are a bit over hyped and there are better options at around this price range.The M50x are good for comfort and are small enough to be portable, though I personally prefer IEMs for pertability. The DT770 are MUCH more comfortable. The ear pads are like fig soft pillows for you ears. For long listening sessions the DT 770 is much much better.  The M50x has an edge in compactness and portability. Also the lower impedance makes the M50x easier to drive on with mobile devices. The DT 770 can be driven with a moble device but may got get loud enough for some. An AMP or DAC/AMP is recommended fot the DT 770. As I do not intend to use my full size headphones as a portable system, and have a  portable DAC/AMP if I needed to travel with them, this is not a big deal for me.Removable cables are always a plus and the M50x offers this and come with three cables one one coiled and two straight (one longer, one shorter). The DT 770 dose not have a removable cable. Win for the M50x.I got a pair of used Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro (80 ohms version) and find them superior in every way except they don't fold. Though the DT 770 is also considered a V-shaped headphone I found it to be not as harsh with the highs and the bass very good. The DT 770 is noticeably cleaner sounding to my ears. While the M50x is considered to have a small soundstage the DT 770 is considered to have a big soundstage for closed headphones.Basically sound quality and comfort are wins for the DT 770.Compactness for portability and removable cables are wind for the M50xI'm sending back the M50xs and keeping and enjoying the DT 770 Pro.

VThey sound amazing for almost all purposes. I can hear some maxing out/distortion with certain gun shots in CS:GO however for music and movies and even games save for the one exception mentioned earlier they are amazing.The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is that they are hard for me to wear for long periods of time. I also had to give them a heavy stretch/bend mod (when you temporarily reverse the bend of the band around your head so that they don't press against your ears so much.). Even after the mod perhaps because of it after a while they start to hurt the top of my head.

VFantastic Sounding Headphones!
p3791
sg5
VThese headphones sound amazing. Build quality is superb. I was a little worried about the plastic construction, but they still feel very solid. My other headphones, a pair of v-modas, are all I really have to compare. These headphones sound more natural and less bass heavy than the v-modas. These are also much more comfortable (though my v-modas were on-ear headphones so hard to compare). I think these are my new favorite. If you're looking for a quality headset in this price range, you really can't beat these Audio-Tehchnicas. I also really like the coil cord it comes with. A+ Audio Technica!

VGreat Sound and Build Quality. Comfortable
p3803
sg5
VI have had the old Bose AE2 headphones for a few years and loved them. I replaced the earpieces once and the cords twice due to heavy use, but finally lost them while traveling. I bought this pair on its great reviews both on and off Amazon, and immediately found the sound quality to be a slight improvement on the AE2. Im no audiophile, but I find the sound fuller on the M50X. If there are any cons to these headphones to my others is that they have slightly stiffer and shallower ear cups which I find less comfortable, though not uncomfortable. For anyone who has never used over the ear pieces, they are essentially earmuffs with speakers in them. They will warm your head/ears after extended use. Otherwise the headphones seem very large and a little less stylish/sleek than my old Bose.

VYou will never go back to worse headphones
p3809
sg5
VCame to the ATH-M50x after my long-faithful AKGs finally fell apart. I never knew what I was missing. I went through and listened to nearly my entire library of music over again. There was so much in each song that I had never heard before. I remember sitting in the lobby of one of the dorms on campus and just smiling to myself because it was like experiencing all these songs for the first time. Everyone thought I was weird but what else is new.Bass is perfect. The depth of sound is better than any headphones I've ever heard (though I'm sure you can get better if you're willing to shell out a couple hundred extra bucks). It comes with multiple interchangeable cords so you can use the one that fits your needs the best. For me, this was awesome because I swapped out the default 6-foot cord for the shorter 3-footer. The days of trying to walk outside with wads of tangled cord spilling out of your pockets are over!Best of all, these things are comfortable. I sometimes wear them during gaming and my ears never get cramped or sore. Great headphones!

VThese headphones are super comfortable and the introduction of a detachable cable is a big plus for the M50x over the original M50 model. If your looking for a super flat sound profile and have a good ear you'll notice that these headphones give the base a slight boost. If your used to listening to music through headphones like Apple earbuds, beats, or most other brands though you won't ever notice it. Their not quite audiophile quality for those looking for a hi fidelity sound, but for the average individual, or for casual listening, these are one of the best performing headphones for the dollar (consumer reports 2015) and are super conformable. Not that the green versions do have a green tint to the hard plastic. The photo almost makes the M50xDG model look brown and black.

VIncredible comfort, incredible value, even better sound
p3833
sg5
VI've seen some reviews here about the comfort being an issue. I have had absolutely no issues with comfort whatsoever. The material surrounding the ear is soft and very nice against the skin. It also seals the sound very well. A friend tried them on; when he lifted one side away from his head, the sound would be very apparent; dropped it back flush to his head, the sound was gone.The price is incredible, caught these on the deal of the day for $120. For this sound, I'm astounding that I got these for that price. If you're debating waiting for a better price, I can't imagine Black Friday won't have a better deal than $170.And finally, the sound...oh the sound. I actually located a disc through an audiophile website that basically teaches you what to listen for to tell the difference between high quality equipment and low quality. These headphones passed every single test with sky high flying colors. Compared to my other pair of JBLs, a crap pair of beats, and a pair of IEMs by Shure, these absolutely dominated in every category. The bass is there, but not overpowering. Instead, the bass is appropriate for what the songwriter called for. And if you're questioning its bass potential, try playing the song "Late Night Tip" by Three 6 Mafia and tell me these don't have bass. They do.I'd highly recommend listening to Bohemian Rhapsody on these. Make sure it's the remastered version. You've never heard that song in your life until you hear it with these headphones.Bottom line, these are stellar headphones in every category. The ONLY, and I mean only, issue is the lack of buttons for the iPhone to change songs, for the mic, etc. Other than that, stellar. Don't think. Just buy.

I feel like they could MAYBE fill out the low end just a TINY bit more, but for the most part these things are perfect.I've had everything from Beats Pros, Beyerdynamic DT770's (80 Ohm) and Sony MDR-DJ700's...  for my money these headphones are far better balanced than the Beats Pros and more versatile and look way cooler than my Beyer's.As I mentioned in the title these are the "Swiss-Army Knife of Headphones!".  They handle any kind of music with clarify and depth.

Nice, adjustable fit, comfortable, and a good dynamic range.  The bass response can be a bit overpowering, so I just adjust the bass on my receiver and problem solved.  Great buy for the money, and just a side note here, I think they sound much better than the M70x.

VIncredibly flat and accurate!
p3934
sg5
VFirst off, I am not a studio engineer. I am a hobby musician. I know music well and what sounds good and bad for me. I am not a techno-geek and do not have sound meters around my house detecting frequency loss or bleed. I am sure there is plenty. ;) However, I know what sounds good to my ears and these 50x's rock the planet. I currently have several Bose headphones, including the QC-15's which are the best of that lot that I own. I also have a pair of HD595 Sennheiser cans and will be using those as a comparison, however fair or unfair that can be.My first 30 minutes with the M50's was a real eye (ear) opener. I feel like the balls of cotton have been removed from my ears! The clarity and accuracy of these amazing headphones has to be experienced to be believed. These are simply the best headphones I have ever owned, and I never buy cheapies.The M50's are deliciously flat. I love flat! I am also a semi-professional photographer and shoot my subjects flat and enhance later. And that's the way I feel about sound systems and headphones. A system that can re-produce accurately and flat will win me over all day long. I find it interesting that the majority of the talk of headphones is the bass. So much music, headphones and sound systems are so artificially over-droned with bass it makes me sad. The M50's produce accurate, perfect bass. If you want thumpers, add a sub-amp, equalizer or get some other brand.These blow away the Bose and Sennheiser's I mentioned above. I do agree that the fit on the M50's is a little tight and I have an average 7 1/4 hat size. But, they will break in and relax over time so I am not concerned there. That being said, the Bose are much more comfortable, but they now become my travel cans and the M50's are for home use and when I really want to hear my music. The Sennheiser's fit is horrible. Sound quality is about the same level as the Bose.What prompted this purchase was special Amazon pricing on the M40's. After researching over several hours I decided upon the 50's. I placed them in the shopping cart and then searched some more. At one point I removed them from the cart and decided I was okay with what I had.And then added the M50x's back into the cart and clicked them home. I will never ever regret this purchase. I just regret not discovering the quality of Audio-Technica before now.

p4018
sg5
VI finally got my hands on the M50's but i was severely disappointed by the quality put out by Audio Technica. First and foremost, the sound quality was nothing like the reviews stated. As a sound enthusiast, the quality was diminishing as it served to be just average in regards to the high and low notes. Although mid-rang was decent, the sound quality overall was underwhelming. Second, when i opened this in the mail, the cushioning on the headset was falling apart, i dont know if this was just mine but it still proved to be a pain trying to stick it back together. I am thoroughly disappointed in packaging and care that Audio-Technica gave when sending my headset out. Finally, this headset gives a lot of leakage in sound, when out in public these headphones are of no use, because it is as if you are playing sound from portable speakers. Overall, i would recommend not purchasing these headphones. Save your money, and go buy from another brand.

I also had ear fatigue after several hours of use. You mileage may vary - but they did not work out for me.They did sound very good however - but I could not get over the lack of comfort.

VI love the sound, really crisp.  This is the first set of headphones I ever had where my ears get to warm however.I originally purchased for commuting, as people told me these work as good as noise cancelling (they don't for cancelling out other sounds.)  I wear them at work a lot, but I am limited in how long I can wear them due to the ear heat thing.  Definitely the best sounding headphones I have owned.

VBest headphones I ever used. They beat my Grados in clarity and they do not need any amplifier. The sound insulation is much better if this is important to you but sometimes I appreciate the open design of my Grados too. It depends if you want to hear what is going on around you. They also are a little more heavy but it does not bother me at all. It is a winner and it is very convenient how you can connect each cable to the set. Very thoughtful.

VI'm breathless, as of right now I'm on my 2nd song playing from my phone.This was a impulse buy, and I did one day shipping. Those 24 hours, I was just filled with guilt spending so much for headphones, but holy moly, these are worth the price. I usually played music through my 6 speaker layout, with subwoofer, and I bought these to replace, so that no one hears my music. These are by far the best impulse buy, the noise isolation is amazing, although they don't have active isolation, it's wonderful.The base is crisp, and sounds natural. The comfort, my heads huge, but these  are perfect for my head, the ear muffs, are perfect around my ear, I can already imagine wearing them for many hours at a time.I would highly recommend buying these if you're interested in headphones, it's worth every penny.10/10

VAbsolutely Amazing!
p4209
sg5
VThe build quality of these headphones is excellent.  The padding on the ear-cups is amazing and I had a friend who owns the M40x's try these out and he said these are far superior.  The sound quality absolutely tears apart Beats Solo etc. I checked reviews on probably 8-10 different sets of cans ~$200.  These seemed to be the overall favorite and I am sure glad I bought them.  Audio-Technica designs some amazing stuff, and this is no exception.  Would recommend to anyone who enjoys perfectly crisp sound, Music/Movies/Gaming with perfectly balanced lows and highs.  Some say the mids are a tad low, I don't seem to notice it very much.  I couldn't have asked for better.  I've been watching Game Of Thrones and decided to try plugging these into my Sony STR-DH750 home theater receiver and I was blown away with how amazing the sound quality is.  I can hear more detail and the volume is so much more balanced than when I listen using the same receiver with my Polk Audio 7.1 speakers. They also came with 3 different size cables and a carrying bag.  Give em a shot, Cannot go wrong.Pros:Audio QualityComfortAccessoriesCons:None I can think of

VFantastic. The whole package
p4250
sg5
VI've been using these headphones for a few days and let me tell you, they are fantastic. I am not an 'expert' on headphones, but I can say that the sound quality blows away any other headphones I've had. Whilst these are billed as studio headphones and are very detailed in mids highs and lows, they have a somewhat warm sound which makes them very enjoyable for simply listening to music. I was concerned that these were going to be geared more towards studio work than casual listening, but these will do both quite well. There is plenty of bass, dubstep and electronic music sounds great. The dark green edition looks fantastic. The green parts appear dark grey unless in direct sunlight, then they appear an olive color. They are also very comfortable. The band fits a bit snug, just enough so that they won't fall off or slide when bending over, but not so much as to cause discomfort. The extra cables are also very nice to have. Keep in mind that these are closed-back headphones.Overall I think that these are quite possibly the best all-around studio headphones for under $200. You would be remiss to not give these ample consideration if you are looking for a pair of great sounding headphones at this price point.

VJust adding my praise here
p4280
sg5
VMany of the other five-star reviewers do an excellent job of going into the more technical aspects of these headphones, so I'll just briefly add my voice to the cacophony of praise for these cans:-Audio quality is absolutely superb.  I used to own a pair of regular M50's before breaking them after about a year, and until I finally got around to purchasing these I sorely missed having high-quality headphones.-It absolutely does take some time to burn in these headphones.  Some people say up to 100 hours, but I've noticed a marked improvement in just after 10-20 hours of listening time (I use these almost the entire day at the office).-Having a removable cable, though new to me, is actually a plus as it makes packing the headphone's up much easier.  In the case of actually damaging the cable (fingers crossed that doesn't happen), swapping it out is much easier and there's no risk of rendering the whole unit useless.-Fit is fine.  I have a medium-sized head and have no risk of them sliding off, nor are they too noticeably heavy.-My one gripe remains with build quality, as like the regular M50's the M50x's use a lot of plastic components.  If you will be traveling with these, I highly recommend purchasing a hard travel case, which could save you some heartbreak further down the line.  I recently purchased a Caseling headphones case to avoid just that.And that's it!

VNo Artificial Colors or Flavors
p4292
sg5
VWhat do I mean by the title? Unlike some other high profile and popular headphones, one with a big B (Bose) and the other with a little b (beats), the M50x's are natural. No modifications for extra bass or treble. That only robs you of hearing things you should be by drowning them out from boosting other things. These give you the pure, unaltered sound as the artist intended. That means a lot to me because as a home theater enthusiast, I want to see and hear things as they were meant to be. I want accuracy in my audio and video devices and these deliver the audio in spades. It reminds me of TV displays in stores. The brightness and contrast are cranked up to get your attention but upon closer inspection, it's not at all realistic. Details are lost, people look sunburned, blacks look grey and it doesn't reflect real life. That's what Bose and Beats are to me. Dial back the settings and you get every detail, accurate colors, levels of shadow and an overall realistic picture. That's the AT M50x's.When searching for my first pair of expensive headphones (I had never spent more than $50) the M50x's consistently came up as the best or one of the best in the under $200 category. $200 was all I was willing to spend. What always caught my attention was the unaltered clarity these provide and so far, I have been very pleased by how well they deliver on that promise. When listening to music, I can clearly focus in on every instrument, every cymbal, every word, chorus and solo. It's a joy to hear my music so clearly and well defined. If other headphones I've used were good, solid standard definition, these are definitely high definition. If you really listen to your music, these headphones are going to help you do that and will make it a much more enjoyable experience. I've used them for movies as well and they really deliver a convincing movie experience. Dialogue is easy to understand, sound effects pack all the right punches, surrounds come through, putting you in the moment and theres nice thumps and booms substituting for subwoofer action. If there's a need to keep the noise down or your going portable, you can have a great movie watching experience with these.Speaking of portability, this isn't your practical, walking around town or going to the gym set. They're big but perfect for home, long trips or any other stationary listening. Sure, you could take them out but it's a pretty big set to have on when you're on the move. I'll use my on-ear Noontec Zoro HD's (which I highly recommend) for that.Build quality is excellent. There's plenty of plastic here but this is a very solid feeling set. The leather on the head band and earpads is soft, comfortable and has an expensive look and feel. The earpads completely cover my ears and form a nice seal, keeping the sound in, preventing excess leaking and keeping outside sounds out. I'm not one of those 8 hour a day wearers but for the duration of a movie, I didn't notice any discomfort. Felt or suede earpads can always be purchased and swapped out if need be. They're also very versatile by how many ways they can contort and collapse for storage. I also like the matching and locking removable cord and spare cords packed in the box. Also packed in was a soft leather pouch in a matching chocolate brown to my set. I bought a hard case to use instead but I could see using it for a short trip or days use elsewhere. I went with the limited edition dark green and brown and they really look nice. The green is a dark forest green, almost black in low light and the brown is a darker chocolate brown, with champagne gold accents on the ear cups and hinges. Aesthetically, this is a very good looking and feeling combination. Like they're more expensive than their price point.I chose the combo from Beach Camera as you get the free case and mini amp for the same price. Shipping was next day and reasonable and packaged well.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. I read a lot and watched a lot of videos before making the decision to buy these. It only took a few listens to know that I made the right choice. I know there are other brands of good sounding and well built headphones in the same price range but this combination of high marks by professional and casual reviewers, numerous appearances on top 5 lists, good brand reputation, warranty, build quality, and physical attractiveness made these the set for me. When I give a 5/5 review, it's not for perfection or best available product, it's for a performance and value combination. These meet that combination easily. Highly recommended for music listeners.

VPROSThese headphones feel, look and sound GREAT. These are probably the best headphones for the price IF you are using them to listen to music.CONSHowever, I am a composer and audio engineer and wanted to use these for mixing and composing purposes. So the fact that these headphones are colored so that anything coming through them sounds good is a minus for me. These add some low-mid body to mixes and a very little bit of pleasant reverb. This is great for listening, but when I'm looking for problems in a mix these colors can cover those problems so I don't catch them.But don't let this "coloration" con keep you from buying if you are simply an avid music listener. As an audio engineer I had to send these back and get some open backed AKGs.

p4321
sg5
VThere isn't much about these cans that hasn't already been said. They're fantastic. For those concerned about comfort I had a recent revelation. I picked up the velour replacement pads and the comfort is now on a totally different (better) level. Sound (primarily soundstage) is also improved. If you buy these headphones, do yourself a favor and get the velour pads. I wish I would have sooner. I was not a fan of the pleather pads they came with and I was constantly fiddling around trying to get a more comfortable fit. With the velour pads they're a pleasure to wear for hours.

VAwesome Headphones!
p4344
sg5
VThese are the best Headphones I've ever owned!They come with the headphones itself, 2 types of cables (long ones too), 1x cable being the curly type which can be very flexible when moving around and 1x cable being the straight cable. The design is also awesome, as they screw right into the headset so they don't fall off easily, the other terminates into a 3.5mm jack for (ipod, iphone, cell phone or any other audio source), lastly there is the black leather-like carrying pouch.I was skeptical before I purchased these. I did my share of reading reviews, watching YouTube reviews and posting on forums for opinions. I've never purchased any headphones or headsets over the $50 mark so being at over $100, I wanted to make sure it was worth it.At the end, it was these Audio Technica ATH-M50x vs Sennheiser Momentum 2.0's. I originally purchased the Sennheiser Momentum 2.0s...and don't get me wrong, they were great but they were on-the-ear headphones and a lot of the music was bleeding out. Everyone around me could hear my music and where I work at, it was too loud for some other workers. I soon returned them and opted for these Audio Technica ATH-M50's.What a difference closed back headphones were. Not only did these fit around my ears, but the sound quality was superb! I had some older SONY MDX-550's and they were also awesome, but when you pair these with a good (not even great) amplifier, these M50x's rock my world! I was now able to hear the crisp sounds I normally couldn't hear. The voices sounded different, in a good and best way possible. The bass was rocking and thumping in my ear. The tweeters came through crystal clear....it was a whole new experience for me...I can't even imagine how better more pricier headphones would be but these have been wonderful!I've had these for a year now and listen to them almost daily. Every type of music I play through them sounds crystal clear. Even some older MP3's (with only 56kbps) sounded a little muffled, but better than any earbud or earphones I heard them through.I'm not a headphone techy, nor a music enthusiast...I'm just a regular guy that listens to music while working. Again, even after a whole year of listening to these I have not even tried to look elsewhere. These are incredible headphones for $150 and I fully recommend them.

p4349
sg5
VA lot has been said about the sound quality of these headphones and I don't feel like my hearing is as golden as the plugs on the cables you get with these headphones, so I won't comment on that. I think it's quite great.The build quality seems excellent other than the plastic of the cans looking a little bit cheap.I'm taking away two stars for the comfort of wearing these for extended periods of time. I'm used to using headphones for upwards of 12h a day and when I use these - my ears hurt from the pressure of the plastic behind of the inner mesh pressing against them. I'll take my ATH-ANC7b over these any day for the comfort of wearing. It would be nice if Audio Technica updated these or created a version improved for better comfort of extended use - perhaps by adding some more empty space inside of the cans or slightly reducing the thickness/rigidity of the band.I think I'll keep them and use them for mixing/reference, but stick to my lightweight ATH-ANC7b or Audio-Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile ones for anything else.I'm disappointed by the comfort of these headphones that sound like standard cans used by sound engineers on a daily basis.

VI could go on about how good this headphones are but i wontwhat you will  get with this headphones is a pure balanced sound overall as stated by every review ever made for this superb headphones.Every range of music genre will feel as if it was the best thing you have ever hard, cuz its what this had headphones were made to do.Get them and you wont regret unless you want that extra base or whatever you want, 200 dollars and up and there is a whole new level of heaphones that will blow your mind.But NOTEall heaphones in the hundreds are worth the buck, you will have to do a large amount of research before wasting money on a 500 -1000 dollar headphones or lessDepending on what you want you cant go wrong on the choices available for anyone that deeply cares about sound quality.simply there is a pair of headphones for everyone, for anyone even if it cost 1000 dollars it still has a fan, someone willing to pay that much to get the satisfaction of buying something worth it according to their taste of music quality and budget price.

p4449
sg5
VNegatives:- A tad overpriced.- Sound spectrum is too "V shaped" too much bass and treble, not enough mids.- ZERO soundstage, sound is aggressively blasted into your skull, it's exhausting.- Stock pads are uncomfortable after an hour.Positives:- Excellent build quality.- Sound quality, great sound detail, very good range (can reach the lowest bass, and highest of highs effortlessly).- Can go extremely loud with no distortion whatsoever.- 3 included cables are a nice touch, and very useful.- Limited Edition colors are gorgeous.- HM5 pads fit perfect, and make these infinitely more comfortable, while adding a bit of "sorely needed" soundstage.Conclusion:These are great, high quality, headphones, but to me adding HM5 pads is a MUST. If you own these, or are considering purchasing them, get some HM5 pads along with them, you will not regret it. After adding the HM5 pads, I Love them, and can wear them for 8+ hours straight, no problem. I purchased the Limited-Edition "Dark Green", which has dark brown pleather and pale metallic gold accents, I purchased Brown pleather HM5 pads, they go perfectly together, and match my gold FiiO X1 in its brown leather Ignis case. The headphones with the larger HM5 pads, 4-foot cable, connected to the Fiio X1 (in its leather Ignis case), all fit perfectly in the included bag.

Vthese are the bomb. So comfortable, and also very stylish. The sound is crazy good. I am not a DJ or a producer or anything like that. I dabble in Garageband, and like to watch movies late at night. I am usually watching movies at night while my girlfriend is sleeping in the next room, so I pop these on and we are good to go! Sometime I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable.Pros:-Great sound-Different length cables, allows me to watch tv from the couch and not have to stay up close to the computer.-Has both studio and regular size jacks-SUPER comfortable. I have a fairly wide head and these seemed tight a first but you can stretch them out a little with some gentle tugs. fit like a glove now.Cons:-the white finish seems like it will get dirty over the years-fairly bulky

VI had pretty high expectations for these headphones, and in terms of sound these shattered my expectations. This is the best sound quality I have ever heard, headphones or not. The cups are big enough to cover my ears completly, however, they are a little on the heavy side. I was expecting something lighter, but I'm happy with the weight for sound sacrifice.

VI have always loved listening to music like most but when I got older I started to appreciate listening to music with actual good headphones and as a user of audio technica ATH M50 and how much I loved them I felt it was time to get the new ATH M50xDG as mine were just getting old after almost three years of use they just had some normal wear and tear that ended up breaking them. So the next day after they broke I ordered these ATH M50x headphones for my new cans. I CAN TELL YOU THEY ARE A VERY GOOD SUCCESSOR TO THE OLD ONES. They produce the same great sound as the old ATH M50s but now the earcup cushions are a lot more comfortable and the new colors look amazing. Also one of my only problems with the last model was that there was no detachable cable and now there is which is very convenient to have three different cables for different situations. Overall I can say that these new headphones are defiantly worth the purchase if your an avid music listener, I use them on average once a day.10/10 wonderful headphones with good true sound

VThese headphones are well made and very comfortable. I was waiting for these headphones like a kid waiting for Christmas, since I had read so many great reviews and videos saying how awesome they were... When I finally got to listen to them my reaction was more like " that's it? " the sounds are clean and detailed but to my ears, it was missing depth. I listen to all kinds of music, from classical to electronic... I think these were a little flat for my taste, with a little more bass they would have been perfect. If you listen to mostly vocals, or instrumental I think they would work out very well... So my search for the perfect headphones continues...

VThese headphones sound amazing especially for being sub 200 dollar pairs. If you are considering buying headphones and sound quality is your biggest concern get these. You can keep the money you saved and buy a DAC.ProsAmazing, rich, balanced sound.Good bass but not overpowering.Extremely comfortable.Different cables that are removable and lock into place.ConsCan be a pro or con but bass is not too powerful. If you are a basshead the bass on these may disappoint you. It is important to remember these are studio monitors so they are not designed to have powerful bass, but a balanced sound.The audio jack on the headphones is not 3.5mm so you have to use the audio technica cables.

VLet me first start this review by saying I am by no means an audiophile or anything. To be honest I probably wouldn't even be writing this, or have gotten this, if it wasn't for my old gaming headset finally breaking. I would rarely use that headset for anything other voice chat also, very rarely would it be used for music or game sound. I decided that I would replace it with something that I could use to listen to game sounds more clearly sometimes, along with music and voice chat. But really, anything is going to be step up from the game headset.I have to say that I'm fairly impressed overall with this set of headphones. I'm picking up things that, even with a decent 5.1 system hooked to my computer, I never noticed before. Like water on the other side of walls in games. Or a drum beat in the background that kind of faded in before. It really makes me excited and I can't wait to continue to explore these in use.Now I should also mention that I bought a pair ofJBL Synchros S500 Powered Over-Ear Stereo Headphones, Blackat around the same time (thanks to a good deal in a local store that didn't carry the M50s) and had those for a few days before the M50s arrived. So I did some of the same testing and exploring on them as I did on the M50 when it arrived. I have to say that even to my untrained ears I can hear the difference in sound quality and profile between the two. I believe it was said that these were the most neutral sounding phones on the market now, or at least in this price range, and I have to say that that is really the best way to put it. The 500s just seem more warm and rich, which is a plus for them in a sense, but ultimately I feel it comes down to having the right set of headphones for the right job, and something more neutral is going to be better for being able to tweak things down the road with equalizers and stuff.Speaking of tweaks and equalizers, in my (nowhere near exhaustive) testing one thing I was hook these into my computer (duh) and play around the sound card's built in equalizer and its presets/features. While by default the bass does seem to be a little lacking (though I can kind of tell it's there) it doesn't take much to start bringing it. Just a few little tweaks on settings, maybe enabling the virtual surround, and you'll see some nice differences. It wont get to the same level as others, including the aforementioned 500s, but I again feel like that ability to tweak is what really makes these a good pair of headphones in this price range.In the end I'm going to be keeping both of them I believe. At the moment I'm not 100% sure how much I like the M50s for music, where that warmth and bass can really shine and help. But I feel for use in gaming and the computer use I do that the M50s win hands down. Maybe this shouldn't be much of a surprise though since, in hindsight, it feels like the 500s were more made for music and smartphone/media player use (look at the cord) and the M50s were designed for audio mixing and the like. As the saying goes, pick the right tool for the job. But if you only had to pick one pair of headphones for everything, I would highly suggest this.

VExtended Session Comfort Without Compromising Sound
p4750
sg5
VAs someone who dropped $300+ on Beats Headphones, I couldn\u2019t help but feel underwhelmed by the build and sound quality that I received.  The materials had me worrying about carrying them loosely in my backpack, and the aggressive EQ made any audio production impossible, as I couldn\u2019t get an accurate response.  I knew I needed something different.  Headphones that were comfortable, built well, and had incredible sound.  The Audiotechnica m50x headphones will absolutely meet your price to quality expectations while maintaining sleek and convenient design elements.Comfort & BuildAn avid music listener\u2019s sessions can last anywhere between 30 minutes and a full day.  The M50x headphones come with luscious padding on both the headband as well as the ears.  The soft, faux leather material used is smooth to the touch and is easy to clean as well.  Housed within the plastic exterior is a metal frame that gives the headphones just the right amount of weight, assuring its durability.  You can be certain that wearing these headphones will remain comfortable from the moment you put them on.EQThe M50x uses a very conservative EQ, allowing for you to enjoy music with or without an external amplifier.  Without one, you\u2019ll enjoy accurate bass that doesn\u2019t affect other lower frequencies present in the mix.  The high end is exceptionally crisp without sounding tinny.  Whether you pair it with a portable amplifier or not, your music will sound fantastic.Convenience FeaturesThe headset does in fact fold in to itself, becoming about half its original size.  Included with purchase was a small carrying pouch that will give peace of mind when putting the headphones in a suitcase or backpack.Another useful feature is the specifically designed audio cables, which lock into place on the left ear.  This ensures that if the cable gets caught on a door handle, or table corner even, that headphones remain undamaged by the sudden tension.  While these cables aren\u2019t universal the extra durability, as well as the impossibility of the cable being pulled out accidentally, is well worth it.  Plus, third party cables are available for extremely affordable prices on Amazon.Final ThoughtsIf you\u2019re looking for fantastic sound and a device that won\u2019t become uncomfortable, even after hours of listening, these are for you.  The EQ, build quality, and style are all top notch, and the convenient features just sweeten the deal.  With these headphones, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy your music to its fullest.

VGreat College Dorm Headphones.
p4784
sg5
VThese are the first pair of quality closed headphones that I have bought. The only other experience I have with closed headphones is using a pair of my dad's Bose QuietComfort 15s. Recently, I started attending college and I needed to be able to listen to music/movies without annoying my roommates. Even in a 8x10 ft room, with two roommates, I can listen to music pretty loudly with these and they're quiet enough so that my roommates don't hear me. The audio quality is very good, along with the QuietComforts, the only other quality speaker I use regularly is the Bose SoundLink Mini. Compared to those two, the audio on the M50xs is a major improvement, and the base gets pretty deep too.The physical quality of the headphones is really high, I have been keeping them in the front pocket of my backpack, sometimes in the nice leather slip that was included, sometimes loose, and after a month there hasn't been any problems. The headphones are a little snug on my head, but they don't move around at all. After about an hour of use, my ears do start to hurt. But, all I need to do is just take them off for a like 2-5 minutes and I'm good for another hour.Originally I was looking at buying the Superlux 668Bs, but I'm very happy that I changed my mind and spent a little more on these. At $170 I think that the ATH-M50xs are as good as they come.

VBest headphone's I've ever owned.  The sound quality is amazing.  (Beware fans of punchy bass, you will need to have at least a software equalizer to get those lows you're looking for).  I'm using these on a macbook pro without an amplifier, and they sounds amazing.

VGreat headphones! I'm not an audiophile but wanted some quality headphones to use at work. They're very comfortable, and while they don't block out all sound (if I'm wearing them without any music playing I can still hear people talking around me), they do a good job of not leaking sound--so my coworkers can't hear my music unless I have it turned up really really loud. They also come with a nice carrying case and fold up into a reasonable size.

VWow! I previously had a pair of studio "reference" monitors from another brand, similar price. The cord frayed, and my brother (a musician with recording equipment) has the M50s as does one of my fave musicians. Given the rave reviews of brother and the rest of the world when I looked at these, it was a no brainer...and they are right-these rocked my world! I love them. I am not a studio pro, but I am a very picky audio geek. Way better sound than far more expensive headphones.One minor issue: I have a small head. At their smallest, they can fall off if I'm not a bit careful. But that is a common issue for me with headphones, hats, helmets, etc. The sound is way worth it. They are super comfy, and go way around my ears, which I like.Just don't expect to take these on your commute on a subway. They are big and heavy. The case is just a bag, not very protective. Drive them, but don't shove them into small spaces in bags and get on public transport.I am not dinging these for that. 5 stars. I knew that before buying them. If you want commuters, you don't buy these.

It's like listening to music for the first time.  I'm hearing things in the tracks I've never heard before, it's so crisp and clear.  I listen to a variety of different music genres and I was blown away by how these handled each genre differently.  I'd definitely recommend them for anyone who is multi-genre listener too.Absolutely worth the price.

VI cannot say enough about how satisfied I am with the headphones
p4892
sg5
VFirst of all, let me preface this by saying I have not used these headphones for actual studio recording, but just for casual listening and at the library while in school.I cannot say enough about how satisfied I am with the headphones. First off, they look really nice. They are different enough that people comment on them, but they are "conservative" enough that it's not gonna make me stick out like a sore thumb (I got the blue/tan ones). The headband is solid and comfortable and the adjustments are subtle enough that you can really dial in the perfect fit for your head.The ear pads fit over my entire ear, which is great because in long study sessions of 2+ hours I don't have to constantly adjust or take them off to give my ears a break.The sound quality is awesome. Far and away better than anything Skullcandy (especially in this price range) and comparable to some higher priced brands. They isolate the sounds pretty well, and so far no one in the silent library has told me they leak sound, so I am assuming they also do a great job of keeping sound in.These headphones were well worth the price and then some!

VBest Headphones. Best Company. -Customer for Life After Getting These-
p4910
sg5
VI previously owned a pair of excellent $350 Monitor Headphones from a German company. I wanted something from a company that had great expertise in headphones and payed attention to ALL of the details to make their product and headphones the best in all aspects. Hence, I checked out Audio-Technica and I got what I was missing out on:1) These headphones are much more comfortable for LONG USE, which is a must in a solid pair of headphones.2) ELEGANT DESIGN (I got the DG Limited Edition). Absolutely fantastic look for PROFESSIONAL headphones that offer Amazing sound.3) The reason that I want to mention that the noise cancelling is great, just as you would expect, is because at the same time they are VERY comfortable - especially the ear pads.4) The Sound Quality is absolutely PHENOMENAL, I mean I can't tell the difference between my old $350 pair. I got MORE than what I payed for with these Mx50's. Love it.5) Finally I love the fact that they have included the option to attach different chords. The thing is they are VERY smart for doing this because over time(years) the chord may break while the headphones will still be at 100% - we especially know this to be true with other cheap branded headphones, where the chords break all the time and much much sooner than many years. This way you will have these headphones working forever, so you might as well merry them now.-Also, the attention to detail is exhibited again when you notice that you get 3 chords that are all useful: For example, they offer a short cord that is perfect for use anywhere for casual listeners and great for travelers. The other 2 are also specific to professional studio listeners but can be used by anybody (you can take advantage of the long cord and screw on adapter).6) Well one last and Most Important thing is the EXTRAORDINARY BUILD QUALITY! I love this, as for me this is most important in any product that you use and are rough with everyday..

VI am having difficulty understanding how this product got so many good reviews.I bought these for office use. It did an excellent job for cancelling out the sound. I believe it is because my ears felt like Loki laying on the bi-frost bridge with Thor's hammer on his chest. I mean holly hell ... I put the headphones on my bookshelf speaker one ear on each side to expand it up. After a week, I had to give in.It comes with lots of cables yes. However, the end of all those cables that goes into the headphone is specific to the headphone. The cable end has a shape that allows it to lock into the headphone so if you loose one or you shave off the plastic on the headphone that locks your cable, you are screwed.I think some headphones have some kind of a "driver" built into them that will work towards the magnets' sound spectrum to give you the best output. I do not know if these have it or not but I never thought I would that much difference on different songs even within same streaming app like spotify. I mean, if your audio quality itself is bad even the slightest, you will hear it and these do nothing to nullify the effect. I had some headphones in the past that did an excellent job on steady performance throughout *cough*sennheiser*cough*I knew the Mhz range of this headphone before I bought it. For those who would like some more info on that, this headphone is a "V" headphone. It means that you get high bass and high treble and not much in between. It does not work for this. Lows are not really that low. Even though headphones felt like they were embedded to my skull, bass did not even feel punchy. Highs felt like they scratched my ear drums. When I was able to suffer through the pain of these grasping headphones, thinking that pain is the weakness that leaves the body, I had to take these off after may be an hour because of the very disturbing highs.I wanted to give this a chance. I really did. That is why I kept it for a week and even almost two weeks. I put them on my bookshelf speakers to stretch them out even over a weekend etc. I could not take it anymore and I returned them. I thank amazon for a swift refund. I really would not buy this headphones and definitely not for this price.

VThese are not only very good looking headphones with a great sound quality, but are extremely practical in their design. I myself use these for all purposes, for my music making, my bus rides, and for home listening. I was astounded at the quality of the sound at the fist song I played, and I am sure you will be too. And I am not just some bass hungry consumer, I have done much research and I am experienced with the audio world. These things are balanced to perfection.personally I believe the blue version of these are the best looking, and they aren't too huge on my head. I wasn't too concerned about looks when I purchased these, however if you are conscious of that sort of thing these are truly fantastic. They are comfortable I don't care what other reviews say, and they are super durable. I can throw these in a bag and not worry. The cables also add a nice touch.If you are hesitating to buy some sennheisers, sonys, or beyrerdynamics at a similar price don't do it, get these. certainly worth it.

VSome research on youtube and blogs brings to a conclusion that these are probably among the best over ear - closed back headphones to buy under $200. After putting these on I believe that those were accurate reviews. The noise isolation (not cancellation - that is battery powered) is great !! Comfort is pretty good and make quality also very good. You can start to get tired in about 2 hours which is pretty high for closed back headphones. The 3 cables provided offer an interesting choice to the listener and are color matched. I highly recommend these headphones to anyone wanting to spend upto $200.

VI got these head phones as a replacement for my broken 2014 Beats Studio Wireless. I can honestly say I wish i had known about these headphones before I got the beats. The sound quality on these is better than the Beats except the Bass isn't quite as deep as the Beats were. The build quality of these is much better. The plastic is very sturdy and the leather on the headband is really soft. The ear cups are also mush more comfortable than the Beats.The only con to these headphones is the soft leather bag that they come with for carrying around. I would much rather have a hard case so I can put these in a bag and not worry about them getting broken.Overall these are probably the best headphones for their price.

VGreat sound!! The passive noise cancellation works well. I did a significant amount of research before buying. I have not used them on a plane yet but it works great to block out sound while I listen to music at work. I purchased this headset with the Creative Sound Blaster E1 portable headphone amp and I have to say that the amp is a must. I can definitely hear a difference in the sound quality when I use it with my Nexus phone and iPad. I've also used them for 6 to 8 hours at work without any fatigue. Overall, for the money and quality this is great buy compared to other over the ear headphones. I don't believe you will be disappointed at this price point.

VAudio Technica, Beats, or Bose???
p5131
sg5
VI had been researching for about two weeks on which headphones were the best choice for me. After reading hundreds of audiophiles reviews, I decided to give these a try. I ordered the ath-m50x and the ath-m70x. The m50x are a better choice for people looking for an amazing balance in listening to all genres of music. The bass isn't overwhelming like the beats and the m70s are more a studio recording headphone. The m70s sound more clear, but your bass is essentially dead. If you just want to hear the singing and any high pitched string or synthesized  sounds then go with the m70s. If you listen to everything like most then go with the m50s. You wont be said!!! The greatest part about them is that they really seal well so that noise around is cut out as much as possible. Its not as good as the Bose Qc25 active noise cancelling, but better than any of the Beats active noise canceling. The best part is that you don't have any batteries to worry about as well! Also for those that want an inline mic. you can get one that works with the m50s/m70s. They have ones for the iphone. I haven't found any for the android yet. If you have an android, buy the iphone inline mic ones and usually the only buttons that don't work on the inline mic are the volume buttons.

p5155

VI first want to caution buyers to purchase only from authorized dealers.  The list of authorized dealers is extensive and can be found at http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/site/1e22eec97c088a8b/ or http://www.audio-technica.com/cgi-bin/dealers/dealers.plI had a pair of these headphones on order -- to be fulfilled by Amazon -- but fortunately I learned in time to cancel that the dealer was not only not authorized but does not even sell audio equipment or even photographic equipment despite its name suggesting that it does.NOW TO THE HEADPHONES:  I love them!  I have listened to all kinds of music through two different stereos, a full-size computer, and a laptop.  I feel that the high notes are perfectly rendered as are the bass notes.  The music through the headphones is exactly the music that you would hear without the headphones.Also, I like that the headphones come with three different cables.  I like that they are detachable because I usually have headphone failure only because the wires go faulty where the cable enters the headphone.  In the past, I've purchased far less expensive headphones, but this way of listening is something that brings me great joy, so I wanted to buy a really good model.  I thoroughly researched the Audio-Technica ATH-M50X and feel that these headphones will live up to their excellent reviews and reputation.Be sure to get yourself a pair.  Just be sure to get them from an authorized dealer (perhaps there are authorized dealers on Amazon, but I ended up at a store despite my love affair with Amazon.

VListening to Counting Stars by OneRepublic flac is truly an experience, I hear every detail so clearly and every instrument feels so alive... I use it all the time. It's very comfortable and the build quality feels awesome even though it's mostly plastic (it feels like solid, durable plastic). Detachable cable is a great feature and so is being able to fold it. I wouldn't say it's base heavy, even though I love electronic music, I'd say the base is fine because if it were stronger it would probably be annoying when listening to other types of music. The mids and high feel amazing to me (i'm no expert). I have to warn you they are kind of big so if you want something slim looking or something look elsewhere (maybe momentums or bose). Overall amazing set!

VAs someone who loves to listen to music on a daily basis,the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is on the top of my list. The M50x surpasses Beats and many other headphone manufacturers in all aspects. The bass of the headphones allows to isolate yourself and the clarity from the extended frequency, you're able to achieve the clear, crisp sound that everyone wants. I would recommend this to any consumer that would like to upgrade their current headphones to studio quality headphones without having to pay upwards of $600.

VThese cans are great. In all honesty they sound WAY better than the price would indicate. I also own Denon AHD 2000's which aren't made anymore. Tragic btw but that is for another discussion. I also own Audio Technica ATHESW9 with the wooden cups. Very cool cans and not made anymore either. I also have a pair of Grado RS1's. Not comparing them as these are all very different headphones but more as a point of reference to my taste in sound. Grados are way different. They are open backed and have a wide open sound stage. But they are 600 plus dollars and meant to be used with an amp in a quiet room. I bought the denons because they are fun and play r&b; like no other can in the world. I bought the wooden AT's because, well I'm a headphone junky. :)Back to the M50s. These are my commuter train phones and they are glorious. I'm writing this as I sit on the train listening to some Peter Gabriel. I get many compliments on how cool and different they look. The cables they came with are fan... Read more

VBest Headphones for Their Price By Far
p5306
sg5
VI first heard of these magnificent headphones from a Youtube tech reviewer Marques Brownlee back when the ATH M50 was new. I had always wanted a pair, and could never get my hands on them. Soon after I managed the money, these came out. As a strict upgrade, and a piece of art, the ATH M50x are worth every penny I've spent. They are very neutral, giving out a true sound rather than being biased toward bass or treble, which allows for sound programs like Dolby Home Theatre to shine. They're fairly good at noise cancelling too--there have been many times using them that I could not hear anything apart from what I was listening to.They're very light and comfortable, extend to fit on any head, and swivel or flip in any direction I could think of using them. It comes with several cords of different lengths and types, though I only ever used the long one, since the distance between my CPU or keyboard and myself is rather far. I use them every day, and I have not had a single problem out of them. No pops, no connection issue, no screeches--nothing. Even at very high pitch sound, they do not breakup frequencies easily. Bass is great as well, especially if you have access to an Equalizer. In all, five stars for my favorite pair of headphones!

VA real world and practical comparison of Audio Technica ATH-M50 and the new ATH-M50x. This review is for people who haven't owned the old or the new ones and is contemplating a purchase between the two. I am not a DJ or audiophile, so this review is geared towards common folks who just use headphones for listening to music, videos, audio books, movies in a real world setting using phones, tablets, laptops etc (i.e. not professional equipment).Price -M50 - look for deals online and you can find a brand new one for under $100 easily (I bought mine brand new for $80) with a deal alert on Slickdeals.M50x - $169-189. Since they are relatively new there has not been any price reduction or deals yet and won't be for quite sometime.Sound quality -Same as M50, i.e. excellent and the best you can get for this money. Tons of reviews covering this so I'm not going into details.Sound isolation i.e. noise cancellation -Same as M50, i.e. very good. These aren't active noise cancelling, b... Read more

They give me a truer quality sound and let me hear things I wouldn't have noticed on a lower quality pair of headphones.Having a detachable cable was another feature I really wanted and the interlocking system on the M50x's is really nice-keeps the cable secured nicely. Being able to use the longer cable at my workstation and the shorter one when I'm on the go is great.I would recommend these for anyone in the market for a quality pair of headphones, professional or not.

VSo freaking clear!
p5335
sg5
VThese make songs sound new again. The sound is so clear. It's strange but you can hear background insturments that you may not have paid attention to before.I know its not a good comparison but I listened to my wife's $20.00 pair of over the ear Sony's and these really made them unlistenable. I know these are a little pricey but all worth it. I'm blown away some say there isn't enough low end. I'm listening to Slacker radio and I sure wouldn't want more bass. They are also very sturdy feeling. I can't imagine any other headphone would compare in this price range. I also connected my Fiio 11 amp to it as I did to my old Grado 60 that made them sound better. These didn't need the amp and actually sound better without it. If you want over the ear headphones look no further.

VI would like a bit more low-end response
p5341
sg5
VI don't have a professional ear for the sort of thing, but the sound is definitely accurate. Unfortunately though, I bought these headphones based on reviews alone, as no store in my area carries the brand. For me, accurate or not, I would like a bit more low-end response, and I also don't find them to be all that comfortable. I wanted the over-ear versus on-ear because the pressure of on-ear headphones makes me ears ache if I wear them for too long. For me, these headphones do not cure that, as the surrounds don't open quite large enough. I tried on several pairs at my local BestBuy that I found to be more comfortable, comparable in performance and had more low-end response. While the build quality definitely wasn't as good, they were also a hundred dollars cheaper.

p5377
sg5
VEar pads are small.  Drivers are right against your ears.  Highs get a bit piercing on strong vocal tracks.  Can be heavy on the bass for some.After changing to the HM5 pads, these go to a 4 star rating for me.  The new pads opened the sound stage up giving a more flat tone balance to the headphones overall.  The bass is slightly less "boomy" and the treble has been evened out a bit due to the drivers are farther away from your ear.

VI mean they sound good but they are a little heavy and if you have longer hair, they can slide around pretty easily. Not too impressed although they are still good in regards to design and sound. I can't blame just these headphones though because I'm sure other headphones are also a little slick against hair. In short, they just didn't surpass my expectations. That is why I gave it 4 out of 5. For your average Joe, these might be a tad pricy. If you can swallow the price though, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

VI struggled with whether I wanted to spend $150.00 on headphones, but since they had some pretty good reviews, I took the plunge and purchased them. I have no regret, I am so in love with these headphones! They are definitely more comfortable than other headphones I have had in the past and have excellent sound quality. The only thing is that they are just a tad big on me and sometimes they slip around on my head if not positioned exactly right. However, they are not so large that they don't fit and it's not a big deal at all. I love them and I would highly recommend them if they are in your price range!

p5401

VAs with all user product reviews, personal impressions are completely subjective, but I am one that generally relies on these reviews for most of my purchases. I am a "home recording enthusiast", and I have used the previous version of these headphones for many years, so I must admit a bias towards them. Reviews, even professional reviews, can only get you so far with something like this. If you live near enough to a music store, you really need to demo headphone to find your preference.That said, I find the ATH-M50x to be very well balance, with a solid (but not hyped) bottom end, a natural to slightly warm mid-range, and a clean (but not overly bright) high-end. For me, that makes them near perfect. As a musician recording at home, so much of the work is done wearing cans, and I can wear the M50x for hours without any fatigue or discomfort. Most importantly, these headphones are "neutral" enough that I can get almost 90% of the way to a finished mix before needing to switch to monitors to get the final mix. This makes working at home, and not driving my family crazy by hearing the same song over and over again during the tracking and mixing process, much easier.

VTHE TRUTH.
p5455
sg5
VHeadphones are decent... If anything, I would compare the bass to Apple headphones/Earbuds, trust me when I say this. If your looking to go for a bass headset always go for Sennheiser headphones/speakers they may look beefy, or big... But they are the true bass speakers/headphones you seek.When you put them on, it practically can be referred to as listening to an ocean in a sea shell, it feels weird when you put them on it's very noise cancelling...Now here's the big beef... When you want to listen to music while you wear these, in a library, on a plane, anywhere... It's just not going to work. If you plug this headset into your MP3 player even if the volume is lower than 5% the music you are listening too is still very clearly heard to people around you, when you set the volume to 100% it practically becomes a speaker! Literally, no joke.Very durable, I could've seen this sticking around for a very long time if I hadn't returned it. But I see no reason to include 90 degree swiveling earcups, well I could see how it's still relevant if you turn the volume to 100% and then you can face the music outwards... But other than that, the swiveling earcups can be annoying as a lot of the times I had them, the swiveling earcups were facing the wrong way and I had a lot of trouble trying to face the earcups inwards facing each other.

VI got these to replace a set of Grado SR80 head phones that were nice, but had weak mechanical integrity at the cord connections.  I got this due to the jack that I figured would be more forgiving, and since it came with three cables, if one breaks I have back-ups.  As to the sound quality, you can find plenty of positive reviews for that from folks with better ears than mine, but I agree they are excellent at this price point.

VRenewing my love of music again...
p5545
sg5
VSo where do I even start with these.  Full disclosure - this is my first REAL foray into anywhere close to high-end headphones or studio-quality products, so hopefully that'll help temper the rest of this review.  Second piece of disclosure - I have none of the other accompanying studio or high-end audio gear that supposedly can make these headphones shine, so there's that.That being said, summed up in one word: amazing.  I have this on-again/off-again relationship with music.  I was REALLY into music for much of my college years, and now that I have a real life, it's really hard to have the same passion for music that I used to.  These headphones are changing that.I don't know quite what it is with quality products, but when you use them, you just know.  The build on these things is pretty solid.  Unless you're a serial abuser of your stuff, they should stand up to most any normal use cases.  The included cable options are pretty solid, too, although the proprietary connector from cable-to-headphone is a bit disappointing.  Other than that, fantastic.Now onto the sound.  Wow.  Just wow.  I'm really avoiding trying to oversell these things, but it's really hard to do.  Do they have the head-rattling bass of Beats et al?  No.  But do they have a really well-develop sound balance, including keeping a nice bass kick along with clear highs and solid mids?  Yes, yes they do.  And the soundstage is really amazing, too.  Almost freakishly so.  Where that really shines is when you have the listening volume set to a 'normal' level (e.g. not blowing your ears out).  A well-produced track will have really solid depth-of-field, to the point where I've actually tripped myself out, thinking I was hearing noises behind me or to the side of me that were actually in the song themselves.  Great example: My Love by Blackmill.  The 'crackling' can be heard far rear left.  Load it up on Apple Music or the like and tell me I'm lying.End of story/tl;dr - buy these.  Now.  Really, you're doing yourself a disservice if you're considering anything else anywhere close to this price point.  You will NOT be disappointed.

p5591
sg5
VThe sound is great.  If I was rating on sound quality alone, it would be 4-5 stars easy.  They are very comfortable, and they naturally block out ambient noise sufficiently. Noise cancelling headphones I have tested do only a little bit better, but they make my ears feel weird after a few minutes. No such problem with these guys!I have to knock off a couple of stars for two very simple usability screw-ups. First, the headphone jack that it comes with does not fit completely into my phone (with no case on!) and most airplane ports I have tried.  It has a piece of plastic at the base of the jack that makes it pop out of the port with even slight movement.  I shaved off some of the plastic around the metal piece with a box cutter, and that seems to have fixed the problem. But why do I have to modify the jack so that it works with normal devices!?The second feature that ticks me off is the headphone cable itself.  It is detachable, and it comes with 3 different chords with different lengths and tips.  That would be cool by itself, but the end that plugs into the headphone is a special size! So if I lose the chord (or destroy it with a box cutter while attempting to modify it), I cannot simply grab a replacement from a local electronics store.

VBought it for my boyfriend. He loves it so far, and he couldn't stop complimenting it. It is pretty cheap, knowing that this kind of headphone is under 200. It is not noise cancelling, but it is just enough to drown out the sounds from the environment. My boyfriend couldn't hear a thing I say with his music on, but he could hear some muffles when he turns off his music. I guess that's about it for this review. :]

VThese headphones are great at their job: playing sounds and music in high quality and definition. They fit well on the ears and are comfortable there. They are very durable and the extras included are very nice. For the price, these seem like good entry level headphones.But there is one major flaw: the headband that connects the two headphones is very uncomfortable. After wearing it for too long, it starts to actually hurt your head, either pressing down on your scalp or clamping on your whole head. Adjusting the headband does little to alleviate the problem, because the headphones are always either so loose they'll slip off, or so tight they hurt after a while. Overall, I'd say it's the shape of the headband that's at fault.If you can overcome this issue, don't wear them for long periods, or if you have a perfectly spherical head like Pac-Man, then consider getting these headphones. Personally I am satisfied with them and have gotten over the problem, but I know there are others who could not do so and ended up with buyer's remorse.

VGreat pair of headphones. Much more reliable when it comes to a more flat, genuine tone than most popular headphones. With that being said, I would recommend these more for someone who is looking to create music or have a genuine listen to their music. I personally do not use this for enjoyment listening, simply because I like heavy bass, scooped mid and high treble when I listen for pleasure. If you are an audiophile or looking to record/mix with headphones, I HIGHLY recommend these. Great build quality, reliable, and much more professional than other "pro/studio" headphones out there.

They give a nice surrounding sound effect to the ears but there's just something off about them that I don't like. I plugged them into my mp3 player and I have to turn the volume up almost all the way to get decent sound. The only thing I like about this headset is the build. It looks nice and feels comfortable.

p5681
sg5
VExcellent sounding headphones. While not noise canceling, in most circumstances with medium or above volume music I can't hear anything else. The improvement from the ATH-M50 of now 3 interchangeable cables is most welcomed if you ever take these with you. Trying to manage the long coiling cable of the M50 was a pain on airplanes and traveling, but the new shorter cable (that now fits better into phone/tablet cases) is perfect for travel.The sound profile and quality is the same as the M50, which is great considering the M50 sounds excellent to begin with.I also personally love the look of these headphones.I've heard complaints of discomfort on the original M50. While I haven't experienced any noticeable discomfort, I do find the ear pads on the M50x to be softer and more comfortable overall than the M50.5/5 would buy again (and considering I bought these so that I could leave my M50's at work proves it)

VI have the M50 anniversary model which still works great, but I had to get these as the color scheme was too nice to pass up. As always, amazing sound quality that you would expect from AT, and the detachable cable was a huge plus. I pair these with a mini-amp to add a bit more boost to the lows (as these are studio monitoring which provides a more flat delivery). I just hope AT stocks replacement pads in the tan color.

VAmazing headphones!
p5693

VI've owned these for about 5 months and have almost no complaints. The sound is literally so well balanced and well-designed  that I can't tell how loud my music is until my ears start to hurt. There is a little distortion at max volume, but I don't plan on listening at this level for any extended period of time. There is also very little if any sound leakage which is great for an office environment. The reason for four stars is because, after 5 months of ownership, the right earpiece stopped producing sound. I tried a few different cables and different audio sources and all produced the same issue. Ultimately I had to send it in for warranty repair. This was a very seamless process and there was no hassle whatsoever. If I would have paid the $100+ for overnight shipping, their warranty documentation states they would have tried to repair it same-day and return it with the same overnight shipping. That's pretty impressive in my book! The only caveat with this process is that there was no communication until I received a return tracking number. It would've been nice to have received an email letting me know that they received the item and when I could expect the headphones to be returned, but I'm otherwise very satisfied with the process. I would very highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of headphones from a great company.

These are great for all kinds of music, but you can expect to see them the most for "professional" work. (But I think us audiophiles just want to immerse ourselves in the best since we are spoiled.) :)

My plans of wearing them for watching movies and working over several hours will be tested unless my ears toughen up. Come with several cords, which is also a plus

VVery good headphones for beginners
p5776
sg5
VThese are the first quality headphones that I have ever owned and they sound very good. The bass is punchy at very high levels but sounds good on lower levels. The music is clear and balanced to my ear and I am really enjoying them. I have not used them for more than two hours but I did not get tired. I think it helps that I have a small head. I have read somewhere that people with bigger heads have trouble with these.  I won't say these are the best headphones oranything because these are the first I have ever tried and owned, but the quality is definitely noticeable! I bought them for 130 on a lightning deal and I honestly would not have paid 170+ for these, specially since I was not sure what I was getting into. However, they might be worth full price if you have some disposable income.  Anyway, I highly recommend these to beginners for their portability and good sound quality, specially if found cheaper.

VIt's been said by reviewers all over but these headphones deserve most if not all the kind words its received.I used to own a pair of Bose AE2 and since I bought them at practically the same price the difference in quality is almost absurd.The only cons I really have for them is the weight and stiffness.The weight takes some extended time to get used to especially if they are your first pair of studio quality headphones. For the stiffness, it was uncomfortable to wear for about the first week but after that I was perfectly fine. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is the fact I have to buy an inline mic cable separately.

VThe overwhelming amount of good reviews on this product is what after some time led me to finally buying it. I know no technical words to write and I don't have much to compare this headphones to, so I am gonna limit myself to sharing my first impressions with this product. For the record, I come from using the Bose OE2. This purchase was meant to be an upgrade for me, since I listen to music for about 6 hours a day Monday thru Friday at work and also watch netflix on my tablet at night and listen to music at home while reading on the weekends, I thought these could be a good investment. Also for the record, all my music comes from an unlimited subscription to Google play music set on "high quality" that's about it. Now on to the product itself:My first impression was "wow! these look great! They're big! I'm gonna look like a dork! lol. That's ok"I didn't have super high expectations and I was more than willing to return these if i just felt that i didn't like them. At first i didn't think the sound was anything special. I had made a playlist containing about 50 of my favorite songs and tracks. In order to decide whether i really wanted to keep these I listened to soundtracks (like "The Da vinci Code," "The Fountain," "Gladiator," "Ratatouille," "Gladiator," "The Lord of the Rings" and "Blood Diamond") The headphones performed remarkably well. I heard things in the recordings that i had never heard before and compared to before, I could hear all tracks very, very clearly.I also listened to some Salsa music like (Grupo niche, Eddie Santiago, Orquesta Guayacan and some really old Celia Cruz recordings) Considering that most of these songs where recorded decades ago, I thought they really sounded as clear as possible and I really enjoyed them.I listened to some Mariachi music, some spanish Bulerias and Rumbas, some Michael Jackson, Regaetton, Latin music, spanish rock, and some folk and americana. They all sounded really great. I don't spend too much time listening to today's hits, but I did listen to some pop, indie rock, and R&B; and i thought they sounded great.I'll admit that at first I spent must of my time trying to find flaws and thing that could possibly be wrong with the headphones, but after a while i found myself just enjoying the music and having a good time. As far as the sound, I thought to myself "I'm gonna be keeping these!" For me it is all about being able to truly enjoy my music and to hear songs, specially classical and soundtrack with a good degree of clarity and good volume. All of which I was able to do.Comfort was another mayor issue and at first these feel very, very uncomfortable. I am a medium size woman. I felt they pressed my head hard and I expected not to be able to wear them for long. After about 2 hours I was having so much fun I totally forgot about that. They really do get comfortable with time. I think given the fact that I've never had headphones as big as these, wearing them was just a matter of getting used to them. They really did feel weird at first, but I ended up wearing them for about 4 hours at work. My ears didn't sweat and I didn't have a headache at the end.The final thing that convinced me that I was certain I wanted to keep these headphones was listening to my favorite soundtracks with exceptional clarity, the kind that in the past i didn't have and therefore I had opted to skip several songs from an album because they just sounded muddy and busy and just like a could of sounds with no real definition. All that changed with these headphones and I was able to listen to some of my favorite albums from beginning to end without skipping. That sold me completely. I couldn't do that with my Bose and I couldn't do that with the $200 Bose wireless over the ear headphones my co-worker let me try prior to buying these.Overall, I am enjoying my music and as I intended, these headphones were an upgrade for me. I don't know how these stack up next to other similar brands in the same price range or how these hold up when all technicalities are measured and I really don't care.Finally, I really hope these last. I will update on their durability if there's ever an issue. For now 4 stars.

VThis is my second pair, so obviously I like them
p5896
sg5
VThere are many other reviews you can read that go into greater detail about all the specs on these things, but this is not one of those reviews.I have a set for home (my old plain ATH-M50 which I have had for 2 years) and a set for work (this pair, the ATH-M50x). I can't really tell the difference (if any) in sound quality as the speakers are pretty much identical. I bought the M50x pair for work and wear them about 6-7 hours a day. I have a rather fat head but these are still incredibly comfortable after hours of wear.I have several points I like to make about these headphones:1 - These sound good (like really good, with all types of audio AND that sound quality does NOT seem to fade over time)2 - These headphones are very comfortable (however, you do need to wear them for a little while so that they form to your head)3 - While these are very comfortable, if your head/ears perspire (sweat), you should remove them every so often so that your ears do not become a swamp (the plastic/leather cups tend to form a rather good seal around your ears)Bottom line: I would wear these all the time if I did not have to interact with people every so often. The quality you get for the price (keep an eye on the sales too) is totally worth it.

VThese headphones are worth every penny spent. I bought myself a pair of bose oe2i at the outlet and I thought they were the best things going. They got uncomfortable after wearing them for extended periods of time. So I went on a search. I want around ear, great sounding, and comfortable headphones. Every review I looked at said the Audiotechnica ATH-M50Xs were amazing. So, I bought a pair. I have to say. They never get uncomfortable, they have the best sound quality I've heard for the price. My dad, who reviews tech like this, said he hasn't heard anything much better. And, the price point is spot on. Highly recommend getting a pair if you are thinking about these as your next purchase. Very Pleased

This Audio-Technica headset sound quality far surpasses the Mixr and is much more comfortable. This Audio-Technica headset is even better than the higher end Beats that I tried, like the Pro and Studio models (my daughter's Mixr headsets are even better than the higher end models). Furthermore, you can easily replace the ear pads on these, while this is not the case on any of the Beats headsets. Audio-Technica engineers have created a GREAT product!!

They sound nice and tight and when I plug it into my PS4 CONTROLLER and play FIFA its so clear...I can hear the "thud" from the ball every time its passed and can clearly hear the fan chants!!! O never heard all that before. Great headphones however my only gripe is the volume at times...seems if you don't have very high quality music the volume doesn't get too loud. Which is good and bad. You won't hurt your ears or blow out the headphones but when I'm at the gym I want some extra volume. Though I will say you don't hear much else when these are on your head and playing.

I am going to use these for listening to music and watching movies. They sound great, natural but still shine in treble and got that tight bass that even goes low with no distortion what so ever. These cans sound like 1000 dollar studio monitors. The great thing I can do with these is listen to music and watch movies without disturbing the neighbors. Ordered 2 pairs. I still need to get one more so I will wait until it goes on sale again, because I saw it for 99 dollars before. Will give it as a gift to a friend.

VThese are the headphones to buy under 500
p6104
sg5
VThese headphones are awesome. There exist so many in depth reviews so I will keep it short.Flat sound with incredible range. In other words, they are studio monitors capable of whatever bass your equalizer has to give.Sound quality is great and if your sound card or headphone amp can push them, they go much louder than you will be comfortable with.I use them in an office setting mostly. The sound bleeds when I really have the music going. And when I don't have them up very loud, the fit over the ear still cups out most of the sound to the point where the guys I share an office with have to visually grab my attention when they need me.I ride a motorcycle in to work making space in my bag a commodity. These fold and fit in the included bag to not take up much space in my backpack.After I bought these headphones, now my dad has a pair and two other guys at work. I would definitely recommend them.These are the headphones to buy under 500.One side note that I do find handy. I have a headphone amp with a built in mic making the M50x's good for phone calls and gaming.

I have the Limited Edition dark green variant and my friend has the blue variant, and both are absolutely beautiful and make a bold statement without looking stupid and preppy, like Beats. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who has any idea what good audio sounds like. They're even better if you have lossless audio files!

VFor the price, these are clearly the best headphones you can buy! I absolutely love the included coiled cable! It is as short as a typical earbud cord, but can expand to a crazy distance. If the coiled cable is not for you, just switch it out with the included longer or shorter cords. I use these as my daily drivers, and the clamping force that others seem to describe is not a big issue, as they seem to stretch out with use. I just wished they included a microphone cord, but I know that these are STUDIO monitors and not your typical retail gamer or recreational headphones. Also, they are capable of having bass with amps and equalizers, but without, I think they need just a tad more bass. However, do not let this stop you from getting the clearest and most elegant-sounding headphones for the price.

VFrom one audiophile to another: buy these.  Best value around.  The sound is better than anything Bose or Beats puts out at a quarter of the price.  Very balanced crisp sound; nice bass as well.  Great for anything from jazz to rock to hip hop.  Unless you are planning on using these everyday in the studio to remix the led leppelin master tapes there is no reason to buy anything else.

VEasily Listening...
p6188

VThe Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones certainly have a lofty reputation.  This is my first experience with them.  I\u2019ve previously owned a pair of Onkyo cans that have wonderful sound, but faulty cabling undercutting their desirability.  The foam on the ear cups adorning Monster\u2019s DNA Pro tears easily, so they\u2019re a nonstarter for me.  I love Grado headphones, but they\u2019re openness makes them unsuitable for use in public places, lest you want the world to know you like listening to ABBA.  Alpha Design Labs makes two headphones, the fine ADL H118 and the upscale H128 and the latter is an absolute knockout.  Still, the H128\u2019s metal design and circumference doesn\u2019t lend them to portability.  I\u2019ve finally succumbed to purchasing the ATH-M50x after reading effusive praise from both connoisseurs and laypersons.  The acclaim is well deserved.  The headphones are comfortable to wear, compact and sound splendid.  The sound is bright with mildly accentuated treble, decent midrange and good bass\u2026 but not overpowering. I\u2019d resist deeming the ATH-M50x as neutral sound due to their inherent brightness, but they clearly won\u2019t engender listener fatigue as other more dynamic cans do.  The soundstage I was hearing using lossless files was quite expansive.  The ATH-M50x also seems versatile, able to handle a variety of music genres.  The cables are proprietary, but Audio-Technica thoughtfully provided three different variations so they\u2019ve got you covered.  It\u2019s easy to see why everyone likes the Audio-Technica ATH-MX50x.  After listening to them I said to myself\u2026 what\u2019s not to like?

VExcellent headphones.  I've been using them for over a year now and they're the best headphones I've owned.  Audio is nice and clear, and balanced.  The bass isn't too heavy, so it won't block out the mids and trebles.  They're perfect for listening to any type of audio.  I use them almost exclusively and I have no complaints.  The three cords which come with them provide a nice variety depending on what you're doing with them.  The fit is amazing and I can wear them for hours on end without noticing any discomfort on my ears or head; at the same time they're not too loose either.  I use them for gaming as well and these are perfect as well; sounds are very clear and there is nothing happening in the game that the headphones can't handle.  Well worth the price and I can definitely recommend these to anyone.  However, if you are wanting something super bass heavy then you might want to look elsewhere.  They handle bass very well, but, as mentioned, it's not over-the-top and the bass doesn't overwhelm the other sounds and parts.

VAs good or better than ATH-A700
p6212
sg5
VI bought these while they were on sale because my ATH-A700s have seen better days (though those still work too).  These are as good if not slightly better in terms of audio quality.  They also block outside noise better because they fit more tightly (which some may see as a con I suppose).Despite the tighter fit and smaller cups than the ATH-A700, I was pleasantly surprised to still find these to be comfortable, though admittedly they can prove a tad annoying with glasses sometimes.  The ATH-A700s were super-comfortable and glasses-friendly and I can't rate these quite that highly on the spectrum.The variety of cables this comes with are a nice touch, though I find myself exclusively using the long cable for my purposes.

VI am not an audiophile, but i do greatly enjoy the sound these headphones make.  They seem to be pretty balanced, which is a nice change for super bass heavy beats and similar headphones. The multiple cables is great as it gives a length that is useful for many different situations.  They are also very comfortable, I have worn them for 4-6 hours at a time multiple times and have not gotten sore ears or anything from having them on

p6230

VThis was my first real quality headphone purchase, and I am so glad I chose to pick up this pair. Of course being studio monitors, they have a very balanced, even sound profile and for that reason, I really enjoy it. Many "high-end" headphones these days just don't have the clean sound profile that I want and these deliver. For such a price, these are a great value.
