AB Ideas from Randall Collins's Sociology of Philosophies are applied to
   U.S. criminology, a policy-oriented field and one case of
   differentiation out of a fragmented sociological discipline. Building on
   previous quantitative work, in-depth interviews with eight prominent
   scholars provide the empirical material. As in philosophy, vertical
   network ties are important. Yet, they may take different forms, with
   consequences for the shape of horizontal networks and the nature of
   scholarship. Comparable to philosophy, horizontal network ties provide
   social capital and opportunities for interaction rituals that generate
   collective effervescence and emotional energy. Further, the nature of
   these interactions is dependent on the changing institutional
   environment in which they are embedded. Such institutional settings,
   themselves affected by changes in the political economy, also provide
   material resources, constituting dependencies that produce mediated
   effects and, in this policy-oriented field, also direct effects on the
   nature of scholarship.

AB This article examines whether emotional fluctuations predict the
   likelihood of future attendance at a movement's week-long recruitment
   and training events. I present a statistical analysis of longitudinal
   survey data, and then examine qualitative data on multiple emotions and
   "chains" of emotions over time. Qualitative and quantitative data
   together generate a multifaceted understanding of emotions' interactions
   over time and their independent and combined ability to predict who
   returns to the events a year later. Previous work on emotions and
   movement recruitment has confined itself to whether emotional
   experiences were positive or negative or focused in depth on one
   particular emotion. This article's findings show that confusion,
   courage, fear, and hope have a substantial and sometimes interactive
   impact on attendance at subsequent events.

AB This article employs evidence from a literature within social psychology
   on the malleability of scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a
   measure that is widely used to assess implicit attitudes, and other
   implicit cognition measures, to provide a theoretical framework for
   incorporating implicit processes into sociological accounts of culture.
   Studies from this literature demonstrate the fundamentally contextual
   and interactional nature of implicit cognition; that is, how the
   cultural environment shapes the activation of cognitive associations.
   Understanding how culture works to influence behavior requires attention
   to the interaction between the cultural environment-including symbols
   and media, place, situations, and networks-and cognitive
   representations. Using this theoretical framework, I discuss how
   evidence from the sociology of culture regarding the nature of this
   cultural environment can inform our understanding of culture in action.

AB The project of merging qualitative and quantitative approaches in
   sociology is advancing on many fronts-most typically through appending
   in-depth interviews to surveys. This research note describes an
   alternative approach of amassing in-depth qualitative accounts and
   content coding them for statistical analysis. Funding requirements for
   such projects are minimal and students can easily be involved-providing
   important training opportunities that broaden their appreciation of and
   expertise in diverse methodologies. Such endeavors thus present valuable
   opportunities for advancing training and research. We illustrate how
   this approach has been applied in a project focusing on workplace
   ethnographies. We conclude with a discussion of additional bodies of
   ethnographic research similarly ripe for systematic analysis.

AB Within this paper we offer what is hopefully both a suggestive (as
   opposed to definitive) and generative (as opposed to suppressive)
   signposting of the ontological, epistemological, and methodological
   boundaries framing the putative intellectual project that is Physical
   Cultural Studies (PCS). Ground in a commitment toward engaging varied
   dimensions or expressions of active physicality, we deliberate on an
   understanding of, and approach to, the corporeal practices, discourses,
   and subjectivities through which active bodies become organized,
   represented, and experienced in relation to the operations of social
   power. Further, drawing on Toby Miller, we suggest that this approach
   requires a motivation toward progressive social change. We consider the
   political and axiological contingencies of PCS, how it is differentiated
   from the "sociology of sport," and how we may produce the type of
   knowledge that is able to intervene into the broader social world and
   make a difference. We are sure many will disagree-perhaps with good
   reason-with our assumptions. Indeed, such differences are welcomed for
   we feel that there is greater progressive potential in a field in
   tension, in healthy contestation, and, in which debates surrounding
   ontology, epistemology, political intent, method, interpretation,
   expression, and impact flow freely.

AB This article discusses how organizations can resist normative
   institutional pressures associated with the use of formally trained and
   credentialed professionals. This research draws on neoinstitutional
   theories of isomorphism and utilizes a framework of religious training
   developed by <link rid="b25">Finke and Dougherty (2002), which
   emphasizes both the social and religious capital gained during
   professionalization, to show that resistance to normative institutional
   pressures is possible. The data demonstrate that organizations which act
   to reformulate the role of religious professionals in a way which limits
   both the opportunities and ability of clergy to implement and maintain
   organizational routines and processes can successfully avoid normative
   institutional forces. This research draws on over 50 interviews and 100
   hours of fieldwork with people in the Emerging Church, a religious
   movement that has arisen in the last 25 years as a response to
   increasing distrust of institutional authority. This study helps to
   close the gap between institutional studies of organizations and the
   sociology of religion by suggesting that some, currently overlooked,
   organizational activities can be more accurately understood as
   deliberate attempts to resist institutionalizing forces.

AB The list experiment is used to detect latent beliefs when researchers
   suspect a substantial degree of social desirability bias from
   respondents. This methodology has been used in areas ranging from racial
   attitudes to political preferences. Meanwhile, social psychologists
   interested in the salience of physical attributes to social behavior
   have provided respondents with experimentally altered photographs to
   test the influence of particular visual cues or traits on social
   evaluations. This experimental research has examined the effect of skin
   blemishes, hairlessness, and particular racial attributes on
   respondents' evaluation of these photographs. While this approach
   isolates variation in particular visual characteristics from other
   visual aspects that tend to covary with the traits in question, it fails
   to adequately deal with social desirability bias. This shortcoming is
   particularly important when concerned with potentially charged visual
   cues, such as body mass index (BMI). The present article describes a
   novel experiment that combines the digital alteration of photographs
   with the list experiment approach. When tested on a nationally
   representative sample of Internet respondents, results suggest that when
   shown photographs of women, male respondents report differences in
   levels of attractiveness based on the perceived BMI of the photographed
   confederate. Overweight individuals are less likely than their normal
   weight peers to report different levels of attractiveness between
   high-BMI and low-BMI photographs. Knowing that evaluations of
   attractiveness influence labor market outcomes, the findings are
   particularly salient in a society with rising incidence of obesity.

AB A common complaint about the sociology of deviance, particularly the
   perspective known as labeling theory or the societal reaction
   perspective, is that the field is dead. However, considerable evidence
   suggests that the core themes of societal reaction work live on in
   several areas of contemporary scholarship. After identifying and
   describing three key strands of the early societal reaction perspective,
   I consider how those strands are reflected in more recent work, much of
   which does not explicitly reference the earlier tradition. I identify
   the ways that recent scholarship builds upon and yet extends the earlier
   societal reaction tradition. I close by describing three trajectories
   emerging in recent work that should focus future inquiry: the contingent
   effects of labeling, the causes of gaps between social control discourse
   and practice, and the diffusion of social control practices from
   deviants to nondeviants.

AB Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociological attention to
   understanding the roots of self-destruction has been inconsistent. hi
   this review, we use three historical periods of interest (pre-Durkheim,
   Durkheim, post-Durkheim) to organize basic findings in the body of
   sociological knowledge regarding suicide. Much of the twentieth-century
   research focused on issues of integration and regulation, imitation, and
   the social construction of suicide rates. Innovations in the
   twenty-first-century resurgence of sociological research on suicide are
   described in detail. These newer studies begin to redirect theory and
   analysis toward a focus on ethnoracial subgroups, individual-level
   phenomena (e.g., ideation), and age-period-cohort effects. Our analysis
   of sociology's contributions, limits, and possibilities leads to a
   recognition of the need to break through bifurcations in individual- and
   aggregate-level studies, to pursue the translation of Durkheim's
   original theory into a network perspective as one avenue of guiding
   micro-macro research, and to attend to the complexity in both
   multidisciplinary explanations and pragmatic interventions.

AB Sociologists have developed a wide range of pedagogical strategies to
   facilitate student learning about racial/ethnic, class, and gender
   inequalities. Despite the growing subdiscipline of the sociology of the
   body and evidence pointing to the prevalence of inequalities based on
   physical attractiveness, the pedagogical literature has yet to develop
   strategies for teaching students about biases based on physical
   attractiveness. In this article, the authors report on a pedagogical
   module that involves student evaluations of photographs (depicting
   individuals ranging in levels of physical attractiveness) using semantic
   differential scales, and discuss the results of this evaluation. The
   authors test for student learning outcomes through (1) a one-group
   pretest-posttest design and (2) an assessment survey with both
   qualitative and quantitative components. Because this photograph
   evaluation typically illustrates students' beauty biases, a discussion
   of these results, paired with relevant readings, provides a powerful
   tool for the exchange of ideas about physical attractiveness biases.

   of pre- and posttests, the authors demonstrate how CBR can help students
   gain a better command of the research process and enhance student
   attitudes toward community service. After participating in CBR, the

AB Research into environmental concern and behavior has been extensive in
   the past few decades. The connection between the two, as well as other
   related variables, has however remained somewhat elusive. This study
   attempts to refine our understanding of how concern for the environment
   is related to pro-environmental behavior such as buying ecologically
   friendly products, driving less, conserving resources at home,
   recycling, etc., by considering the role played by social structural
   context and self-efficacy. Furthermore, through principle component
   analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is
   identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social
   structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators
   of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental
   behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the
   availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to
   additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling.

AB In contrast to the antistructuralist and antipositivist agenda that has
   animated the "narrative turn" in the social sciences since the 1980s, a
   more uniquely sociological approach has studied stories in the
   interactional, institutional, and political contexts of their telling.
   Scholars working in this vein have seen narrative as powerful, but as
   variably so, and they have focused on the ways in which narrative
   competence is socially organized and unevenly distributed. We show how
   this approach, or cluster of approaches, rooted variously in
   conversational analysis, symbolic interactionism, network analysis, and
   structuralist cultural sociologies, has both responded to problems
   associated with the narrative turn and shed light on enduring
   sociological questions such as the bases of institutional authority, how
   inequalities are maintained and reproduced, why political challengers
   are sometimes able to win support, and the cultural foundations of
   self-interest and instrumental rationality.

AB Sociological theories about the political economy of the environment
   have appeared in two waves. The first wave has a productivist
   orientation, showing how the normal workings of industrial production
   damage the environment. It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT),
   the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource
   extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of
   theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements
   that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest
   over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist
   policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate
   environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged
   and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and
   sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded,
   articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns.
   Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of
   first- and second-wave theories. This theoretical focus may shift toward
   the political economy of disasters as climate change intensifies.

AB The economic crisis of 2008-2010 stimulated an already growing
   sociological interest in finance. Before the crisis, disintermediation
   and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as
   bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to
   originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size
   and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed
   financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital
   market integration and liberalization created greater global
   interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered
   their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and
   overall exposure to the stock market. Research reveals the importance of
   politics for many financial market developments, various implications
   for corporate governance, the continuing significance of social factors
   within finance, and the role of theoretical and material devices in
   shaping financial practices. Key directions for future research focus on
   finance in relation to social inequality, informal sectors, valuation,
   and social networks.

AB The American conservative movement that began to gain steam in the
   post-World War II era had, by the 1980s, emerged as a transformative
   political force in the United States and the world. Yet sociology has
   been slower than other disciplines to come to grips with conservatism.
   In the hope of spurring more research, we review the substantial
   literature on the conservative movement produced by historians,
   political scientists, and serious journalists since the mid-1990s, along
   with the more limited number of sociological contributions. After
   identifying what we see as a promising approach for conceptualizing
   conservatism, we illustrate the benefits of sociological engagement by
   showing how three areas of sociology that might at first glance seem
   disconnected from the movement the-sociology of intellectuals, theories
   of social change, and scholarship on stratification-could profit from
   consideration of the conservative case.

AB Sociology is poised to greatly enhance our collective understanding of
   the various sustainability challenges facing the world today To
   contribute to this endeavor the authors conduct panel analyses of the
   per capita ecological footprints of nations to evaluate multiple
   theoretical traditions within environmental sociology and its sister
   approaches Findings indicate that the consumption-based environmental
   impacts of nations are tied to economic development urban population,
   militarization, and the structure of international trade Ecological
   conditions in the context of climate and biogeography also prove to
   partially shape the environmental harms of human activities Ultimately
   this research suggests that political-economic factors, ecological
   milieu and structural associations between nations all influence
   society/nature relationships Considering the globally unsustainable
   levels of resource consumption and concomitant increases in pollution
   for a growing number of nations throughout the world the authors contend
   that theoretically inclusive and methodologically rigorous
   investigations on such topics should be more central to the discipline

   investigate the consequences of organizational de-coupling from an
   inward-looking within organizational perspective Specifically we study
   how the de-coupling of flexible work program affects workers
   actualization of productivity Our data analysis suggests that the
   organizational de-coupling in which organizations only ceremonially
   adopt flexible work program without making it available to all workers,
   is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were
   bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of
   productivity actualization is associated with workers who enjoy a
   factual flexible work schedule which is nevertheless not formally
   adopted by the employer The implications of the findings are discussed

AB This article introduces a sociology role-playing game (RPG) used to
   demonstrate the broad range of social forces, institutions, and
   structures in a semester-long series of in-class and homework
   assignments. RPGs and other simulation games have been frequently
   suggested as a useful teaching methodology because of their unique
   ability to allow students to observe and analyze society from a new
   perspective; however, most games are limited in scope. We present a game
   that is based on a clearly articulated theoretical foundation, reflects
   contemporary American demographics, and recreates the full breadth of
   social structures and relationships. The result is a robust teaching
   tool that develops critical thinking skills, encourages the sociological
   imagination, and is applicable to a wide range of classes and topics.
   Informal student feedback and student evaluations indicate that students
   enjoy the game, that it aids students in understanding sociological
   concepts, and that it encourages social critique beyond the classroom.

AB P>The current call for public scholarship and community engagement by
   universities and disciplinary organizations has created opportunities to
   develop innovative ways to integrate research, instruction, and
   outreach. This article discusses a collaboration among scholars at the
   University of Kentucky and alternative agrifood movement organizations
   that has evolved as they pursue an alternative agrifood system in
   Kentucky. This collaboration made instructional programs in sociology
   and the honors world food issues track places in which both students and
   instructors can examine "problems" of the conventional agrifood system,
   conduct research, and develop collaborative relationships with community
   activists. We draw on Burawoy's discussion of public sociology and its
   interface with professional, critical, and policy sociologies.
   Supplementing our discussion with literature from social movements and
   science studies, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can render
   sociological knowledge and skills useful as critical support of
   alternative agrifood movements. We argue that the "experiential
   classroom" is an excellent site for the critical examination within the
   agrifood movements of oppositional culture. This, in turn, makes
   possible students' recognition of injustice in the existing agrifood
   system.

   trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific
   community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that?
   We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific
   contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box
   imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that
   as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall
   network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now
   considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the
   non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to
   currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular
   phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting
   meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a
   niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a
   typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en
   route to consensus.

   sociology has tended to see this work as the exercise of tacit or
   embodied knowledge, curatorial knowledge and plans may be elaborated and
   altered by the situated actions of exhibition installation. While
   curators know a successful installation "when they see it," this depends
   on the indexical particularities of artworks and environments which
   cannot be predicted in advance. In demonstrating the practical ways in
   which culture is mobilized in situations of object (inter) action, this
   paper emphasizes the "making" in artistic meaning-making.

AB Culture has long shaped individuals' response to problems. A classic
   puzzle in the sociology of health and illness is discrepancy between
   theory and research regarding cultural beliefs and medical care service
   use. "Utilization research," examining individuals' responses to the
   onset of health problems, has not consistently found an effect of
   culture on the uptake of formal treatment. While ethnographic research
   often describes how culture shapes illness behaviors, survey-based
   studies rarely find significant effects of predispositions once "need"
   is controlled. In quantitative studies, individuals report supportive
   treatment beliefs or predispositions to use services but low utilization
   levels, reinforcing claims about lack of utility of cultural ideologies
   in health-care decision making. We ask whether innovations in the
   sociology of culture and cognition provide the theoretical scaffolding
   to conceptualize and measure culture in health service utilization.
   Examining data from the General Social Survey, we focus on how different
   approaches to culture might explain the paradox of high cultural
   predispositions and low actual use. Children with mental health problems
   provide a comparison between suggestions and endorsements. Suggestions,
   sources of care offered by individuals in response to a case description
   without any other social cues, align with new cultural approaches, and
   are measured by responses to open-ended questions about what should be
   done for the child described (meeting clinical criteria for ADHD, major
   depression, asthma, or "daily troubles"). Endorsements, requiring less
   cognitive work and cultural resistance, align with traditional
   conceptualizations of culture, and are measured by closed-ended
   questions that ask respondents to agree or disagree with seeking help
   from different treatment options placed later in the survey. We find
   that suggestions reveal cultural predispositions to use services
   corresponding closely to reported utilization levels; endorsements
   reveal high, unrealistic cultural predispositions to use services.
   Further, suggestions are associated with sociodemographics that proxy
   culture (e.g., race), while endorsements are associated only with
   perceived need.

AB Despite sociology's longstanding interest in inequality, the
   internalization of racial oppression among the racially subordinated and
   its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been
   largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently,
   internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood
   components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by
   defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and
   the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the
   concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on
   critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a
   theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism,
   and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by
   offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance
   concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression.

AB Sociology requires a robust theory of how local circumstances create
   social order. When we analyze social structures not recognizing that
   they depend on groups with collective pasts and futures that are
   spatially situated and that are based on personal relations, we avoid a
   core sociological dimension: the importance of local context in
   constituting social worlds. Too often this has been the sociological
   stance, both in micro-sociological studies that examine interaction as
   untethered from local traditions and in research that treats culture as
   autonomous from action and choice. Building on theories of action, group
   dynamics, and micro-cultures, I argue that a sociology of the local
   solves critical theoretical problems. The local is a stage on which
   social order gets produced and a lens for understanding how particular
   forms of action are selected. Treating ethnographic studies as readings
   of ongoing cultures, I examine how the continuing and referential
   features of group life (spatial arenas, relations, shared pasts)
   generate action and argue that local practices provide the basis for
   cultural extension, influencing societal expectations through the
   linkages among groups.

   simply as an ascetic ethos but in broader terms of the cult of
   individualism, I demonstrate that the Soviet party-state promoted ideas
   and values of individuality, self-expression, and pleasure seeking in
   the areas of work and consumption. By broadening our conception of the
   spirit of capitalism, tracing the formation of capitalist dispositions
   as well as institutions, and showing that the culture of capitalism can
   come from within the old regime, I further the agenda of neoclassical
   sociology of studying varieties of origins, paths, and destinations of

AB This article investigates structural sources of earnings losses in the
   U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and
   Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations
   Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model
   of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market
   between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that
   industry of employment represents a salient partition of the
   distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the
   current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were
   displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings
   losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment
   in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed
   determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that
   displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses
   in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch
   industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage
   industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those
   who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be
   explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs
   from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are
   re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural
   theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which
   represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic
   skill-based accounts of earnings differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   the sacred and profane binaries that structure meaning even in

   totemism, it also reflects the eschatological hopes for salvation that

   they attempted to introduce several important innovations in their

   Social Paradigm (DSP) and indicators of neighborhood environmental
   quality. Using face-to-face interviews with probability samples surveys
   of residents in the Beijing and Detroit metropolitan areas, the study
   also determined, from open-ended questions, people's understandings of
   'the environment' and 'economic growth' and the priority trade-offs
   between them that are often implied and debated. The analyses found
   striking similarities as well as differences in the two metropolitan
   areas.

   implications for conceptualizing states. To examine this possibility the
   authors look through the lens of actor-network theory (ANT) and in doing
   so articulate a relationship between two models of the state in the
   literature. They find that an 'actor model' of the state is accepted by
   many scholars, few of whom develop 'network models' of the state. In
   response, this study introduces an actor-network model and proposes that
   its contribution to state theory is in rethinking the character of
   modern states to be the outcome of actually performed assemblages of all
   those practices of building it, protecting it, governing it and
   theorizing about it.

AB Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located
   stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC).
   Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that
   Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor,
   unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a
   shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper
   examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of
   176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the
   US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are
   disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with
   a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three
   further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First,
   findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and

AB At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative,
   based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The
   article highlights the structural features of narrative-basically, the
   organization of the genre around the semantic template
   actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but
   where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the
   verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet,
   such as time and space of action-and shows how to implement this
   structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological
   tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism,
   1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An
   Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color
   circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from
   Newton to Goethe-and the quality versus quantity debate-to Goethe and
   Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.

AB In this article, I attempt to address some enduring problems in
   formulation and practical use of the notion of structure in contemporary
   social science. I begin by revisiting the question of the fidelity of
   Anthony Giddens' appropriation of the idea of structure with respect to
   Levi-Strauss. This requires a reconsideration of Levi-Strauss' original
   conceptualization of "social structure" which I argue is a sort of
   "methodological structuralism" that stands sharply opposed to Giddens'
   ontological reconceptualization of the notion. I go on to show that
   Bourdieu's contemporaneous critique of Levi-Strauss is best understood
   as an attempt to recover rather than reject the central implication of
   Levi-Strauss' methodological structuralism, which puts Bourdieu and
   Giddens on clearly distinct camps in terms of their approach toward the
   idea of structure. To demonstrate the-insurmountable-conceptual
   difficulties inherent in the ontological approach, I proceed by
   critically examining what I consider to be the most influential attempt
   to resolve the ambiguities in Giddens structuration theory: Sewell's
   argument for the "duality of structure." I show that by retaining
   Giddens' ontological focus, Sewell ends up with a notion of structure
   that is at its very core "anti-structuralist" or only structuralist in a
   weak sense. I close by considering the implications of the analysis for
   the possibility of developing the rather neglected "methodological
   structuralist" legacy in contemporary social analysis.

   prepare their students for a more interdependent world. While sociology
   has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to
   implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus
   on what ''internationalizing'' or ''globalizing'' the classroom actually
   means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose
   of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of
   internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest
   teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of
   teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology
   courses-Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and
   Migration in a Global Context-are used to illustrate how a more
   systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve
   course design.

   majors from the class of 2005, following them from senior year into
   careers or graduate school. The first part of this article provides a
   context for the results from the What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree
   in Sociology? study and a summary of its key findings. Wave I data
   demonstrate strong student interest in sociological concepts, perceived
   mastery of some research skills but not others, and general satisfaction
   with the major. Sociology majors are both idealists and careerists. The
   majority expects to enter the job market after graduation but is not
   satisfied with the career advising they receive. Key findings from Wave
   II demonstrate that more respondents go directly into the job market
   than expected, job search strategies are important in finding a job that
   matches what students learned in their sociology programs, and those who
   find such jobs are more satisfied with the major. The second part
   discusses how the survey findings can be used to enhance curriculum,
   advising, and assessment without vocationalizing the curriculum and
   without adding extra burdens to faculty members' already heavy
   schedules. Finally, the article discusses how the data can be used as a
   baseline for department assessment.

AB Although social status plays a crucial role in the generation and
   maintenance of social inequalities, how status processes operate in
   naturalistic social contexts remains less clear. In the following
   article, I provide a case study of doormen-individuals who
   simultaneously represent status experts and status judges-at a highly
   exclusive nightclub to investigate how people draw status distinctions
   in micro-social settings. Using interview and ethnographic data, I
   analyze on what bases doormen evaluate the relative worth of patrons and
   confer the status prize of admission. I find that in making such
   decisions, doormen drew from a constellation of competence and esteem
   cues, which were informed by contextually specific status schemas about
   the relative material, moral, and symbolic worth of particular client
   groups. Moreover, the ways in which doormen used these cues and schema
   depended on the identity of the specific patron being evaluated. As
   such, I argue that processes of interpersonal evaluation and status
   conferral are contextually specific, culturally embedded, and
   interpersonally variable. Despite such variations, a patron's perceived
   social connections seemed to outweigh other types of cues in admissions
   decisions. I conclude by discussing these findings in light of both
   status characteristics theory and Bourdieu's work on the
   transubstantiation of capital to suggest that social capital is a
   powerful status cue that can, under certain conditions, be a more potent
   source of social distinction and status advantage, or hold a greater
   conversion value, in systems of stratification than other types of
   qualities.

AB How do activists create cultural change? Scholars have investigated the
   development and maintenance of collective identities as one avenue for
   cultural change, but to understand how activists foster change beyond
   their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for
   changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look
   at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals
   and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural
   changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with
   animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on
   research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main
   strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as
   well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries
   through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross
   boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study
   contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural
   changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a
   useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and
   maintenance in the sociology of culture.

AB Following up on Zirin's (2008)challenge that sports sociologists "get
   off the bench," and Karen and Washington's (2001) plea to make sports
   sociology more central to analyses of social power, this article
   empirically reviews and assesses the sociology of sports from 1977-2008.
   Using a sample of 441 articles selected from the three major sports
   sociology journals during that period, we conclude that sports sociology
   exhibits a strong and increasing bias toward micro-level analyses of
   (for example) how the content of sports frames and constructs the social
   world. A smaller and shrinking body of work examines more macro-oriented
   issues such as the economics and politics of sports, and there seem to
   be few attempts to meaningfully synthesize these micro and macro
   orientations. We think this partiality toward micro-oriented frameworks
   is rooted in factors unique to sports sociology while also reflecting
   larger trends within sociology as a whole. As advocates of popularly
   accessible public sociology, we respectfully suggest that sports
   sociologists try harder to weave macro analyses into their work, not
   necessarily replacing micro-level approaches, but complementing them. We
   believe that sports sociology is well-positioned to become a standard
   bearer for public sociology, but only if it pays more attention to the
   way organized sports intertwines with the organizational, political, and
   economic forces that perpetuate and exacerbate social inequality.

   then offer a brief theorization of the social world through the "lens"

   women constitute the majority of religious consumers, the majority of
   the religions produced in the American religious marketplace favor men's
   interests relative to women's. Three modifications to the religious
   economies model are suggested to account for this contradiction. The
   first modification is a respecification of "religious capital" that
   takes into account unequal distributions of power among producers of
   religious value and their differential effects on the beneficiaries and
   targets of religious norms. The second modification theorizes religion's
   linkages to other social institutions as sources of cost and benefit
   that are taken into account by religious entrepreneurs. The third
   modification accounts for status-based discrimination and unequal
   distributions of capital as sources of constraint that influence the
   production of religious supply. Several directions for future research
   are proposed.

AB The diversity of contemporary "capitalisms" underscores the need to
   supplant the amorphous concept of structure with more precise concepts,
   particularly institutions and networks. All institutions entail both
   embodied and relational aspects. Institutions are relational insofar as
   they map obligatory patterns of "getting by and getting
   along"-institutional orders-that steer stable social fields over time.
   Institutions are simultaneously embodied as institutional paradigms,
   part of a larger bodily agency Pierre Bourdieu called habitus.
   Institutions are in turn tightly coupled to networks between various
   people based on, but not reducible to, strategic interests. Yet social
   interaction sometimes exceeds institutional boundaries, giving rise to
   disjunctive fields and underscoring the prominence of institutional
   failures in the unfolding of antagonistic relations such as warfare.
   Such disjunctive fields can be tracked in relation to some transnational
   networks at the global level without assuming developmental convergence.
   This last point underscores the meaning of neoclassical sociology, which
   eschews assumptions of developmental convergence at the global level.

   of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories
   that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in
   light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change:
   first, the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of
   moments of breaks and ruptures. Along the way, I develop an argument
   about the conditions of emergence of self-limiting norms and the
   centrality of epistemic beliefs in situations of high disruption.

AB This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes
   on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council.
   Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses
   demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of
   religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is
   important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood
   only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social
   environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which
   we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests
   and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions'
   legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice
   theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the
   population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold
   firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational
   field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts
   firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.

AB Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory
   expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative
   experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and
   others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these
   opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a
   key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of
   an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We
   connect different strands of theory and research in the social
   psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between
   occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from
   the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are
   consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two
   opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to
   experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's
   macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.

AB Quantitative and computer literacy are increasingly recognized as core
   components of a liberal education in sociology. This study draws on
   student, faculty, and alumni questionnaires to identify the kinds of
   quantitative literacy skills that are perceived to be most critical for
   students enrolled in sociology courses. Respondents at Lehman College
   highlighted the need for proficiencies in a number of key areas,
   including (a) basic mathematical and statistical skills, such as
   measures of central tendency, ratios, and percentages; (b) the
   presentation and interpretation of quantitative data, including tables
   and charts; (c) the research process, such as developing hypotheses,
   sampling, and interpreting data; and (d) computer-based presentation and
   data analysis, including the use of software programs such as SPSS and
   Excel. Moreover, hands-on work in data analysis was highly valued by all
   respondents, particularly as a strategy for mastering these skills. This
   study suggests that effective education in quantitative literacy
   requires both (a) the removal of barriers to the incorporation of data
   analysis in sociology courses and (b) a well-sequenced sociology
   curriculum that pinpoints specific quantitative and computer literacy
   learning objectives at multiple course levels.

AB P>How people respond to questions involving the environment depends
   partly on individual characteristics. Characteristics such as age,
   gender, education, and ideology constitute the well-studied "social
   bases of environmental concern," which have been explained in terms of
   cohort effects or of cognitive and cultural factors related to social
   position. It seems likely that people's environmental views depend not
   only on personal characteristics but also on their social and physical
   environments. This hypothesis has been more difficult to test, however.
   Using data from surveys in 19 rural U.S. counties, we apply
   mixed-effects modeling to investigate simple place effects with respect
   to locally focused environmental views. We find evidence for two kinds
   of place effects. Net of individual characteristics, specific place
   characteristics have the expected effect on related environmental views.
   Local changes are related to attitudes about regulation and growth. For
   example, respondents more often perceive rapid development as a problem,
   and favor environmental rules that restrict development, in rural
   counties with growing populations. Moreover, they favor conserving
   resources for the future rather than using them now to create jobs in
   counties that have low unemployment. After we controlled for county
   growth, unemployment and jobs in resource-based industries, and
   individual social-position and ideological factors, there remains
   significant place-to-place variation in mean levels of environmental
   concern. Even with both kinds of place effects in the models, the
   individual-level predictors of environmental concern follow patterns
   expected from previous research. Concern increases with education among
   Democrats, whereas among Republicans, the relationship is attenuated or
   reversed. The interaction marks reframing of environmental questions as
   political wedge issues, through nominally scientific counterarguments
   aimed at educated, ideologically receptive audiences.

AB A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental
   health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a
   number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women
   have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively
   experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from
   the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and
   persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and
   (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are
   involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data
   from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two
   hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent
   anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss
   the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of
   social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between
   them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future
   theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.

   Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a
   rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from
   the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce
   mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of
   religiosity have a strong impact on giving.

AB Most sociological research assumes that social network composition
   shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not
   adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect
   network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of
   culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this
   article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in
   network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the
   influence of other structural factors, including prior network
   composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little
   evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping
   worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play
   an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the
   dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be

AB In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some
   members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to
   save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely
   together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors-killing
   on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such
   cases-where the same individuals kill and rescue-and discusses their
   relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and
   individualistic theories of killing and rescuing-which explain these
   behaviors with the properties of groups or persons-are inadequate in
   accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995,
   2000)strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell,
   2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals
   during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different
   structures-killing where there is social distance and rescuing where
   there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory
   behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close.
   One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory
   power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme
   variations in individual behavior.

AB There is rarely an introductory text in sociology that does not begin
   with C. Wright Mills's (1967)distinction between personal troubles and
   structural or public issues. To lack sociological imagination is to
   confuse between these two levels of analysis in trying to explain public
   issues in terms of personal troubles, or history in terms of the
   individual's biography. "Troubles occur within the character of the
   individual and within the range of his immediate relations with others;
   Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments
   of the individual and the range of his inner life" (Mills, 1967:8).
   Issues are generated in response to the dynamics of the social system
   and unfold within the larger structural and historical contexts where
   the character of the individual takes shape. Yet, the most popular
   explanation of the contemporary financial crisis with its disastrous
   social and economic consequences is personal greed. It is the greedy
   investment bankers, corrupt politicians, and unscrupulous lobbyists who
   are to take the brunt of the current economic meltdown in the United
   States. A few bad apples on Wall Street have created havoc on Main
   Street. Here, one may argue that greed that-if not kept in check-which
   seems to afflict almost everyone, transcending social class and status
   boundaries, may be a public issue-a structural problem-rather than a
   problem within the character of the individual. Not to be greedy within
   the contemporary social and economic system may be considered
   pathological, an instance of personal trouble.

AB Despite increasing interest in gendered sexuality over the life course,
   a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual
   life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology,
   feminist theory, and sexuality studies, has yet to be elaborated. The
   model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result
   from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and
   disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts,
   within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive
   sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences
   and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine.
   Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de)
   coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps
   explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among
   individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying
   lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests
   improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models,
   and the sexual scripting approach.

   The concept of "emotive performance" is developed to highlight the
   overlooked quality of performativity in the social use of emotion. We
   argue that emotive performance is reflexive, cultural, and
   communicative. As an active social act, emotive performance draws from
   the cultural repertoire of interpretative frameworks and dominant
   narratives. We illustrate the utility of the concept by analyzing two
   episodes of unrehearsed emotive performances by two well-known
   politicians, Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin. The two cases demonstrate how
   emotion can be analyzed as a domain in which culturally specific
   narratives and rhetorics are used to advance the situational agenda of
   actors. The concept opens up a more expansive research agenda for
   sociology. It pushes sociologists to pay greater attention to people's

   excessive pay increases for even relatively few CEOs a year spread to

   Counterfactual simulation based on Standard and Poor's ExecuComp data

AB Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical
   work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative
   consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth
   outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have
   documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the
   macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with
   delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among
   adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between
   mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing
   differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for
   delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue.
   Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the
   most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes
   that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem
   behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential
   and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and
   substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both
   observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and
   delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future
   research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the
   mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the
   realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound
   transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the
   international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home,
   the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal
   bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show
   that World War II mobilization played an important role. First,
   Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent
   military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft
   manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing
   intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered
   significantly greater losses where both non-white population and
   aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate
   accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and
   path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years
   left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare
   reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall
   of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we
   demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies
   undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This
   intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an
   inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social
   welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and
   abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.

AB The teaching and learning movement in sociology in general and within
   the American Sociological Association specifically has a surprisingly
   long history. This history can be divided into three periods of
   activity: early efforts (1905 to 1960), innovation and implementation
   (1960 to 1980), and the institutionalization of gains (1980 to 2009).
   Beginning in the first period, sociologists interested in teaching and
   learning focused cycles of attention on the introductory sociology
   course in higher education, high school sociology courses, and the
   formation of sections within the American Sociological Association. Hans
   Mauksch led a period of significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Many of those gains were then institutionalized under the leadership of
   Carla Howery beginning in the 1980s. Publication related to teaching and
   learning, which was once spread throughout numerous outlets has, over
   time, become focused in Teaching Sociology. This article presents an
   investigation of the past and present of the teaching and learning
   movement in sociology and offers some suggested direction for the
   movement's future.

   methodology and the completion of actual research projects. The goal was
   to develop a multilevel team approach within which faculty, graduate
   students, and undergraduates would view their work as part of a
   connected project. The authors describe the three central components of
   the multilevel approach: a newly required research seminar for graduate
   students, an approach to teaching research methods in a joint seminar of
   graduate and undergraduate students, and an approach to teaching
   undergraduate research methods that includes having graduate students
   model research techniques for undergraduates. The authors then assess
   each of these components based on course evaluations and additional data
   gathered from participants. The authors conclude with a series of
   suggestions about how this model might be expanded and developed further
   in their own and other institutional contexts.

   proceeds in four sections. The first section provides an overview of
   service learning and its benefits. This is followed by a detailed
   description of the service-learning project. In the third section, the
   author draws from a postclass survey, course evaluations, and her
   observations to illustrate the ways in which the project enhances

   impressions about people with AIDS. Multimethod, active learning
   processes were utilized to introduce the sociological imagination,
   critical thinking, and theory and methods in sociology. The intent was
   to apply basic sociological knowledge to a real-world issue, HIV/AIDS in
   a global perspective. In the process of developing basic skills in
   sociology, a consistent change was noted in students' self-reported
   impressions about people with AIDS in each of four semesters (N = 160).
   Catastrophic contagion characterized their impressions at the beginning
   of the semester; humanizing attributes (encouragement and empowerment)
   replaced catastrophic contagion at the end of the semester. Implications
   of these findings for teaching and learning, and deconstructing HIV/AIDS
   stigma, are discussed.

   present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of

   might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and
   communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global

AB P>The effects of highways on transforming human society and promoting
   population change have been investigated in several disciplines,
   including geography, sociology, economics, and planning. Currently, the
   primary highway construction activity in the nation is highway
   expansion; however, this expansion has not been the focus of much of the
   existing literature. This research examines the role that highway
   expansion plays in the process of population change. Specifically, this
   research proposes an integrated spatial regression approach to study the
   impacts of highway expansion on population change in the 1980s and 1990s
   in Wisconsin at the minor civil division level. The integrated approach
   thoroughly considers the factors that influence population change,
   appropriately examines the spatial variations of their impacts,
   simultaneously incorporates spatial lag and spatial error dependence,
   and systematically selects the optimal neighborhood structure. The
   findings suggest that the impacts of highway expansion on population
   change differ across rural, suburban, and urban areas: There are only
   indirect effects in rural areas, both direct and indirect effects in
   suburban areas, and no statistically significant effects in urban areas.
   Overall, highway expansion serves as a facilitator of population change
   within the framework of growth pole theory and location theory.

   re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in

   of regional identification in more recent time periods. These findings

   in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic
   characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with
   the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data,

AB The nature of social cognition-how we "know about" the social world-is
   one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we
   know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it.
   Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely,
   what we will call "political ideology"-that is, people's self-placement
   on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We
   focus on that understanding that is in some ways the "ur-form" of social
   cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social
   formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these
   self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the
   development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is,
   when citizens develop such a "political ideology," what does this mean,
   and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their
   subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by
   using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a
   hypothetical policy.

AB Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century
   U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy,
   scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds
   significance for different populations with competing political agendas
   (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of
   community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as
   naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape
   the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute
   sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of
   community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic
   political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and
   around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze
   how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might
   provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first
   explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking
   both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely
   characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary
   sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct
   or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the
   construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of
   class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race.
   Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance
   of these developments.

AB The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational
   sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30
   years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and
   develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths
   become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens
   when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as
   "accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh?
   Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide
   answers and reveal "recoupling'' processes through which institutional
   myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected
   become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling
   accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that
   teachers labeled "turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of
   the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by
   "inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities,
   social interactions, and meaning-making processes.

   then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core
   sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of
   Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in
   many academic fields, especially health research and education;
   Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of
   politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion
   dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing
   surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates,
   increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and
   the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is
   increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative
   data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations,
   Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent
   and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet
   surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data,
   and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of
   participation in stigmatized Internet research and actively engage in
   the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the
   utility and validity of Internet-based data collection.

   matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and
   culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods & Research. The
   debate triggered a "second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new
   technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors
   bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected
   advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually
   contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in
   less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling
   the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that "anybody who
   believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to
   social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much
   surprised'' (p. 75).

AB Standards and standardization aim to render the world equivalent across
   cultures, time, and geography. Standards are ubiquitous but
   underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in
   modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works.
   Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse
   theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the
   emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of
   making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple
   outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with
   totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for
   careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences
   of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.

AB This review suggests that the sociology of intellectuals is being
   converted into a sociology of interventions, i.e., instead of focusing
   on a certain social type, it analyzes the movement by which knowledge
   and expertise are mobilized to inform a value-laden intervention in the
   public sphere. We first demonstrate that the classical sociology of
   intellectuals was centered on a problematic of allegiance that no longer
   seems productive. In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular
   social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into
   the public sphere. We then review two literatures that distance
   themselves from the classical problematic and that could be integrated
   under the common rubric of a sociology of interventions: The first
   literature analyzes intellectual fields and markets. It moves away from
   the sociology of intellectuals by multiplying the relevant actors and
   depersonalizing the term "intellectual" so that it no longer stands for
   a social type but for the capacity to make a public intervention, a
   capacity to which many different actors lay claim. The second literature
   analyzes the public deployment of expertise. It multiplies not simply
   the actors laying claim to the mantle of the intellectual, but the
   formats and modes of intervention itself, i.e., the different ways in
   which knowledge and expertise can be inserted into the public sphere.

   decades. While its proponents are well aware of this field's
   contributions and relevance, we focus here on demonstrating its merit to
   the broader sociological community. We do so by addressing the following
   questions: What is music, sociologically speaking? How do individuals
   and groups use music? How is the collective production of music made
   possible? How does music relate to broader social distinctions,
   especially class, race, and gender? Answering these questions reveals
   that music provides an important and engaging purchase on topics that
   are of great concern to sociologists of all stripes-topics that range
   from the microfoundations of interaction to the macro-level dynamics of
   inequality.

AB A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social
   network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the
   relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising
   recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison,
   critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques
   for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to
   classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same
   time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as
   providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as
   a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a
   new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis
   that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of
   "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the
   cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly
   permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social
   networks.

AB While much of economic sociology focuses on the stabilizing aspects of
   markets, the social movement perspective emphasizes the role that
   contentiousness plays in bringing institutional change and innovation to
   markets. Markets are inherently political, both because of their ties to
   the regulatory functions of the state and because markets are contested
   by actors who are dissatisfied with market outcomes and who use the
   market as a platform for social change. Research in this area focuses on
   the pathways to market change pursued by social movements, including
   direct challenges to corporations, the institutionalization of systems
   of private regulation, and the creation of new market categories through
   institutional entrepreneurship. Much contentiousness, while initially
   disruptive, works within the market system by producing innovation and
   restraining capitalism from destroying the resources it depends on for
   survival.

AB The inverse relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and
   unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and poor
   nutrition have been well demonstrated empirically but encompass diverse
   underlying causal mechanisms. These mechanisms have special theoretical
   importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities
   in many other components of health, involve something more than the
   ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of
   broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we
   classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet,
   and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that
   specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear
   support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES
   disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies
   that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.

AB Preferences for the racial neighborhood composition differ significantly
   between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of
   Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica,
   CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if
   mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently
   published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social
   distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations
   using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30,
   185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this
   process empirically through a case study of a university housing system
   that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation
   between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the
   larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep
   roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact,
   residence assignment procedures are completely "color-blind." Thus a
   college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of
   preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks
   continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing
   applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to
   halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that
   percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for
   black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist
   preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect
   is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference
   has important consequences for the residential separation process. (C)

   inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status
   hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of
   Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor
   model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on
   perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute
   homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the
   single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This
   allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the
   individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the
   propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four
   waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally
   support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality,

   in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   of religious affiliation. Along with control variables, we include
   attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender
   equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual
   relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes
   within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether
   variations emerge and whether they are nested within specific issues,

   present an interactive framework that considers not only how the broader

   they responded by actively reshaping their environment. I apply this
   framework to the Chinese community's initial use of litigation and their
   move towards tactics of subterfuge in response to changes in Chinese

   that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an
   abundance of civic institutions, and civically engaged citizens should
   exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand,
   recent writings exposing a potential "dark side'' of social capital
   suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties.
   Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S.
   counties, the current analysis examines these competing hypotheses
   regarding the effects of civic community. Results suggest mixed support
   for both the traditional and "dark side'' predictions. Implications for

AB Because lecture-based teaching limits student learning, many instructors
   are interested in pedagogical strategies that support critical thinking,
   student participation, and group discussion in large classrooms.
   Audience response systems, or "clickers," are an emerging tool for
   addressing this problem, but predominant pedagogical models for clicker
   use developed in the natural sciences often do not encourage the
   "inquiry-guided learning" that is useful in sociology. This article
   introduces readers to clicker technology and outlines a new pedagogical
   model for clicker use designed to address sociological learning goals,
   including critical thinking, applications of concepts to real-life
   experiences, and critiques of sociological methods. The authors discuss
   the effects of clickers for classroom interaction and students'
   experiences in three undergraduate sociology courses, using quantitative
   and qualitative data about students' perceptions of the effects of this
   pedagogical model on learning. The results suggest that the model
   positively affects participation, critical thinking, and classroom
   interaction dynamics. The authors conclude with practical suggestions
   for instructors considering implementing clickers; in sociology courses.

AB Recently, a growing contingent of "evolutionary sociologists" has begun
   to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from
   evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of
   sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of
   either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers
   and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with
   research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences.
   These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new
   opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's
   relevance to sociology. In this article, the authors review key issues
   pertaining to evolutionary explanations of social behavior, offer
   clarifications and explanations of several issues that are sometimes
   misrepresented and misunderstood, and provide specific suggestions for
   instructors who are interested in updating and improving the quality of
   instruction on this important topic.

AB Historical reversals highlight a basic methodological problem: is it
   possible to treat two successive periods both as independent cases to
   compare for causal analysis and as parts of a single historical
   sequence? I argue that one strategy for doing so, using models of path
   dependency, imposes serious limits on explanation. An alternative model
   which treats successive periods as contrasting solutions for recurrent
   problems offers two advantages. First, it more effectively combines
   analytical comparisons of different periods with narratives of causal
   sequences spanning two or more periods. Second, it better integrates
   scholarly accounts of historical reversals with actors' own narratives
   of the past.

AB This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus
   concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use
   culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent
   findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the
   analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals
   to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this
   conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied
   metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet
   Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors,
   and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the
   group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for
   either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied
   metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social
   bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of
   embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and
   group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be
   more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than
   is modernist culture.

   at a moment when changing lives are colliding with resistant

   dilemmas for women and men alike. To explain the interplay between lives

   analysis. Using the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), religious participation
   from pre- to postmigration time periods is found to decrease among
   recent immigrants to the United States. Individual-level characteristics
   (i.e., gender, familial conditions, employment) do not substantially
   explain this decline; alternatively, contextual-level factors (i.e.,

AB With larger percentages of high school students entering higher
   education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes
   occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using
   in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class
   structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I
   argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for
   stratification because it is there that students gain access to social
   and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that
   upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources
   that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate
   their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial
   factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources
   further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings
   contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing
   that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the
   outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources
   throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that
   symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent
   relationship between social and cultural capital.

AB The question of the extent to which Durkheim's argument in Division of
   Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work
   of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In
   this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent
   scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of
   "representation" and "dualism" in Durkheim's overall thought. The
   analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism
   is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is
   based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system.
   Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely
   misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of
   Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in
   order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes
   that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the
   primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of
   "individualism." This necessitates the analytical distinction between
   the two conceptions of " the individual," which I label the
   "bio-psychological" and the "sociological."

AB Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an "impulse" toward sociability,
   defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an
   end in itself. While sociability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates
   a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize
   symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans
   engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from
   ethnomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a
   way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to
   interactions among humans. Beginning with a conceptualization of play as
   an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize
   situated interactions, this article argues that humans can engage in
   playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the
   play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of
   the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies
   how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume
   that interactants share intersubjectivity. The article concludes by
   offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities
   of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and
   other situational factors.

AB Institutional differentiation has been one of the central concerns of
   sociology since the days of Auguste Comte. However, the overarching
   tendency among institutionalists such as Durkheim or Spencer has been to
   treat the process of differentiation from a macro, "outside in"
   perspective. Missing from this analysis is how institutional
   differentiation occurs from the "inside out," or through the efforts and
   struggles of individual and corporate actors. Despite the recent efforts
   of the "new institutionalism" to fill in this gap, a closer look at the
   literature will uncover the fact that (1) it has tended to conflate
   macro-level institutions and meso-level organizations and (2) this has
   led to a taken for granted approach to institutional dynamics. This
   article seeks to develop a general theory of institutional autonomy;
   autonomy is a function of the degree to which specialized corporate
   units are structurally and symbolically independent of other corporate
   units. It is argued herein that the process by which these
   "institutional entrepreneurs" become independent can explain how
   institutions become differentiated from the "inside out." Moreover, this
   article offers five dimensions that can be operationalized, measuring
   the degree to which institutions are autonomous.

AB The notion that social facts can be caused only by other social facts is
   obsolete. Human societies today are affected by biogeochemical change.
   "Developed'' human societies so overuse the finite planet they share
   with "underdeveloped'' societies that the future of all is threatened.
   Medicine's prosthesis concept becomes useful for sociology when extended
   beyond referring to devices for replacing lost body parts or restoring
   impaired sensory powers. If we regard all modern tools and machines as
   prosthetic devices, we see them enabling humans to act as giants-giving
   us colossal resource appetites and huge environmental impacts.
   Prosthetic apparatus (and familiar assumptions) previously useful are
   subject to obsolescence. But there is cultural lag. Conceptual habits
   restrict the way we see our world. The bubble of twentieth century
   experience obstructs our understanding of the future into which we
   giants are plummeting. To explain severe hardships ahead in the
   twenty-first century, sociologists need to break out of our discipline's
   traditional conceptual bubble. Twentieth century expectations have
   become misleading. The basis of past progress (a carrying capacity
   surplus) is gone, replaced by a carrying capacity deficit. Earth's
   diminished carrying capacity will sustain fewer (dinosaur-equivalent)
   Homo colossus than original Homo sapiens.

AB Optimal matching (OM) is a method for measuring the similarity between

   author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of
   OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an
   empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and
   sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM
   and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates
   the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational
   sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human
   capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal
   improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its
   computational complexity. These results point to the need for more
   systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.

AB Sociological imagination is a quality of mind that cannot be adopted by
   simply teaching students its discursive assumptions. Rather, it is a
   disposition, in competition with other forms of sensibility, which can
   be acquired only when it is practiced. Adhering to this important
   pedagogical assumption, students were assigned to write their
   sociological autobiography. While in the process of establishing a
   connection between their biography and social history, students were
   encouraged to narrate their life stories using sociological language.
   After completing the project, they were asked to comment on their work.
   Student responses show the positive dimensions involved (including
   unintended therapeutic consequences) and the major hurdles that they
   experienced in executing the assignment. In the latter case, the major
   problem was writing a sociological autobiography qualitatively distinct
   from what might be referred to as "plain autobiography." Results
   reinforce the idea that sociological instruction is better handled when
   sociological imagination is viewed as a linguistic habitus which serves
   both as a medium of communication and an intellectual instrument of
   looking at the social world.

AB Environmental social scientists debate whether or not. modern
   development reduces society's impact on the biosphere. The empirical
   research informing the discussion has not yet adequately examined the
   social determinants of municipal solid-waste (MSW) generation, an
   increasingly relevant issue, both ecologically and sociologically. A
   primary problem for this research concerns the increasing exchange of
   MSW across state and county borders. A convenient way to avoid this
   problem is to examine variation between counties with landfills that
   service only the county in which the landfills are located. I applied
   this restriction to a cross-sectional analysis of total MSW generated in
   Texas at the county level for 2006. Using robust regression, this Study
   found that two basic measures of modern development, Population per
   square mile and per capita income, are both positively related to total
   MSW generated at the county level and together explain about 73 percent
   of the variation in the dependent variable. The evidence corroborates
   the metabolic-rift theory. The concentration of people onto smaller land
   areas, or urbanization, and increasing wealth in a capitalist economy
   contribute to the metabolic rupture between human society and the
   environment.

   countries between 1966 and 2000, this article analyzes patterns of
   membership to the International Human Rights Covenants. The analysis
   produced two main conclusions. First, the potential costs associated
   with joining a treaty, rather than its substantive content, motivates
   the decision to join. Treaties that protect different rights but
   establish comparable implementation mechanisms exhibit similar patterns
   of membership, whereas treaties that protect identical rights but
   establish different implementation provisions exhibit dissimilar
   patterns of membership. Second, rates of treaty membership differ by
   level of commitment. Countries that sign human rights treaties differ
   from countries that ratify. Results are interpreted with respect to four
   theories of commitment and compliance: realism, liberalism,
   constructivism, and sociological institutionalism. Theories that
   emphasize the importance of a treaty's costs (realism and
   institutionalism) fare better than theories that prioritize a treaty's
   content (liberalism and constructivism).

   author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and
   democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and
   democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First,
   international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic
   and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to
   conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that
   the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery.
   Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore
   international trade in world-systems and political analysis.

AB In this article, I argue that the study of disability would be
   thoroughly enriched if the insights offered by cultural sociology as
   well as recent work on civil society were applied to it. I illustrate
   this point by offering my own interpretation of contrasting discourses
   of disability and their relationship to major narrative frameworks of
   disability. I describe how these narrative frameworks are dependent on a
   symbolic code that distinguishes between the abilities and inabilities
   of the physical body.

AB Teaching Sociology's emphasis on the scholarship of teaching and
   learning has moved the field well beyond simple description of teaching
   methods. There is no doubt that the journal is more scholarly than in
   the past. Still, we do not take advantage of our rich theoretical
   disciplinary work. There is much to learn sociologically about the
   classroom and other sites of interaction between teachers and students.
   Our classrooms are social sites and our analysis of them can be of help
   to scholars both inside and outside the discipline. In this article, we
   propose a sensitizing concept, the sociology of the college
   classroom-the application of sociological theory and/or concepts to
   understand social phenomena that take place at the level of the
   classroom and other sites of faculty-student interaction. We situate the
   sociology of the college classroom as a subset of the scholarship of
   teaching and learning and the sociology of higher education, Sociology
   of the college classroom can be a place not only where research meets
   teaching, but it can also be a site where sociological theory meets
   pedagogical praxis.

AB This article explores the social-psychological process of identity
   negotiation in collaborative teaching, using Erving Goffman's (1959)
   theoretical tradition of dramaturgy to analyze the classroom itself as a
   performance venue. A dramaturgical analysis of collaborative teaching is
   especially significant given this growing pedagogical trend because
   identity negotiation in team teaching has the potential to impact one's
   teaching, one's career, and students' learning. We demonstrate that
   despite the positive outcomes of collaborative teaching for both
   teachers and learners, building a successful team is a process that
   takes time, effective communication, risk taking, and trust. Most
   significantly, sustaining a clear definition of the situation in the
   classroom is a challenge when a teaching team is engaged in the ongoing
   negotiation of roles, power, and course structure-in front of students.
   We argue that making identity claims in a collaborative team teaching
   situation is both more challenging and rewarding than acting alone on
   the classroom stage.

   Designing a new course for Honors students provided an opportunity to
   change my traditional teaching style. I envisioned a classroom where
   students enthusiastically became more self-directed learners. I was
   perplexed with mixed reactions from students; while some joined me and
   adopted the model of teaching and learning I proposed, far more than I
   expected resisted this change. Using a sociological framework helped me
   understand that I had overlooked the powerful influence of the larger
   institutional context for shaping and maintaining expectations for
   teacher/student role enactment. I argue that when students' comfort is
   disrupted and their normative role expectations are rendered
   unpredictable or misunderstood, some respond with resistance. Honors
   students, in particular, may be the most resistant to pedagogical
   innovation because they are the most skilled at, and invested in,
   enacting and maintaining the institutionally normative roles.

PD JUN 2009

AB Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in
   terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories.
   Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences
   in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This
   article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to
   develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant
   hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We
   argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under
   circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that,
   compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare
   participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare
   exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in
   states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using
   individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple
   panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged
   with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine
   immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and
   transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare
   benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire
   account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to
   avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of
   dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment
   discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy
   implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.

AB Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great
   variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality,
   laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex
   behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes
   about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural
   orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual
   attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we
   merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to
   explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality.
   Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and
   Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and
   macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural
   orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a
   greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the
   United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

AB Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that

   performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control
   theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain

   college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different
   instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their
   major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced
   progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental
   ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a
   half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental
   ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly
   support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions

AB White working-class citizens who vote for the Republican Party have been
   fodder for much political discussion and speculation recently, and a
   debate has arisen about the role that "moral values" played in the
   political decision making of this segment of voters. In this article, we
   defend a version of the moral values claim. We show that although the
   Republicans' policies are unpopular, they are bundled with an
   overarching moral framework that is extremely resonant to this set of
   voters, and we use in-depth interviews to uncover this framework. A key
   feature of this framework, on which in the 2004 presidential election
   George W. Bush scored high and John Kerry scored low, is the appropriate
   attitude to wealth, which serves as an indicator for a candidate's
   general moral philosophy and as a heuristic about whether the candidate
   will govern with working-class voters' interests in mind. National
   Election Studies data support the argument that this was a key influence
   on the voting decision in 2004, even controlling for voters' partisan
   identification.

AB Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa
   has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and
   systematically account for the cross-national variation in the
   prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach,
   this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of
   Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that
   legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation
   of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with
   increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand
   repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and
   systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and
   militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate
   that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the
   religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political
   exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of
   economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic
   mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered
   perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.

AB Given the significant increase in the number of women and girls
   participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have
   ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that
   girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack
   interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of
   accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for
   low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying
   Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant
   observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as
   they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their
   participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while
   enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary
   understanding of social construction by illustrating how social
   structure and cultural discourses interact in shaping everyday social

   integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing
   between "discursive" and "practical" modes of culture and cognition. The
   author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to
   illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he
   finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of

AB This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882
   to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in
   the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation
   between past levels of lynching and current social control practices
   against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of
   social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we
   hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will
   be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930.
   Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three
   outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but
   the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a
   minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable
   black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal
   hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks,
   and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime
   case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup
   conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control,
   and theories that emphasize minority group threat.

   the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Through a discourse
   analysis of publicity materials and media coverage, I reconstruct the
   symbolic frameworks that guide the construction of the event and the
   interpretation of competitors' performances. I also trace the critical
   challenge to the idealized representations of the event, and decode the
   gender ideologies implied in commonly used metaphors. Demonstrating the
   centrality of meaning in musical production and reception, I aim to
   expose the limitations of the production perspective and Bourdieu's
   model of the artistic field, offering in their place a new approach

AB A pervasive anti-statism often blinds us to the democratic victories in
   the past and thus to possibilities in our future. This article argues
   that big government can democratize society and uses historical
   investigation to make the point. The Study of history emancipates its
   from the tyranny of the present. Progressive social change has come
   about in the United States and elsewhere as combined bottom-up, top-down
   initiatives. I present two such cases of democratization during the New
   Deal era. The first is about rural sociologists' participatory-action
   research with local citizens for policy planning. This program, while
   short-lived, fed into the creation of the field of community
   development. The other is a land-reform experiment among poor African
   Americans. In the 1960s these "resettlement communities" became local
   strongholds of the civil-rights movement, and their descendants carry on
   the Struggle today. I use these two historical instances to show that
   big states as well as social scientists have been effective agents of
   democracy, and suggest that they can be again. History then enable us to
   reimagine, re-new, and re-form our democratic tradition of rural
   sociology.

AB Despite their longstanding interest in race, American sociologists have
   conducted little empirical research on sociodemographic patterns or

   what race is, how races differ, and the origins of race. This article
   outlines key empirical, methodological and theoretical considerations
   for a research agenda on racial conceptualization. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with more than 50 college students, I describe the variety of
   race concepts among respondents, illustrate the importance of using
   multiple measures of conceptualization, and demonstrate the malleability
   of conceptualization, linking it to demographic context and thereby
   raising the question of its future evolution in the changing United

AB This study proposes a theoretical framework to understand how nations
   deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights
   violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master
   narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on
   studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial
   historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the
   degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two
   key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation
   of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective
   trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war
   Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers'
   speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the
   framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for
   apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification
   of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring
   countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that
   arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial
   conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese
   victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights
   language by proponents of the defensive arguments.

AB The structural theory of ecologically unequal exchange posits that
   through the vertical flow of exports from lower-income countries, the
   stratified world economy enables higher-income countries to
   misappropriate global environmental space. Tied to their unsustainable
   consumption levels, this misappropriation by higher-income countries
   leads to the suppression of resource consumption in lower-income
   countries, well below globally sustainable thresholds, which negatively
   impacts the well-being of domestic populations. To evaluate key aspects
   of the theory, I test the hypothesis that lower-income countries with
   elevated levels of exports sent to higher-income countries exhibit lower
   consumption-based environmental demand, measured as per-capita
   ecological footprints. Findings for generalized least squares panel
   regression analyses of 66 lower-income countries from 1975 to 2000
   confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional
   results indicate that the strength of the hypothesized relationship
   increased in magnitude during the 25-year period. These findings hold,
   net of the effects of economic development, ecological conditions, and
   other structural factors.

AB Contemporary social theory suggests that the meaning of any object
   differs by how we, as social actors, respond and relate to it. The

   practices recursively and productively embedded in these relationships.
   In this article, I present data from in-depth interviews with 20
   home-based employees to illustrate how these individuals interact with
   familiar objects in their surroundings to form anchor points for diverse
   lines of conduct. Although I draw from a number of sociological theories
   in my analyses, I further utilize cognitive theory to outline three
   micro-psychological practices (i.e., routinization, goal targeting, and
   emotional alignment) that respondents apply in their attempt to
   establish the desired association between objects and identities. In
   this way, the article both extends previous lines of inquiry into the
   relationship between objects and actors, and makes a new contribution to
   the growing literature on culture and cognition.

PD FEB 2009
PY 2009
AB One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members
   to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This
   article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a
   selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective
   action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn
   diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and
   these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In
   Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status,
   exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and
   received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these
   findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies
   show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual
   an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who
   received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more
   and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the
   allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and
   solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.

AB Sociologists have long recognized that social problems do not derive

   examines competing cultural meanings about the fat body. Through frame
   analysis of organizational materials, I map the contested field of
   obesity and document three cultural frames-medical frame, social justice
   frame, and market choice frame-as represented by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association to Advance Fat
   Acceptance (NAAFA), and the food industry group the Center for Consumer
   Freedom (CCF), respectively. Using the "framing matrix," I explore each
   frame's key signature elements and discuss its social and cultural
   significance. Notably, each frame leads to different outcomes for social
   equality and how society thinks about fat bodies, health, and public
   policy.

AB Most pregnant women in the United States today choose a normative

   rarely been studied: a planned birth at home with neither a doctor nor a
   midwife assisting. In this article, I examine the stories told by women
   in this under-researched population to consider how they make and
   explain this highly unusual choice. Analysis of online birth stories and
   in-depth interviews with women who planned and had an unassisted
   homebirth reveal ways in which these women rely on competing discourses
   of midwifery and medicine to craft a unique sense of agency in birth.

AB Though Pierre Bourdieu has been criticized for ignoring the moral
   dimensions of social judgments, I suggest that his habitus concept can
   provide a useful theoretical foundation for a sociological analysis of
   morality. If the habitus is revised in a way that recognizes the
   embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for
   moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can
   account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social
   settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of
   emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied
   cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are
   employed in different configurations across cultural settings. I argue
   that a modified habitus concept that can account for these phenomena has
   significant implications for the sociological analysis of lay morality.

   the authors argue that the technological and social characteristics of

   sociology, social psychology, urban studies, technology assessment, and
   media studies. The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of
   people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for
   automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and
   can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and
   cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on
   everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone
   calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in
   human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone,
   two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their
   experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats
   to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These
   approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since
   research software for smartphones have been published in open source,
   which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their
   utilization in research.

   I hope the essay demonstrates that working in many fields can make for a
   satisfying and productive career. Research across areas also encourages
   comparative work, and if enough young people become mufti-field
   researchers, sociologists might then develop more interdisciplinary
   skills, which is even now desirable and may one day be necessary for all
   the social sciences. My essay also describes how and why I became

AB Emotional labor refers to the process by which workers are expected to
   manage their feelings in accordance with organizationally defined rules
   and guidelines. Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart introduced this
   concept and inspired an outpouring of research on this topic. This
   article reviews theory and research on emotional labor with a particular
   focus on its contributions to sociological understandings of workers and
   jobs. The sociological literature on emotional labor can be roughly
   divided into two major streams of research. These include studies of
   interactive work and research directly focused on emotions and their
   management by workers. The first uses emotional labor as a vehicle to
   understand the organization, structure, and social relations of service
   jobs, while the second focuses on individuals' efforts to express and
   regulate emotion and the consequences of those efforts. The concept of
   emotional labor has motivated a tremendous amount of research, but it
   has been much less helpful in providing theoretical guidance for or
   integration of the results generated by these bodies of work.

AB During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published
   several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were
   addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black
   Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological
   triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church.
   Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a
   comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African
   American community. He addressed the social construction of African
   American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of
   the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was
   recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational
   studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership
   patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and
   ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church
   membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it
   possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these
   areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the
   discipline's past and a bridge to its future.

AB An important consequence of the economic structure transformations of

   literature has explored the relationship between economic restructuring
   and inequality, the unique contribution of this article is that it
   develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this
   process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap
   between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the
   educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5
   percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of
   Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided
   strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and
   the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income
   gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality.
   Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality
   were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor
   force employed in services, and both were lower where greater
   proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing
   industries.

   arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped

   in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three

AB Between 1895 and 1924 Atlanta University sponsored yearly investigations
   into the social, economic, and physical condition of Blacks and hosted
   conferences where the findings were presented. With the appointment of
   William Edward Burghardt Du Bois as director of the investigations in
   1897 the unit soon became the first American school of sociology.
   Unfortunately, the contributions of members of the school beyond Du Bois
   remain buried within the hundreds of pages of the Atlanta University
   Publications. This inquiry provides examples of three groups of
   contributors to the research program at Atlanta Universityprofessionally
   trained social scientists, citizen researchers, and university students.

AB The Sociological Imagination is among the most recognized books in the
   history of American Sociology. Yet, the sociological imagination as
   such, a radical form of self-consciousness, is not commonly well
   understood nor easily acquired. This essay examines the challenges thus
   faced by instructors who seek to accurately impart what Mills meant by
   his famous neologism and the even stiffer challenge for those struggling
   to instill the sociological imagination in their students. Two pertinent
   examples of creative and probably productive pedagogy are discussed,
   Maurice R. Stein's "Sociology of Birth & Death" at Brandeis University
   and Brian Rich's senior seminar in sociology at Transylvania University.
   The essay concludes with advice for the instructor in pursuit of
   fidelity to Mills's original argument and guidance vis-a-vis the typical
   constraints encountered in today's classrooms.

AB Here I emphasize the applicability of the sociological imagination to an
   international audience by sharing my journey of teaching sociology in
   Japan. I found my own sociological imagination helpful in critically
   evaluating the literature on Japanese higher education and the
   construction of the Japanese student as a form of Orientalism. As I
   embraced international students' unique, context-specific capacities for
   learning, I relied on the illuminating power of C. Wright Mills's
   sociological imagination to heighten their understandings of themselves
   and others. Despite the characterization of Japanese students as passive
   learners, I discovered an engaged and responsive student body who
   developed a keen sociological imagination through storytelling.
   Employing a pedagogy of storytelling, I helped my students successfully
   explore gender and ethnic troubles as public issues in a global context.
   The insight gained abroad has led me to expand my pedagogy at home
   beyond active learning strategies to incorporate stories to enhance U.S.
   students' sociological imaginations.

AB C. Wright Mills would be a friendly critic of service learning,
   acknowledging its benefits for providing students with experiential
   learning opportunities to connect personal troubles with social issues.
   Yet he would be critical of service-learning practices that perpetuate
   institutional power inequalities and that do not advance the social
   change objectives of community-based organizations. We offer an
   innovative approach that helps to address some of these concerns which,
   when used in conjunction with "best practices" of service learning, has
   the potential to make a greater impact on the community than most
   service-learning projects. This paper highlights how two sociology
   programs in two urban universities-a large, elite university and a
   smaller, minority-serving university-have completed significant
   community-based research projects by having classes of students at both
   universities work on projects both consecutively and simultaneously
   across several semesters to complete substantial research projects with
   and for community partners. We use a case study approach to identify
   five key practices that have enabled the two universities to effectively
   collaborate across institutions,

AB Though C. Wright Mills made a pivotal contribution to the discipline by
   raising sociologists' awareness of the ideological and bureaucratic
   content of sociological practicality, he may have placed unyielding
   limits on "the promise" he profoundly proclaimed in the "sociological
   imagination." By defining types of practicality in such rigidly
   confining terms, as either "liberal" or "illiberal" those wishing to
   practice sociology in broader and more expansive ways were left with few
   of the alternatives Mills himself wished to extol. Over the past
   generation, the field of applied sociology and teaching and learning
   sociological practice have struggled to develop in the discipline. This
   has posed huge challenges for teachers wishing to address the needs of
   students who have perennially been interested in finding practical
   possibilities for applying their sociology in jobs and careers. The
   purpose of this paper is to: 1) examine the concept of sociological
   practicality propounded by Mills; 2) critically assess the concept of
   sociological practicality in the historical context of American
   sociology, 3) identify and discuss a broad typology of models of
   research and practice from which types of practicality may emerge; 4)
   discuss the implications of this typology for teaching and learning
   sociological practice; and 5) conclude by discussing ways of teaching a
   liberating practicality for sociology.

AB Sociologists empirically and theoretically neglect genocide. In this
   article, our critical collective framing perspective begins by focusing
   on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and
   dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative
   dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes
   that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We
   investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of
   refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the
   Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process.
   Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African
   settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a
   collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which
   amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and
   lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial
   and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the
   instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive
   perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing
   perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously
   added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering
   discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin
   concept of genocide.

AB The writings of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) foreshadowed several
   of the dominant theories of sociology, social psychology, aesthetics,
   linguistics and literary theory. His ideas impacted generations of
   thinkers, but today he is uncelebrated, mostly unknown. His writings on
   populism, expressionism, and pluralism are relevant to contemporary
   sociology, especially community sociology. Here we consider his views on
   the nature and meaning of community, and his methods Of Studying and
   interpreting communities. These include an emphasis on the essential
   particularity of human communities and their connection to wider systems
   and networks. Herder urges special attention to the elements of context
   (place, time, language, culture) within which communi ties are situated.
   Herder's is an embedded particularism, a focus on individuality and
   diversity within larger unities. He also sensitizes LIS to the
   multivalence and multiplicity of social phenomena. As the proper stance
   for community research he Counsels involvement and empathy rather than
   objectivity and emotional distance, and he urges researchers to be
   sensitive to data from all of their senses, not merely sight. Drawing
   upon Herder's writings, we conclude with several important
   methodological principles relevant to improving current work on the
   nature and conceptualization of communities.

   incorporate into regression analysis the ecological footprint, a
   comprehensive measure of natural resource consumption, and alternative
   explanatory variables drawn from previous research. Results illustrate
   ecological footprint consumption has a moderately strong direct
   influence shaping lower levels of maternal mortality. Path analysis
   reveals export commodity concentration has a negative effect on level of
   ecological footprint demand net the strong positive influence of income
   per capita. This illustrates cross-national trade dependency relations
   directly influence natural resource consumption opportunities and
   thereby indirectly contribute to higher maternal mortality levels within

   consumption is an important dimension of improvement in maternal

AB In the United States, voter turnout rates have been declining for the
   last 4 decades; however, this pattern differs substantially by region.
   Southern states have actually seen a fairly dramatic increase in turnout
   since the 1950s and currently the South and non-South have almost
   identical rates of voter registration and turnout. Using a series of
   Heckman probit models, which examine voting as a two-step process of
   registering and casting a vote, we systematically investigate
   differences in rates of registering and voting across regions and test
   explanations for regional convergence over time. Using data from the
   American National Election Studies (1956-2000), we find that regional
   convergence in voter registration is primarily due to the removal of
   formal and informal barriers to registration and voting in the South and
   declining efforts to mobilize potential voters in the non-South. In
   addition, we find some fairly distinct differences in which predictors
   are important to each stage of the voting process; for example, race is
   a better predictor of registering to vote than voting. We conclude with
   a discussion of the implications of these results.

AB Austin Turk (1969) offers a distinctly sociological explanation of
   policing by theorizing that structural reinforcers (e.g., older police
   officer, younger citizen) and reversals (e.g., younger police officer,
   older citizen) of the situationally absolute positional authority of
   police officers affect the relationship between police officers and
   citizens. To this point, however, there have been only three direct
   tests of Turk's theory (Greenleaf and Lanza-Kaduce, 1995; Lanza-Kaduce
   and Greenleaf, 2000; Weidner and Terrill, 2005). All have examined overt
   conflict and the results are mixed. The present research therefore adds
   a fourth test of Turk's (1969) theory to the sociological literature by
   examining the effects of structural reinforcers and reversals on
   citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy and propriety of police actions
   during routine traffic stop encounters. Net of control measures,
   including the legal reason for the traffic stop, and extra-legal
   measures, such as driver gender, the data provide modest to strong
   support for parts of Turk's (1969) theory and absolutely no support for
   others. The conclusion of the present study is that more research is
   needed to determine whether Turk (1969) is correct in theorizing that
   there is a sociology, and not just a social psychology, to
   police-citizen encounters.

   1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers' life insurance
   policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The
   author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three
   conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation,
   and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are
   considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its
   success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about
   markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for
   analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within

AB This study sets out to investigate whether introducing molecular genetic

   sociological insights. The data source is the white male DNA sample in
   the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors'
   empirical gene-environment interaction analysis produces a robust
   protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype
   in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to
   be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having
   sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive
   ability. The genetics-informed sociological analysis here suggests that
   explaining a human trait or behavior may require a theory that
   accommodates the complex interplay between social contextual and

   feminist sociologists have paid to how major leaders of the women's

   and early twentieth centuries. It documents how these early feminists
   had both progressive and reactionary responses to the anti-imperialist
   struggles of their era. Particular emphasis is given to how issues of
   race, class, and gender were interwoven in their discourses on
   imperialism.
   The second section focuses on how the writings of the most famous woman
   theorist and critic of imperialism during this era-Rosa Luxemburg-are
   virtually ignored in U. S. portrayals of feminist sociology and women
   founders of sociology. To address this omission, Luxemburg's theory of
   imperialism is examined, as well as how it has influenced contemporary
   global feminist works. A critical analysis of these Luxemburg-inspired
   works considers their implications for understanding global imperialism
   today. In this way, the past is used to clarify the present.

AB Critical thinking is often presented as a generic technique. This
   article develops an alternative that links critique more closely to the
   sociological perspective. I suggest three answers to the above question:
   that the sociological perspective is critical for comprehending complex
   issues, that all sociology is implicitly critical by virtue of its
   debunking tendency, and that some sociology is explicitly critical by
   virtue of value commitments that lead to a critique of domination. The
   article identifies some basic themes of what it means to think
   sociologically, discusses sociology's "double critique" in more detail,
   illustrates the critical potential of scientific, humanistic and
   critical approaches to sociology, and explores some implications of this
   approach for how we teach sociology. It concludes by suggesting that the
   goal of fostering critical thinking in our students might better be met
   by returning to the critical roots of our own discipline.

AB This study uses a quasi-experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of
   Internet videoconferencing technology. The instructor used a laptop,
   webcam, highspeed DSL connection, and Polycom (TM) Viewstation to teach
   a course unit of introductory sociology from a remote location to an
   experimental group of students in a large multimedia classroom. The same
   instructor taught a control group of introductory sociology students
   without videoconferencing. The groups were compared using exam scores,
   attendance, classroom observations, and student evaluations. The use of
   Internet videoconferencing did not affect exam scores or attendance.
   However, it substantially lowered student evaluation scores. In
   comparison to classroom-based instruction and due to problems with and
   limitations of the technology, students experienced greater difficulty
   communicating with the instructor, felt more separated, and were less
   engaged in the course. Therefore, they perceived the instructor's
   teaching to be less effective, and evaluations reflected lower scores,
   thereby "punishing" the instructor. Symbolic interactionism is used to
   interpret the results. This research is compared and contrasted with a
   previous study conducted by one of the authors (Koeber 2005), also
   published in Teaching Sociology, which yielded opposite results. In
   Koeber's study the instructor was rewarded with favorable student
   evaluations for the use of new technology that enhanced engagement. We
   conclude that when instructors choose whether or not to use Internet
   videoconferencing, they must weigh the potential benefits associated
   with bridging distance gaps versus potential costs associated with
   reduction in quantity and quality of symbolic interaction that may cause
   students to disengage.

   institution continues to elude clear and full specification. One reason
   for this lack of clarity is that about 50 years ago empirical
   researchers in the field of sociology turned their gaze downward, away
   from macro-sociological constructs in order to focus their attention on
   middle-range empirical projects. It took almost 20 years for the concept
   of the institution to work its back onto the empirical research agenda
   of mainstream sociologists. The new institutional project in
   organizational sociology led the way. Since then, scholars in this
   tradition have achieved a great deal but there is still much more to
   accomplish. Here, future directions for research are considered by
   reviewing how the concept of the institution has come to be treated by
   mainstream philosophers, sociologists of science and technology studies,
   and social network theorists.

AB This article addresses the relationship between technology and
   institutions and asks whether technology itself is an institution. The
   argument is that social theorists need to attend better to materiality:
   the world of things and objects of which technical things form an
   important class. It criticizes the new institutionalism in sociology for
   its failure to sufficiently open up the black box of technology. Recent
   work in science and technology studies (S&TS) and in particular the
   sociology of technology is reviewed as another route into dealing with
   technology and materiality. The recent ideas in sociology of technology
   are exemplified with the author's study of the development of the
   electronic music synthesizer.

AB Bridging the areas of political-economic sociology, the sociology of

   derived from a refined theory of foreign investment dependence. The
   hypotheses state that pesticide and fertilizer use intensity in
   less-developed countries are both positively associated with foreign
   investment dependence in the primary sector. The use of such inputs in
   agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human
   health and environmental problems. Findings for random effects and
   static score panel regression analyses of 35 less-developed countries
   confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in
   assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the
   transnational organization and the relative scale of production in
   different sectors.

AB Legislative roll-call voting is crucial in policy making. Standard
   approaches to studying roll-call voting focus on legislator attributes,
   ignoring how social factors, such as legislator relations, may drive
   voting. Using original data based on a state legislature, I adopt a
   relational approach to examine how legislator relations impact roll-call
   voting net of attributes. Results show that relations strongly influence
   voting, adding significantly to the explanatory power of the models.
   These results imply that standard approaches to studying roll-call
   voting should incorporate consideration of social factors, suggesting
   the value of social influence models in studies of political phenomena.

AB In this article I first examine the ways in which the dual terms of
   structure and agency are used in sociological theories. Then, relying on
   Lacan's notions of split-subject, the formula of sexuation, and forms of
   discourses, and Laclau's theory of ideological hegemony, I argue that
   agency in most current sociological formulations is but a posited other
   of the structure that dissolves if examined closely; it is similar to
   the Lacanian fantasmic object. To resolve the fundamental paradoxes in
   structure-agency theories, I reformulate structures as paradoxical,
   incomplete, and contingent symbolic formations that are always partial
   and unstable due to their inclusion and exclusion operations.
   Consequently, social transformational agency consists in the structural
   inconsistencies that open structural gaps available to social actors. As
   a result, agency can be recognized in two moments conceived as two
   symbolic gestures. From this perspective, agency as such is always a
   possibility qua potential and its efficacy is always retroactively
   recognized-actualized from within a new social structure or symbolic
   order.

AB Using the American Housing Survey for 2001 and Census 2000, I examine
   the link between gated communities and residential segregation. I
   hypothesize that gating and segregation are defined by similar
   mechanisms, thus reinforcing urban inequality in U. S. cities. The
   results, however, indicate a more complex relationship. On the one hand,
   there are common mechanisms behind the two processes: the pursuit of
   higher property values, fear of crime, and fear of increased social
   heterogeneity. An increase in percent recent immigrants leads to higher
   levels of both segregation and gating. On the other hand, factors such
   as region, percent black, percent Hispanic, percent college graduates,
   and functional specialization affect the two processes differentially.
   Although segregation is less pronounced and declining in the U. S. urban
   Southwest, gated communities are much more prominent there. The results
   challenge the notion that the declines in residential segregation in
   recent decades indicate social progress.

AB The cultural turn has been one of the major shifts in sociology over the
   last two decades. Though nearly everyone now agrees that culture
   matters, how it matters is not terribly clear. What, exactly, is culture
   supposed to do? In this essay, I articulate two ideal-typical - though
   often implicit - ways most sociologists have thought about culture's
   role in action. Although no single sociologist or piece of research
   fully embodies either ideal type, I believe they are real tendencies in
   the field that have real consequences for how research is designed,
   undertaken, and understood. After outlining these approaches, I subject
   them to an engagement with cognitive science. This is not out a desire
   for reductionism but, as I will show, because a crucial difference
   between these perspectives is their implicit model of how human beings
   perceive, acquire, store, retrieve, and act on the symbolic information
   that surrounds them every day. This exercise will lead to the conclusion
   that both perspectives are incomplete and will point toward a synthetic
   approach that can shed new light on how culture matters for action.

   system and world society while articulating them with the field theory
   of Bourdieu and organizational sociology. It highlights particular
   structural configurations ("spaces of relations") and the specific
   cultural content ("rules of the game" and "symbolic capital") of global
   systems. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through an analysis
   of the different forms of the two hegemonic empires of the past
   centuries, Great Britain and the United States. The British state tended
   toward formal imperialism in the 19th century, characterized by direct
   territorial rule, while the United States since WWII has tended toward
   informal imperialism. The essay shows that the difference can be best
   explained by considering the different historical global fields in which
   the two empires operated.

AB Approaching the public representation of a "difficult past" as a

   government has represented the country to international audiences via
   tourism after the wars of Yugoslav secession. Challenging assumptions
   that contentious historical moments will be commemorated, I find that
   the state has managed Croatia "diflicult" recent past through covering
   and cultural reframing rather than public acknowledgment. The country
   has omitted the war from representations of national history and
   repositioned Croatia as identical in history and culture to its Western
   European neighbors. I draw from Goffman's work on stigma to explain the
   Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for
   understanding the conditions under which public recognition of
   reputation-damaging events is likely not to occur I conclude by
   discussing theoretical implications for scholarship on collective
   memory, cultural sociology, and world polity theory.

   level on the pattern of published findings is examined using a

   rejected at approximately the 1 in 10 million level. Findings suggest
   that some of the results reported in leading sociology journals may be

AB Elite college admissions exemplify processes of social closure in which
   status-group conflict, organizational self-interest, the strategic use
   of cultural ideals of merit, and broader social trends and contingent
   historical events interweave to shape institutional power in the United
   States. The Chosen, Jerome Karabel's monumental study of the history of
   college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton from 1900 to 2005,
   offers a political sociology of elite recruitment and a cultural and
   social history of the definition of merit that has guided these three
   schools and shaped much current thinking about college admissions. As
   Max Weber reminded us, the very definition of cultural ideals of an
   epoch bear the stamp of elite group domination: not cultural ideals but
   cultural interests and their strategic uses guide institutional power.
   The book provides an impressive empirical demonstration of that
   proposition: it identifies four different definitions of merit as
   organizational gatekeeping tools that have guided Harvard, Yale, and
   Princeton over the last hundred years and shows how these definitions
   were molded by status-group conflict and organizational interests. This
   essay outlines the central arguments of Karabel's book; it identifies
   key contributions for our understanding of the history, culture,
   organizational interests, and politics of these three institutions; it
   highlights the social closure framework guiding the analysis; and it
   reflects on a fundamental ambiguity in Karabel's thinking about
   meritocratic ideals as governing principles for modern stratified
   societies.

AB In his massively influential work, Clifford Geertz crystallized core
   methodological and theoretical elements of a strong program in cultural
   sociology, a program that argues for a meaning-centered social science.
   If meaning is to be so central, then the theoretical tools that the
   humanities have developed to investigate art and language must become
   central to the human sciences more generally. The 'thick descriptions'
   Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the
   empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local
   knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing,
   global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not
   enriched but different as it emerges locally. Interests can never be
   objective, and extra-individual structures are both cultural and social
   at the same time. Yet, while structures are central, they take form only
   through contingent process, and intertwining them is what Geertz's turn
   to performance was about.

   and influential piece of work. Why? Using resources from the Russian
   formalism of the early 20th century, the article uncovers the textual
   and structural foundations that gave it a competitive advantage over his
   other writings. In so doing the analysis seeks to reconcile Geertz with
   the structuralism that he famously and perhaps unwisely dismissed as
   irrelevant for interpretative sociology. The reception trajectory of
   Geertz points to the need for a more robust theory of culture than his
   hermeneutics could offer. The Yale strong program is understood as a
   solution to this malaise, one that combines structuralist analysis with
   Geertzian sensibilities.

AB The strong program in cultural sociology faces - and creates for
   sociology generally - an epistemic dilemma: does an interpretation of
   culture constitute an explanation of social action? The work of Clifford
   Geertz suggests the two are not mutually exclusive. In his empirical
   studies he artfully produced 'maximal interpretations' that went beyond
   both extant theories and the immediate data given by participant
   observation. Maximal interpretations, I argue, claim the epistemic
   status of sociological explanations. Indeed, the core problems of the
   philosophy of social science and social theory can be reframed in terms
   of the difference between relatively uncontroversial 'minimal
   interpretation' and relatively tendentious (but powerful) 'maximal
   interpretation'. The implications of this distinction for research can
   be made clear by considering, as an example, what is required to explain
   witch hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, and the Salem
   witch trials in particular.

   have shaped the discipline of sociology and continue to shape it. It is
   organized around the concept of crisis, arguing that sociology has been
   produced by crises and that it has been defined by its responses to
   crises. It identifies an ethic of control and manipulation as a chief
   product of 19th century responses. It suggests that we have once again
   entered a period of disruption and rapid change, and that the current
   challenge of sociology is to situate ourselves, reflexively, within a
   dense web of philosophical, psychological, social, biological, and
   environmental linkages, recognizing that we can never see the network in
   its entirety because we ourselves are nodes within it. However, the
   ethic of control and manipulation that we have inherited from earlier
   sociological responses often prevents sociologists from developing an
   immanent, reflexive, and ecological approach to the crisis of the
   present that would enable us to place ourselves within this web.

AB In this article / explore the ethical terrain of experiential learning
   activities drawing on my experiences leading college students on field
   trips into criminal justice settings. Though there are numerous
   educational benefits to adopting experiential learning activities, the
   rewards must be evaluated in light of the potential harms to nonstudent
   participants. Student observations of criminal justice settings can
   reinforce common stereotypes of prisoners as scary and dangerous while
   reifying the legitimacy of state power exercised through agents of

   highlight the shame and embarrassment of subordinate groups when such
   activities devolve into voyeuristic spectacles of human misery. In light
   of these potential harms to nonstudent groups, this article proposes
   guiding questions for educators to address in designing experiential
   activities. These questions draw attention to the following issues: the
   vulnerability of participants, the relative social power of nonstudent
   participants, whether participation is truly voluntary, the
   accessibility of the setting to outside observers, group size, benefits
   to nonstudent participants, duration of activity, protection of
   confidentiality, the role of students in the activity, and the

AB We have updated Ferree and Hall's (1990) study of the way gender and
   race are constructed through pictures in introductory sociology
   textbooks. Ferree and Hall looked at 33 textbooks published between 1982
   and 1988. We replicated their study by examining 3,085 illustrations in
   a sample of 27 textbooks, most of which were published between 2002 and
   2006. We found important areas of progress in the presentation of both
   gender and race as well as significant areas of stasis. The face of
   society we found depicted in contemporary textbooks was distinctly less
   likely to be that of a white man, very prominent in the 1980s texts, and
   much more likely to be that of a minority woman. Thus, while only 34
   percent of the pictures of identifiable individuals in the textbooks
   examined by Ferree and Hall were of women, almost 50 percent of such
   pictures were of women in the recent texts. Moreover, while the
   percentage of white men portrayed dropped from about 45 percent to 30
   percent, the percentage of portrayals of minority women rose from about
   11 percent to 22 percent. Another sign of progress has been the
   decreasing likelihood of textbooks to depict race and gender as being
   nonoverlapping categories: while women of color apparently "had" only
   race in the sample examined by Ferree and Hall, they "had" both gender
   and race in the sample we studied. Still, our examination of pictures as
   a whole as a unit of analysis found that blacks continue to be more
   likely than any other racial group to be depicted in the presence of
   other racial groups and thus, to idealize the degree of social
   integration in American society. We also still see non-white women
   enjoying very little (in fact, no) visibility in sections devoted to
   theory, despite developments in feminist theory, generally, and
   multicultural feminist, specifically. In general, though, our analysis
   suggests that the various criticisms of introductory texts that have
   appeared in this forum and others can have an impact on the content of
   those texts and, by extension, the sociology we teach.

   understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against
   the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates
   successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of "objectivity as
   neutrality" eventually embracing "objectivity as the scientific method"
   in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic
   interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in
   knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the
   potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity
   is compromised.

AB Despite a number of contemporary theoretical works in sociology and
   moral philosophy arguing that the project of modern selfhood is
   necessarily a deeply moral endeavor, there are few empirical studies
   examining the specific ways in which social actors construct moral
   selves and lives. Utilizing ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth
   interviews, this article examines how a group of adult Muslim converts
   in Missouri produced new moral selves in and through the use of embodied
   religious practices. Drawing on the theoretical insights of Bourdieu, I
   demonstrate how the embodied religious practices of ritual prayer,
   fasting and covering formed within converts the moral dispositions, or
   habitus, associated with becoming a 'good Muslim.".

AB Sociologists of religion have often connected secularization to science,
   but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists
   or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address
   this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite
   academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005.
   Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university
   scientists as well as a change in their religious composition.
   Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to
   natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred
   between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion
   of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists.
   Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general
   population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact
   among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise
   older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists.
   Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master
   identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of
   religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion
   that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and
   connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional
   spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership
   role in society.

   sociological study, as an object of research, as a factor in behavior,
   and as an element to be controlled in the prosecution of research''
   (Williams, 1958: 621). In this essay, I ask what has become of that

AB Drawing inspiration from the work of Robin M. Williams Jr., I map out
   the complexities of ethnic and racial relations in the contemporary
   United States by focusing on the impacts of 9/11 - particularly in
   relation to immigration policy. Because the attackers entered the
   country through regular immigration channels (i.e., as foreign students)
   the U. S. government has introduced policies to enhance border security,
   restrict immigration, increase the surveillance of immigrant
   populations, and more actively enforce immigration policy. These
   national-security-related immigration policies, however, are
   exacerbating existing tensions and producing new sets of ethnic and
   racialized conflicts in the United States. In this article, I first
   provide an overview of the key national-security-related immigration
   policies that were passed in the wake of September 11, 2001. Then, I
   review some of the recent sociological literature, as well as draw from
   my own preliminary research in the State of New Jersey, to illustrate
   the social impacts of these policies on ethnic and racial relations. I
   conclude with an outline of the ways the sociology of ethnic and racial
   relations specifically, as well as other subfields of the discipline,
   might approach analyses of social conflict in the contemporary United
   States, post - September 11.

   a variant of Dillman's "total designmethod," the author conducted a
   survey of 345 arts and sciences academic deans, asking them to select
   the top-ranked and second-ranked disciplines on a number of items.
   Sociology fared quite well or well on commitment and concern with
   students, success in conducting research aimed at ameliorating community
   problems, ability to work in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
   teams, involvement in college and university governance, and involvement
   in the surrounding community. Sociology did not fare well on academic
   rigor, success in attracting students to the discipline, success of
   students with regard to occupational and graduate education achievement,
   securing funded grants and contracts, success in producing peer-reviewed
   publications, involvement in international activities, fundraising, and
   overall prestige on campus. The author offers suggestions on how
   sociology could improve its status in the academy.

AB Nearly all of sociology's top graduate training programs require their

   instructors for these courses have an extraordinary opportunity to

   This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices
   of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with
   particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory
   construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the
   discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of
   questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were
   teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of
   the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the
   nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most
   important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However,
   attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical
   theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific
   standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author
   explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices.

AB 'Theory' is one of the most important words in the lexicon of
   contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite
   unclear what sociologists mean by the words 'theory,' 'theoretical,' and
   'theorize.' I argue that confusions about the meaning of 'theory' have
   brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and
   even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions:
   (a) what does 'theory' mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what
   ought 'theory' to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five
   stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about
   'theory.' Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of
   the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some
   difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology
   to. Fourth, I articulate the question, 'what ought "theory" to mean?,'
   which I dub the 'semantic predicament' (SP), and I consider what one can
   learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a
   'semantic therapy' for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP:
   (a) the principle of practical reason-SP is to a large extent a
   political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political
   mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological
   pluralism-the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and
   epistemologically demanding.

   both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4)
   relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained
   APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability,
   hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a
   criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC

   across three of the most visible of these: Boyer's Scholarship
   Reconsidered, Carnegie's Stewardship of the Discipline, and Burawoy's
   Public Sociology. Putting the development of these conceptualizations
   into the larger context of shifts in higher education, I briefly review
   each, putting special emphasis on the synergy among them. However,
   despite these overarching guides and a number of other noted innovations
   (particularly in the scholarship of teaching and learning), new
   challenges have arisen, I end by discussing these new developments,
   drawing from basic sociological research to provide insights for
   maintaining gains and pushing these efforts forward. In particular, SoTL
   and the aging of the cohort of leaders who pioneered these redefinition
   efforts emphasize the importance of Preparing Future Faculty (PFF)
   programs, and the placement of new PhDs with this broad vision in

   of 44 leaders to gain an understanding of key principles and how they
   are taught. We report their teaching strategies and compare their
   strategies to those of other teachers and the recommendations in
   McKinney et al. (2004). Although similar in many respects, leaders are
   considerably more likely than other sociologists to engage students in
   research and somewhat more likely to use simulations or games.

   The results also provide evidence of a direct effect of religion on

AB We use a reputational approach to create a theory of martyrdom that
   synthesizes scholarship on the body politic, cultural symbols, and
   collective memory. The making of a martyr, a contested social process,
   depends on both the resources of the martyr's supporters and the
   cultural context into which the martyr's image is introduced. Our
   approach is well suited to analyzing how martyrs are used 'on the
   ground' and given cultural and material utility. We highlight the
   attention paid to the conception and reception of the martyr's corporeal
   body, in particular, as a source of identity and meaning, giving
   emotional weight to social ideas about death and sacrifice. Control over
   martyrs' bodies derives from the cultural and political intricacies of
   reputational entrepreneurship, thus employing the body as a medium of
   culture. To examine this concept of embodied martyrdom, we examine the
   cases of Joan of Arc, John Brown, and Che Guevara.

   alternatives that, if pursued, could help to create an expanded set of

AB Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge
   from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions
   produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A
   work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers
   that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get
   from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained.
   The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings
   reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance
   feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to
   feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations.
   These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest
   that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on

   tests these competing claims, while also considering the extent to which
   the mediation process relies on negative social capital (targeted

   from more than 1,600 counties and seemingly unrelated regression
   techniques, the author finds that the presence of men in families is
   integral to community efforts to reduce both female and male violence
   levels, net controls for ecological variables; old heads are moderately
   effective in reducing male violence levels. Men in families have robust
   effects on both female and male violence rates, though male homicide is
   somewhat more responsive to shifts in the presence of men in families
   and old heads. Gender differences across other ecological variables are

AB This study advances the sociological inquiry on social categories by
   synthesizing two lines of research in economic and organizational
   sociology - studies of industrial categories in market dynamics and
   neo-institutional analyses of social categories. It compares the
   classificatory schemes and structures in the California and French wine
   industries and investigates the impact of institutionalized categories
   on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price.
   Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems,
   similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and
   affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound
   consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in

AB Donald Black insists that sociology must be purged of its psychological
   elements in order to become a genuinely distinct and scientific
   discipline. But such "purification" is simultaneously unnecessary,
   undesirable, and unattainable. It is unnecessary because the scientific
   shortcomings of sociology are indigenous and have nothing to do with
   psychologism. Indeed, a more scientific sociology would look more, not
   less, like psychology. Purity is undesirable in that it is not only not
   a scientific virtue, but is antithetical to the very scientific values
   that Black invokes to justify it. His systems are neither theories nor
   laws, but heuristics, more akin to common sense than to scientific
   theory. Finally, purity is unattainable because though society is indeed
   discontinuous with the individuals who make it up, it and all theorizing
   about it, are ontologically and conceptually dependent upon them.

   science background to the issues with Black's claims, and presents the
   core issues as they have been normally and historically understood.
   These include the following: that the theory is literally false, and is
   not defensible as an approximation; that the magnitudes to which his
   "geometry" refers are not magnitudes according to standard measurement
   theory: that the form of the theory precludes testing by correlational
   evidence. Moreover, the phenomena are better accounted for by cognitive
   rather than "pure" sociological explainers.

AB crafting this analysis of professional golfers John Daly and Laura

   that elite, corpulent athletes might enact through their mere presence,
   as well as through their public ability to compete with idealized
   athletic bodies. That sport and dominant beliefs about sport contribute
   to disciplining bodies is not a point of contention for us. It is,
   however, unclear where the disciplining lines are drawn, and what
   happens when bodies that resist corporeal rationality refuse to
   disappear. What are the consequences of/for publicly successful,
   undisciplined bodies operating instead in a corporeal irrationality? Of
   course this entire line of questioning suggests fissures in the
   disciplining systems of corporeal rationality outlined by several

AB This article argues that while elements of Pierre Bourdieu's sociology
   are increasingly employed in American sociology, it is rare to find all
   three of Bourdieu's master concepts-habitus, capital, and
   field-incorporated into a single study. Moreover, these concepts are
   seldom deployed within a relational perspective that was fundamental to
   Bourdieu's thinking. The article "Bourdieu and Organizational Analysis"
   by Mustafa Emirbayer and Victoria Johnson is a welcomed exception, for
   it draws on all three of Bourdieu's pillar concepts to propose a
   relational approach to the study of organizations. It both reframes
   existing thinking about organizations, particularly from the
   neo-institutional and resource dependence schools, and indicates new
   directions for research in organizations to move. This paper evaluates
   their contribution calling attention to its many strengths and
   suggesting a few points that need future clarification and elaboration.

AB Adolescent substance use is an important area of research in sociology;
   however, there is a lack of research on nonmedical prescription drug
   use. The dearth of research on this topic is problematic given the
   relatively high prevalence of use among adolescents, the drastic
   increase in use in recent years, and the potential negative consequences
   from misusing prescription drugs. Using data from a national sample of
   adolescents, this research fills an important gap in the literature by
   testing one of the most prominent theories of deviance: social learning
   theory. Findings support variables related to social learning theory as
   correlates of nonmedical prescription drug use. Adolescents with
   definitions that are pro-substance use, whose peers use drugs, and whose
   parents and peers have attitudes that condone substance use are more
   likely to report nonmedical prescription drug use in the past year.
   Important implications and future research directions are discussed.

   students in upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses to engage
   in exercises that increase quantitative literacy, and paper competitions
   reward them for doing so.

   project uses wage and sex composition data that allows students to learn
   actively how data are used to study general trends and changes over
   time. It encourages students to explore the reality of their possible
   careers and fields in terms of wages, proportion of women and men, and
   other factors. Sharon Bird's class exercise requires students to
   consider the interactional dynamics of everyday work life and encourages
   them to see the subtle processes of marginalization and exclusion while
   also thinking about how to overcome gender biases. Some of this
   information will contribute to student angst about inequality in the
   workplace; thus, we conclude with suggestions for decreasing potential
   student distress and increasing student empowerment.

AB Driven by the popularity of social capital theories, the concept of

   this area relies on exclusively "structural" thinking, attributing group
   identification to mechanisms such as the arrangement of physical space,
   power relations, or high investment requirements. Often neglected is a
   strand of theory that attributes gemeinschaft to shared moral order and
   culture. Using data from the Urban Communes Project, this article
   directly tests the influence of both structural and cultural mechanisms
   in producing the experience of community. Although the results show that
   both structural and cultural mechanisms are positively correlated with
   gemeinschaft, they also confirm the existence of shared moral order as
   the most likely proximate mechanism for creating community in these
   groups. Analyses using fuzzy-set techniques illustrate how culture and
   structure combine to sustain-or inhibit-the experience of community.

   this study examines how a group of Turkish men experience and assign
   significance to the activity of caring for domestic pigeons. Building on
   approaches to ethnicity that follow the "cognitive turn," as well as
   recent studies of human-anitnal interaction and cultural examinations of
   nature and the environment, this article demonstrates how: (1) these men
   frame their animal practices within their understandings of ethnicity,
   culture, and territory; and (2) communal relationships formed through
   pigeon caretaking reinforce definitions of Turkish ethnicity and culture
   for participants. Beyond offering in situ data on the link between
   animal practices and ethnicity, the analyses and case suggest how and

   forged relationships to examine the reciprocal relationship between
   resources and the verification of a person identity and role identity.
   The findings reveal that the relationship between resource use and
   identity verification is mutually reinforcing: resource use facilitates
   identity verification and identity verification increases the resources
   available for future use. This reciprocal relationship occurs across
   identities and over time. The results provide insights on the idea that
   resources at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are mobilized among
   social actors to support the self and each other, help maintain a system
   of interaction, and reproduce culture and social structure.

AB The authors draw on developmental psychopathology, life course
   sociology, and scholarship on educational processes to develop a
   conceptual framework for understanding the association of children's
   mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this
   framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of
   attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider
   diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent
   classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and
   externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the
   classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school
   completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three
   sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude,
   disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational
   expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude
   and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health
   problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational
   trajectories.

AB The credibility of quantitative social science benefits from policies
   that increase confidence that results reported by one researcher can be
   verified by others. Concerns about replicability have increased as the
   scale and sophistication of analyses increase the possible dependence of
   results on subtle analytic decisions and decrease the extent to which
   published articles contain full descriptions of methods. The author
   argues that sociology should adopt standards regarding replication that
   minimize its conceptualization as an ethical and individualistic matter
   and advocates for a policy in which authors use independent online
   archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating
   published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the
   conditions of availability for any necessary materials that are not
   provided. The author responds to several objections that might be raised
   to increasing the transparency of quantitative sociology in this way and
   offers a candidate replication policy for sociology.

AB Sociologists have long reflected on what should be taught in sociology.
   In recent years, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) has
   produced several important publications on key principles and learning
   goals for the introductory course, However, little current work has
   systematically examined what peer-recognized leaders in the field deem
   important for introductory sociology. This paper is an effort to fill
   this research gap. Our research questions include: What do leaders think
   students should understand after an introduction to sociology course? Do
   the goals of Teaching Award winners differ from those of other leaders?
   How do the leaders' goals compare with those expressed in leading SoTL
   publications? To address these questions, we interviewed a sample of 44
   leaders in 2005-2006. Using qualitative content analysis, we
   systematically coded, analyzed, and compared their goals.

AB Teaching about intersecting, fluid and historically contingent
   identities has been taken up extensively within the sociology of race,
   class and gender and women's studies. Oddly, the case of Jewish women
   has been virtually left out of this robust literature. This article
   explores the challenges raised through teaching the course "Jewish Women
   in Contemporary America," and links these challenges to the pedagogy of
   race, class and gender more broadly. Using the classroom as a research
   site, the authors conducted post-course interviews with students and
   kept detailed field notes on class sessions. The authors use Judith
   Butler's theorization of performativity to analyze classroom dynamics.
   After redesigning and teaching the course a second time, the authors
   conclude that the relationship between "experience" and "theory" must be
   constantly interrogated by both instructor and students; that personal
   narratives merit space within the classroom, but must be problematized;
   and a critical Jewish Women's Studies, based on illuminating the
   socially constructed and hybrid character of contemporary Jewish
   American women's identities, can help to expose the tendency to
   methodological essentialism still prevalent in much of the feminist
   race, class, and gender literature.

AB Affirmative action, a controversial topic about which students have many
   misconceptions, lends itself especially well to a sociological analysis.
   This paper describes an approach to teaching that: 1) informs students
   of different affirmative action programs; 2) gives them the opportunity
   to apply and integrate a variety of concepts and research findings
   covered in our sociology courses; 3) allows us to assess how well
   students understand affirmative action and to what degree they retain
   myths about the programs, and 4) covers an emotionally charged topic
   with enough depth to go beyond surface reactions. We find that this
   integrated approach dispels some of the most common myths, leads
   students to become more thoughtful and analytical, and gives them a good
   foundation from which to examine affirmative action in the future.

AB Jeffrey Alexander's recent book on cultural sociology argues that
   sociologists must grant the realm of ideas autonomy to determine
   behavior, unencumbered by interference from instrumental or material
   factors. He criticizes the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu as "weak" for
   failing to give autonomy to culture by reducing it to self-interested
   behavior that immediately reflects class position. However, Alexander's
   arguments seriously distort and misstate Bourdieu's theory, which
   provides for the relative autonomy of culture through the concepts of
   habitus and field. Because habitus is a set of durable dispositions
   conditioned by past structures, it may contradict the changed structures
   of the present. Further, the influence of the habitus is always mediated
   by the structure and strategies of the field of contest in which it is
   deployed, so that the same habitus may motivate different actions in
   different circumstances. However, Alexander is correct to argue that in
   Bourdieu's theory culture generally serves to reproduce, not contradict
   social structures. Yet Bourdieu addresses this and other problems in his
   later work, in which he argues for the existence of certain cultural
   universals transcending particular structures.

   will attempt to show that the logic of turning-point arguments does not
   disprove historical causality but, on the contrary, depends on belief in
   causality. Sometimes, this is only an implicit belief in the cliches of
   folk historiography; occasionally, a serious sociology is explicitly
   invoked. In either case, there is a tendency to misperceive how
   historical causality works through broadly-based processes that are not

AB Travis Hirschi's control or social bonding theory argues that those
   persons who have strong and abiding attachments to conventional society
   (in the form of attachments, involvement, investment, and belief) are
   less likely to deviate than persons who have weak or shallow bonds.
   Later, Gottfredson and Hirschi moved away from the social bond as the
   primary factor in deviance, and toward an emphasis on self-control. In
   short, low self-control is associated with higher levels of deviance and
   criminality irrespective of the strength or weakness of one's social
   bonds. In this article I argue that Talcott Parsons' AGIL schema easily
   incorporates Hirschi's social bond into its broader analytical
   framework. Furthermore, from within the logical framework of Parsons'
   system, Hirschi's move from an emphasis on social bonds to an emphasis
   on self-control is wholly compatible with, and even anticipated by, the
   AGIL schema. The article illustrates, and argues for, the continuing
   importance of theoretical subsumption in sociology and criminology.
   Lastly, a set of testable hypotheses is generated based upon this
   theoretical reformulation.

AB Here we assess the limitations of "social physics" methods for making
   predictions of future social conditions in order to contribute to the
   development of an alternative model of scientific sociology. First, we
   discuss the complexities inherent in causal analyses of social
   phenomena, where social organizing principles change historically and
   causal forces interact to generate outcomes. Second, we analyze the
   assumptions that underlie prediction in the social sciences by using the
   population projections of demographers as an illustrative example.
   Demographers typically make projections assuming the future will be the
   same as the (recent) past. This approach neglects the possibility of
   abrupt historical change, contingent events, and emergent social
   structures. Third, we argue that historical contingency is an essential
   and necessary consideration in any analysis of the world. A historical
   materialist approach provides the basis for better formulating
   nomothetic and idiographic modes of explanation and appreciates the
   important connections between the two. Sociological inquiry should be an
   attempt to distinguish between truly nomothetic processes and emergent
   historical background conditions that only appear nomothetic in a
   specific historical era. We close with an argument for the importance of
   developing a sociological science that runs parallel to nonmechanistic
   approaches in the biological sciences.

AB Although the philosophy of pragmatism influenced American sociology,
   specifically that of symbolic interactionism, its use as a tool for
   explanation of everyday life has been underutilized throughout
   sociology. In this article, pragmatism, specifically the ideas of George
   Herbert Mead and John Dewey provide a framework for the understanding of
   grieving, specifically as it relates to people with mental retardation.
   Both Mead and Dewey's use and inclusion of physics into their
   philosophies proved paramount in their assertions regarding Cartesian or
   ontological dualism. They then demonstrated through the inclusion of
   quantum physics how to avoid positivism, thereby creating the necessary
   link of science with human perception and human action. Mead's use of
   the Theory of Relativity, as well as Sociality; and Dewey's
   incorporation of the Uncertainty Principle, and addressing the sum of
   possibilities, provides a context where the grieving process of people
   with mental retardation will be much more pronounced. People with mental
   retardation, by definition, through their neural networks have an
   inability to perceive existence in a manner that is functionally the
   same as the rest of the population. Their abilities influence how people
   with mental retardation relate to themselves or environment, thereby
   creating either fewer realities or systems from which to interact, or
   creating ones that are functionally dissimilar from the typical
   population, hence the label "mental retardation;" therefore, the loss of
   someone or something creates a greater hole or emptiness for people with
   mental retardation than the rest of society.

AB Recently, there has been a proliferation of measures responding to

   rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological
   concept of reactivity-the idea that people change their behavior in
   reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured-offers a useful lens
   for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed
   for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of
   public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms,
   self-fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and
   then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This
   approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures
   change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is
   important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more
   systematically.

   "organizational imprinting hypothesis," is frequently cited but remains
   little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship
   studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws
   on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in
   selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may
   remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the
   organization in question. The founding of the Paris Opera under Louis
   XIV serves as the basis for theorizing organizational imprinting at

   A more interpretive approach to the explanation of Salem is proposed: an
   analysis of the intersection of the gendered symbolization of witchcraft
   in colonial Massachusetts and the larger tensions within Puritan culture
   at the close of the 17th century. A broad theoretical implication of
   this interpretive shift is also proposed: that a cultural-sociological
   approach to witch-hunting as symbolic action can bring together feminist
   theorizations of witch-hunting as an exercise in patriarchal power with
   the social history of the broad, structural causes of witch-hunting in

   and Census counts as social constructions of the moral phenomena we call
   race. In the process, students are introduced to Census data and the
   Census web site as well as to historical and theoretical literature on
   the social construction of race. Students are then asked to reflect
   critically about the scientific practices in which race is constructed
   as a social fact, and in particular, to consider their own roles in
   these practices as users and subjects of race categories. The larger
   goal is to help students to develop a critical sociological imagination

AB Mirroring increased cultural and disciplinary attention to sexuality,
   many introductory sociology textbooks have begun to include coverage of
   the topic. Our study first assesses the extent of textual coverage of
   sexuality in a sample of 38 introductory textbooks published after 2000.
   Secondly, we focus on 14 textbooks with a sexuality chapter and/or
   textbooks with more than the average textual coverage of sexuality. We
   find that the emergent "core" of the sociology of sexuality centers on
   sex research, historical and cross-cultural trends in sexuality, media
   representations, gender and sexuality, homosexuality and society, and
   sexual violence. These textbooks vary widely in their attention to the
   intersection of race, class and sexuality and theoretical applications.
   We find lingering heteronormativity, homogenization of homosexuality,
   and problematic representations of non-normative sexuality within the
   chapters. We conclude with comments on the relevance of these findings
   and offer some suggestions to ensure that coverage of sexuality better
   reflects scholarship and discourse within the discipline.

AB Eggs and sperm are parallel bodily goods in that each contributes half
   of the reproductive material needed to create life. Yet these cells are
   produced by differently sexed bodies, allowing for a comparative
   analysis of how the social process of bodily commodification varies
   based on sex and gender Drawing on interview and observational data from
   two egg agencies and two sperm banks in the United States, this article
   compares how staff recruit, screen, market, and compensate women and men
   donors. Results show how gendered norms inspire more altruistic rhetoric
   in egg donation than in sperm donation, producing different regimes of
   bodily commodification for women and men. I conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings for debates in sociology of gender about
   biological differences among women and men and the cultural norms
   attributed to these differences; debates in economic sociology about how
   social factors shape the expansion of the market; and debates in medical
   sociology about the intersection of the market and medical practice.

AB We define a "hot potato" to be a good that may be traded a finite number
   of times, but which becomes a bad if and when it can no longer be
   exchanged. We describe a game involving such goods, and show that
   non-acceptance is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for rational
   egoists. Contrastingly, experiments with human subjects show willingness
   to accept such goods under a variety of conditions. Acceptance of the
   hot potato is positively related to payoff size and to the length of the
   remaining chain, but negatively related to the number of potential
   exchange partners. We find that subjects' behaviors are consistent with
   collectively oriented behavior, in contrast with their personal
   accounts. Implications for rational choice theory and economic sociology
   are discussed.

AB Patterns of postsecondary attendance in the United States continue to be
   stratified by socioeconomic background and race/ethnicity. We suggest
   that inequalities in knowledge of the costs of going to college
   contribute to persistent patterns of stratification. We hypothesize that
   disadvantaged parents who believe their child will attend college are
   less certain of the costs of college attendance than more advantaged
   parents. As a result, they are less able or willing to provide an
   estimate of the costs of college attendance, more likely to
   over-estimate those costs if they do provide an estimate, and more
   likely to make larger errors in estimation than comparable middle-class
   or white parents. Using nationally representative data, we find mixed
   support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents
   and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college
   tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On
   average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that
   are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We discuss
   implications of these findings for sociological theory and for
   inequality in postsecondary education. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB This paper examines social pattern analysis, the yet-unarticulated
   research strategy that guides formal sociologists in their efforts to
   distill generic social patterns from their specific cultural,
   situational, and historical contexts. Following in the implicit
   methodological footsteps of Georg Simmel, social pattern analysts view
   specific sociohistorical configurations as mere instantiations of such
   patterns, thereby deliberately disregarding various idiosyncrasies of
   the particular communities, events, and social situations they examine.
   Analytically focused, they thus draw their evidence from multiple social
   contexts, thereby making their essentially decontextualized findings
   more generalizable. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to historians and
   ethnographers, they try to highlight universality rather than
   singularity, thereby focusing their attention on the common formal
   features of any given pattern across those contexts while deliberately
   ignoring differences among its various specific manifestations. The
   outcome of such transcultural, transsituational, and transhistorical
   (that is, transcontextual) mode of inquiry is an empirically grounded
   "social geometry."

   sociology is in a unique position to evaluate and specify a
   theoretically robust concept of environment. Building on insights from
   classical and contemporary social theory, the authors argue that the
   study of genetic influence on behavior needs to incorporate sociological
   understandings of contextual effects. The authors propose five points
   for evaluating behavioral genetic studies' conceptualization of
   environment and use those points to evaluate three exemplary recent

   Bourdieu offered a highly suggestive reading and analysis of Gustave
   Flaubert's Sentimental Education. Bourdieu's approach has been
   extraordinarily influential in recent years in both the sociology of
   culture and, increasingly, literary criticism. Yet, his treatment of
   Flaubert's work, this article argues, despite its indisputable insight
   is problematic in several ways. This article has two objectives in this
   connection: (1) to show how the weaknesses in Bourdieu's treatment of
   the novel point to certain key weaknesses in his broader social theory,
   and (2) to use a parallel reading of the same novel both to demonstrate
   said weaknesses and to embark on a discussion of the future
   possibilities of the sociology of literature, arguing that though we
   should not simply engage in Bourdieuian readings of literary texts, a
   consideration of the late sociologist's work could inspire a renewed,
   vigorous research program in this area.

AB In this article, Jean-Paul Sartre's relationship to the negritude
   movement and black intellectuals in Paris between the 1940s and the
   1960s is examined in sociological and historical context. Sartre's
   version of negritude, developed in his 1948 treatise "Orphee noir"
   prefacing Leopold Senghor's collection of African and Malagasy poetry,
   is analyzed in terms of its role in shaping the discourses and debates
   surrounding negritude and the relationship of black intellectuals to the
   rest of French society. Sartre's phenomenological theories of race,
   juxtaposing dominant and subaltern ideologies, are contrasted with his
   dialectic of negritude. The antinegritude movement of the late 1960s is
   also considered with reference to Sartre's theories and inspiration.
   During this period, the relationship that Sartre established with
   Martinican intellectual and revolutionary Frantz Fanon helped to place
   Sartre into prominence as an activist and a theorist of decolonization
   and Third World politics. Sartre's theories of race, self, and society
   were integral to both his early and later works and warrant review as
   approaches to the sociology of culture and sources of reflection for
   contemporary postcolonial studies.

   about persons who are homeless and to increase students' sense of
   efficacy for engaging in social advocacy. Through Breaking Ground,
   students formed a partnership with advocates and homeless clients to
   raise public awareness about homelessness and to organize advocacy and
   fund-raising events for the agency partner. The research element of the
   project used pre-tests and post-tests to assess changes in students'
   beliefs about social justice, self-efficacy, and perceptions of
   homelessness. When compared to students who took the class, but did not
   participate in the described service-learning project, Breaking Ground
   students experienced significant changes in a positive direction in
   their perceptions of individuals who are homeless. There were also some
   small changes in student feelings of self-efficacy and opinions on
   social justice. I explain these results and provide suggestions for
   implementation of similar projects.

AB When it comes to issues of equality and redistribution, sociologists are
   particularly prone to think in anti-cultural terms. External, objective,
   and material forces are conceived as determining unequal distributions
   without reference to the wills of actors via hegemony, domination,
   subordination. But if inequality is imposed by material and coercive
   force, then it can be remedied only by accumulating power and
   counterforce, and by exercising them in an instrumental and potentially
   coercive way. What is missing from this account is meaning, the
   recognition of its relative autonomy. The imposition of inequality, and
   struggles over justice, inclusion, and distribution, are mediated by
   cultural structures. Inequalities are nested inside the discourse of
   civil society, and so are demands for equality. Vis-a-vis the binary
   codes of civil society, protest movements pollute hegemonic forces and
   purify subordinate groups in its name.

   the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the
   use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi
   in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques
   derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not
   considered classical. Ironically, the Canal du Midi was promoted in
   propaganda campaigns, defining France as the New Rome, but the peasant
   women who actually carried Roman culture in their eyes and hands were
   not socially elevated enough to be New Romans, so they were written out
   of this story.

   sociology. The paper takes up Michael Burawoy's call for public
   sociology and discusses what rural sociologists have to offer to publics
   and how we stand to gain as a discipline in working with publics. The
   paper argues that rural sociologists' ability to adopt a cosmopolitan
   view while negotiating the complexities of global/local processes
   provides a useful theoretical stance for doing public sociology.
   Methodologically, both feminist methods and various approaches to
   networks can guide us as we do public sociology. Then, the paper
   provides two examples of recent efforts to do public sociology with a
   women's community group in Sri Lanka in response to the tsunami and with
   the Pennsylvania Women's Agricultural Network to illustrate the
   possibilities and limitations of working with networks. In conclusion,
   the paper addresses opportunities for doing public sociology, the
   challenges we face as we go public, and future work that is needed to
   develop theoretically and methodologically strong public rural
   sociology.

AB This research examines the individual-level and contextual correlates of
   punitive attitudes in the United States. Prior research suggests that
   the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas
   influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest
   on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as
   threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the
   concept of "perceived threat" and examining the association between
   aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive sentiments.
   Analysis of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong
   predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in
   areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a
   recent increase in the size of the African American population are more
   punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to material resources for white
   respondents. The results agree with racial threat perspectives on social
   control, but we go beyond extant research by unpacking the micro-level
   processes that are central to the threat hypothesis.

AB The purpose of this paper is to identify and explain a rather large
   impediment to the use of mixed method research designs that begin with
   survey data. Although supplementing quantitative survey analyses with
   insights derived from qualitative work is increasingly popular, there is
   also heightened concern about ethical issues in research, particularly
   the confidentiality of human research subjects. Surprisingly, there has
   been little discussion about how these two trends intersect, and the
   extent to which they are compatible. In this paper I argue that because
   of the important obligation to protect human research subjects'
   identities (and, to a lesser extent, the proliferation of publicly
   available datasets), few researchers are actually in a position to
   implement this type of mixed methodology. Despite their noted advantages
   over mono-method designs, mixed method designs that start with
   quantitative data and subsequently supplement it with qualitative
   insights may not achieve the dominance that many have supposed and
   desired. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Findings reveal that low-income rural Whites predominantly use
   ideologies of individualism to interpret the inequalities experienced by
   others, they employ a pseudostructural level analysis tempered by
   individualism to interpret their experience of health and income
   inequalities, and they respond collectively along racial and national

   not yet been developed. To redress this, the author presents a
   theoretical framework that builds upon the insights of Connell and
   others, offers a definition of hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic
   femininity that allows for multiple configurations within each, and that
   can be used empirically across settings and groups. The author also
   outlines how hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic femininity are
   implicated in and intersect with other systems of inequality such as

AB The Zapatistas and Sandinistas both invoked historical figures in their
   rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is
   explained by a model of path-dependent memory work that is sensitive to
   how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of
   historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct
   reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of
   different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational
   trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic
   possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing
   contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the
   opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories
   condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the
   collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics
   literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take
   seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.

AB This article traces the transatlantic diffusion of Pierre Bourdieu's
   ideas into American sociology. We find that rather than being received
   as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate
   new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used
   their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu's
   sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program
   in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for
   presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of
   articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far
   from a recent fad, Bourdieu's ideas steadily diffused into American
   sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books
   in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu's key concepts
   (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four
   core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).

AB For several decades, the concept of the niche has enriched sociological
   theory. The niche represents the position or function of an entity, such
   as an organization or population of organizations, within a larger
   community environment. Using the concept of the niche allows researchers
   to go beyond classifying entities to understanding (a) their life
   chances under different and changing environmental conditions and (b)
   how they interact under the competitive conditions induced by a finite
   environment. We briefly review the intellectual history of the niche
   concept as it came from bioecology to sociology. The bulk of the article
   reviews the two major streams of sociological research that use the
   niche concept: the population ecology of organizations and McPherson's
   ecology of affiliation. Finally, we survey commonalities between these
   approaches and highlight new directions, including applications that
   take the niche concept well beyond its origins in organizational
   studies.

AB Sociologists use negative feedback loop systems to explain identity
   processes, interpersonal behavior, crowd behavior, organizational
   behavior, social relationships, and the behavior of political systems.
   Control system models help us to understand how actors enact social
   roles with enough stability to preserve institutional arrangements,
   while still demonstrating remarkable creativity in unusual
   circumstances. These theories take us away from an oversocialized view
   of the actor, without relegating us to exclusive reliance on grounded
   theory. They provide a foundation for several generative theories of
   adaptive, goal-seeking behavior on the part of social actors and
   institutions. This chapter begins by tracing the history of control
   theorizing in sociology, then-describes several contemporary theoties
   that rely on control imagery, reviews the empirical support for these
   theories, describes some of their significant points of overlap and
   departure, and examines some of the key tested-and untested-implications
   of a control system approach in sociology.

   with the global prison yard. Strange is how we, global spectators of the
   prison abuses, continue to stand on shaky cardboard boxes of rising and
   falling empires with hoods of amnesia and evasion put on our minds, and
   sophisticated media wires of true or false fears manipulating our
   emotions. To escape from prison, a mystic once said, one must first

   question of change in the meaning of nature resulting from the rise of

   address both issues, general audience magazines were examined to uncover
   trends in the meanings of nature from 1945 through 1980. A qualitative
   and semiotic approach was used to examine the data. The analysis
   revealed a predominance of appreciative meanings and little qualitative
   change despite the rise of environmental struggle midway through the
   study period. Implications and the relationship of this finding to other
   relevant cultural research in environmental sociology were discussed.

AB Some commentators have suggested that the embrace of "identity politics"
   has gone too far and that we are now in a putative postidentity moment.
   Within the academy this argument has been articulated from two divergent
   positions. The first derides identity politics as a move away from
   materialist concerns. The second, more conservative, position argues
   that identity politics is at fault for being over-political, for reading
   politics into every aspect of knowledge production. I argue that
   identity is in fact a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition
   for any effective oppositional politics. I further suggest that these
   arguments are themselves evidence of the articulation of (white, male,
   and heterosexual) institutional power within the academic field of
   (sport) sociology. As an alternative, I argue for the renewal of a
   critical public sport sociology that draws upon and extends the cultural
   studies tradition of committed and engaged scholarship.

   in sociology, extended to medical sociology as that area of
   specialization was developing, and seeks to apply his ideas to the
   development of SoTL in sociology today. I make three specific
   recommendations: (1) maintaining the independence of SoTL as a separate
   area of interest and scholarship while enthusiastically working with and
   drawing upon the work of others within and outside sociology, (2)
   broadening the content of SoTL investigations to address teaching and
   learning from additional perspectives, and (3) utilizing an increasingly

   dimensions of teaching and learning.

AB Academic sociologists have recently increased their focus on improving

   teachers and universities, improving curriculum, and enhancing teacher
   training. I propose that this list be expanded to include setting
   curricular standards. Current trends in educational reform center on
   standards-based education, and although many social science disciplines
   have adapted to this trend, sociology's focus on standards is limited to
   undergraduate education. I analyze the existing state sociology
   standards by measuring them against the American Sociological
   Association's (ASA) Advanced Placement Sociology course, the National
   Council for Social Studies standards, and the sample learning goals from
   Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major Updated (McKinney et al. 2005).
   The results indicate that there are some substantial differences in the
   learning goals set forth by the ASA and those set forth by the states. I
   suggest that since the academic sociological community is in an ideal
   position to address high school social studies content in a variety of
   disciplines, we should expand our efforts in this area.

   voted to "encourage departments to consider and implement the
   recommendations" for the undergraduate curriculum found in Liberal
   Learning. These recommendations suggest a cumulative curriculum,
   including a four-level sequence and a capstone course. I assess the
   extent to which these recommendations had been adopted a decade after

PD JAN 2007
PY 2007
AB Decades of research have documented the positive impacts of cooperative
   learning on student success: increased learning, retention through
   graduation, improved critical thinking, and intrinsic motivation. One
   cooperative teaching technique, however, has received relatively little
   attention. In the two-stage cooperative, group, or "pyramid" exam
   students first take an exam individually-as in traditional testing-and
   then take the same exam together with their learning group, with the
   exam grade being a weighted combination of their individual and group
   scores. This approach uses the exam itself not only for evaluation, but
   also as a learning tool. Although some researchers have studied group
   exams, they have not isolated the impact of group tests from individual
   achievernent-an important omission. Using data from a mass lecture
   introductory sociology course, I found that holding individual
   achievement constant the group exam process significantly increased
   learning both for students who knew the material initially and for those
   who did not. This suggests that cooperative exams not only enhance
   learning but also allow for the process and form of testing to become
   more closely linked to the process and form of teaching and learning.

AB Routes to economic development attract considerable attention in
   community and rural sociology. Social scientists draw increasingly on
   studies of social capital and environmental surroundings as they examine
   the factors that facilitate and inhibit economic development. However,
   few empirical analyses exist that analyze the impact of the combination
   of social infrastructure and natural capital on different forms of
   economic development such as on industrial recruitment and
   self-development. Using data collected from six communities in
   Washington State, the interaction of a community's social infrastructure
   and natural capital on industrial recruitment and self-development
   efforts is examined. Results suggest that while natural capital
   positively impacts a community's successful recruitment of outside
   industries, it is not significant for a community's level of
   self-development. However, a community's social infrastructure, measured
   by the existence of active civic organizations, local businesses that
   support local community projects, community-wide fund-raising capacity,
   and extra-local linkages to nearby communities, state, and national
   agencies, positively affects both industrial recruitment and
   self-development. These findings illustrate the need for communities and
   local activists to carefully weigh their advantages and potential
   shortcomings when deciding on an economic development strategy.

AB Research on quality of life in sociology is largely focused on a narrow
   range of dimensions including affect, happiness and satisfaction. It
   largely avoids a concern with the meanings that provide people with the
   purpose, significance, validity and coherence that are a basis of social
   relationships and social integration. Evidence is presented that people
   experience lowered affect in some challenging and stressful situations
   that simultaneously generate meanings that enhance the quality of their
   lives, and that experiences of high affect along with impoverished
   meanings produce low quality of life. This strongly suggests that
   meaning may be a more fundamental dimension of life quality than is
   affect. Meanings may also enhance the quality of life by motivating
   people's involvement in activities that promote social integration and
   the quality of social relationships. Sociologists should work to further
   develop the theoretical and empirical basis of quality of life so that
   it more fully includes dimensions that reflect the meanings that provide
   purpose and significance in people's lives.

AB This article uses the puzzle of diverging trajectories of immigrant

   the study of citizenship and political incorporation. I consider three

   adoption as the product of cost/benefit calculations; an approach that
   understands individuals and groups to be differentially endowed with the
   skills, resources and interests necessary to acquire citizenship; and an
   approach that believes countries adopt citizenship regimes which either
   include or shut out immigrants. I then offer an alternative model of
   structured mobilization which views political incorporation as a social
   process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and
   local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by
   government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement. The material
   and symbolic resources provided by government shape the ability and
   interest of "social helpers" to assist with and mobilize around
   citizenship. The article concludes by considering the implications of
   structured mobilization for various debates in immigration and political

AB Each workplace operates within a cultural context in which local
   features of interaction influence how employees conceptualize their

   understanding these idiocultures as action arenas helps to specify how
   group knowledge, practices, and beliefs are expressed and affect
   occupational identity. To demonstrate the power of microcultures, I
   analyzed local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) through
   ethnographic methods. I focused on the Chicago office, demonstrating how
   its culture, which emphasizes autonomy and resistance to authority,
   shapes the staff's images of scientific practice and the contours of
   being a scientist. The culture is revealed in their joking relations as
   well as in other office traditions. I then compared this culture with
   that of Flowerland, a spin-up office established in the 1990s. These two
   offices use their cultures to differentiate themselves, creating
   distinct work practices. As all work groups have local cultures, giving
   greater attention to small-group dynamics helps us understand how
   workers define themselves, how cultures differ, and how the effects of
   these differences shape the experience of work.

AB This article examines historical transformations of Japanese collective
   memory of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by utilizing a theoretical
   framework that combines a model of reiterated problem solving and a
   theory of cultural trauma. I illustrate how the event of the nuclear
   fallout in March 1954 allowed actors to consolidate previously
   fragmented commemorative practices into a master frame to define the
   postwar Japanese identity in terms of transnational commemoration of
   "Hiroshima." I also show that nationalization of trauma of "Hiroshima"
   involved a shift from pity to sympathy in structures of feeling about
   the event. This historical study suggests that a reiterated
   problem-solving approach can be efficacious in analyzing how
   construction of national memory of a traumatic event connects with the
   recurrent reworking of national identity, on the one hand, and how a
   theory of cultural trauma can be helpful in exploring a synthesis of
   psychological and sociological approaches to commemoration of a
   traumatic event, on the other.

AB This article examines the impact of the Internet on the social
   construction of reality. By revisiting the lifeworld Berger and Luckmann
   depicted 40 years ago, I seek to highlight the changes the Internet has
   brought to our everyday lives. I argue that the spread of the Internet
   has altered the conditions of interpersonal contact, as well as the
   realms of the lifeworld in which we live. Specifically, the Internet has
   created a new spatiotemporal zone-the zone of the "there and now," a new
   mode of communication-the electronic text chat, and a new social
   gathering place-the online public domain. These creations have in turn
   contributed to the rise of the realm of "consociated contemporaries,"
   the formation of a new matrix of social contact, the maintenance of the
   subjective reality through text chat, and the involvement of the online
   world in the socialization process. In light of such changes, I join
   those who call for a revision of the existing sociological stance on
   human interaction.

AB In this work I argue that the study of deviance as distinct from crime
   is no longer a productive specialty in sociology. I attribute the cause
   of the demise of the field to its over reliance on the assumption of
   cultural relativity. In contrast to the relativist position, I argue
   that behavior that causes harm will be more likely to be condemned by
   public opinion and that there will be less variation in attitudes toward
   behaviors that cause more harm. Using data from the General Social
   Survey, I find support for the hypothesis that a "deviant" sexual
   behavior that can have a victim, extramarital sex, will be more
   consensually condemned than "deviant" sexual behaviors that do not have
   victims, premarital sex and homosexual sex. I recommend that future
   research focus on the study of values, as the validity of cultural
   relativity can be empirically evaluated.

AB This article examines why the Stonewall riots became central to gay
   collective memory while other events did not. It does so through a
   comparative-historical analysis of Stonewall and four events similar to
   it that occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the
   1960s. The Stonewall riots were remembered because they were the first
   to meet two conditions: activists considered the event commemorable and
   had the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle. That this
   conjuncture occurred in New York in 1969, and not earlier or elsewhere,
   was a result of complex political developments that converged in this
   time and place. The success of the national commemorative ritual planned
   by New York activists depended on its resonance, not only in New York
   but also in other US. cities. Gay community members found Stonewall
   commemorable and the proposed parade an appealing form for
   commemoration. The parade was amenable to institutionalization, leading
   it to survive over time and spread around the world. The Stonewall story
   is thus an achievement of gay liberation rather than an account of its
   origins.

AB This ethnographic account of the rituals of risk and error after NASA's
   Columbia accident reveals the mechanisms by which sociological theory
   traveled across the disciplinary boundary to public and policy domains.
   The analysis shows that analogy was the instigator of it all, enabled by
   the social mechanisms of professional legitimacy, conversation,
   technologies, time, networks, and social support. It demonstrates the
   work sociologists do when theory travels from professional sociology to
   nonacademic audiences and what happens to the theory and the sociologist
   in the process. It reveals the tensions when professional sociology,
   critical sociology, public sociology, and policy sociology are joined. A
   study of sociology in the field, it shows how sociologists negotiate the
   meaning of their work in a nonacademic situation. Thus, this account
   contributes to research and theory on social boundaries, the diffusion
   of ideas, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and current debates
   about public sociology and the role of the sociologist, adding to the
   sociology of our own work.

   that they alter citizens' relationships to labor markets, directly

   indicate that net of military spending, nations with relatively large

AB While sociologists and the public at large are increasingly interested
   in the life conditions of animals, conceptual and empirical development
   of the topic is limited. This paper seeks to further develop the
   sociological research on attitudes toward animal well-being. We build on
   insights from contemporary stratification theory to explain the nature
   of animal attitudes and their determinants. We also extend past work by
   examining a broader range of factors related to attitudes about animal
   wellbeing, focusing on place, other social structural factors, and
   individuals' unique animal-related experiences. Data are from a survey
   of over 4,000 Ohio residents conducted in 2002. We find that childhood
   experience has the greatest place-based effect on attitudes. Other
   findings highlight the importance of social structural factors,
   suggesting support for the "underdog hypothesis." Women, people
   experiencing economic hardship, those with less education, younger and
   middle aged people, and blacks tend to be more concerned with animal
   well-being. Individualized, experiential variables are also important.
   Our results reflect the complexity of attitudes about animals and point
   to the need for greater sociological attention to factors left largely
   unexplored in previous studies, including childhood place-based factors,
   economic hardship, and individuals' unique animal-related experiences.

AB Cultural sociology agrees that meanings attributed to objects vary

   identities and competencies influence interpretation. Through an
   analysis of how 307 undergraduate students at a Midwestern state
   university interpreted a black-and-white photograph of an individual
   masturbating, this article finds that assessments of the degree to which
   the image should be considered art and/or pornography are associated
   with self-reported indicators of both cultural competencies and
   identities. Indicators of religious and conventional identities and of
   training with regard to photography stand out in this regard. The
   intersection of the constructions of pornography and art enabled the
   authors to classify participants as Nonartistic Conservatives,
   Nonartistic Liberals, Artistic Liberals, and Artistic Conservatives and
   to show that interpretations are a consequence of how persons are
   simultaneously situated in relation to both moral and aesthetic
   criteria.

   instrumentally inconsequential, how one conveys information affects the
   meaning of the telling. This article introduces the concepts of
   "notification norms" and the "information order," showing how the former
   constrain the behavior of nodes in social networks as well as enabling
   manipulation of the relationships that comprise those networks.
   "Notification" is defined as information transmission motivated by role
   obligations and notification norms as social rules that govern such
   transmission. These rules produce patterns of information dissemination
   different from what individual volition would yield and from what
   technology makes possible. The capacity to wield a socially sanctioned
   repertoire of notification rules is a learned competence. Competent
   notifiers must also understand the local epistemological ecology-the
   distribution and trajectory of information, as well as the projects,
   concerns, and priorities of one's fellows. This study of notification
   introduces the broader concept of "the information order" and is a first
   step in the project of a sociology of information.

AB This study contributes to the sociological study of suicide via an
   exploration of the implications and application of literary texts in
   sociological analysis. The examination of two pairs of literary texts
   suggests that some cases of suicide can be self-affirming. When the
   characters find themselves in circumstances that threaten their
   perception of who they are in their social contexts, they may choose the
   possibility of death over life with a change in self-concept. The
   interpretation of the four selected narrative cases of self-affirmative
   suicide is nestled in complexities of self-identity: two from The Iliad
   by Homer, and one each from Andorra and I'm Not Stiller by Max Frisch.
   Relating the findings to Turner's theory of impulsive versus
   institutional loci of real self, the article argues that institutionally
   constituted characters are more likely than impulsive-selves to find
   self-killing an acceptable resolution to their crises of identity. The
   findings are discussed in relation to classic theory in the sociology of
   suicide, concepts of the real self, and the use of literature in social
   science research.

   sociologists have returned to matching as a research methodology. In
   this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators
   are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are
   emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on
   ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant
   causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in
   practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis
   routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the
   assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice.
   Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used

AB Although all of us must teach against the text at times, I find myself

   question textbooks, which they regard as "gospel truth". How can we get
   our students to go beyond both textbook myths and mainstream folklore to
   grapple with misleading and inaccurate statements? In this article I
   suggest several strategies to raise awareness of myths about qualitative
   research, explain why several common statements about qualitative

AB The maximization of productivity and labor efficiency has been a
   hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of
   these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated
   provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view
   this model as a panacea for providing food to a modem industrial
   workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this
   system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial
   model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural
   community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in
   this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses
   toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in
   a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one
   such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize
   agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security,
   literacy, safety, and rebuilding rural communities. In this paper, I
   detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the
   development of community-based learning in the form of global and local
   public learning communities, service-learning advocacy, and
   international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of
   agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of
   sustainability, I developed a partnership with a Hungarian class which
   allowed students to compare and contrast approaches to sustainable
   development and probe the role of history and culture as causal forces
   in these endeavors. I describe my efforts to develop this partnership
   and weave opportunities for service-learning advocacy into the
   curriculum.

AB Although many of us would like to get beyond lecturing, we often lack
   concrete strategies for doing so, particularly in our larger classes.
   This paper suggests one such strategy for creating a discussion-based
   course. The success of such a course is predicated on students reading
   and thinking about the course material (receiving "first exposure")
   prior to attending class so that class time can be devoted to more
   substantively engaging activities grounded in guided discussion. The
   vehicle I propose for achieving this first exposure to the course
   material is the "Course Preparation Assignment" (CPA). This article
   explains the rationale for discussion-based courses, describes the
   development and use of CPAs, and assesses a discussion-based course by
   comparing it to a traditional lecture course on several outcomes. The
   assessment reveals that the use of these assignments to create a
   discussion-based course has been a great success, allowing me to foster
   student engagement with the course material by spending the majority of
   class time coordinating, facilitating, and leading discussions, rather
   than constantly lecturing at the students.

   utility extends to testing as well as projects and papers. In an effort
   to address these gaps, we used quasi-experimental and survey data to
   examine the effects of collaborative testing on Introduction to
   Sociology students' learning, behavior and attitudes. Findings indicate
   that collaborative testing improved students' behavior and attitudes. In
   comparison to a control group, students who participated in
   collaborative testing reported completing more of their assigned
   readings and had improved attitudes toward their learning, the testing
   process, and sociology.

AB In this paper I present a pedagogical method called Writing Answers to
   Learn (WAL) which combines Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and Exploratory
   Writing to address the interrelated pedagogical problems of
   misconceptions, resistance, retention, and transfer. I analyze the use
   of this combined method in a course on racial and ethnic relations and
   provide examples to suggest that students commonly use four ideologies
   to understand racial and ethnic inequality: blaming the victim,
   justification, naturalization, and colorblind racism. I describe how I
   helped students identify and unlearn these ideological misconceptions
   and replace them with a sociological conceptual framework. I analyze the
   results of a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test showing that
   students' use of ideology declined on each subsequent exam while their
   use of sociology increased during the semester and was partially
   retained months later. Finally I discuss the study's limitations and the
   utility of students learning the falseness of ideology.

AB Are American attitudes toward economic inequality different from those
   in other countries? One tradition in sociology suggests American
   "exceptionalism," while another argues for convergence across nations in
   social norms, such as attitudes toward inequality. This article uses
   International Social Survey Program (ISSP) microdata to compare
   attitudes in different countries toward what individuals in specific
   occupations "do earn " and what they "should earn," and to distinguish
   value preferences for more egalitarian outcomes from other confounding
   attitudes and perceptions. The authors suggest a method for summarizing
   individual preferences for the leveling of earnings and use kernel
   density estimates to describe and compare the distribution of individual
   preferences over time and cross-nationally. They find that subjective
   estimates of inequality in pay diverge substantially from actual data,
   and that although Americans do not, on the average, have different
   preferences for aggregate (in)equality, there is evidence for:
   1. Less awareness concerning the extent of inequality at the top of the
   income distribution in America
   2. More polarization in attitudes among Americans
   3. Similar preferences for "leveling down" at the top of the earnings
   distribution in the United States, but also
   4. Less concern for reducing differentials at the bottom of the
   distribution.

AB Research on the new managerial regimes has been hampered by its neglect
   of the question of human agency - specifically, the nature of workers'
   responses to the advent of the new forms of work organization. Drawing
   on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the
   author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and
   effects of workers' responses to the changes they confront in their work
   situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on
   structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the
   fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing
   a fourfold typology of workers' responses, the author shows how each
   type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These
   findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a
   relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and
   practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the
   restructuring of their jobs.

AB The author develops the concept of legal framing to expand theoretical
   knowledge on the cultural and symbolic processes that enable, constrain,
   and transform social movements. Merging insights from social movement
   theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the
   author argues that law is a type of " master frame," and that mobilizing
   law's " constitutive" symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely
   overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity,
   and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing
   processes through historical-narrative analysis of the women's movement
   and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical
   evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women's
   movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a
   symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of
   gender ("protective" vs. "equal" treatment) and that this contest was
   waged in explicitly legal terms.

AB "Balance" in the classroom has been the subject of recent debate in
   academic and public spheres, with some calling for legislation to
   prevent instructors from "indoctrinating" students. The debate over
   balance is important to sociology because the discipline is sometimes
   characterized as overtly liberal and activist; but the implications of
   balance for teaching and learning remain unclear. In this article, we
   present the results of a study in which we operationalized balance as
   students' perceptions of whether instructors discussed points of view
   other than their own and invited criticism of their ideas. Using OLS
   regression on undergraduate classes' quantitative evaluations of
   sociology instructors at Indiana University during the 2002-2003
   academic year (N = 99 classes), we asked whether classes perceived their
   sociology instructors to be balanced and whether positive perceptions
   led to better evaluations. We also asked about the relative influence of
   sociology classes' perceptions of balance compared to other influences.
   We found that most classes perceived their instructors as balanced and
   instructors who were perceived as being more balanced received better
   evaluations. However, we also found that balance was not as important as
   other factors in influencing evaluations. We discuss implications.

   enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence analysis
   to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network resources to
   buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain knowledge and
   legitimacy. During this period, networked property grew, stabilized, and
   involved a growing proportion of foreign capital. Cohesive networks of
   recombinant property were robust, and in fact integrated foreign
   investment. Although multinationals, through their subsidiaries,
   dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
   that they also built durable networks. These findings suggest that
   developing economies do not necessarily face a forced choice between
   networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.

AB Rather than seeking ivory-tower isolation, members of the Rural
   Sociological Society have always been distinguished by a willingness to
   work with specialists from a broad range of disciplines, and to work on
   some of the world's most challenging problems. What is less commonly
   recognized is that the willingness to reach beyond disciplinary
   boundaries can contribute not just to the solution of real-world
   problems, but also to the advancement of the discipline itself. This
   point is increasingly being illustrated in studies of
   environment-society relationships. Most past discussions of humans'
   roles in environmental problems have focused on overall or average human
   impacts, but rural sociologists have played leading roles in identifying
   what I have come to call "the double diversion." First, rather than
   being well-represented by averages, environmental damages are often
   characterized by high levels of disproportionality, with much or most of
   the harm being created by the diversion of environmental rights and
   resources to a surprisingly small fraction of the relevant social
   actors. The disproportionality appears to be made possible in part
   through the second diversion, namely distraction the diversion of
   attention, largely through the taken-for-granted but generally erroneous
   assumption that the environmental harm "must" be for the benefit Of us
   all. There are good reasons why rural sociologists would have been among
   the first to notice both of these "diversions"-and why they will give
   even greater attention to both in the future.

   comparing couple responses to survey items on the wife's autonomy in
   various domains using data from 23 communities in India, Pakistan,
   Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. We employ an item response model to
   show that the level of women's autonomy depends on whether wives or
   husbands are respondents and that the response categories do not have
   the same cognitive or semantic meanings to men and women. The
   disagreement between men and women varies across communities for reasons
   that are not easy to explain. The items also contain random measurement
   error that attenuates the correlation between spousal reports. We
   conclude that these survey questions are of limited utility for
   understanding differences in gender stratification across context. (c)

AB In this essay, I draw on a professional life history to suggest how
   sociological knowledge is generated by encounters with changing research
   opportunities, here called targets of opportunity. In my case, a study
   of rural communities led to unanticipated conclusions concerning
   buffering mechanisms that protected authorities by absorbing
   dissatisfactions and rebellions. Wartime research in a military setting
   identified sources of group solidarity and effective performance under
   stress. Major societal changes in racial/ethnic relations provided
   opportunities to develop new concepts and empirical findings. Synoptic
   studies of post-World War II American society led to extensive research
   on values and institutions. These macrosociological analyses of
   ethnicity and social systems, in turn, led me to a new sociology of war
   and interstate relations. I also offer here some critical reflections on
   recurrent issues and chronic controversies in American sociology. Final
   sections of the review deal with the continuing search for conceptual
   clarity and cumulative knowledge. I note the obstacles of disciplinary
   fragmentation, but my closing judgment is that sociology now has the
   base of substantial scientific knowledge and methodological expertise
   necessary for investigating crucial twenty-first century problems.

AB Sociology can be an important disciplinary bridge between the study of
   what demographers call forced migration and mortality and what legal
   sociologists and criminologists understand as war crimes. The challenge
   is to develop a critically informed sociological synthesis that joins
   our understanding of the frequently politicized health and violence
   dimensions of what are also diplomatically called "complex" humanitarian
   emergencies. The frequency of these emergencies is growing, and there is
   an increasing amount of data collected by governmental and
   nongovernmental organizations exposing large-scale violations of human
   rights and war crimes. Yet analyses of these data are often inadequate.
   Although the humanitarian emergency in Kosovo marked a high point in
   collaborative human rights research, the circumstances that allowed this
   collaboration are probably atypical. We consider how, in increasingly
   challenging circumstances such as the Darfur region of Sudan, population
   health and legal and criminological surveys can be joined to provide
   more comprehensive estimates of deaths resulting from violent attacks as
   well as from disease and starvation. The discipline of sociology, with
   its expertise in population-based surveys and other measurement and
   analytic techniques, has the capacity to bridge differences and to
   provide more meaningfully synthesized conclusions.

AB The literature on globalization and social movements emphasizes the
   ability of international non-governmental organizations to influence
   states and foster domestic social change. This article examines the
   dynamics of this process in an early international movement to combat
   prostitution in the late 1800s. Why did reformers succeed in their goal
   of abolishing the state regulation of prostitution earlier in some
   countries compared to others? A qualitative comparative-historical
   approach is used to outline local social movement dynamics and
   consequent paths to abolition in a subset of European countries (i.e.
   the Netherlands, France and Germany), as influenced by two international
   voluntary associations. The findings show that contestation between the
   associations - one more transnational than the other in practice -
   hampered abolitionist successes. International voluntary associations'
   organization, alliances and cultural framings, as they operated in local
   settings, affected the form of local movements as well as their
   outcomes. Rather than challenging state interests, international
   associations sometimes help to reinforce them.

AB This paper examines the articulation of goals and means of sociological
   instruction in course syllabi. Three questions guide this inquiry.
   First, do sociology instructors articulate common learning goals? Second
   what pedagogical means do instructors commonly employ to meet these
   goals? Third to what extent have sociology instructors incorporated the
   recommendations presented in Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major
   (Eberts et al. 1990) and in its updated version (McKinney et al. 2004)?
   To answer these questions, we analyzed syllabi from 418 courses
   published by the American Sociological Association's Teaching Resource
   Center. We found that aside from course-specific goals, most syllabi
   shared only a few general, abstract goals in common. The pedagogical
   methods or requirements of students tended to be fairly traditional
   (readings, writing, and exams). Requirements that required more active
   types of learning were less common. While these goals and means do seem
   to reflect what sociologists consider to be important, they do not
   correspond closely to the American Sociological Associations Taskforce
   on the Undergraduate Major's recommendations for the sociology major.

AB The NSF-funded Integrating Data Analysis (IDA) Project undertaken by the

   Analysis Network sought to close the quantitative literacy gap for
   sociology majors. Working with twelve departments, the project built on
   lessons learned from ASA's Minority Opportunities through School
   Transformation (MOST) Program, where curricular change was a
   departmental (not individual faculty) agenda. A critical mass of faculty
   in each IDA department developed and used quantitative modules in lower
   division courses. This article reports on the steps to develop
   departmental curricular change and the important results for student
   learning and future professional success.

AB Sociologists can make meaningful contributions to quantitative literacy
   by teaching sociological research skills in sociology classes, including
   introductory courses. We report on the effectiveness of requiring a
   research module in a large introductory class. The module is designed to
   teach both basic research skills and to increase awareness of race and
   gender inequality. We find that a majority of students are able to
   interpret basic percentage tables with a minimum of instruction. Under
   the condition that students are willing to acknowledge inequality in our
   occupational system, completing the research assignment increases their
   awareness of race and gender inequality. We argue that one of
   sociology's most powerful contributions to quantitative literacy is that
   our core content provides a challenging and relevant context in which to
   learn quantitative skills.

AB Why do countries differ so much in the extent to which they adopt
   neoliberal, market-oriented reform in their infrastructure industries?
   Building on world-society and neo-institutional theories in sociology,
   this paper argues that international pressures of coercion, normative
   emulation, and competitive mimicry strongly influence the domestic
   adoption of market-oriented reform. The paper considers the effect of
   such pressures on the adoption of four reform elements: the
   privatization of state-owned firms, the formal separation of the
   regulatory authority from the executive branch, the de facto elimination
   of executive political influence on the regulatory authority, and the
   opening of the retail market to multiple service providers. It finds
   generally robust support for its arguments using a multivariate probit
   analysis of reform adoption in the telecommunications and electricity
   industries of as many as 71 countries and territories between 1977 and
   1999. The results also suggest that the coercive effect of lending by
   the IMF and World Bank differs for each reform element. The paper
   discusses the possibility that, by leading countries to adopt some
   reform elements but not others, international coercion may not produce
   ideal outcomes.

PY 2005
AB Drawing insights from the ethnographies in the natural sciences, which
   have focused on the role of technical instruments in laboratory
   practices, this article asks, "What role do technical instruments play
   in the humanities?" Editions of La Comedie humaine, written by Honore de
   Balzac, are taken as a case study. Primarily based on ethnographic
   research with Balzac scholars, this article traces the evolution of
   Balzac text from a unified and unadorned text in the 1930s, to a single
   annotated text in the critical edition of the 1970s, and to a searchable
   electronic format of different versions. The author shows that the
   different schools of interpretation in Balzac criticism (traditional,
   semioticians, socio-critics) constructed these diverse editing
   technologies to influence the evolution of literary theories. For
   instance, traditional scholars' theory of authorship entertains en
   elective affinity with the critical edition of La Comedie humaine.
   Socio-critics challenged its assumptions and constructed electronic
   editions to develop their own theories, particularly on the genesis and
   reception of Balzac texts. By focusing on the epistemic cultures in
   which research practices are embedded, this case study complements
   purely institutionalist perspectives on knowledge-production in the
   academic field and highlights the presence of diverse epistemic cultures
   in literary criticism.

AB Change in art is all understudied topic in sociological research. This
   article examines protest artworks (arpilleras) produced by shantytown
   women during and shortly after the dictatorship in Chile, to explore the
   question Why political art that is for sale changes over time. This
   research is based oil 136 semi-structured and in-depth interviews with
   various members of the art world in Chile, Europe, and the United
   States, a year's worth of participant observation of art groups in
   Santiago and over five hundred photographs of arpilleras, taken by the
   author and analyzed thematically. Political art that is for sale call
   change because the intermediary (the organization connecting producers
   and buyers) becomes less or more politically conservative, develops a
   precarious financial situation, grows more afraid of repression, and has
   the power to enforce the changes it desires; because the original
   buyer,,; are replaced with new buyers with different motivations; and
   because new artists with new ideas begin making the art, one artist in
   the group produces something different and the idea spreads, artists
   censor themselves, and artists have new experiences or learn about new
   events. Through these sources of change, international social movements,
   local and international political and economic developments, and global
   institutions impact the art. Meanings attached to the art by the
   different parties (intermediaries, buyers, and artists) and class
   differences between artists and intermediaries are also important in
   facilitating change. These findings, based as they are oil political art
   made in a repressive context, not only contribute to our understanding
   of artistic evolution bill they help correct the bias in the sociology
   of art toward "art" made in democratic countries of the "First World."
   They are not just applicable to authoritarian regimes but also to art by
   politicized minority groups in democratic contexts, and to other
   cultural products such as newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and
   books.

AB While the influence of networks in conversion is among the most
   established findings in the sociology of religion, relatively little is
   known about how and why they have their influence. In this study the
   author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in
   network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently
   influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter
   and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, "structural
   availability" works not only by freeing an actor from
   conformity-inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative
   absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates
   individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location
   strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life
   problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number
   of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations.

AB In his popular introductory sociology text, Stark identifies W. E. B. Du
   Bois and Albion Small as important cornerstones of the U.S. sociological
   tradition. While the work of the "Chicago School" is well known in
   sociological circles, Do Bois' sociological legacy is not. The
   Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996) is a classic empirical sociological
   study that is rarely included in discussions of the development of
   scientific sociology. Likewise, The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003)
   represents one of the first empirically based sociological studies of a
   religious institution. Sociologists of religion routinely discuss the
   contributions of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel while virtually ignoring Du
   Bois. This is ironic because Du Bois' work on religion was based on
   ethnographic data, field inter-views, surveys, and census data. This
   article provides an overview of Do Bois' sociological study of the Black
   Church in the United States by identifying some of the main themes
   developed in The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996), The Souls of Black
   Folk ([1903a] 1994), and The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003). These studies
   reveal that Du Bois was a pioneer in the areas of evaluation research,
   public sociology, service learning, and congregational studies.

AB As originally developed by Charles Ragin in The Comparative Method
   (1987), qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has been used extensively
   by comparative and historical sociologists as an effective tool for
   analyzing data sets of medium-N populations. Like many other methods,
   however, QCA is a temporal and obscures the sequential nature of paths
   of causation. QCA ignores the order of events by treating combinations
   of attributes as though they occur simultaneously rather than as
   unfolding over time. While preserving the essential strengths of QCA,
   the authors present a modification that is capable of capturing the
   temporal nature of causal interactions. This modification involves a
   hybrid of Boolean algebra and sequence analysis to create a parsimonious
   set of solutions. This technique is referred to as temporal qualitative
   comparative analysis, or TQCA.

AB High school teachers of sociology have long been neglected by academic
   sociologists and the ASA. Recent developments are encouraging, however.
   In 2001, the ASA appointed a Task Force on the Advanced Placement Course
   for Sociology in High School, and Teaching Sociology has published three
   articles on high school sociology since that year. Still, there is a
   dire need for research on the characteristics and experiences of
   teachers themselves, and for empirically-based recommendations for
   assisting them. The current study uses questionnaire data to examine the
   personal and professional characteristics of the teachers who offered a
   sociology course in Connecticut public high schools during academic year
   2000-01. The results indicate that teachers have little formal education
   in sociology, are not involved in the professional activities of the
   discipline, and have virtually no exposure to sociology outside of their
   own courses. The paper concludes with recommendations for future
   research and action.

   teaching a sociology course on social control, twice under slightly

   and practices that optimize the goals of providing a forum for
   international education and enhancing reading and writing skills. A
   content analysis of the online Student-Led Discussions provides evidence
   that cross-national knowledge and understanding can be enhanced in this

   Belarus, Russia, and Australia, our course demonstrates how instructors
   can create a successful virtual classroom that truly encircles the

   statistical significance testing flourished in the 20th century.
   Contagion processes and the suitability of significance testing given a
   study's data characteristics encourage the diffusion of significance
   testing, whereas institutional factors such as department prestige and
   particular editorships help explain growing popularity of the. 05 alpha

AB Environmental harms involve a "double diversion" - two forms of
   privilege that deserve greater attention. The first involves
   disproportionality, or the privileged diversion of rights/resources:
   Contrary to common assumptions, much environmental damage is not
   economically "necessary" - instead, it represents privileged access to
   the environment. It is made possible in part by the second diversion -
   the diversion of attention, or distraction - largely through
   taken-for-granted or privileged accounts, which are rarely questioned,
   even in leftist critiques. Data show that, rather than producing
   advanced materials, major polluters tend to be inefficient producers of
   low-value commodities, and rather than being major employers, they can
   have emissions-to-jobs ratios a thousand times worse than the economy as
   a whole. Instead of simply focusing on overall/average levels of
   environmental problems, sociologists also need to examine
   disproportionalities, analyzing the socially structured nature Of
   environmental and discursive privileges. Doing so can offer important
   opportunities for insights, not just about nature, but also about the
   nature of power, and about the power of the naturalized.

AB Much of our knowledge about police behavior "on the street" is based on
   in-person observation of the police. However, little research has
   examined how the observers can potentially bias observational data. In
   this paper, anecdotal accounts from a variety of field settings are
   categorized into four potential sources of observer bias. Secondary
   analyses of data from a large-scale observational study of police are
   used to assess the impact of three out of the four type of observer bias
   (reactivity, going native, and burnout). There is evidence of reactivity
   for arrest, but not use of force behavior and little support for going
   native and burnout. More generally, observer bias is categorized as: (1)
   threats to the validity of observational data collected at different
   stages of fieldwork; and (2) the potential for human error implicit in
   observational data. The incorporation of a semi-structured field diary
   is suggested to more systematically document all four types of observer
   bias in future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   and interactionism to inform my analysis. With this approach, I
   illustrate the complicated relationship women athletes have with their
   bodies in relation to physical competition and dominant notions of
   femininity today. Key reference groups influenced the players'
   self-perceptions and encouraged the women to closely monitor their own
   appearances and actions. While undoubtedly affected by these
   interactions as well as their place in the gender hierarchy, many women
   athletes subtly resisted notions of idealized bodies and constructed
   their own meanings about their bodies and experiences. Investigating the
   day-to-day body awareness and negotiations of women athletes reveals the
   gendered nuances of sport and the complicated relationship between
   cultural ideals and female embodiment.

AB This paper is an inquiry into how a new truth about sleepiness is being
   produced in a society increasingly organized around the primacy of
   expertise and its representation in print and visual media. Sleepiness
   originally described a benign, naturally occurring corporeal moment, a
   precursor to sleep. Increasingly, however, a new and disturbing meaning
   of somnolence is found in a juncture of medical and epidemiological
   research, social movements, and popular culture. Alongside the idea that
   sleepiness is a tranquil promise of repose is another, emerging truth.
   Sleepiness, we are told, is hazardous to self and others, and,
   importantly, it is each person's responsibility to resist this seductive
   call of the body. How, we ask, is a private, routinely occurring state
   of partial consciousness deprivatized, linked to public health
   vernaculars, and transformed into a reprobate condition? This
   alternative, disturbing truth about sleepiness is shown to be emerging
   from several disparate, seemingly unrelated caches of scientific
   studies, social movement literatures, magazines and newspapers, and web
   sites. The ideas of Michel Foucault, who pioneered the contemporary
   study of discourse, are shown to be particularly apropos to this
   inquiry, though not without some modification to make them more amenable
   to a contemporary society shaped increasingly by what Zygmunt Bauman
   calls "liquid modernity."

   begins to remedy this deficiency by analyzing the motives articulated by
   twenty-three childless women and men using Weber's typology of social
   action and distinction between primary and end motives. In-depth
   interview and focus group data reveal that, compared to men, women more
   often were affected by the parenting models of significant others, saw
   parenting as conflicting with career and leisured identities, and
   claimed the lack of a "maternal instinct" or disinterest in children as
   dominant influences. Men more explicitly than women rejected parenthood
   because of its perceived sacrifices, including financial expense. Both
   women and men were motivated by personality traits that they deemed
   incongruent with good parenting. Declared motives especially
   demonstrated instrumentally rational action in Weber's schema, although
   affectual and value-rational actions also were present. Respondent

AB While the scholarship of teaching has risen in prominence in the past
   few decades, little is presently known about the structure of knowledge
   creation and dissemination in that area of scholarship. Such basic facts
   as the characteristics of programs that perform and publish the research
   (e.g., B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.), or the identities of specific schools that
   are leaders in teaching scholarship remain undocumented. This article
   explores the topic through counts of articles and notes published in a
   major outlet in the scholarship of teaching, Teaching Sociology, during
   the decade of the 1990s. We address the following: (1) Does publication
   of teaching scholarship vary by the type of degree program (e.g., B.A.,
   M.A., and Ph.D.) or by other characteristics? (2) Are some institutions
   centers of teaching scholarship? (3) How wide is the scope of teaching
   scholarship across the nation's departments? Overall, we find that a
   variety of sociology departments have established records of teaching
   publishing. Yet, some departments are leaders and appear to create a
   climate favorable to teaching scholarship.

AB I use a quasi-experiment and follow-up questionnaire to ascertain the
   effects of PowerPoint multimedia presentations and a Blackboard course
   website on the course grades and perceptions of teaching effectiveness
   of introductory sociology students. Results of t-tests showed no
   statistically significant difference in course grades between
   experimental and control groups. However, students' responses to
   standardized teaching evaluations were considerably more favorable in
   the experimental group; all measured dimensions of perceived teaching
   effectiveness yielded statistically significant increases, with
   substantial increases in perceptions of instructor rapport and grading.
   I use the ideas of George Herbert Mead to interpret the results and
   increase sociological understanding of the relationship between the
   introduction of instructional technology and student perceptions of
   teaching effectiveness. In Mead's terms, the introduction of technology
   is not merely a self-involved act performed by the instructor that
   changes the modality of course presentation but a social process
   involving both instructor and students. Within this process the
   introduction of technology is both a nonsignificant gesture, which
   elicits from students an unconscious or "instinctively" favorable
   impression of the course, and a significant symbol, which calls forth
   behavioral responses from students, conscious actions that substantially
   alter their perceptions of the course. Students not only reacted
   positively to the instructor's use of technology but through their own
   use of the technology increased their involvement in the course and came
   to perceive its teaching more favorably.

   weakness in the production and use of modern technology. Even Nigeria, a
   country with immense human and material resources, coupled with
   significant scientific infrastructure, has not yet been able to manage
   the all-important technological leap forward. The situation was
   different in Biafra (1967-70), when indigenous scientists and engineers
   performed socially relevant science without the preconditions
   conventionally perceived as necessary for technological development.
   Anchored in structuration theory, this article explores the sociology of
   scientific and technological practice in Biafra, outlines the
   achievements of Biafran scientists and engineers, and offers
   explanations of why the Biafran technological success has not been
   replicable in post-civil war Nigeria. Discussion concludes with a

   often assumed to be a structurally determined process lacking human

   that middle-class social reproduction arises out of the interplay
   between agency and structure, specifically, from individuals' activation
   and negotiation of structural advantages. My analysis centers around the
   themes often invoked to illustrate working-class reproduction:
   resistance and contestation; the importance of the peer group; and
   familial structural resources-or the lack thereof. I discuss how these

AB Contemporary sociology conceptualizes religion along two dimensions: the
   institutional and the individual. Lost in this dichotomy is religion's
   noninstitutional, but collective and public, cultural dimension. As a
   result, theories of religious modernity, including both sides of the
   secularization debate, are unable to recognize or evaluate the social
   power of noninstitutionalized religious communication. This article
   offers a reconceptualization of religion that highlights its cultural,
   communicative dimension. Original research on religious talk provides an
   empirical ground for a theoretical discussion that highlights: (1) the
   "invisible" nature of religion in modern societies, as theorized by
   Thomas Luckmann and (2) the social power attributed to communication by
   contemporary cultural sociologists and cultural theorists. I argue that
   conceptualizing religion as an evolving societal conversation about
   transcendent meaning broadens the empirical and theoretical grasp of the
   religion concept.

AB Ever since Maurice Halbwachs's pioneering work, most scholars have been
   content to explore collective memory through texts and commemorative
   symbolism. Assuming that a study of collective memory has fuller meaning
   when it takes into account what ordinary people think about the past, we
   compare historians' and commemorative agents' representations of Abraham
   Lincoln to what four national samples of Americans believe about him.
   Five primary images-Savior of the Union, Great Emancipator, Man of the
   People, First (Frontier) American, and Self-Made Man-are prominent in
   the cumulative body of Lincoln representations, but recent surveys show
   that only one of these images, the Great Emancipator, is dominant within
   the public. Lincoln one-dimensional Emancipator image, which differs
   from the multi-dimensional one evident in a 1945 sample, reflects new
   perceptions of the Civil War shaped by late twentieth-century minority
   rights movements. Thus, "bringing men [and women] back in" involves
   survey evidence being added to historiographic and commemoration
   analysis to clarify one of sociology most ambiguous concepts, collective
   memory, and to explore its social and generational roots.

AB Since Durkheim pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been
   suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of
   researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a
   minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased.
   Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question
   the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From
   the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide
   accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators.
   Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to
   underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires
   positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not
   challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives.
   Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging
   of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and
   close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same
   professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in
   suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by
   determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma
   of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting
   have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article
   contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how
   a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism
   from outside parties.

AB When and how will third parties intervene in the conflicts of others?
   When will third parties further violence, and when will they foster
   peace? These are questions addressed by Black theory of the third party.
   The authors conducted the first systematic test of the theory, drawing
   on quantitative and qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 100
   men imprisoned for assault or homicide. Specifically, they tested
   Cooney's elaboration of Black theory, which argues (1) that the social
   location of a third party, based on ties to the principals, predicts
   whether he or she will act as a partisan or settlement agent or remain
   uninvolved, and (2) that the third-party structure of a conflict, based
   on the general configuration of all the third parties present, predicts
   whether the conflict will escalate to violence. The study results
   confirm most of the theoretical predictions regarding both third-party
   behavior and violence. The discussion also extends the theoretical
   model, offering new concepts and suggesting how the theory can be
   applied to a range of subjects, such as international war and the
   long-term historical decline of interpersonal violence.

   Novak et al.'s (1999) Just-In-Time Teaching methods, we developed online
   activities to help prepare students for subsequent in-class work and to
   cultivate a sense of group solidarity among smaller teams within the

   group learning activities was strongly predictive of better student
   academic achievement on the biweekly quizzes, cumulative final exam, and
   course paper. These findings highlight the potential value of online
   group work for fostering collaborative learning environments in large

   critical pedagogical approach to travel-study abroad by presenting a

   Following Kaufman's (2002) four-point model of critical pedagogy, I
   recommend that understanding, reflecting, analyzing, and engaging in

   travel-study abroad in sociology. My research suggests benefits of such
   an approach, including working with a native educational institution,
   pairing sociology and Spanish students, and using home-stay families as
   informal teachers. I conclude by offering suggestions for faculty
   interested in creating a travel-study abroad course, to a developing
   nation in particular.

   of the most important issues facing the sociology of sport, leisure, and
   recreation. The article offers some initial dialogue toward the
   development of a theory that would explain the myriad of activities
   which continue to evolve from leisure time pursuits of a few, into more
   organized recreation for many, and then into highly competitive sports.
   The status-of this subarea of sociology is discussed within the context
   that the sportization of pastimes may generate enough research interest
   so as to catapult this subarea into mainstream sociology.

AB Trash talking has rarely been studied within sociology at a time when
   the behavior itself has been flourishing in amateur and professional
   sports. George Herbert Mead's ideas on gestures, symbols, and language,
   in conjunction with the overarching transcendency of the community aid
   in understanding the development of self and the subsequent behaviors
   that emanate from and within trash talking in college athletics. Here a
   Meadian perspective is used to explain the act of trash talking at both
   macro- and micro-levels. Three areas were identified where Meadian
   philosophy applies: (1) the game and the role of the generalized other;
   (2) play and significant communication; and (3) self-development.

AB This article considers one way to construct "analytic" narratives in
   historical sociology. The author grounds his approach in ongoing
   methodological debates over temporality and sequence in historical
   processes and the assumed trade-off between historical particularity and
   causal generality He promotes narratives that exploit both the
   sequential/ eventful and contextual properties of analytic time, with an
   approach that combines and builds on two emerging developments in
   narrative methodology: the use of rational choice theory and the idea of
   "increasing returns" in path-dependent historical processes. While doing
   narrative in this way will not be appropriate for analyzing all
   historical processes, it can be a useful methodological strategy for
   many of the questions, events, and outcomes that interest historical
   sociologists. The author draws oil his own research program on early
   equal employment law in the mid- to late 1960s to illustrate how this
   method can work in practice.

AB Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition

   network visualizations, or network "movies." This article confronts
   theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social
   networks and technical questions about how best to link network change
   to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network
   movies into ( 1) static flip books, where node position remains constant
   but edges cumulate over time, and ( 2) dynamic movies, where nodes move
   as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly
   useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected
   networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples
   demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software
   program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.

AB In an agency relationship, one party acts on behalf of another. It is
   curious that a concept that could not be more profoundly sociological
   does not have a niche in the sociological literature. This essay begins
   with the economics paradigm of agency theory, which casts a very long
   shadow over the social sciences, and then traces how these ideas diffuse
   to and are transformed (if at all) in the scholarship produced in
   business schools, political science, law, and sociology. I cut a swathe
   through the social fabric where agency relationships are especially
   prevalent and examine some of the institutions, roles, forms of social
   organization, deviance, and strategies of social control that deliver
   agency and respond to its vulnerabilities, and I consider their impact.
   Finally, I suggest how sociology might make better use of and contribute
   to agency theory.

AB This paper focuses on theory in sociology. I suggest that,
   notwithstanding the benefits that accrue from the development of
   theoretical ideas and research in a competitive environment, competition
   can also have undesirable consequences. I argue that such tendencies
   should be countered by cooperation in our theoretical and research
   efforts (e.g., multimethod research). I also advocate the development of
   abstract formulations that are precise and systematic because such
   theories are more clearly understood and capable of being investigated,
   can lead to the development of more clearly defined questions, and can
   help us achieve the goal of greater cooperation. To provide an
   illustration of these points I discuss a recently developed line of
   theory and research related to "structural ritualization theory." This
   work focuses on "deritualization, "that is, the breakdown of previously
   engaged in ritualized practices due to disruptive events. Four studies
   are discussed: an experimental investigation of positive, negative, and
   neutral disruptions of ritualized practices in task groups; a study of
   personal accounts of individuals interned in concentration camps; a
   qualitative analysis of pioneering reports on disasters which shows how
   such events result in the breakdown of ritualized behaviors; and,
   historical research that focuses on "dark ages" as macrolevel
   disruptions leading to large-scale deritualization. I conclude by
   reemphasizing the value of theory and the need for cooperation,
   summarizing analytical concerns generated by deritualization research,
   and suggesting the need for applied efforts based on these principles
   and research.

AB A simulation called Star Power provides an invaluable means to help
   students understand structural social inequality. This paper explains
   how Star Power achieves this goal and provides suggestions on how to
   inculcate the following points that are both central to sociology and
   difficult to adequately convey to students: 1) Students see how those in
   power maintain their position by structuring the system to their
   advantage, 2) they learn how the structure of this system makes
   advancement for others difficult; 3) privileged students begin to
   recognize the impact of their own family's social position that they
   tend to overlook in favor of their personal effort and merit. By
   becoming more aware of structural inequalities, students realize that
   for the lower classes to join the most powerful in society, they must
   triumph over a system in which those in power make rules that protect
   their own interests, usually at someone else's expense.

AB The reciprocal connection between religion and family life makes the
   topic of religious intermarriage of particular importance in the
   sociology of religion. Spousal influences are key for motivating
   religious switching and other religious commitments. Religious
   intermarriage has also been shown to influence a host of other outcomes,
   including spousal conflict, domestic violence, divorce, and fertility.
   Using data from the 1973-1994 GSS, I estimate log-multiplicative models
   examining patterns of association between spouses' religious
   affiliations across two broad cohorts. Two-step and FIML Heckman's
   selection models are used to determine how education, migration, cohort,
   and denominational origins influence the probability of intermarriage
   and the distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Religious intermarriage
   increases across cohorts, but declines in homogamy are limited to
   liberal religious groups. Catholics and members of conservative sects
   are less likely to intermarry compared to others. The relative ordering
   of distances between religious groups was unchanged across cohorts.
   Educational attainment increases the likelihood of intermarriage, and
   marriages in which the woman has more education are more likely to be
   heterogamous. However, educational factors have no impact on the
   distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Geographically stable rural
   Southerners are least likely to intermarry and if they do, choose a more
   similar spouse. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article analyzes the anomalous case of early Title VII enforcement
   to challenge the standard political-institutional (PI) account of state
   capacity. Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement
   resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title
   VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the
   literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence
   of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies
   can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory
   construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social
   movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a
   "moving target," with state and societal actors building on legal as
   well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By
   reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced
   explanations of state policy that are both "political" and
   "institutional" and that highlight the centrality of legal
   interpretation and judicial review to political sociology.

AB Sociologists tend to eschew biological explanations of human social
   behavior. Accordingly, when evolutionary biologists began to apply
   neo-Darwinian theory to the study of human social behavior, the
   reactions of sociologists typically ranged from indifference to overt
   hostility. Since the mid-1960s, however, neo-Darwinian evolutionary
   theory has stimulated a "second Darwinian revolution" in traditional
   social scientific conceptions of human nature and social behavior, even
   while most sociologists remain largely uninformed about neo-Darwinian
   theory and research. This article traces sociology's long-standing
   isolation from the life sciences, especially evolutionary biology, to
   divergence in the metatheoretical assumptions that typify conventional
   sociological thought versus contemporary evolutionary biology. We
   conclude with a discussion of the recent emergence of a nascent
   "evolutionary sociology" that integrates sociobiological reasoning with

   this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political

   pursues a pattern of environmental "bads" that cannot be reduced to
   capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial
   distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our
   contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we
   recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope
   conditions under which a "treadmill of production" and a "treadmill of
   destruction" are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a "treadmill of
   destruction" is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be
   reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the
   "treadmill of destruction" by examining the environmental inequality
   endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have
   collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed
   but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence
   that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such
   hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and
   won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The
   geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power
   pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of
   unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the

   doctoral students anticipating entry into a professional position be
   prepared for all expectations associated with faculty life in a wide
   variety of college and university placements. NCSUs program combined
   in-house research mentoring opportunities as well as off-campus
   mentoring relationships with faculty at other schools to explore the
   teaching and service responsibilities of junior faculty members. An
   evaluation committee assessed the effectiveness of this new initiative.
   Data were collected using several methods, including surveys,
   interviews, and focus groups. The committee found the PFF program to be
   a welcome addition to graduate training, however, the NCSU program
   experienced struggles that provide insight for other schools that may
   wish to start a PFF program of their own.

AB This paper discusses learning communities as pedagogy for introductory
   sociology courses, which are often plagued by student apathy. Most
   importantly, it examines the potential for learning communities to
   incorporate active and collaborative learning techniques as a vehicle to
   subvert dominant views of diversity, to see diversity as intersecting
   social inequalities that can be rearranged in favor of greater social
   equality. The effectiveness of a learning community with the theme of
   diversity for meeting these goals is assessed using qualitative and
   quantitative data. It is concluded that the pedagogic framework of the
   learning community did indeed push students to problematize their
   student role. Finally, a review of results from a pre/post-test
   questionnaire suggests that students entered the community as a fairly
   homogenous group in their views of diversity and left as a more
   heterogeneous group, indicating some shift in consciousness, however
   slight.

PD JUN 2004
PY 2004
AB This article presents a social-organizational approach to explaining
   empirical variation in rates of altruism. The efforts of organizations
   are mostly responsible for much of the altruism seen today, and the
   substance of these efforts varies. Although research from social
   psychology and organizational studies suggests that altruistic action is
   sensitive to social context, the link between individual and
   organizational aspects of altruism has not been clearly articulated. In
   particular our knowledge of "one-shot," organizationally managed
   altruism is limited. I suggest that the factors of organizational
   resources, scope, and persistence are likely to generate higher rates of
   individual altruism in the absence of long-term relationships that
   encourage giving behavior The approach is applied to the case of
   cadaveric organ procurement in the United States. The analysis
   highlights the central role of organ procurement organizations (OPOs).
   Quantitative analysis of OPO procurement rates shows that, while
   demographic characteristics are important, OPO resources and scope are
   important predictors of procurement. The findings strongly suggest that
   the ability of organizations to produce contexts for giving explains a
   substantial amount of variation in rates of one-shot altruism.

AB This article encourages sociologists to study gender as a social
   institution. Noting that scholars apply the institution concept to
   highly disparate phenomena, it reviews the history of the concept in
   twentieth-century sociology. The defining characteristic most commonly
   attributed to social institution is endurance (or persistence over time)
   while contemporary uses highlight practices, conflict, identity, power,
   and change. I identify twelve criteria for deciding whether any
   phenomenon is a social institution. I conclude that treating gender as
   an institution will improve gender scholarship and social theory
   generally, increase awareness of gender's profound sociality, offer a
   means of linking diverse theoretical and empirical work, and make
   gender's invisible dynamics and complex intersections with other
   institutions more apparent and subject to critical analysis and change.

   topical and theoretical foci are associated with themes suggested by the

AB The growing interest in public sociologies marks an increasing gap
   between the ethos of sociologists and social, political, and economic
   tendencies in the wider society. Public sociology aims to enrich public
   debate about moral and political issues by infusing them with
   sociological theory and research. It has to be, distinguished from
   policy, professional, and critical sociologies. Together these four
   interdependent sociologies enter into relations of domination and
   subordination, forming a disciplinary division of labor that varies
   among academic institutions as well as over time, both within and
   between nations. Applying the same disciplinary matrix to the other
   social sciences suggests that sociology's specific contribution lies in
   its relation to civil society, and, thus, in its defense of human
   interests against the encroachment of states and markets.

   were salient. Firms financed through central government and bond issues
   relied less on markets. Firms funded through local government moved into
   markets faster; firms funded by banks were initially faster to markets

AB Four decades have passed since the publication of Gerhard Lenski's The
   Religious Factor. While generally regarded as a classic in the sociology
   of religion, the book has had a curious history, largely because of the
   interest it generated in differences between Protestants and Catholics.
   In this paper I provide an alternative reading of The Religious Factor's
   impact on sociology of religion that points to its larger theoretical
   implications. I argue that the book should be understood in relation to
   continuing debates about the classification of religious traditions,
   differentiation among socioreligious groups, intergroup relations among
   religious traditions, and friendship ties within religious communities.
   Through understanding these contributions, the book's legacy as well as
   continuities and new opportunities in the study of religion can be

   explanation in sociology was social-psychological. Moreover, by the
   1980s, the bias against biology in feminist theory came to include all
   of science. Exceptions to these trends include the work of Blumberg,

   requires consideration of constructs in addition to those developed by

   can be quite helpful in posing new questions about an eventful
   sociology. By rethinking communism's collapse in 1989 and terrorism's
   explosion in 2001 within Lenski's theoretical frame, one can suggest

AB The media, in the sociology of natural disasters, are mainly viewed as

   limited to the warning, preparedness, and recovery phases. Through
   interviews with residents of eight communities in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico,
   impacted by Hurricane Georges in 1998, this paper shows that through
   integrating mass communication research to disaster theory we can obtain
   a more accurate picture of the media-audience relationship during
   natural disasters. In addition to the manifest functions of providing
   information, the media also have latent functions in disasters, which
   consist of emotional support and companionship. The media also help
   isolated individuals to feel connected with the "outside world." These
   functions are most salient in the impact phase of disasters. These
   functions are also particularly crucial as they have been shown to

PY 2004
AB Drawing on interviews with peer-review panelists from five
   multidisciplinary fellowship competitions, this paper analyzes one of
   the main criteria used to evaluate scholarship in the humanities and the
   social sciences: originality. Whereas the literature in the sociology of
   science focuses on the natural sciences and defines originality as the
   production of new findings and new theories, we show that in the context
   of fellowship competitions, peer reviewers in the social sciences and
   humanities define originality much more broadly: as using a new
   approach, theory, method, or data; studying a new topic; doing research
   in an understudied area; or producing new findings. Whereas the
   literature has not considered disciplinary variation in the definition
   of originality, we identified significant differences. Humanists and
   historians clearly privilege originality in approach, and humanists also
   emphasize originality in the data used. Social scientists most often
   mention originality in method, but they also appreciate a more diverse
   range of types of originality. Whereas the literature tends to equate
   originality with substantive innovation and to consider the personal
   attributes of the researcher as irrelevant to the evaluation process, we
   show that panelists often view the originality of a proposal as an
   indication of the researcher moral character especially of his/her
   authenticity and integrity. These contributions constitute a new
   approach to the study of peer review and originality that focuses on the
   meaning of criteria of evaluation and their distribution across clusters
   of disciplines.

AB Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years?
   Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage
   between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas,
   suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific
   practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration
   networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been
   growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline
   coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the
   sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that
   quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative
   work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given
   collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is
   consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has
   potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in
   sociology.

AB The prestige of academic departments is commonly understood as rooted in

   theories of Weber and Bourdieu to advance an alternative view of
   departmental prestige, which I show is an effect a department position
   within networks of association and social exchange-that is, it is a form
   of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs
   among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data
   on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network
   analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental
   prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view.
   Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks
   explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar
   findings are reported for history and political science. This
   alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies -
   e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity,
   the strong association between department size and prestige, and the
   long-term stability of prestige rankings - encountered in research that
   is based on the more conventional view.

AB The authors examine self-reported emotional experiences of individuals
   in a large probability sample of Americans, using two theories in the
   sociology of emotions as lenses to apprehend social order in emotional
   processes. Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals' positions in a
   three-dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith-Lovin, MacKinnon),
   the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social
   structural, circumstantial, and individual-level variables. Viewing
   emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts
   (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how
   transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and
   other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that
   emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the
   examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find
   that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience,
   structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The
   analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion
   management that may have been overlooked in other studies.

AB Sociologists have produced large, well-known literatures on inequality
   across geographic territory at two ends of the spatial scale continuum,
   within the city and across nation-states. In this paper, I discuss a
   different scale of focus, subnational stratification processes across
   middle-range spatial units, those between the city and nation-state.
   While characterizing much contemporary rural sociological research, this
   approach to spatial inequality does not tend to be seen as a coherent
   tradition that cross-cuts substantive areas. First, I discuss why
   attention to subnational inequality, rural regions, and middle-range
   spatial units are important to social science understanding of
   stratification processes. Second, I provide an overview of contemporary
   research traditions in rural sociology which, taken together, form a
   distinct and innovative approach to spatial inequality. Third, I draw
   from my own work to explain how factors affecting socioeconomic
   inequalities across middle-range territorial units may be conceptualized
   and provide two sets of empirical examples. Finally, I discuss what
   should be done in terms of furthering rural sociology's regional
   approach to spatial inequality.

AB Retail farmers' markets are seen as key institutions in a more "civic
   agriculture," but little is known about how they promote small business
   entrepreneurship. Drawing on research in economic sociology and economic
   geography, this paper examines the role of social learning in vendor
   innovation. Data from a 1999 mail survey of farmers' market vendors in
   California, New York and Iowa show that business innovation, as
   represented by intensity of vendors' innovative marketing practices and
   vendors' successful enterprise expansion, was modest. Social learning
   through engagement with customers contributed to more innovative
   marketing by vendors, while social learning through engagement with
   customers and fellow vendors increased the likelihood of vendors
   diversifying to additional markets beyond the farmers' market. Certain
   individual and enterprise characteristics also influenced vendor
   innovation. This suggests that, although important, the beneficial
   effects of social learning for vendors at farmers' markets remain
   moderated by human capital and structural factors.

AB Sustainable development demands institutions manage the conflicts and
   struggles that inevitably arise over material and ideal interests. While
   current cooperative theory privileges the economic element, a political
   economy of cooperation emphasizes cooperatives' tentative bridging of
   economic and political spheres with a democratic ethos. The
   cooperatives' democratic political structure exists in tension with a
   capitalist economic structure and other sites of friction. These
   contradictions are: in the realm of social relations, between production
   and consumption; in the realm of spatial relations, between the local
   and the global; and in the realm of collective action, between
   cooperatives as both traditional as well as new social movements. Where
   neo-classical economic models seek to eliminate or reduce these
   tensions, political economy views these tensions as functional to
   sustainability by creating an "institutional friction" that facilitates
   innovation, flexibility and long-term adaptability. This political
   economy of cooperation is intended as a step toward the development of a
   multidimensional sociology of cooperation.

AB Although there have been general social, economic, and environmental
   hypotheses developed to explain the distribution of endangered species
   across the globe, there is a paucity of social science literature
   designed to specify these hypotheses in more detail or test them with
   comparative, national-level data. This study draws on several models
   from environmental sociology to specify conceptually the relationship
   between social and economic factors and rates of endangered mammals and
   birds. Specifically, I developed hypotheses based on neo-Malthusian,
   ecological modernization, treadmill of production, and world-systems
   theory and analyzed data on endangered species, population, land use,
   economic size and growth, energy use, and industrial pollutants from one
   hundred twenty nations. The results support ecological modernization's
   position that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP per
   capita and endangerment rates, but they also indicate that GDP growth is
   associated with a monotonic increase in these rates, thus supporting a
   treadmill of production argument. Yet these relationships vary by
   world-systems position. Endangerment rates in peripheral nations are
   affected more by GDP growth, whereas rates in semiperipheral nations are
   affected more by deforestation, GDP per capita, and growth in energy use
   per capita.

AB Terrorism in its purest form is self-help by organized civilians who
   covertly inflict mass violence on other civilians. Pure sociology
   explains terrorism with its social geometry-its multidimensional
   location and direction in social space. Here I build on the work of
   Senechal de la Roche (1996) and propose the following geometrical model:
   Pure terrorism arises intercollectively and upwardly across long
   distances in multidimensional space. Yet because social distance
   historically corresponded to physical distance, terrorism often lacked
   the physical geometry necessary for its occurrence: physical closeness
   to civilians socially distant enough to attract terrorism. New
   technology has made physical distance increasingly irrelevant, however,
   and terrorism has proliferated. But technology also shrinks the social
   universe and sows the seeds of terrorism's destruction.

AB Even in an increasingly polarized climate of global policy-making, the
   ideal of "sustainable development" retains currency across a remarkably
   broad swath of the political spectrum in debating alternative scenarios
   for the future. By adapting Weber's classic categories of value spheres
   and collective rationality, I distinguish contemporary approaches to
   operationalizing the concept of sustainability and elucidate the
   practical implications of each. For some, the social, ecological, and
   economic dimensions of sustainability are synergistic components of a
   single meaningful goal, pursued by either an overarching technique or a
   unifying ethic. In contrast to these unifying models, one may conclude
   that the dimensions of sustainable development invoke values that
   inevitably conflict in any complex social interaction to derive
   strategies for collective action. Framing the concept in such terms, as
   a dialogue of values, highlights the need to adapt social institutions
   to mediate value conflict at different scales, and points to
   opportunities for engaging development debates through applied research
   on comparative governance.

AB The last decade featured the emergence of a significant and growing
   literature concerning comparative-historical methods. This literature
   offers methodological tools for causal and descriptive inference that go
   beyond the techniques currently available in mainstream statistical
   analysis. In terms of causal inference, new procedures exist for testing
   hypotheses about necessary and sufficient causes, and these procedures
   address the skepticism that mainstream methodologists may hold about
   necessary and sufficient causation. Likewise, new techniques are
   available for analyzing hypotheses that refer to complex temporal
   processes, including path-dependent sequences. In the area of
   descriptive inference, the comparative-historical literature offers
   important tools for concept analysis and for achieving measurement
   validity. Given these contributions, comparative-historical methods
   merit a central place within the general field of social science
   methodology.

AB This paper examines recent work in the sociology of culture devoted to
   providing endogenous explanations of cultural phenomena. The focus is on
   works that provide cultural explanations of cultural processes, as
   opposed to the social structural and "production of culture"
   explanations otherwise predominant in the literature. I examine three
   distinct approaches: a "post-hermeneutic" approach devoted. not to the
   question of cultural interpretation but to the issue of subjects'
   manipulation of culture in the quest for meaning; a semiotic approach
   focused on the mechanics of symbol systems; and an ecological approach
   that emphasizes the role of competition and niche density in explaining
   both cultural stasis and change. The three approaches have in common a
   general lack of interest in traditional conceptions of meaning
   (verstehen), choosing instead to focus on issues related to the internal
   structure and dynamics of cultural expression. This marks a new
   opportunity for synthesis and exploration in a field traditionally
   devoted to extra-cultural explanation of cultural phenomena. Both
   endogenous and exogenous explanations are offered for the rise of this
   new trend in the sociology of culture.

AB Durkheim hypothesized that basic categories of thought an, based on

   participation in society's totemic rites. This proposition is evaluated
   in light of recent research on the cognitive architecture of newborns
   and infants. The evidence suggests that presocialized infants possess
   mental representations of not only the physical world but also the minds
   of others and even the sui generis quality of collectivities. This
   review concludes that the Durkheimian theory of the social origin of
   mind has little empirical support and suggests that the sociology of
   mental life needs to be radically retheorized.

AB Rural sociologists are currently debating the pace and extent of
   industrialization in the dairy sector of the United States. We offer the
   perspective of historical sociology to this debate, arguing that time
   and place significantly determine the outcomes of processes such as
   industrialization. We present an historically-grounded explanation for
   the rise of industrial dairying, which first occurred in Los Angeles
   County. Beginning with the immigration of Dutch dairy farmers to Los
   Angeles (L.A.) in the 1920s, a contingent and sequential
   process-embedded within the local/California political economy-of
   exploding population growth, rapid urbanization, and skyrocketing land
   prices led to repeated geographical relocations and expansions of
   large-scale dairies during the next three decades. We conclude that
   agricultural industrialization is not inevitable but instead is the
   result of contingent factors (cultural and political-economic) as well
   as the particular sequencing of events and processes. In thus
   historicizing the industrialization debate, we seek limited, rather than
   universal, generalizations.

AB Despite their plausibility, political explanations for incarceration
   rates have not been intensely investigated. Centralized democracies that
   reduce public influence by using corporatist methods to resolve disputes
   should have lower incarceration rates, but the opposite should be true
   in decentralized polities with federalist political arrangements where
   mass publics have greater control over punishment. Threat hypotheses are
   assessed by examining the effects of minority presence and economic
   inequality. This study uses a panel design to examine these effects on
   imprisonment rates in 13 of the most progressive democracies from 1970
   to 1995. With the murder or overall crime rates, social disorganization,
   and additional indicators held constant, the presence of corporatist and
   federalist political arrangements explain cross-national differences in
   incarceration rates. The evidence suggests that internal racial or
   ethnic threat produces larger imprisonment rates as well. The findings
   indicate that a well-developed comparative political sociology of
   punishment should help us understand contrasts in the proportion of the
   population that is incarcerated in advanced democracies.

   are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present
   research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by
   drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally responsive
   behavior. We develop an environment identity model of environmental
   behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment
   identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment
   identity and commitment to the environment identity,. We examine the
   identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion
   of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal
   that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally
   responsive behavior, but this agency is largely through identity
   processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important
   theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental
   sociology.

AB By the late 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu had become the primary public
   intellectual of major social scientific status at the head of the
   anti-globalization movement that emerged in France and in other Western
   European countries. This article discusses how Bourdieu became a leading
   public intellectual, a role that seems to contrast with his early years
   as a professional sociologist. It explores what seemed to change in
   Bourdieu's activities and outlook as sociologist and what seems to have
   remained constant. It identifies several institutional conditions that
   seemed necessary for Bourdieu to be able to play the kind of public
   intellectual role he did in his later years. Bourdieu's movement from a
   peripheral position to a central location in the French intellectual
   field, the changing character of the field itself, the growing influence
   of the mass media in French political and cultural life, the failures of
   the French Socialists in power, a cultural legacy of leading critical
   intellectuals in France, a unifying national issue of globalization, and
   the political conjuncture in 1995 all intersected in ways that opened a
   path for Bourdieu to choose new and more frequent forms of political
   action. His responses to that combination of factors at different
   moments reveal both a striking continuity in desire to preserve the
   autonomy of intellectual life and a change in view and strategy on how
   best to do that. The article concludes with a brief evaluation of
   Bourdieu's public intellectual role.

AB Robert Merton presented two, not always clearly differentiated theories
   in his seminal explorations on the social-structure-and-anomie paradigm:
   a strain theory and an anomie theory. A one-sided focus on Merton's
   strain theory in the secondary literature has unnecessarily restricted
   the power and effectiveness of Merton's anomie theory. For although
   structural strain is one way to explain why deviance occurs in the
   context of anomie, it is not the only way. We contend that scholars who
   are critical of strain theory should not automatically discard Merton's
   anomie theory, because the perspective of anomie is compatible with
   several other theories of crime and delinquency. Offering examples of
   previous integration efforts, we maintain that Merton's theoretical
   model can benefit from the input of other theories of crime and deviance
   as much as these other theoretical perspectives can fine-tune their
   models and explanations.

AB This paper explores the ethnographic technique of the focused
   revisit-rare in sociology but common in anthropology-when an
   ethnographer returns to the site of a previous study. Discrepancies
   between earlier and later accounts can be attributed to differences in:
   (1) the relation of observer to participant, (2) theory brought to the
   field by the ethnographer (3) internal processes within the field site
   itself or (4) forces external to the field site. Focused revisits tend
   to settle on one or another of these four explanations, giving rise to
   four types of focused revisits. Using examples, the limits of each type
   of focused revisit are explored with a view to developing a reflexive
   ethnography that combines all four approaches. The principles of the
   focused revisit are then extended to rolling, punctuated, heuristic,
   archeological, and valedictory revisits. In centering attention on
   ethnography-as-revisit sociologists directly confront the dilemmas of
   participating in the world they study-a world that undergoes (real)
   historical change that can only be grasped using a (constructed)
   theoretical lens.

AB A single unified frame of reference for determining how sociology should
   be taught does not exist; nor does it exist for describing the optimum
   design for instituting curricula in sociology at different colleges and
   universities. Yet patterns and themes appear to persist at particular
   institutions that reflect the influence of their peculiar historical
   development and social contexts. This perspective underlies the
   examination of sociology at Howard University since its beginning as a
   series of lectures in 1895. Four factors are emphasized: the historical
   mission of the university, the special research and intellectual
   interests of departmental faculty, with particular discussion of the
   influence of E. Franklin Frazier; the struggles of traditional
   perspectives in opposition to the need to respond to new demands in
   society, and the demand of students for new courses outside the boundary
   of the existing curriculum. While I conclude that sociology at Howard
   University has always generally exhibited major facets of mainstream
   sociology, the most enduring thematic focus in research and teaching has
   centered on problems associated with racial and social inequality.

   variety of pedagogical strategies designed to provide experiential and
   service-learning situations to help students connect readings such as
   those by Marx, Olin Wright, and Davis and Moore with the situation of
   social class in contemporary United States. Students were required to
   keep journals of their experiences, and their journal entries provide
   the data for this paper. Though there is considerable room for
   improvement, the data suggest that the pedagogical tools employed were
   successful in promoting a deeper level of learning around issues of
   inequality, particularly social class inequality, as it exists in the
   United States.

AB This article develops an interactive, theoretical model of emotional
   feedback and amplification. Whereas the sociology of emotions typically
   examines how affect arises, this article focuses on the aftermath of an
   evoked emotion as it evolves in ongoing interaction. I argue that
   interactions serve as a stimulus to evoke emotional responses, but as
   interactions continue, these interactions provide an additional stimulus
   that feeds back into the initial emotion, amplifying it. I articulate
   two modes of emotional feedback and amplification: spontaneous and
   managed. Spontaneous amplification is a by-product of unplanned but
   continuous interactions. In contrast, managed amplification results from
   purposeful interactions and can be initiated through either surface
   acting or deep acting. The process of feedback and amplification is more
   likely under structural and cultural conditions that facilitate ongoing
   interactions. An empirical elaboration of the model is drawn from an
   ethnographic study of "TD's Restaurant." Examining how feedback and
   amplification occur in different settings is an ongoing task for
   sociologists interested in emotions, work and occupations, mental
   health, and social movements.

AB This essay explicates the role of countersystem analysis as an essential
   mode of social inquiry. In the process, particular attention is given to
   the place of negation and the future. One underlying theme is the
   asymmetry between the negative and the positive features of social
   activities, the negative being more readily identifiable empirically
   than the positive. A corollary theme, building on the observations of
   George Herbert Mead, is: one engages the present through experience; one
   engages the future through ideas. Furthermore, as Anthony Giddens,
   Ulrich Beck, and Niklas Luhmann suggest, we in late modernity seem to be
   facing a future that is more contingent than it was in early modernity.
   After articulating the foundations of the mode of inquiry we term
   "countersystem analysis," we employ Karl Mannheim as a point of
   departure for critically surveying a constellation of
   scholars-conservatives as well as reformers-who have relied upon some
   version of countersystem analysis in addressing the future. Such an
   orientation serves to advance not only theoretical inquiry but empirical
   investigation as well.

   either from a sample to a larger population or to settings and
   populations other than those studied. While definitions vary,
   discussions generally agree that experiments are lower in external
   validity than other methodological approaches. Further, external
   validity is widely treated as an issue to be addressed through
   methodological procedures. When testing theories, all measures are
   indirect indicators of theoretical constructs, and no methodological
   procedures taken alone can produce external validity. External validity
   can be assessed through determining (1) the extent to which empirical
   measures accurately reflect theoretical constructs, (2) whether the
   research setting conforms to the scope of the theory under test, (3) our
   confidence that findings will repeat under identical conditions, (4)
   whether findings support the theory being tested, and (5) the
   confirmatory status of the theory under test. In these ways, external
   validity is foremost a theoretical issue and can only be addressed by an
   examination of the interplay between theory and methods.

AB Why did! a partially bureaucratized administrative system develop in Qin
   China about two millennia before it did in European states? In this
   paper, comparative historical arguments about war and state-making are
   combined with agency theory to answer this question. The Spring and
   Autumn and Warring States eras that preceded the Qin unification of
   China created the necessary conditions for bureaucratization by
   weakening the aristocracy, creating a bureaucratic model, facilitating
   the development of roads, and providing trained and disciplined
   personnel. Comparative analysis shows that the main factor
   differentiating Qin China from other states and empires was the extreme
   weakness of the aristocracy produced by an unusually long period of
   severe warfare. Although Qin China was more bureaucratic than any other
   state or empire prior to the seventeenth century, it was far from
   completely bureaucratic. The persistence of monitoring problems
   prevented its full development, necessitating deviations such as the use
   of severe negative sanctions, the creation of redundant positions, and
   limiting bureaucratization to the top of the administrative system. The
   further development of the bureaucratic administrative system in the Han
   dynasty is also discussed.

   protest events in New York State between 1968 and 1973 are tested with
   the aim of understanding the broad mechanisms of social control used by
   authorities during this cycle of mass protest. Contrary to the popular
   perception of overzealous police repression of protest in this period,
   results show that police did not attend the majority of protest events.
   Tests of dominant explanations of police presence using logistic
   regress, on analysis indicate that the best predictor of police presence
   at a protest event was how threatening the event was-police attended
   larger protest events and those that used confrontational tactics. Tests
   (using multinomial logistic regression) of explonations of police
   action, given police presence at an event, indicate that extreme forms
   of police action were also triggered by threatening characteristics of
   events. Events in which subordinate groups and social movement
   organizations participated were also more likely to draw police action.
   Novel contributions include the comparison of dominant explanations of
   protest policing and methods that move beyond the tradition of examining
   repression through police presence or absence.

AB This study examines the concrete modalities of the production and

   textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of
   evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the
   theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the
   draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of
   the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its
   reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and
   by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization
   of debates over and the certification of the theorem were not based on
   the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified
   responses by critics and by the author's responses to
   critiques-responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations.
   This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists
   should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a
   privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social
   forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.

   activities to explain illegal earnings among criminal offenders. To
   isolate the effects of time-varying factors such as legal earnings, drug
   use, and criminal opportunities, we use data from the National Supported
   Work Demonstration Project to estimate fixed-effects models predicting
   month-to-month changes in illegal earnings. We find that criminal
   earnings are sensitive to embeddedness in conforming work and family
   relationships, criminal experience, and the perceived risks and rewards
   of crime. Moreover, heroin and cocaine use creates a strong earnings
   imperative that is difficult to satisfy in the low-wage labor market,
   and offenders earn far more money illegally when they are using these
   drugs than during periods of abstinence.

AB The incorporation of new figures to the canon of sociological theory
   creates unique challenges for the teaching of sociology. We need to
   rethink the intellectual context of such writers' contributions and
   devise new ways to involve students in these theorists' insights. This
   article suggests some of the tasks ahead in reworking our presentation
   of Erving Goffman's sociology to students. An overemphasis on Goffman's
   work on the social self in has resulted in a teaching convention that
   places him among symbolic interactionist theorists. This practice has
   obscured important linkages of Goffman's other work on social rituals
   and social forms to other theoretical traditions, most conspicuously the
   Durkheimian ritual tradition. This article depicts a useful
   participatory exercise for teaching Goffman's dramaturgical sociology
   that draws from his little-utilized essay on embarrassment and social
   organization.

AB How power is extended vertically through hierarchies and horizontally
   through industrial networks and markets is a classic issue in sociology
   that was once extensively studied by Weber. Yet it is little studied
   today. Definitions of power exclude power exercise beyond the single
   relation, as does research in exchange networks. In contrast, research
   in organizations recognizes the extension of power, but offers no theory
   to explain how it is produced or to identify the conditions which might
   further or impede it. Here the extension of power beyond the single
   relationship is called power-at-a-distance. New theory offering metric
   predictions is applied to power-at-a-distance in exchange networks. That
   theory identifies the conditions that extend power beyond the dyad and
   the conditions that tend to block that extension. Five experiments on
   contrasting structures broadly support those predictions. Relations
   between power-at-a-distance and power centralization are theorized.
   Practical problems of extending power are addressed and further research
   is proposed.

AB Karl Polanyi's 1944 book, The Great Transformation, has been recognized
   as central for the field of economic sociology, but it has not been
   subject to the same theoretical scrutiny as other classic works in the
   field. This is a particular problem in that there are central tensions
   and complexities in Polanyi's argument. This article suggests that these
   tensions can be understood as a consequence of Polanyi's changing
   theoretical orientation. The basic outline of the book was developed in
   England in the late 1930s when Polanyi was working within a specific
   type of Marxist framework. However, as he was writing the book, he
   developed several new concepts, including fictitious commodities and the
   embedded economy, that led in new directions. Because circumstances did
   not give him the time to revise his manuscript, the book is marked by a
   tension between these different moments in his own theoretical
   development. The result is that Polanyi glimpses the concept of the
   always embedded market economy, but he does not name it or elaborate it.

AB The "embeddedness'' of economic life in social relations has become a
   productive analytical principle and the basis of a penetrating critique
   of economic orthodoxy. But this critique raises another important,
   social and historical question, of how the economy became "disembedded''
   in the first place - how the multitude of transactions designated
   (somewhat arbitrarily) as economic were abstracted from the rest of
   social life and reconstituted as an object, the economy, which behaves
   according to its own logic. This article investigates the social sources
   of some innovations in economic thought that contributed to the
   emergence of the economy, particularly statistical indicators and
   mechanical models. By examining the redefinitions of the object of
   economic research developed by Irving Fisher and Wesley Mitchell in the
   1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century, I argue that the
   abstraction of the economy from the remainder of social life was a
   strategy linked to the position of these innovators within the field of
   economics, conceived as a social structure. Possessing a specialized
   scientific cultural capital, but lacking upper class background,
   contacts, and dispositions that characterized the founders of academic
   economics, Fisher and Mitchell elaborated new definitions of their
   discipline's object of study, and a new type of economic expertise.

AB Using stories of citizens' resistance to legalized authority, the
   authors propose that the act of storytelling extends temporally and
   socially what might otherwise be an individual, discrete, and ephemeral
   transaction. Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a
   social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant,
   institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized
   authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including
   symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although
   such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional
   change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific
   social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending
   the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of
   resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of
   the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance
   can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of
   power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories,
   they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social
   structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.

   related to the way STL is handled within faculty assessment as well as
   aspects of faculty assessment that could be topics for STL. Topics
   suggested for STL on assessment (student evaluations, teaching and
   learning styles, distance education, and faculty sociodemographics)
   would contribute to our understanding the evaluation of teaching.
   Consideration of the knowledge currently available and the knowledge
   needed in these areas leads us to two conclusions. First, there is
   considerable opportunity for sociologists to contribute to STL within
   faculty assessment. Contributions can be made in understanding what
   constitutes STL and methods for assessing contributions in this area of
   research. Second, both conceptual and empirical STL can be conducted
   within a sociological framework to improve methods of assessing teaching
   during faculty assessment.

AB Forty textbooks developed for the introductory sociology market are
   examined for the quantity and quality of material pertaining to ideas in
   the symbolic interaction tradition. All texts discuss at least some of
   the ideas from this tradition. Most of the texts, however, only include
   material from the Chicago school of this tradition with only a few
   including information from the Iowa school. Thus, the ideas about
   symbolic interaction that students receive from these texts are both
   incomplete and outdated. Additionally, the inclusion of material from
   only one of these schools greatly diminishes opportunities to use
   information from the other school to help students gain a sociological
   perspective on some of the most important topics in the introductory
   course. We discuss the empirical findings from the study together with
   many illustrations of how material from both symbolic interaction
   traditions can be used to enhance student learning about topics central
   to the introductory course.

AB Some sociologists have wrestled with the problem of teaching distinct

   e.g., Bader, Becker, and Desmond 1996, Kunkel 1999). Serious issues
   arise in course development, including course content similarity,
   theoretical overlap, and reading and writing assignment redundancy. What
   if we must teach delinquency in addition to criminology and deviance?
   Sociology majors interested in crime and deviance are likely to take
   more than one of these sociology courses, and non-majors often take
   these courses as electives. In this paper, I offer ideas for developing
   distinct deviance, delinquency, and criminology courses, and discuss how
   to reduce theoretical and other content overlap, paper assignments,
   course readings, and departmental issues.

AB Efforts to prepare graduate students for the multiple responsibilities
   they will face as faculty members have led to an emphasis on the
   development of teaching credentials as evidence of teaching
   effectiveness. Teaching credentials refer to teaching experience,
   syllabi, teaching evaluations, a teaching philosophy, and a teaching
   portfolio. Although these indicators have gained popularity among some
   graduate education programs in sociology, to what extent are they
   requested of job applicants? Our content analysis of the academic
   positions advertised in the 1999 Employment Bulletin suggests that the
   majority of departments prefer applicants with teaching experience, but
   few request specific evidence of teaching effectiveness in their job
   advertisements. Moreover, we find that research-oriented institutions
   are less likely to request teaching credentials. Recommendations for
   future research are proposed.

AB Despite serious methodological problems, quantitative studies of poverty
   by U.S. sociologists predominantly rely on the official U.S. measure.
   After reviewing the shortcomings of the U.S. measure, this article
   examines several theoretical and methodological advances in poverty
   measurement. After synthesizing literature on poverty measurement, I
   argue that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative
   historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute;
   (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of
   taxes, transfers, and state benefits, and (5) integrate the depth of
   poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates
   sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of
   these criteria. Due to sociology's neglect of these criteria, this
   article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval
   measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally,
   using the Luxembourg Income Study, I examine the empirical patterns with
   these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967
   to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available for
   future research.

AB While the scholarship on internal labor markets and promotion chances
   has contributed substantially to the sociology of organizations and
   labor markets, it has not developed a rich understanding of how career
   trajectories are influenced by the firm's competitive position in its
   product market. Our central claim is that a firm's implicit bargaining
   power over its employees depends on its product market position and its
   sensitivity to environmental change. The greater the firm's bargaining
   power, the less the firm will be compelled to use promotions as a device
   to induce productivity. Firms occupying robust competitive positions
   should have greater bargaining power in the labor market and be less
   likely to fill vacancies through internal promotions. Analyses of
   promotion rates among top managers in a longitudinal sample of
   television stations support our thesis.

AB In the analysis of cross-classified data, sociologists often focus on
   building flexible models for the marginal distributions of a selected
   set of variables. One strategy for achieving flexible modeling is to
   design models for telescoping marginal distributions. As an illustration
   of telescoping distributions, consider a joint distribution of four
   cross-classifying variables: occupational attainment, education level,
   race, and gender A set Of telescoping distributions would be the
   univariate occupation distribution, the bivariate occupation by
   education, the trivariate occupation by education by race, and the
   entire joint distribution. A methodology that enables the telescoping
   modeling strategy is mixed parameterization, which has its roots in the
   statistics and sociology literatures. In this article, the authors
   develop a scheme of multilevel mixed parameterization that can be
   applied to a hierarchy of marginal distributions of reducing dimension.
   An example from the General Social Survey illustrates mixed parameters
   for telescoping models.
