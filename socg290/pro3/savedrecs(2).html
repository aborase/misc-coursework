<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and
   research into the connections between associations and democracy. This
   article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy
   into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds
   of associations make: to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic
   governance in various (d) political contexts? Associations enhance
   democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of
   associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills,
   offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the
   quality and equality of representation, facilitating public
   deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to
   participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all
   mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations
   are better suited to advance some contributions than others.
   Further-more, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy
   for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of
   democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations
   appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance-liberal
   minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and
   participatory democracy-are also discussed. Finally, the democratic
   priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual
   features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example,
   associations that resist government authority are more crucial than
   those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.</td>

   ineffectiveness in dealing with the anomie associated with high
   modernity. I attempt to make the case for a sociology that can
   empirically distinguish between tolerance and license and can posit
   conceptions of "social justice" and "morality" as empirically
   demonstrable phenomena. After briefly discussing relevant ideas
   associated with classical sociology and recent theoretical approaches to
   the question of sociocultural relativity, I suggest that any attempt to
   deal with the issue of social justice must involve an empirically
   grounded view of universal human nature as an emergent process that
   reveals itself time and time again within the seemingly infinite
   diversity of a socially constructed world. I further suggest that the
   path to understanding emergent human nature might include an integration
   of linguistic analysis, contemporary brain research, and the quest for
   human universals. After considering the practical (and impractical)
   implications of a successful search for emergent human nature for the
   discipline of sociology, I conclude the address with a real life example
   that illustrates the essence of human species powers even in the face of
   authoritarian oppression.</td>

   decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than
   counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the

   0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with
   the smallest proportion of White youth (1st decile = 0.13). These

   higher-level thinking. What, then, is higher-level thinking and why is
   it important? What is the proper attitude for this form of thinking?
   What are the most important dimensions and types of higher-level
   thinking, particularly in sociology? How should we teach higher-level

   inform the teaching of sociology in the 21st century. This article

   geographic patterning of suicide. this classic debate is revisited using
   techniques of spatial analysis and data for two geographies: late
   nineteenth-century French departments, and late twentieth-century U.S.
   counties. Results of the French analysis contradict Durkheim's claim
   that "imitation" plays no role in shaping the geographic patterning of
   suicide. Suicide rates for northern and southern French departments
   cluster geographically even when the clustering of multiple dimensions
   of social integration is controlled. These findings are replicated in a
   contemporary analysis of nonwestern U.S. counties. Results for the
   American West, however support the Durkheimian view that suicide
   clusters in geographic space only because important structural
   predictors of suicide, including measures,of social integration, do so
   as. well. These discrepant findings are reconciled and it is concluded
   that the geographic patterning of suicide is shaped by both social
   integration and imitation.</td>

   by subjects. A game theoretic model of strategic interactions between
   rulers and subjects is developed to more fully specify the relationship
   between state-making and revolt in France between 1515 and 1789.
   Quantitative analyses of revolts throughout France are combined with a
   brief case study of revolts in Guyenne (the most quarrelsome French
   province) to test propositions derived from the model. Offensive war
   (but not war in general) and administrative centralization increased the
   likelihood of revolt, while the presence of the Estates General (the
   national legislative assembly) decreased it. The effect of taxation on
   revolt depended on the historical context-high taxes and offensive wars
   tended to incite revolts prior to the Fronde (a cluster of revolts in
   1648-1653), but had no effect afterwards. It is argued that the outcomes
   of significant revolts, like the Fronde, often serve as important
   turning points in the history of state-making. Potentially similar

   place, race, and gender interact to determine the levels of
   homeownership for nonmarried women? The findings reveal that, although
   black women were less likely than white women to own homes, the racial
   differential declined dramatically in rural areas over the two-decade
   period. The overall trend of decline was opposite to that for urban
   areas.</td>

   substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion
   is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an
   impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs;
   and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent
   that their activities provide elected officials with information and
   resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is
   articles published in major sociology and political science journals
   from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of
   organizations on policy. The major findings include. political
   organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and
   nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some
   evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral
   concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.</td>

   neighborhood effects. Neighborhood effects are community influences on
   individual social or economic outcomes. Examples include labor force
   activity, child outcomes, criminal behavior, and other socioeconomic
   phenomena. The existing theoretical and empirical literature is
   reviewed. Conceptual definitions from sociology are linked and
   contrasted with economic models. Early studies are criticized for
   failing to account for a number of endogeneity concerns. Recent
   empirical studies are also explored. The results of these papers
   demonstrate that although neighborhood characteristics are important,
   their influences are much smaller than suggested by previous research.
   An additional emphasis is dedicated to linking the neighborhood effects
   literature to other research of local or spatial activity within
   economics, sociology, and geography. In particular, the potential
   employment of local interaction game theory and spatial econometrics in
   neighborhood effects research is discussed. Additionally, a catalogue of
   existing empirical research is assembled. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Max Weber has typically been regarded as a central thinker in the
   liberal tradition of social analysis. At the same time, critics have
   long noted how his democratic commitments were compromised by his
   nationalism. Drawing on existing criticism, I discuss the importance of
   charismatic leadership in Weber's thought and its implications for his
   understanding of the process of democratization. Reconstructing core
   concepts in Weber's political thought, I analyze how Weber's concept of
   plebiscitarian leadership unites charismatic domination with nationalism
   and skepticism concerning effective democratic politics. I show how
   Weber's concept of plebiscitarian rule grew from deeply held political
   values and his engagement with German politics. I then generate
   propositions regarding the problem of democratization in regime
   transitions and apply them to contemporary charismatic leaders and
   ethno-nationalist mobilization in post-Communist transitions. T argue
   that as much as it anticipates the central dilemma of charismatic
   solutions to political crisis, Weber's thought favors nationalist and
   plebiscitarian responses to democratization that have been largely
   discredited by historical experience.</td>

   author organized a special session to reflect on the particular
   sociological tradition associated with Washington University, with a
   particular focus on Alvin Gouldner's work. From that session came this
   symposium. for which various papers presented were developed into
   articles. The session and these articles raise important issues for what
   they tell us both about Gouldner's work and about where sociology is as
   a discipline today. Among these issues are (1) the optimistic quest for
   objective value-free knowledge positivism entailed in the past versus a
   self-reflexive quest for knowledge that entails a tragic acceptance of
   its limits at present. (2) the effort to distinguish social theory from
   sociology, ideology. and politics, with all of whom it overlaps as they
   strive to be both social diagnosis and social therapy. (3) the
   production of knowledge as dependent both on the lived experiences that
   shape our biographies and on the intellectual influences available in
   the local settings where we work, (4) the effort to warn us against the
   various excesses to which our disciplinary and personal commitments give
   way, and (5) the role social theory can play as a search light that
   illuminates our way in the darkness of the empirical world in which we
   live, while it simultaneously casts a shadow.</td>

   understanding the transitions Alvin Gouldner made during his career as a
   sociologist. This article argues that a latent tragic orientation or
   vision existed during Gouldner's early career as a standout in the field
   of industrial sociology and that this tragic vision became manifest
   around 1962 as Gouldner was developing more and more strident
   denunciations of establishment sociology. This case study of Gouldner's
   career teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the tragic
   vision in helping sociologists to understand the limitations of the

   contributions ever made to the sociology of ideas. Overshadowed soon

   The coming crisis of Western Sociology. the earlier book has suffered
   neglect. In an effort to correct this situation, we situate Enter Plato
   against the backdrop of other mid-twentieth-century works in the
   sociology of knowledge and related areas, arguing that Gouldner's study
   was one of the first sustained responses to Robert K, Merton's call for
   a sociology of knowledge that would steer a middle course between the
   abstract, speculative tendencies of the field's European founders and
   the relatively atheoretical contributions of their American
   counterparts. We build on this interpretation to offer a contemporary
   sociological appraisal of Enter Plato, considering its positive and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The movement to assess student learning more comprehensively and more
   systematically began in earnest in the mid-1980s, and today is
   entrenched throughout higher education. However, commentary about
   assessment continues to be dominated by anecdotal reports and analyses
   of the strengths and weaknesses of particular programs. In order to
   obtain a broad-based picture of the development of assessment programs
   within sociology, 150 sociology departments were randomly selected and
   sent a self-administered questionnaire regarding the level of
   development of their departmental statement of purpose, departmental
   goals and objectives, the use of and experience with particular
   assessment mechanisms, and a summative judgment about the amount of work
   invested in assessment to date and the effects of that work.Almost
   two-thirds of the 70 responding departments have a departmental
   statement of purpose, but only about half of the departments have
   articulated specific learning objectives for students. Departments in
   public institutions are much more likely than departments in private
   institutions to have a statement of purpose and are somewhat more likely
   to have learning objectives. The most common assessment mechanisms being
   used are evaluations of specific assignments in required major courses,
   student surveys, alumni surveys, external reviewers, and evaluations of
   research projects. However, the most beneficial mechanisms are perceived
   to be reviews by external evaluators, work in a capstone course,
   in-house comprehensive exams, and in-house exams given early and late
   during a student's progression through the sociology major. Responding
   institutions reported that they have dedicated only a moderate effort to
   their student learning assessments and that the information received
   from those assessments has provided only moderate value. The
   implications of these assessment patterns found in sociology departments
   are discussed.</td>

   strategies. The data are broken down by school type-public and
   private-as well as by school size. Alumni and senior surveys and
   capstone products are used most often, while commercial exams, external
   review of student work, and oral exams are used least often. Few
   differences exist for school type and size. Impact on the curriculum and
   teaching is modest at best, with faculty members at private and smaller
   schools reporting greater impact. The implications of outcomes
   assessment for power redistribution are examined.</td>

   issue. Arguments often center on assessment methodology, but the real
   source of disagreement is usually the underlying model of learning
   informing the methodology. This article describes a program for
   assessing student learning at a community college using critical
   theories of knowledge and the learning process. The faculty-designed
   assessment program includes an annotated bibliography assignment
   required in all introductory sociology sections. Faculty identified
   three types of literacy that students were expected to understand and
   practice as a result of the assignment: resource, social structural, and
   social scientific. Student learning in these areas was tracked across
   semesters using a survey, faculty observations, and sampled evaluations
   of completed bibliographies. All measures of learning indicate
   significant improvement in learning outcomes. The article records and
   discusses the program methodology within the framework of critical
   pedagogical theory.</td>

   assessment of one multidisciplinary program goal (understanding human
   behavior). We show how assessing a desired outcome requires attention to
   four specific areas: organizational context, the articulation of a
   learning model, program design and implementation, and outcomes
   assessment. Our findings, based on multiple indicators gathered over
   time and including both summative and formative measures, suggest that
   our graduates are generally achieving the outcomes established for them.
   We discuss how our results are used to inform decision-makers, and how
   inconsistencies discovered between the program's desired outcomes and
   students' actual achievements are managed within the framework of the
   program. Finally, we highlight several lessons learned as a result of
   this intensive process, linking its benefits to programs within
   sociology and other disciplines.</td>

   different types of curricula and report results from a
   quasi-experimental design comparing the level of critical sociological
   reasoning skills between students near the beginning and those finishing
   their studies. Those students finishing their program, organized as a
   loosely-spiraling curriculum with a capstone course, displayed stronger
   sociological reasoning skills even when controlling for each student's
   overall GPA. An analysis of course syllabi revealed an academic
   environment with variable standards inconsistently associated with
   course level. Several recommendations are offered for the "real world"
   implementation of sociology curriculum assessment. We think the

   examine how human interest stories create collective attention,
   essential for the establishment of a public or demos, and the
   limitations of that process. Although human interest stories are not
   unique in this regard, such stories encourage shared identification,
   important for social cohesion and the maintenance of a public sphere.
   However, since the embedded story is presented as one that is not
   perceived as having lasting societal impact, it directs attention away
   from political action. We present four processes through which human
   interest stories operate. (1) media placement - how media structure and
   occupational interests produce stories that capture reader loyalty, (2)
   identification potential - the creation of scenes and personae that
   audiences feel they "know" and with which they can identify, (3)
   narrative arc - the process by which a story maintains reader interest,
   exposing conflicts and changes in likely outcomes, and (4) discursive
   space - the role of moral issues, provoking discussion and the
   possibility of active involvement of audiences. To explore these
   processes we analyze the case of Floyd Collins, the Kentucky caver
   trapped for seventeen days in 1925, and detail the associated media
   frenzy.</td>

   technologies has resulted in the creation of the Internet, a global
   network of computers that has been growing at an exponential rate.
   Although the Internet/World Wide Web combination is widely hailed as a
   new, powerful engine of global social and economic change, there has
   been very little sociological theorizing and even less sociological
   research on the globalization of the Internet. Using classical
   macrosocial theories of development as a springboard, we hypothesize
   that the level of development, political openness/democracy, mass
   education, the presence of a sizeable tertiary/services sector, and
   interactions between some of these variables will drive the Internet's
   growth and spread around the globe. In our cross-national analysis of
   approximately 74 developed and developing countries, we find that
   Internet capacity is not in fact a simple linear function of economic
   and political development, but rather has been driven by complex
   interactions that could aptly be termed "post-industrialism." Uncovering
   some of these structural preconditions and determinants of Internet
   diffusion provides a first step toward providing a theoretical and
   empirical sociology of this "third technological revolution." (C) 2002

   management to teaching methods, considering ways that teachers can

   sociological education and professionalization of high school teachers
   of the discipline. Improving teacher training is the best way to enhance

   insights from their better trained teachers.</td>

   the meaning and value of the sociological imagination. While this task
   is daunting under typical circumstances, it is more difficult when
   instructors are committed to raising students' critical awareness of
   social conventions that maintain systems of racial oppression. In this
   paper, we discuss our experiences with teaching this aspect of the
   sociological imagination to a group of ethnically and economically
   privileged students. Based upon our experiences and existing research,
   we propose that a rise in students' political conservatism and their
   adoption of color-blind racism may explain our students' recalcitrance
   and the increasing reports of resistance from those who teach race and
   inequality courses. We provide details of an assignment that eased
   students' recalcitrance by enabling them to demonstrate to themselves
   the fallacies of scientific racism. The assignment, a critical
   assessment of Rushton's scathing review of "Gould's Mismeasure of Man, "
   required students to exercise their sociological imagination to
   successfully unmask the agendas, fallacies, and consequences of
   "scientific racism." Quotes from the students' assignments and the
   course evaluations show that the assignment conveys to recalcitrant
   students the utility of sociological analysis.</td>

   histories portray different strategies of organizing associations and

   strategy, but its viability ebbed and flowed with political oppression,
   the state of sociology as a discipline and internal associational
   conditions such as disciplinary composition and dissension. Two of the
   seven associations have survived continuously since being founded, while
   the other five have perished and been reborn from one to five times.
   Political oppression and internal associational dissension are what are
   mainly responsible for these associational deaths; for the state of
   sociology and its place in the academy for rebirths; and for the
   organizational cooptation of member interests for associational survival

   clearly recognize the limitations of the local market for labor. Sample
   women are ambivalent about welfare receipt and welfare reform. Although

   lifetime. Championed by reputational entrepreneurs, reputations emerge
   from competitive fields of interpretive possibilities. The purification
   of Pete Seeger's image, from vilified Communist to national hero, lets
   us study both reputational change and the relationship between art and
   politics. An objectivist model suggests that reputations simply reflect
   truth. An ideological model claims that Seeger's redemption is shaped by
   a biased media. Neither sufficiently explains the competitive nature of
   reputational politics. Our constructionist model takes into account both
   the role of reputational entrepreneurs and the structural constraints
   they face. We chart Seeger's reputation through four historical periods:
   recognition among his peers on the Left (1940s), ruin in the McCarthy
   period (1950-62), renown among sympathetic subcultures (1960s), and
   institutionalization as a cultural icon. While it has clear advantages,
   institutionalization can also have a dampening effect on an artist's
   oppositional potency.</td>

   concentration within major urban areas. Los Angeles and New York City
   are two of the most important immigrant meccas today. Recent studies of
   immigrant adaptation within these cities have emphasized material
   factors at the expense of cultural considerations. This paper adopts a
   comparative perspective to demonstrate extreme differences in the
   symbolic construction of identity vis-a-vis immigrants in these two
   urban areas. Using The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times as
   indicators of elite cultural orientations, a content analysis is
   performed. The results demonstrate the social construction of an
   exclusive "threat" narrative in Southern California, and an inclusive
   "immigrant as victim" narrative in the New York metropolitan area. I
   argue that this extreme variation in cultural orientations must be
   understood as the result of divergent material and symbolic contexts. In
   order to demonstrate the importance of cultural factors, this paper
   focuses on symbolic differences between these areas and the influence
   these differences have on the political process of inclusion/exclusion.</td>

   away from mainstream sociology, to the detriment of both. For
   sociologists working in this field, application of Max Weber's political
   sociology is proposed as one way to reconnect their research with
   longstanding concerns of the discipline. Weber's political sociology
   contains a conflict model focusing on structured inequalities of class,
   status, and power. Its relevance to both contemporary sociology and

   religiousness are a product of differential socialization. Yet, there is
   little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the
   literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the
   relationship between differential socialization and differential
   religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World
   Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between
   traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs
   and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the
   two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model
   involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new
   approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being
   irreligious constitutes risk-taking behavior. This model is able to
   predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and
   cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the most widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been
   how to interpret patterns of family change in the United States during
   the past four decades. Much of these debates focus on a thesis advanced
   by a number of scholars and political activists-that such features of
   family structure as high divorce rates and an increasing proportion of
   single-parent families have led to the decline of the family. Although
   past research has examined the causes and historical trends involved in
   family change, scholars have neglected important questions about family
   attitudes that have been raised in recent debates. Have levels of public
   concerti with family decline increased over time? If so, what are the
   sources of these attitudes? And have changing levels of public concerti
   with family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage?
   This study applies a theory of religious influence to answer these
   questions. Results show that public concern with family decline
   increased steadily after 1980, leading to a new and increasingly large
   cleavage in presidential elections. The analyses also find that high
   levels of concern with family decline are concentrated among evangelical
   Protestants who attend church regularly. In addition to extending
   sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions,
   these results bear productively on theory and research in political
   sociology and the sociology of religion. I discuss their relevance to
   long-standing debates over political trends among evangelical
   Protestants and the influence of Christian Right movement organizations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The recent literature on immigrant transnationalism points to an
   alternative form of economic adaptation of foreign minorities in
   advanced societies that is based on the mobilization of their
   cross-country social networks, Case studies have noted the phenomenon's
   potential significance for immigrant integration into receiving
   countries and for the economic development in countries of origin.
   Despite their suggestive character, these studies consistently sample on
   the dependent variable (transnationalism), failing to establish the
   empirical existence of these activities beyond a few descriptive
   examples and their possible determinants. These issues are addressed
   using a survey designed explicitly for this purpose and conducted among
   selected Latin immigrant groups in the United States. Although immigrant
   transnationalism has received little attention in the mainstream
   sociological literature so far, it has the potential of altering the
   character of the new ethnic Communities spawned by contemporary
   immigration. The empirical existence of transnationalism is examined on
   the basis of discriminant functions of migrant characteristics, and the
   relative probabilities of engaging in these kinds of activities is
   established based on hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications
   for the sociology of immigration as well as for broader sociological
   theories of the economy are discussed.</td>

   internships to research projects and field trips, The questions include:
   Among the goals of the project, are there primary and secondary goals or
   are the goals given equal weight? Is participation in the project
   mandatory or voluntary? Should the CBL component of a course be
   concentrated in one site or dispersed across many sites? How similar or
   different should each student's individual participation in the project
   be? How central should direct client/community interaction be to
   students' activities? Based on a review of the CBL literature in
   Sociology and feedback from the students and partner organization in our
   own CBL project, we discuss each question and outline some of the
   advantages and disadvantages of various decisions, focusing on the
   competing interests of students, instructors, and partner organizations.
   The aim is not to advocate one kind of project or design over another
   but rather to help other project planners anticipate and avoid pitfalls
   noted in the literature and maximize the benefits of CBL.</td>

   systematically compares the outcomes from two groups of students, one of
   which was involved in relatively unstructured community work and the
   other in a structured service learning assignment and examines the
   benefits experienced from this transformation. Although adding the
   structure necessary to accomplish effective service learning involved
   careful preliminary reflection, planning, and coordination, the study
   suggests that the service learning approach enhances students'
   development of a sociological orientation and understanding of
   structural linkages to poverty. It also indicates that students involved
   in structured service learning may better master course materials than
   students involved In less-structured community work, as measured by
   objective examination. Finally, the study supports earlier claims
   reported in the literature that service learning might be a particularly
   effective way of improving the efficacy of introductory sociology
   courses.</td>

   and activities. Using these insights, this article develops and tests a
   theory of European integration focusing on the case of the European
   Community, the first pillar of the European Union. Traders, organized
   interests, courts, and the EC's policy-making organs, over time, have
   produced a self- sustaining causal system that has driven the
   construction of the European market and polity. The generality of this
   explanation to a sociology of markets and polity-building projects is
   discussed in the conclusion.</td>

   demonstrating the existence of competing explanations for the question

   explanation, multiple victimization arguments that emphasize the
   numerous ways battered women are victimized, are most common. Through an
   analysis of social science citations, news papers, and legislative and
   judicial decisions, I conclude that one multiple victimization argument
   in particular Lenore Walker's battered woman svndrome (Walker, 1979, The
   Battered Woman. New York: Harper Row; Walker, 1984, The Battered Woman
   Syndrome. New York: Springer), has become the most recognized
   explanation for why abusive relationships continue. The syndrome was
   best able to meet the criteria necessary, for gaining cultural
   authority, put forth by, Schudson (1989, Theory, and Society,
   18:153180): retrievability, rhetorical force, resonance, resolution, and
   institutional retention. In recent,ears, however this authority, has
   been threatened as social and cultural conditions have changed, leaving
   competing understandings of the domestic violence issue to challenge
   Walker's claims.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Are the politics of economic regulation contingent on institutions?
   Drawing on arguments about institutional mediation and the institutional
   bases of rational action, we explore how institutions shape the dynamics
   invoked in two theories of regulation. We argue that institutional
   arrangements affect both the clarity and the content of group interests
   in regulation. Event history analyses of U.S.. states' passage of fire
   insurance regulation from 1906 to 1930 support these arguments in
   several ways. Market-heterogeneity dynamics specified by cartel-capture
   theory affected the passage of regulation only under some
   conditions-namely, relatively depoliticized settings with little overt
   conflict or uncertainty about policy outcomes. In addition, interest
   group dynamics were conditioned by the consolidation of
   interorganizational fields around a particular model of market order,
   which allowed divergent interest groups to converge in support of
   regulation. The research suggests ways of thinking about theoretical
   generality and specificity, regulatory politics, and the relationship
   between institutional theory and rationality.</td>

   to resolve these seemingly incompatible perspectives. By extending
   Randall Collins's interaction ritual theory, and synthesizing it with
   Norbert Wiley's model of the self this paper suggests how the emotional
   dynamics between people and within the self can explain social inertia
   as well as the possibility for resistance and change. Diverging from
   literature on the sociology of emotions that has been concerned with
   individual emotional processes, this paper considers the collective
   level in order to explore how movement action is motivated. The
   emotional dynamics of subordinate positioning that limit women's options
   in face-to-face interactions are examined, as are the social processes
   of developing feminist consciousness and a willingness to participate in
   resistance work. Pointing toward empirical applications, I conclude by
   suggesting conditions where resistance is likely.</td>

   isolated the social and political forces that account for the legality
   of this punishment. Racial or ethnic threat theories suggest that the
   death penalty will more likely be legal in jurisdictions with relatively
   large black or Hispanic populations. Economic threat explanations
   suggest that this punishment will be present in unequal areas.
   Jurisdictions with a more conservative public or a stronger
   law-and-order Republican party should be more likely to legalize the
   death penalty as well. After controlling for social disorganization,
   region, period, and violent crime, panel analyses suggest that minority
   presence and economic inequality enhance the likelihood of a legal death
   penalty. Conservative values and Republican strength in the legislature
   have equivalent effects. A supplemental time-to-event analysis supports
   these conclusions. The results suggest that a political approach has
   explanatory power because threat effects expressed through politics and
   effects that are directly political invariably account for decisions
   about the legality of capital punishment.</td>

   of their degree of consensus (the degree to which all group members
   agree) and their degree of "tightness" (the degree to which holding some
   belief implies holding or not holding other beliefs). Two theoretical
   claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal
   properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to
   produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of
   authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The
   clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as
   an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order
   translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs.
   These claims are tested with data on 44 naturally occurring communities.</td>

   dismissing such efforts use the standards of physics as grounds for
   their objection. Although recognizing that no natural science can serve
   as an automatic template for our work, we suggest that Darwin's work on
   evolution provides a far more applicable model for linking theory and
   research since he dealt with obstacles far more similar to our own. This
   includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather
   than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse
   data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number
   of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction
   as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability
   to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it
   and in its development. Other sciences are briefly cited as well, but
   the main emphasis is on the lessons that Darwin provides for social
   sciences such as sociology that obtain their evidence primarily from

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among
   variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as
   interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response
   to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how
   simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but
   enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information,
   emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in
   collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly
   and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in
   revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide
   theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than
   the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the
   emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical
   model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a
   brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in
   computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs
   fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We
   then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social
   structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology
   has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new
   methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the
   papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social
   networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs
   are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological
   theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology,
   social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with
   a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological
   potential of this approach.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Changes in U.S. environmental policy direction under the Bush
   Administration reflect two interdependent trends that have emerged over
   the past two decades: an increased capability among corporations to
   shape public policy to benefit their narrow interests, and a marked
   decline in the efficacy of democratic forces to defend progressive
   environmental policy. This article theorizes key aspects of
   antienvironmental thought and practice-facets include scientific
   production, civil-political societal relations, interclass coalition
   building, procorporate propaganda, and domination of opposition-to
   demonstrate the existence of a coordinated countermovement. The theory
   is guided by a political sociology adapted from the method of Antonio
   Gramsci that comprehends policymaking in terms of material interests
   without reducing human agency to structural imperative. Evidence
   marshaled to support the theory is gathered from the antienvironmental
   literature, public relations product, and information on political and
   economic affiliations between and among antienvironmentalists and their
   organizations.</td>

   behavior and social movements, in the study of social groups and group
   dynamics, in the interaction of structure and agency, and in the study
   of the social constructions of group identity. Examples drawn from
   several sociology courses are used to illustrate how the "sociological"

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper examines the relationship between rural socialization and
   hunting participation. Assessments of the cultural significance of
   hunting as a "way of life" in rural areas echo traditional assertions of
   the importance of rurality, but do not consider the interplay between
   rural residence and other variables that affect hunting participation.
   Although previous research has demonstrated that rural residents are
   more likely to participate in hunting, as are males and those who are
   influenced by family, the interaction of these variables is poorly
   understood. A national survey used a socialization framework to explore
   the more specific conditions under which rural upbringings were
   associated with increased hunting participation. Rural upbringings
   fostered air increase in hunting primarily when the socialization
   relationship between agent and target was unlikely to do so and when
   participation was consistent with gender norms: rural males whose
   fathers did not hunt were more likely to hunt than urban males whose
   fathers did not. In no other cases did rural upbringings result in an
   increased propensity for hunting. Therefore we suggest that broad
   statements about the cultural significance of hunting to rural life be
   made more cautiously, with the effects of other variables taken into
   account.</td>

   addresses topics informal sociological models and the definition,
   construction, and interpretation of social indicators. I show how
   standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary
   sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This
   demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many
   formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every
   scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and
   model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation
   of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment
   of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate,
   and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These
   studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that
   otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in
   particular, define and interpret social indicators.</td>

   sociologists. In an effort to generate greater domestic interest in the
   field, an examination of Max Weber's methodology and an update to his
   study of music is proposed. Fewer occupations or cultural projects are
   more social than making music, and the domestic sociological community's
   absence from the debate is deplorable given the dominant position our
   country possesses regarding musical production. Weber's Sociology of
   Music, which combines urban theory, class/labor theory, rationalization
   theory, and even climatic changes, is an excellent place to begin a
   thorough discussion of the social components of music. Our present
   understanding of cultural theories, urban theories, and Habermas's
   Communicative Action Theory can be employed to improve on Weber's
   theory; toward a new approach for the study of the sociology of music.</td>

   unrelated to religious belief and practice, gender and race, educational
   performance and grade expectations, and end-of-semester pressures. These
   results are entirely consistent with Colin Campbell's theory of modern

   century, sociologists usually avoid acknowledging progress for fear of

   progress raises concern about social problems. The paradox of
   perfectionism is that optimistic beliefs in social perfectability
   highlight failures to achieve perfection and thereby foster pessimism.
   The paradox of proportion is that reducing large problems makes smaller
   problems seem relatively larger. The paradox of proliferation is that
   social progress encourages recognition of a larger number of problems.
   Finally, the paradox of paranoia is that progress fosters fears of

   dogging discussion of federal civil rights legislation in the early
   1990s, this article highlights sociology's role in shaping employment
   law and shows how apparently technical legal arguments about allocating
   burdens of proof affect labor market resource allocation among the
   classes, races, and genders. Contrasting institutional-sociological with
   liberal-legal concepts of discrimination, the article shows why
   disparate impact theory has been the most sociological approach to Title
   VII enforcement. It also shows how disparate impact-a theory and method
   for establishing legally cognizable employment discrimination injurious
   to women and minorities-is, and is not, related to affirmative action-a
   policy encompassing a broad range of procedures intended to provide
   positive consideration to members of groups discriminated against in the
   past. Finally, a competing incentive framework is used to show that,
   although disparate impact creates some incentives for employers to adopt
   quota hiring, such incentives are counter-balanced by major incentives
   working against race- and gender-based quotas. Major counterincentives
   stem from disparate impact itself, from other aspects of equal
   employment law, and from organizational goals shaping business response
   to the legal environment.</td>

   history of sociological theory, its broadest purpose being to stimulate
   a dialogue among competing "narratives" that will reduce the

   of particular issues the critics raise are addressed by the book's
   arguments regarding the relation of the discipline of sociology to its
   philosophical background, the international setting of early sociology,
   Durkheim's individualism, Weber's distinction between naturalism and
   interpretability, Marx's treatment of Feuerbach and of nationalism, and
   the relation between power and knowledge. This response concludes by
   explicating the proposal that the time may be ripe to rejoin a number of
   the elements of Aristotelian social science that had been delegated to
   various national traditions of social theory in the modern era.</td>

   creditworthiness of prospective credit card holders are compared.
   Drawing on Knight's theory of risk and uncertainty, the authors argue
   that uncertainty, inherent in any credit transaction, can only be
   reduced to measurable risk if there are institutions that create
   stability over time, categorize events properly, and allow for
   verification and accumulation of information. In the United States, the
   gradual evolution of institutions underpinning rational calculation
   permits the transformation of uncertainty into risk. In Russia, however,
   such institutions are absent, and a great degree of uncertainty prevails
   in consumer credit. Using data from original fieldwork in Moscow, this
   study demonstrates that when actors face uncertainty and are unable to
   calculate risk, they rely on trust. Russian banks use and extend their
   existing social ties, or in some cases build new ties. They also exploit
   cardholders' own networks, unrelated to the bank, to increase their
   accountability through anchoring. These strategies, however, keep the
   market embedded, limited in size, and uninsurable. The authors conclude
   that calculation of probabilities (and economic rationality in its
   formal sense) is not an innate human ability but a social capacity that
   exists courtesy of institutional arrangements.</td>

   violence. These methods, many of which include self-disclosure in the
   classroom, can break down the barriers between students and the social
   world. We explore the classroom management of student self-disclosure of
   sensitive topics drawing on our experiences teaching sociology at a
   large, urban university in which a number of students used their
   employment in the sex industry as springboards into class projects.
   Students' concerns with peer disapproval and the processes through which
   they disclosed their involvement in the sex industry raised several
   pedagogical and ethical issues that have not yet been addressed in the
   self-disclosure literature. We examine a number of difficulties with
   students disclosing information partially, either to teachers or to a
   few classmates, on classroom dynamics and teacher-student interactions.
   Finally, we evaluate a number of strategies, such as hidden involvement
   fictitious informant, and full disclosure, for managing self-disclosure
   in the sociology classroom, and we discuss additional steps that
   teachers can take to address sensitive topics in class.</td>

   work on the sociology of civilizations. His main concepts for
   civilizational analysis are located within the sociological tradition,
   in particular, the work of Durkheim, Mauss and their school and Max
   Weber. The article focuses especially on the historical, comparative and
   analytic value of Nelson's distinction among three types of structures
   of consciousness (sacro-magical, faith and rationalized structures),
   particularly the historical role of rationalized structures. It suggests
   how these concepts might be given both a fuller analytical
   differentiation and more detailed historical specification. The article
   emphasizes how intercivilizational encounters provide the settings for
   cultural innovations which serve as starting points for the later
   historical transformations of civilizations. Outcomes of civilizational
   encounters between Greece, Rome and Judaism in the Hellenistic era are
   given special attention. The article's main themes are illustrated
   throughout by reference to a variety of substantive issues and
   historical comparative civilizational contexts. These include the role
   of world religions, sciences, philosophies and other cultural forms in
   the ancient world, Western Europe, Russia and elsewhere.</td>

   increase sympathy for the least affluent and enhance support for
   redistributive policies, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   may have the opposite effect. After controlling for shifts in partisan
   control of the presidency, nonwhite presence, family incomes, and union
   strength, the results suggest that civil rights activity leads to
   redistributive tax codes, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   such as riots or crime reduce tax progressivity. Additional findings
   suggest that these relationships are contingent. The positive
   relationship between civil rights actions and redistributive tax
   policies is significantly stronger when Democrats control the
   presidency, but the negative relationship between riots and egalitarian
   taxation is enhanced during Republican administrations.</td>

   next rather than one year to another. Little is known, however, of
   whether parents also chronometricalized their children's lives. Working
   with 206 advice-seeking letters written by fathers and mothers in the
   1920s and 1930s to nationally known educator and author Angelo Patri

   childhood," employ it in a multivariate analysis, and find that an urban
   environment heightened parents' tendencies toward chronometricity, while
   the financial strain of the Great Depression did just the opposite. Our
   results show how age can be viewed as a social construction, subject to
   the influence of ideology and economics, and that the scheduling of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime was
   once a core concern of American sociology. Yet the extensive post-1965
   wave of immigration to the United States has done little to rekindle
   scholarly interest in this topic, even as politicians and other public
   figures advocate public policies to restrict immigration as a means of
   preventing crime. Although both popular accounts and sociological theory
   predict that immigration should increase crime in areas where immigrants
   settle, this study of Miami, El Paso, and San Diego neighborhoods shows
   that, controlling for other influences. immigration generally does not
   increase levels of homicide among Latinos and African Americans. Our
   results not only challenge stereotypes of the "criminal immigrant" but
   also the core criminological notion that immigration, as a social
   process. disorganizes communities and increases crime.</td>

   study focuses on the impact of life chances and social choices on
   aspects of quality of life in this severely challenged population.
   Regression results show that a number of life chance and social choice
   variables affect general and domain-specific well-being. While chances
   and choices both contribute to these aspects of quality of life, there
   is only modest evidence of a mediating effect. With the exception of
   depressive symptoms, life chances appear to play a more important role
   in quality of life differences than life choices. The specific life
   chance and choice factors influencing aspects of quality of life vary

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Medical sociology and public health share many of the same concerns in
   the study of social and cultural factors that affect the health of the
   population. Differences in theoretical approaches, methodological
   procedures, conceptualization and measurement, and research objectives,
   however, often serve to limit the potential for collaboration between
   the two disciplines. Sociologists possess many of the theoretical models
   and analytical techniques needed in public health for the study of the
   impact of socioeconomic status, poverty, inequality, differentials in
   power, and social and cultural differences on disease outcomes and
   health status. Although in the past, public health professionals were
   dependent primarily on the theoretical and analytical models offered by
   epidemiology and social psychology, current trends in public health
   research ha ve opened a wider variety of opportunities for sociologists
   to contribute to public health research. Public health has reached a
   crossroads that leads in two directions: a broad approach that addresses
   the sociocultural foundations of health and a more narrow approach
   focusing on more proximal risk factors such as individual lifestyles or
   health risk behaviors. This article presents a review of the factors
   that led to this crossroads in public health and offers suggestions as
   to how sociologists might take advantage of the opportunities afforded
   by the broader approach to public health that is gaining momentum among
   some public health practitioners. Medical sociologists are uniquely
   equipped to assist public health in recapturing its historical
   commitment to social justice in the maintenance of health for the entire
   population.</td>

   are employed and paid but also in the essence of the relationship
   between doctors and patients. In medical sociology, a discipline with a
   long-standing focus on scrutinizing the role of both the physician and
   the patient, there has already been discussion of a shift from the
   doctor as more all knowing to a less dominant position vis-a-vis both
   the patient and delivery of care. Patients are aware of shifts that
   place physicians in an environment characterized by new roles and
   responsibilities, such as acting as a gatekeeper. Limitations on health
   care coverage and the rethinking of roles have led to a depiction of the
   patient as the consumer of care and the managed care plan's becoming the
   commercial enterprise from which a service is obtained. The model of the
   patient as consumer of medically related goods and services appears to
   be growing, as does a model of the physician as one who contracts for a
   specified range of services for specific patients. In this article,
   trends in and problems with contemporary managed care are raised. Calls
   for patients' rights legislation may be among the health trends of the
   new millennium.</td>

   implications for research in medical sociology in the new millennium.
   This study discusses the background and usage estimates of Internet
   technology and how this technology affects individuals gathering of
   health information. Potential consequences of this technology for
   patient-provider interactions are also examined, as are the implications
   of Internet communication for social support and health. Current
   measures of social support may be underestimating the effects of social
   support on health by not assessing the influence of support garnered
   through communications on the Internet. The Internet also presents a
   variety of new research venues that medical sociologists should pursue.
   Two of these possibilities-on line surveys and analysis of online
   communication and text-are discussed. Although the Internet is
   increasing research opportunities for medical sociologists, the fact
   that a digital divide still exists with regard to Internet access and
   use cannot be ignored.</td>

   determinants of health. The specific nature of this influence, however,
   is still a mystery. In the new millennium, racial and ethnic
   differentials in health are bound to become a major focus in medical
   sociology not only because of their persistence but also because of the
   demographic changes taking place in the United States. It is estimated
   that racial and ethnic minorities are expected to increase from the
   current level of 25 % of all Americans to 40 % by 2030 and that minority
   groups will make up more than hall of the U.S. population by 2050. Thus,
   overcoming health disparities attributable to race and ethnicity has
   become more urgent in ensuring good health for the nation. This article
   suggests that analyses of the health status of Latinos, the second
   largest minority group in the country, must attend to cultural factors.
   The need for a culture-specific approach to Latino health is
   indispensable to such discourses in medical sociology.</td>

   and why it is violent. Whereas my earlier work addresses the question of
   why collective violence is violent, here I apply and extend Donald
   Black's theory of partisanship to the question of why violence
   collectivizes. I propose in general that the collectivization of
   violence is a direct function of strong partisanship. Strong
   partisanship arises when third parries (1) support one side against the
   other and (2) are solidary among themselves. Such support occurs when
   third parties are socially close to one side and remote from the ther
   and when one side has more social status than the other Third parries
   are solidary M-hen they are intimate, culturally homogeneous. and
   interdependent. I focus in particular on lynching: Lynching is a joint
   function of strong partisanship toward the alleged victim and weak
   partisanship toward the alleged offender. Unequal strong partisanship
   appears in both classic lynchings (of outsiders) and communal lynchings
   (of insiders) across societies and history. Where partisanship is weak
   or strong on both sides, lynching is unlikely to occur. Evidence
   includes patterns of lynching in various tribal societies. the American

   practices related to qualifying examinations in 178 U.S. sociology
   graduate departments (response rate 82%). it addresses two broad
   questions: First, what is the structure of qualifying exams in sociology
   Specifically, what is the format, timing, and method of evaluation of
   this requirement How often is this exam system revised Are prestige
   rankings associated with the structure of qualifying exams Second, whet
   is the substance of these exams Do practices across departments reveal a
   "canon" within the discipline of sociology The findings indicate
   significant differences between Ph.D.-granting and M.A.-granting
   programs in exam structures, though there is considerable consistency in
   exam structures within each type of department. in most Ph.D. and M.A.
   programs, there have been recent changes in the format, content or
   evaluation of exams. Ph.D. departments with higher rankings offer
   students more freedom in taking exams and report higher rates of
   successful completion. The substance of exams is quite diverse, both in
   terms of topic areas and readings within those areas, indicating little

   telephone survey interview, however, laughter threatens standardization.
   Consequently, some survey research centers prohibit interviewers from
   laughing during the administration of surveys. The data for this study
   are recorded telephone interviews from one such survey research center.
   How interviewers handle the "laughter invitations" of respondents is
   analyzed Because these interviewers are not taught what to do when
   laughter occurs, they rely on their tacit knowledge, either accepting
   the invitation, declining it, or engaging in "pseudo-laughter":
   Interviewers most often decline or use a pseudo-laughing response.
   Laughter patterns in a survey research center that does nor prohibit
   interviewer laughter are examined for comparison, and generally much
   more reciprocation and laughter are observed. Respondent laughter
   exhibits a central tension in the telephone survey interview: How can
   interviewers maintain both standardization and an appropriately
   affiliative social relationship with respondents? The differential
   management of this tension is explored in terms of survey methodology,
   the sociology of (social) scientific knowledge, and the organization of
   talk in institutional settings.</td>

   place of the tourist in sociology. The sociology of tourists first
   focused on their economic, and then their physical and sociocultural
   impacts, in the stereotypical case of mass tourists of the metropolis
   visiting historical and peripheral locations. More recently, Graburn and
   Smith differentiated tourists by class, gender and lifestyle, and then
   by national origin. Tourism has come to be seen as a form of expressive
   and perhaps therapeutic culture comparable to art, play and leisure. The
   tourist as sight-seer was first castigated by snobbish social
   commentators, and then valorized as a seeker of authenticity by
   MacCannell, and as a easter of gazes by Urry. Cohen usefully examined
   the range of tourists' experiences and authenticities. In this special
   issue Lengkeek and Harrison re-examine tourist differentiations,
   authenticities and subjective experiences. Thorns and Perkins conjoin
   the notion of the tourist as sight-seer with that of physical performer,
   while Liebman Parrinello looks at the tourist as both embodied and as
   technologized.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The concept of sacrifice used to be a dominant theme in social
   scientific theorizing, but it is now so neglected that recent work
   speaks of the need for a "recovery" of sacrifice. Similarly,
   self-sacrifice in the service of family members, formerly seen as high
   virtue, is now often characterized as personality defect or
   self-defeating behavior. Neither self-sacrifice nor family love play a
   significant part in the prevailing family theories, grounded as they are
   in the assumption of self-interest and framed in the logic of
   utilitarian individualism and the rationalized marketplace. This
   "silence" is more ideologically based than reflective of family process.
   The absence of a language of sacrifice and love limits our ability to
   give voice to our experience, and the professional neglect of these
   concepts diminishes our understanding of the processes they name. Some
   recent work on sacrifice by scholars in other disciplines has
   implications for family theory. We draw from the disciplines of
   economics, history, philosophy, literature, sociology, and from life as
   lived by everyday people ill making the case that self-sacrifice is a
   powerful and essential part of social lift, generally, and family life
   in particular. It merits a more substantial place in contemporary
   theory. Some theoretical approaches compatible with self-sacrifice as
   principle and practice are offered..</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Trends and patterns of religious mobility have played a central role in
   theoretical controversies in the sociology of religion. Early
   examinations focused on how social status might motivate religious
   switching, and recently scholars have claimed that diminishing status
   differences between denominations have opened denominational boundaries
   and led to higher rates of religious mobility. Scholars working from
   rational actor perspectives have generated several hypotheses. First,
   human capital and adaptive preference theories suggest that switching
   will remain infrequent, and will tend to occur between similar
   denominations. Second, "strict church" perspectives argue that demanding
   sectarian denominations will have higher retention, and be more
   attractive destinations. Third, market niche perspectives argue that
   niche overlap will foster high rates of religious mobility. Finally,
   theories emphasizing normative constraints on religious choices suggest
   that quasi-ethnic religious groups will have a greater hold on members.
   This article examines trends and patterns of religious mobility in the
   U.S. between 1973 and 1998 using data from the General Social Surveys.
   Retention rates, distributions of original and destination affiliations,
   and mobility tables are compared across three periods, and four broad
   cohorts using log-multiplicative association models. I find some support
   for hypotheses generated by status theories, and for several
   propositions from rational actor theories, however the decline of
   denominationalism perspective is unsupported.</td>

   explanations for the often-documented association between size of place
   and urbanity traits and to raise the possibility that cultural factors,
   too often neglected in urban sociology, play an important role in this
   relationship. Using survey data from a sample ages 15-89, we compare
   four sets of respondents with different child/adult residential
   configurations: those who grew up in nonurban places and as adults live
   in nonurban places (locals), those who grew up in nonurban places but as
   adults reside in urban places (cosmopolitans), those who grew up in
   urban places and reside in urban places as adults (urbanites), and those
   reared in urban places but residing as adults in nonurban places
   (escapees). The sets are compared with respect to six different measures
   of urbanity-anonymity, tolerance, alienation, community social bonds,
   deviant behavior, and involvement in unconventional subcultures. Our
   results support the contention that size has an independent effect on
   urbanity, but Various structural theories generally fail to explain many
   aspects of the relationship. Instead, the views of Hummon (1990) about a
   shared culture of place are most consistent with our findings. We
   conclude by noting the kinds of contributions such a culturalist
   perspective can make to understanding the link between size of place and
   individual characteristics. (C) 2001 Academic Press.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The idea that civil society is declining has been much discussed
   recently, for example, by Fukuyama (Trust: The Social Virtues and the
   Creation of Prosperity. New York: Free Press, 1995) and Putnam (The
   American Prospect 13 (Spring):35-42, 1993; Nobel Symposium, Uppsala,
   Sweden, August 27-30, 1994; PS: Political Science and Politics,
   December: 664-683). At the same time, another stream of research
   suggests that racial tolerance is increasing through time (Quillian,
   American Journal of Sociology 101 (3):816-860,1996; Firebaugh and Davis,
   American Journal of Sociology 94 (2):-251-272. This paper combines ideas
   from several intellectual traditions to suggest that economic conditions
   may affect civil society, which in turn may influence social tolerance.
   These ideas are explored, using multivariate analysis of pooled General
   Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994. The results suggest that the
   fabric of civil society and economic conditions may contribute somewhat
   to espoused tolerance. Greater economic security, together with the
   attitudes fostered by a vibrant civil society including greater trust
   and less anomia, appear to increase espoused social tolerance. Period
   effects and the effects of other demographic factors remain strongly
   related to expressions of tolerance. While alternative interpretations
   may be offered depending on whether the interaction terms, Year x
   Education or Cohort x Education, are included in the analysis, the high
   correlation between the two suggests that these interpretations cannot
   be seen as oppositional. Finally and most important, the analysis
   reveals many parallels between espoused racial and homosexual tolerance,
   suggesting a more generalizable model of social tolerance.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Fringe religions, often referred to as new religious movements (NRMs),
   or "cults," are a fascinating and theoretically insightful form of
   deviant behavior. For the most part, however, those who have studied
   deviant religions have identified themselves as sociologists of religion
   rather then deviance theorists, and their books and articles dealing
   with deviant religion have primarily been directed toward sociologists
   of religion. As a result, sociologists tend to reach religion as
   deviance in sociology of religion courses but not in deviance or social
   problems courses. The purpose of this paper is to highlight significant
   literature and important theoretical connections relevant to the
   teaching of deviant religions in deviance and social problems courses.
   Deviance conceptions and theory can be easily applied to the study of
   cults, and the result can be academically and intellectually stimulating
   to professor and student alike.</td>

   extensively about the sources of influence on the choice of research
   problems in the agricultural sciences at land-grant universities.
   Employing data from a 1995-1996 nationwide survey of land-grant
   agricultural scientists, I use multiple regression techniques to
   investigate the relative importance of 19 sources of influence on
   agricultural scientists engaged in six research areas:
   productionist-oriented, sustainable agriculture, environmental, basic,
   consumer-oriented, and rural community-oriented. The first objective of
   this paper is to revisit and assess many of Busch and Lacy's findings
   about the influences on land-grant agricultural scientists. I find that
   different types of land-grant research are influenced by distinct
   combinations of factors. The second major objective is to extend Busch
   and Lacy's work by spotlighting the significant influences on
   sustainable agriculture research. My multivariate findings show that
   this research appears to exhibit influences that reflect its dual
   productionist and environmental character.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>White-on-black violence was a fact of life in the Deep South during the
   decades straddling the turn of the century. Yet though the lynching of
   blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a
   relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex
   and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to
   reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate
   causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the
   analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into
   patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole.
   This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure
   of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930.
   Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of
   local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching
   histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel
   mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the
   analysis of discrete incidents.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interest in
   religion's special meaning-making function. At the same time, scholars
   have become increasingly sensitive to the fact that the meanings evoked
   by religious symbols, stories, and practices are not universally shared
   and that they vary by social context. To date, sociologists of religion
   interested in the problem of shared meaning have not employed methods
   that can bring together diverse religious meanings and social settings
   in the same research design. As a result, their work has produced few
   empirical generalizations upon which a long-term research agenda might
   be built. In other subdisciplines, such as cultural sociology,
   researchers have employed new quantitative methods that can empirically
   connect variations in cultural meanings to variations in social context.
   This article calls for importing these methodological advances into the
   sociological study of religious meaning.</td>

   sociology does not figure strongly in this tradition. Several
   influential accounts-such as those by Noel Annan, Philip Abrams, and
   Perry Anderson-exist to explain this fact. I examine these accounts and,
   while largely agreeing with the explanations, question whether we should
   accept the authors' conclusions. In particular, we need to ask whether
   England was so different from other countries in this respect. Moreover,
   even if sociology was weak in England, does this mean that the
   contribution of English social theory was also weak? What alternative
   traditions of social thought might exist? In examining the English case,
   we may get some insight not just into the "peculiarities of the English"
   but also into the way in which the history of sociology has come to be
   written and into some of the assumptions underlying the nature of
   sociology as a discipline.</td>

   of knowledge provides important insights into the role of conflict in an
   intellectual field, his microsociology is more problematic. In
   particular. Collins's micro theory ignores the fundamental importance of
   social interpretations. This leads him to use a vague and unproductive
   notion of emotions. Nevertheless, we can usefully apply Collins's
   findings to sociological theory itself As in philosophy we see the same
   competitive appropriation and elaboration of accumulated intellectual
   capital and the same struggle over the limited resources necessary to
   intellectual production, especially over what Collins calls the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For more than a decade, sociologists of religion have been debating the
   answer to a basic question: What is the relationship between religious
   pluralism and religious vitality? The old wisdom was that the
   relationship was negative, that pluralism undermines vitality. This view
   has been challenged by advocates of a supply-side model of religious
   vitality. They argue that the relationship is positive-that pluralism
   increases vitality-and this empirical claim has become foundational to
   the larger project of applying economic theory to religion. We review
   the relevant evidence and reach a straightforward conclusion: The
   empirical evidence does not support the claim that religious pluralism
   is positively associated with religious participation in any general
   sense. We discuss this conclusion's theoretical implications, and we
   identify potentially productive directions for future research on
   religious pluralism, church-state relations, and religious competition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The distinctive contribution of sociological social psychology cars be
   referred to as sociological miniaturism, a way of interpreting social
   processes and institutions that is microsociological more than it is
   psychological. We argue that social psychology of this variety permits
   the examination of large-scale social issues by means of investigation
   of small-scale social situations. The power of this approach to social
   life is that it permits recognition of the dense texture of everyday
   life, permits sociologists to understand more fully a substantive
   domain, and permits interpretive control. In the chapter we provide
   examples of this approach from two quite distinct theoretical
   orientations: symbolic interactionism and social exchange theory. We
   discuss the ways in which the study of two substantive topics, social
   power and collective identity, using these perspectives can be informed
   by closer collaboration between theorists within sociological social
   psychology. In the end it is our hope that pursuing such integrative
   theoretical and methodological efforts will produce a more complete
   understanding of important social phenomena. We offer sociological
   miniaturism as a promising vehicle for advancing the earlier call for
   greater mutual appreciation of and rapprochement between diverse lines
   of social psychological work in sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>There are at least two preferred outcomes for students taking sociology
   courses dealing with race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. These
   include heightening student awareness of the issues and the dynamics of
   inequality. Bath outcomes initiate active engagement with the structures
   and institutions of society. Aii too often, however, apathy, cynicism,
   and helplessness characterize student responses to such courses. A
   solution to this problem is to structure an interdisciplinary course
   using not only a sociological paradigm, but also paradigms of English
   and art. This yearlong course develops the individual student's ability
   to recognize and generate a deep appreciation of multiple perspectives
   (including their own), and helps them acquire critical assessment
   skills. I recommend here an array of resources for teaching about
   resistance and change while establishing an understanding of the
   existence and causes of inequality in American society. Included in this
   battery of resources are readings, mainstream and alternative video
   media, Internet exchanges, student-produced videos, issue-oriented
   student writing, and class discussions.</td>

   that (2) employers actively contribute to racial antagonism when

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Unlike older sciences such as physics and biology, sociology has never
   had a revolution. Modern sociology is still classical-largely
   psychological, teleological, and individualistic-and evert less
   scientific than classical sociology. But pure sociology is different: It
   predicts and explains the behavior of social life with its location and
   direction in social space-its geometry. Here I illustrate pure sociology
   with formulations about the behavior of ideas, ideas, including a theory
   of scienticity that predicts and explains the degree to which an idea is
   likely to be scientific (testable, general, simple, valid, and
   original). For example: Scienticity is a curvilinear function of social
   distance from the subject. This formulation explains numerous facts
   about the history and practice of science, such as why some sciences
   evolved earlier and faster than others and why so much sociology is so
   unscientific. Because scientific theory is the most scientific science,
   the theory of scienticity also implies a theory of theory and a
   methodology far the development of theory.</td>

   misattribute in a downward direction the level of formal education
   attained by women, even when the female faculty member is a full
   professor. The misattributions are linked to the imputed statuses
   "teacher" for women, and "professor" for men, regardless of the actual
   positions held or the credentials earned by faculty members and graduate
   student instructors. We suggest that a process of marginalization
   explains the empirical findings-a process that is attributed by others,

   incurred. Consequences for students and sociology professors are

   addresses how poverty information is packaged as the intersection of
   class, race, and gender, and how this depiction has changed from
   the;1980s to the early 1990s. I conducted a quantitative content
   analysis of the number of index citations and the location of poverty
   information they reference; the number and composition of poverty
   tables; and the number, type, and race/gender composition of
   illustrations of poverty. Newer textbooks reveal a racialized and
   genderized depiction of poverty which differentiates the topic of
   poverty from inequality topics. Instead of promoting the development of
   a multicultural perspective, the selective location of poverty
   information via ghettoization and topic context appears to counteract
   the impact of the inclusive content of that information. implications of
   and possible strategies for overcoming the conventional topic-chapter
   format of textbooks are discussed.</td>

   the central focus of recent discussions about pedagogical approaches to
   controversial topics. These discussions, while invaluable, fail to fully
   explore two issues.. first, the need for collective as well as
   individual strategies to deal with the problems generated by race
   relations courses; and second, the unique experiences of graduate
   students of color teaching this class at predominantly white
   universities. This paper offers a model for a collective strategy that
   departments can use to more effectively deal with problems associated
   with such courses. This model is provided by a year-long workshop
   organized by our department to analyze and address challenges posed by
   race relations classes. Our workshop was racially and ethnically
   diverse, allowing us a unique opportunity to deliberately explore the
   experiences of teachers of color. Drawing from this diversity, we
   develop a multidimensional analysis of the institutional and pedagogical
   constraints that create problems for race relations instructors, and we
   sketch a multidimensional approach to minimizing these problems.</td>

   most of these courses appear to emphasize reading and talking about
   teaching, rather than actually preparing to teach, in this seminar, by
   drawing on critical, feminist and humanist scholarship, the participants
   put ideas about pedagogy into practice. Each participant developed an
   undergraduate course from scratch, including a syllabus, assignments,
   lesson plans, assessments and a statement of teaching philosophy.
   Moreover, the seminar itself modeled many of the teaching techniques the
   participants might use in their own courses, including extensive peer
   review. Finally, by practicing the work habits of constancy and
   moderation from Advice for New Faculty Members: Nihil Nimus (Boice
   2000), the participants began to get more done in less time with less
   strain. The positive outcomes of this seminar suggest that this approach
   may be informative to faculty members designing or revising similar
   courses.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Friendships with competitors can improve the performance of
   organizations through the mechanisms of enhanced collaboration,
   mitigated competition, and better information exchange. Moreover, these
   benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a
   cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among
   competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information
   culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by
   customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The
   first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the
   friendship-network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with
   performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a
   given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to
   dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved
   if a manager's competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the
   benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis
   examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows
   that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors.</td>

   food-processing transnational corporation (TNC) Archer Daniels Midland
   (ADM) and Asian-based firms. In an "economy and society" conceptual
   framework grounded in the sociology of agriculture and food, we
   investigate the powers and limits of TNCs in the global era. We argue
   that TNCs maintain significant powers which allow them to avoid the laws
   and regulations of nation-states. ADM was able to organize an illegal
   global cartel to control the world production and price of the feed
   supplement lysine. In addition, TNCs' actions in the global arena are
   limited by their inability to trust business partners and to organize
   and maintain systems of social control; these roles historically have
   been played by the nation-state. We conclude that despite their
   significant powers, TNCs' contradictory position in the global arena
   provides opportunities that can be used to democratize society.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research in urban sociology posits that the proliferation of
   female-headed families in American cities is a result of declining
   economic prospects due to profound changes in the structure of the urban
   economy. Meanwhile, macro-level theory and research in criminology
   suggest that an association exists between family structure and rates of
   lethal violence among juveniles. Given these two streams of sociological
   thought, there is good reason to expect that increases in juvenile
   homicide rates since 1970 may be due, in part, to changes in the
   structure of the economy and the family during the 1970 to 1990 period.
   However, the nexus between deindustrialization, female-headed families,
   and juvenile homicide has received little attention in extant research.
   The objective of the current study is to remedy this gap in the
   literature by bringing together ideas about deindustrialization and
   female headship in an attempt to explain city-lever changes in Black and
   White juvenile homicide rates between 1970 and 1990. In particular, the
   research investigates the hypothesis that a decline in the manufacturing
   base of cities increased rates of female headship and thereby indirectly
   raised homicide rates. Race differences in the hypothesized structural
   relationships also are examined.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Drawing on a social capital theoretical framework, I examine race,
   ethnic, and gender wage inequalities. Specifically, I extend past
   research by analyzing differences in the mobilization of different types
   of job contacts, what these types of contacts and their level of
   influence "buy" job seekers in the labor market, and the extent to which
   differences in social resources explain between-group variations in
   wages. Four aspects of job contacts are implicated: the race and gender
   of the job contact, the strength of the relationship between the job
   seeker and the job contact, and the job contact's influence. Employing
   the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, I find that white men are more
   likely to mobilize weak, white, male, and influential contacts, those
   contacts hypothesized to positively impact employment outcomes.
   Moreover, their greater mobilization of male and influential ties helps
   to explain a substantial part of their wage advantage over white women
   and Latinos. However, in many ways, their overall social resource
   advantage seems somewhat overstated. They reap no advantages over
   blacks, Latinos, and white women in their use of weak and white ties.
   Furthermore, results indicate that the benefits of social resources
   appear largely contingent on the social structural location of job
   seekers mobilizing them, less on any benefits inherent in different
   "types" of job contacts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article outlines an emotional achievement perspective for the study
   of emotions in social movements. Following Denzin's work on emotions, I
   consider emotions as self-feelings that are situated, interactional, and
   temporal in nature. The concept of emotions as achievement complements
   Hochschild's emotion management perspective. While management focuses on
   control, achievement emphasizes articulation and creativity. I argue
   that, although individuals may be compelled to suppress feelings in the
   organizational context, different social contexts and practices make it
   possible for individuals to pursue emotional fulfillment and
   self-realization. In social movements, the process of emotional
   achievement among participants unfolds as a process of mobilization. An
   analysis of the emotional dynamics of the 1989 Chinese student movement
   shows that emotions were inextricably intertwined with identities and
   action and that the emotional dynamics generated in this process
   significantly contributed to movement mobilization. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the theoretical contributions of the
   emotional achievement perspective.</td>

   actual circumstances of African American and white women in the
   nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States reveals the relationship
   between gender and economic and political development has been a dynamic
   historical one, culminating recently in a radical transformation of
   women's lives and work. I develop the implications of this argument for
   older analytic divisions between work and home, or productive and
   reproductive labor, and for recent shifts in theory. Coherent grasp of
   the events currently altering women's lives provides a clear way to join
   gender with earlier theoretical concerns, as another moment of social
   transformation brought about by a still-infolding process of economic
   and political development.</td>

   Gesellschaft (The Society of Society). According to Luhmann,
   sociologists have failed to produce even a partially adequate theory of
   society. Epistemological obstacles and humanist concerns for rationality
   and justice have prevented true progress in the discipline. With his
   "radically antihumanist, radically antiregional, and radically
   constructivistic " social system theory Luhmann intends to bring about a
   sociological enlightenment. Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft focuses on
   communication as the only genuinely social phenomenon. Social systems
   differentiate and evolve as they communicate in three separate
   dimensions: the social, temporal, and functional. The path of evolution
   results from a history of variation, selection, and restabilization
   within these discussions. Communication, bit by bit, produces social
   structures that, recursively, produce future structures. Society is
   communication. Sociology, as the science of society: is communication
   about how different societal systems operate, communicate, evolve, and
   maintain their boundaries.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although violence against women is an important topic for many sociology
   classes, teaching about it can be problematic. Students may see violence
   against women as an individual rather than social problem, may
   trivialize or blame victims, or may react defensively. In this paper, I
   present an approach to teaching about violence that addresses some of
   these difficulties. Students keep a one-day journal of their experiences
   of fear and use of safety strategies, and then analyze their findings
   both individually and in discussion with their classmates. This analysis
   helps students to see violence not simply as an individual experience,
   but as a form of social control that differently affects social groups.
   In this paper, I describe this exercise, illustrate its effectiveness
   using excerpts from students journals, and discuss the advantages and
   disadvantages of this pedagogical approach.</td>

   We offered an integrated service-learning option in a variety of

   characteristics to explore differences between participants and
   nonparticipants. We surveyed undergraduates (N = 413) from across the
   academic spectrum and enrolled in sociology courses at a large state
   university. The results contradict previous findings: we found
   heterogeneous participation in the service-learning project; no
   statistical association between prior and current service; commuter
   status and employment appear to influence student decisions to opt; and
   non-social science majors are more likely to participate than social
   science majors. Confirming previous studies, males are less likely to
   participate than females. Research in sociology shows strong support for
   service learning in passing on sociology. Results suggest students'

   who rate their instructor high in likability reward that instructor with
   high ratings in overall reaching ability. However, high likability
   ratings are also associated with a decrease in student perceptions of
   learning. The negative effect of likability on perceived learning
   juxtaposed with its positive impact on global teacher ratings gives some
   credence to sociological critiques of student consumerism in higher
   education. Namely, when students approach college as customers, they
   expect to be entertained and served only in ways they find pleasing.
   Suggestions for more appropriate use of student evaluations of teaching
   (SETS) and their impact on how sociologists define teaching
   effectiveness are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Demographic transition theory posits that modernization, particularly in
   the form of urban industrialism, fundamentally alters the environmental
   context surrounding fertility decision-making, thereby reducing the
   advantages of having children. While fertility research has either
   questioned the link between modernization and fertility or attempted to
   provide the intervening links between the two, there has been, little
   theoretical or empirical refinement of the macrosocial/contextual
   principles of the theory. We argue that human ecology and evolutionary
   theory can help respecify and revitalize demographic transition theory.
   Our respecification produces a more logical account of fertility decline
   that emphasizes the influences of service economies and the social
   adaptations attendant on ethnic heterogeneity and preindustrial social
   complexity. Analyses of changes in total fertility rates in
   approximately 60 less-developed countries suggest: (I) general (if
   partially ambiguous) support for demographic transition theory, (2)
   confirmation of a robust effect of service-sector dominance on
   fertility, and (3) the importance of ethnic homogeneity and
   preindustrial social complexity to demographic transition.</td>

   challenges posed by postmodern and postcolonial critics, and outline how
   feminists have contributed to these debates and have responded with
   innovative methodological strategies, especially in relation to
   self-reflexive techniques. In conclusion, we discuss how rural

   narrative approach represents an epistemological shift and should force
   us to interrogate the crucial role played by narrative in the
   construction of reality. Affirmative action provides a perfect example,
   as sociologists actively define and construct what constitutes
   affirmative action through narrative. I argue that taking narratives
   seriously is key to confronting anti-affirmative action narratives and

   (1991) threefold commitment framework to deviance and social control.
   The central individual-level theories of deviance (differential
   association/social learning, opportunity, social control, and labeling)
   share the generic sociological goal of theorizing continuity in lines of
   action. This suggests the centrality of the concept of commitment, and
   in fact the concept is used throughout the study of deviance and social
   control. The threefold framework provides a superior conceptualization
   of commitment for the field of deviance. In addition, it integrates
   insights from the central deviance theories and directs attention to a
   wide variety of un- and underexplored directions for further research in
   deviance and social control. In addition, I briefly discuss broader
   implications of the commitment framework for other areas of inquiry,
   such as the study of social protest and the sociology of organizations.</td>

   whether this research tradition has powerful tools for assessing
   causality. Yet, recent contributions make it clear that scholars are not
   in consensus with regard to the more basic: issue of which procedures
   and underlying logic are in fact used in small-N causal assessment.
   Focusing on the field of comparative-historical analysis, this article
   attempts to clarify these procedures and logic. Methods associated with
   three major strategies of small-N causal inference are examined: nominal
   comparison, ordinal comparison, and within-case analysis. The article
   argues that the use of these three strategies within particular small-N
   studies has led scholars to reach radically divergent conclusions about
   the logic of causal analysis in small-N research. One implication of
   this argument is that methodologists must sort our the interrelationship
   between strategies of causal inference before arriving at conclusions
   about the overall strengths and limitations of small-N analysis.</td>

   studying women and gender use in articles published in mainstream
   journals. The research is based on an analysis of 1,826 gender-content
   articles published between 1984 and 1993 in 15 major sociology journals.
   Specifically, we explore whether feminist-oriented articles use
   different types of data, data collection methods, and statistical
   techniques than other articles addressing women and gender. The
   relationship between the rank of an academic journal, author's sex, and
   type of research method is also examined. We find that a large majority
   of gender-content articles are based on secondary, quantitative data.
   When the first author is a man, articles are somewhat more likely to be
   based on secondary data and to use quantitative statistical techniques.
   In general, we find that feminist research in the discipline is based on
   a melange of methodological approaches, reflecting the contested nature
   of feminist epistemologies.</td>

   eliminate affirmative action using stare referendums, often engaging in
   misleading public campaigns. in this political atmosphere, the role of
   education is significant. For many of our students, introductory
   sociology may be one of the few courses in which they are exposed to
   serious academic discussions about affirmative action. We examine the
   extent to which sociology texts accurately present affirmative action
   policy in the United States using a sample of introductory texts

   presented either confronts or contributes to widespread myths about
   affirmative action policy. We conclude by offering practical suggestions
   to strengthen affirmative action presentations in sociology texts,
   including drawing upon significant empirical and theoretical
   sociological literature about affirmative action too often ignored by
   textbook authors.</td>

   for non-field trip activities, in large introductory lecture courses,
   additional steps to structure the reflection process can successfully

   the undergraduate learning experience. The animated television series,
   The Simpsons, can be particularly effective for illustrating
   sociological themes and encouraging critical thinking among today's
   undergraduates. Borrowing from Mills (1959), The Simpsons complements
   teaching philosophies that stress applying the sociological imagination
   to the observation of everyday life. We have found that the show is an
   effective pedagogical tool for demonstrating sociological concepts and
   fostering students' understanding of the course material Students can
   relate to the show and by engaging them in critical discussions, The
   Simpsons is a valuable pedagogical resource to the sociology curriculum.
   The true indication of successful teaching is measured by the students'
   ability to grasp course material effectively, and then use that
   knowledge beyond the classroom. The Simpsons provides an excellent way
   To accomplish this goal.</td>

   match," and the "social enrichment" mechanisms. Using unique company
   data on the dollar costs of screening, hiring, and training, this
   article finds that the firm's investment in the social capital of its
   employees yields significant economic returns.</td>

   taste as a means to maintain social distance among different social
   classes, conflict with tastemaking practice in pluralistic societies
   where taste standards are no longer exclusively defined by a society's
   elite strata. To better account for the heterogeneity of tastemaking in
   modem societies, this article suggests a framework for analysis in which
   taste is considered as a collective interpretive activity that unfolds
   in distinct institutional contexts and is shaped by culturally available
   rhetorics of aesthetic judgment. Two conflicting but complementary
   rhetorics are identified: the rhetoric of refinement and the rhetoric of
   authenticity. Drawing on historical studies of taste, the role of
   institutional context for tastemaking is demonstrated. Taste in
   pluralistic society emerges in socially, politically and rhetorically
   contested institutional spaces where it is negotiated among a plurality
   of actors who have recourse to alternative rhetorics and
   classifications.</td>

   show that Cooley and Lynd, particularly, mane contributions to a theory
   of shame and the social bond Lewis's idea that shame arises from threats

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Race has always been a significant sociological theme, from the founding
   of the held and the formulation of classical theoretical statements to
   the present. Since the nineteenth century, sociological perspectives on
   race have developed and changed, always reflecting shifts in large-scale
   political processes. In the classical period, colonialism and
   biologistic racism held sway. As the twentieth century dawned, sociology
   came to be dominated by US-based figures. DuBois and the Chicago School
   presented the first notable challenges to the field's racist
   assumptions. In the aftermath of World War II, with the destruction of
   European colonialism, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the
   surge in migration on a world scale, the sociology of race became a
   central topic. The field moved toward a more critical, more egalitarian
   awareness of race, focused particularly on the overcoming of prejudice
   and discrimination. Although the recognition of these problems increased
   and political reforms made some headway in combatting them, racial
   injustice and inequality were not surmounted. As the global and domestic
   politics of race entered a new period of crisis and uncertainty, so too
   has the field of sociology. To tackle the themes of race and racism once
   again in the new millennium, sociology must develop more effective
   racial theory. Racial formation approaches can offer a starting point
   here. The key tasks will be the formulation of a more adequate
   comparative historical sociology of race, the development of a deeper
   understanding of the micro-macro linkages that shape racial issues, and
   the recognition of the pervasiveness of racial politics in contemporary
   society. This is a challenging but also exciting agenda. The held must
   not shrink from addressing it.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The variant of new institutionalism that is our focus is a
   pan-disciplinary theory that asserts that actors pursue their interests
   by making choices within institutional constraints. We organize our
   review of the theory around its behavioral assumptions, the operation of
   institutional forms, and processes of institutional change. At each
   stage, we give particular attention to the potential contributions of
   sociology to the theory. The behavioral assumptions of the theory amount
   to bounded rationality and imply transaction costs, which, in the
   absence of institutions, may frustrate collective ends. The principle
   weakness of these behavioral assumptions is a failure to treat
   preferences as endogenous. We categorize the institutions that arise in
   response to transaction costs as to whether they are public or private
   in their source and centralized or decentralized in their making. In
   detailing the resulting categories of institutional forms, we identify
   key interdependencies across the public/private and
   centralized/decentralized dimensions. The new institutionalism is in
   particular need of better theory about private decentralized
   institutions, and theorists could turn to embeddedness theory and
   cognitive new-institutional theory as a source of help on this topic.
   The dominant view of institutional change is that it is evolutionary,
   driven by organizational competition, and framed by individual beliefs
   and shared understandings. Sociology can refine the change theory by
   adding better explanations of the behavior of organizations, and of the
   processes by which institutional alternatives come to be viewed as
   acceptable or unacceptable.</td>

   ecosystems, higher education in general, and sociology in particular,
   must adopt postmodern strategies to educate for survival. The
   metanarratives that served the modern age, such as "science" and
   "progress," prove inadequate for the postmodern age of ecological
   crisis. We urgently need a more life-centered vision. The ecological
   perspective replants our feet on the bedrock of biological and
   sociological connectedness. Although science has been central to
   modernity's destructiveness, ecology is a subversive science which can
   serve us well as both science and story; it is the central
   transformative image of a new postmodern metanarrative.</td>

   that has not been studied in these textbooks is the topic of disability,
   in this research, 25 introductory sociology textbooks, published between
   1996 and 1998, are investigated to determine the portrayal of
   disability. Using content analysis, the authors examine these books for
   textual representation of disability and pictorial depiction of
   individuals with disabilities. Results indicate that introductory
   sociology textbooks provide a limited amount of information about
   disability. From the written material, two major themes are identified:
   disability as a defining social characteristic and disability as a basis
   for minority group membership. in addition, textbook photographs present
   a selective depiction of individuals with disabilities. Suggestions for
   providing a more comprehensive portrayal of individuals with
   disabilities are discussed.</td>

   four things in developmental stages: recognize basic concepts to
   cultivate sociological perspective, apply sociological concepts,
   interpretive frameworks, and analytical tools to real world problems
   (fostering greater commitment to life-long learning about one's
   community and the world at large), offer explanations extending one's
   own thinking, sensibly gather data to test those explanations (providing
   the tools for a culture of inquiry and evidence), and envision how
   sociology can be used for organizational effectiveness and improvement
   of community outcomes (empowering our students for lives of constructive
   involvement). A variety of assessment strategies are proving vital.
   Broad stakeholder input was used when clarifying program objectives.
   Deliberations about how to change our program are being stimulated by
   performance problems in internships and on major papers. We have learned
   that developmental goals are not readily achieved without changes
   throughout the program's curriculum, and implementation has been
   incremental, initial changes have increased the confidence of graduating
   seniors, and job placement has improved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I extend the theoretical domain of sociology into an area of social
   psychology that heretofore has been the exclusive domain of
   psychologists. Specifically, I develop a social structural perspective
   on the choice shifts make within groups. During interpersonal
   discussions of issues, choice shifts occur when there is a difference
   between group members' mean final opinion and their mean initial
   opinion. Explanations of choice shifts have emphasized group-level
   conditions (e.g., a norm, a decision rule, a pool of persuasive
   arguments, a distribution of initial opinions). I argue that choice
   shifts are a ubiquitous product of the inequalities of interpersonal
   influence that emerge during discussions of issues. Hence, I bring
   choice shifts squarely into the domain of a structural social psychology
   that attends to the composition of networks of interpersonal influence
   and into broader sociological perspectives concerned with the formation
   of status structures.</td>

   sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and
   economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and
   communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the
   constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key
   weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the
   inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three
   significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out
   alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social
   signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the

   extend our understanding of how religious institutions contribute to
   expanding democracy, but nearly all analyze religious institutions as
   institutions; few focus directly on what religion qua religion might
   contribute. This article strives to illuminate the impact of religious
   culture per se, extending recent work on religion and democratic life by
   a small group of social movement scholars trained also in the sociology
   of religion. In examining religion's democratic impact, an explicitly
   cultural analysis inspired by the new approach to political culture
   developed by historical sociologists and cultural analysts of democracy
   is used to show the power of this approach and to provide a fuller
   theoretical account of how cultural dynamics shape political outcomes.
   The article examines religious institutions as generators of religious
   culture, presents a theoretical model of how religious cultural elements
   are incorporated into social movements and so shape their internal
   political cultures, and discusses how this in turn shapes their impact
   in the public realm. This model is then applied to a key site of
   democratic struggle: four efforts to promote social justice among
   low-income urban residents of the United States, including the most
   widespread such effort-faith-based community organizing.</td>

   and cognitive factors, but neglect technologies of memory other than the
   brain and the ways in which cognitive and even neurological patterns are

   the social and cultural patternings of public and personal memory, but
   neglect the ways in which those processes are constituted in part by

   acceptance of the concept of cultural pluralism (and its contemporary
   variant, multiculturalism) in popular and academic discourses today
   should be investigated as a problem in the sociology of knowledge. In
   this context, this article discusses briefly how cultural pluralism is
   used in popular and academic discourses today. Then, it identifies the
   normative structure of and the domain assumptions underpinning, the
   concept The article constructs an argument that the concept lacks
   conceptual precision and analytical rigor; that its ontological claims
   for race and ethnicity cannot be justified; and that it is
   epistemologically incoherent, as shown by its internal contradictions.
   The article concludes that the ideological implications of the concept
   should be investigated and that discourses on cultural pluralism,
   generally, would benefit by resurrecting Milton Gordon's concept of the

   argue that contemporary Hollywood movies are useful tools to illustrate
   some of our discipline's central concepts and to serve as an exercise in
   the application of the sociological imagination. Films, however, come
   prepackaged with a particular worldview or theoretical perspective.
   Thus, they require the sociologist to consider the theory-laden nature
   of movies as part of the analysis of social life that they depict. in
   order to do this, I analyze three groups of movies through the use of
   sociological concepts such as Griswold's "cultural diamond" and
   Jameson's ideology/utiopa distinction.</td>

   assistant training practices. Hence, it is organized around the
   developmental and cognitive issues facing new, and advanced graduate
   assistants. Using evaluative program data and feedback from those who
   have completed this training program, we elaborate upon the usefulness
   of a developmental approach for the preparation and Training of graduate
   assistants ii, sociology.</td>

   understanding so that we may More fruitfully tie this pedagogy to our
   field. A base for such grounding can be found in the work of C. Wright
   Mills, who built on the work of John Dewey, We argue that incorporating
   sociologically informed service learning into the curriculum is
   necessary for completing the progressive educational and social reforms
   sought by both, thus enabling us to fulfill Mills' "promise" for our
   discipline (Mills 1959). On the other hand, a sociologically uninformed
   service-learning experience may hinder, rather than help, the movement
   toward a just society because students may objectify community residents
   and blame them for their problems. Thus, we present potential problems
   associated with service-learning and argue for the concept of addressing
   key sociological insights prior to immersing students into a program of
   service-learning.</td>

   outlined in particular, this paper discusses the ways in which key
   concepts in social psychology can be applied using a cross-cultural
   autobiography, and it examines the utility of using such a text. A
   survey evaluation of this approach reveals that students generally
   accept a multicultural approach to social psychology and feel that it
   aids in their understanding of key concepts. in addition, a comparison

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Religious nationalism represents an institutional project to transform
   the ontology of the social, to redefine the substance of collective
   representation, the principle of domination and the criteria for
   membership. Religious nationalism transforms the territorial
   nation-state into a vehicle in and by which to extend the materiality of
   its culturally specific categories, codes, values and narratives. It
   thereby challenges social theories, like that of Bourdieu, that
   deculturalize power, as well as those, like Alexander, that culturalize
   it in an institutionally restrictive manner. Religious nationalism is
   not a retreat to the premodern, but an effort to bound and energize the
   elemental modem moments, that of the self and the national-state.
   Religious nationalism represents the return to text, to the fixity of
   signs, the renarrativization of the nation in a cosmic context. It
   returns us to bodies and souls, a zone to be defended against things on
   the one side and beasts on the other. It offers a way to secure morality
   against an increasingly post-humanist world. Its discourse of difference
   seeks to bound the nation. Religious nationalism restores the binaries
   of inside and outside, us and them, good and evil, man and woman and
   centers them in sacred space.</td>

   residents of the Czech and Slovak Republics during the postcommunist
   reforms are compared and related to their support for the reforms. The
   analysis is based on five national surveys, 1992-1996, collected by the
   Sociology Institute of the now Czech Academy of Sciences. Net of
   controls, both Czech and Slovak rural respondents report more economic
   strain and unemployment, a difference that persists over the surveys.
   These experiences account for rural residents' greater economic anxiety,
   their fear of economic development and unemployment, which also persists
   over the surveys. These experiences and anxiety explain, in turn, their
   lower level of support for the reforms, and endorsement of a return to
   socialism and strong-hand government. Rural and urban respondents of the
   two countries have experienced the world differently since 1990, and
   this is expressed in their economic anxiety and political preferences.</td>

   core is a structure in which there are a high density of positive
   network ties within the discipline, relatively weak subdivisions within
   the discipline, and a lower density of ties linking us to outside
   institutions. I use structural and social psychological theory to talk
   about the interactional dynamics that weaken this optimal disciplinary

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent work in the sociology of professions highlights the central
   importance of abstract discourse in professionalization processes.
   Drawing on the work of Kenneth Burke, I argue that broadening the focus
   of analysis from "abstract discourse" to "narratives of expertise" will
   provide the ability to (1) more clearly analyze the social conditions
   that are conducive to the efficacy of abstraction as a basis for a claim
   of expertise and (2) theorize and empirically examine the formation and
   maintenance of a collective professional identity. To assist in the
   reformulation of professionalization studies around narratives of
   expertise, I develop a modified extension of Burke's five key terms of
   dramatism (act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose). Burke's pentadic
   scheme enables researchers to show how narratives of expertise ground
   jurisdictional claims and the constitution of professional identity in
   one of the elements of pentad. I illustrate the empirical power of the
   pentadic scheme through an examination of claims of psychotherapeutic
   expertise, particularly claims of marital and familial expertise.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As rational choice theory has moved from economics into political
   science and sociology, it has been dramatically transformed. The
   intellectual diffusion of agency theory illustrates this process. Agency
   theory is a general model of social relations involving the delegation
   of authority, and generally resulting in problems of control, which has
   been applied to a broad range of substantive contexts. This paper
   analyzes applications of agency theory to state policy implementation in
   economics, political science, and sociology. After documenting
   variations in the theory across disciplinary contexts, the strengths and
   weaknesses of these different varieties of agency theory are assessed.
   Sociological versions of agency theory incorporating both broader
   microfoundations and richer models of social structure, are in many
   respects the most promising. This type of agency theory illustrates the
   potential of art emerging sociological version of rational choice
   theory.</td>

   do not account for changes in imprisonment rates, yet both threat
   conditions explain subsequent shifts in total spending on jails and
   prisons. Increases in the political strength of the the Republican
   Party, past breakdowns in the family, and growth in the tax base lead to
   greater spending on correct-ions as well, but neither unemployment nor

   the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on
   risk, safety and risk as dynamic properties of social systems, and the
   social forces that create and allocate risk. In particular, sociologists
   need to place more emphasis on exploring the roles played by
   organizations and the state in hazard production and on formulating a

   relationship of oral/life history to other materials, purpose of the re
   search, and relationship of oral/life history to other phenomena. We
   conclude that life history methods have not had the transformative
   effect on sociology that they have had in other disciplines. By and
   large, the actual production of life histories continues to be
   ahistorical, to be characterized by abstract empiricism, to extinguish

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The enduring effects of an individual's birth order have been subject to
   a long and lively debate in sociology and other disciplines. Recently,
   in response to Sulloway's (1996) Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family
   Dynamics, and Creative Lives, interest has increased in the possible
   effects of birth order on social attitudes. Using quantitative,
   historical data, Sulloway found that birth order is a better predictor
   of social attitudes than is gender, class, or race. His novel,
   evolutionary theory asserts the universal influence of birth order
   across eras and cultures. We use contemporary data to test Sulloway's
   contention that firstborn adults are more conservative, supportive of
   authority, and "tough-minded" than laterborns. Examining 24 measures of
   social attitudes from the General Social Survey (GSS), we find no
   support for these claims, either in terms of significant effects or even
   the direction of nonsignificant coefficients. An expanded inquiry using
   all (202) relevant attitudinal items on the GSS yields similar results.
   In our analysis, variables discounted by Sulloway-gender, race, social
   class, and family size-are all linked to social attitudes more strongly
   than is birth order: Our findings suggest that birth-order theories may
   be better conceptualized in terms of modest effects in limited domains
   and in specific societies.</td>

   should consider adopting more complex computer multimedia in light of
   balancing interests: (1) resource scarcity in education and (2) few

   test outcomes in this and other research. However, our participants
   consistently cite considerable enhancement of students' cognitive skills

   subculture into the introductory course. Students first conduct a

   they expand this analysis during the rest of the course by applying new

   systems is a potentially fruitful one in both political science and
   sociology. Existing attempts to measure constraint, however, have had
   severe drawbacks, both conceptual and methodological. This paper argues
   that this constraint is better conceived of as the absence of dispersion
   in a table of cross-classified beliefs and demonstrates that measures
   based on this conception are better at discerning the presence of
   constraint where it is quite likely to exist, namely, in small,
   ideologically focused groups. The approach to constraint outlined here
   has a number of other advantages: it is equally appropriate to interval,
   ordinal, or nominal data; it does not require external criteria of what
   responses should be associated with others; it is not
   variance-dependent; it does not assume that constraint is equivalent to
   either reduced dimensionality or pairwise association; and it is equally
   appropriate for mass and nonmass belief systems. It is also simple to
   conduct tests of significance difference across populations. Finally,
   this paper outlines the proper way to standardize such measures, which
   applies to other uses of the entropy measure, such as the quantification
   of income inequality. (C) 1999 Academic Press.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article begins with an autobiographical reflection about what
   sociology has meant to me as an Iranian intellectual. Sociology has
   enabled me to think critically about my country's politics and culture,
   appreciating its strengths without overlooking its unjust and injurious
   aspects. That experience shapes my answer to the question "Saving
   Sociology?" If there is anything in sociology that I would like to
   save-in both senses "to keep" and "to rescue"-it is sociology as a
   critical, reflective discipline, a discipline that not only studies
   society but also contributes to its change. As the contemporary world
   moves toward a "global" society, we are increasingly facing the dilemmas
   of multiculturalism. Sociologists often investigate other societies or
   (like myself) look back at their own from a spatial and cultural
   distance. This situation has created a dilemma for many scholars: Should
   we criticize problems stemming from "indigenous" beliefs and practices
   of other societies? Cultural relativism argues that different cultures
   provide indigenous answers to their social problems that should be
   judged in their own context. While this approach correctly encourages us
   to avoid ethnocentrism, it has led to inaction towards the suffering of
   oppressed groups. Reflecting on the relativist approach to sexual
   dominance, I question some cultural relativist assumptions. Discussing
   how "indigenous" responses to male domination in many cases disguise and
   protect that domination, I will challenge the "localist" approach of
   relativism and argue for a universalist approach.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>What is the value-added character of sociology? In an era of change and
   unease in higher education, can a case be made for sociology in terms of
   intellectual and scholarly substance rather than in terms of
   bureaucratic and political considerations? As a scholarly and
   instructional activity, what is the value of sociology beyond what other
   disciplines have to offer? I address these questions affirmatively in
   this paper by identifying and elaborating four distinctive foci of the
   sociological eye that together frame the window onto the world that
   sociology provides. These distinctive features are a focus on the
   relational connections among the constituent elements of the objects of
   sociological analysis; a focus on the socially contextual embeddedness
   of those objects of analysis; a focus on vexing social conditions and
   processes construed as social problems; and an ironic perspective, that
   is, a penchant for discerning and illuminating the incongruous,
   unexpected, discrepant aspects of social life. I argue that these foci
   are more pronounced in sociology than in other social sciences and that
   together they congeal into a window onto the social world that is unique
   among the social sciences and humanities, thus accounting for the
   value-added character of sociology.</td>

   short account of my own involvement in ARS, I give a brief rendition of
   what sociology as a field has been during the past quarter century-that
   is, what was "out there" to be reflected in the pages of ARS. I lay out
   some statistics on trends in the size, countries, and universities
   represented, coauthorship patterns, and gender ratios in ARS. These
   statistics are very informative but contain few surprises. Next I trace
   and analyze an issue that has commmanded the attention of editors of ARS
   throughout its history-unity or diversity of sociology as a discipline.
   Finally I conclude that the ARS does indeed reflect the field in ways
   that can be documented, but that this process of reflection is subject
   to many imprecisions generated by the editorial process itself.</td>

   interesting ones. This article investigates the aphorism, the purest
   form of an interesting idea that draws the mind onward. It begins by
   examining the linguistic style of aphorisms, their reconceptions of
   experience from deceptive surfaces to more fundamental truths, their
   psychological and social effects on the vanity and status of their
   creators and conveyers, and the decline of their conceptual charisma
   into cliche until a surprising modification restarts the aphorism-cliche
   cycle. The investigation of aphorisms broadens to their intellectual and
   cultural contexts by examining their expansion into articles and
   collection into books, the different aspects of a topic revealed by
   aphoristic perspectives and scientific sequences, and the similarities
   (and differences) between aphoristic and postmodern ways of knowing.
   This article ends with a series of aphorisms on the cognitive substance
   of alluring knowledge, which distinguish some of the components of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article offers a proposal for combining the sport sociological and
   sport psychological imaginations. In order to effect this rapprochement,
   some serious adjustments to the ways in which many applied sport
   psychologists and spore sociologists think about and conduct research
   are required. Thus, the initial part of this article expresses some
   critiques, albeit brief, of current tendencies within both sport
   sociology and sport psychology. We deemed these critiques necessary to
   advance a neo-Millsian position on the articulation of social structure
   and personality. This neo-Millsian position draws on the
   ego-psychoanalytical tradition to offer suggestions for how we might
   reconceive the problems of indispensability/expendability in the
   Prolympic structures of sport and for how we might, using a
   life-histories (biographical) methodology, engage in useful or practical
   research, especially on the problematics of how individuals
   handle/mishandle early, pre-career, and mid-career failure, and, in the
   long-run, inevitable failure at the end of their careers. Where, then,
   is the common ground between sport sociology and sport psychology? We
   argue that it is the analysis of ego-practices and ego-defenses as
   learned, consciously or unconsciously, over our biographical lives as
   they intersect with, and are contoured by, social history and social
   structure.</td>

   and publication of sociology textbooks and the teaching of sociology.
   The research analyzes reviewers' comments regarding a recently published
   text and compares them with peer review patterns observed by other
   authors and editors over the past decade. The results show that peer
   review affects sociology texts in at least five ways: (1) degree of
   innovation, including the book's focus, organization, and content, (2)
   length, (3) reading level, (4) ancillaries and accessories, and (5) the
   marketing strategies that will be used by publishers to "sell" the book.
   The findings suggest that, although the peer review process generally
   provides authors and editors with beneficial ideas for the resulting
   book, it compounds other problems.</td>

   activities? This field study of Vermont and Quebec maple syrup producers
   and their households and enterprises examines the diversity of
   motivations and concerns in contemporary maple syrup production.
   Farmers, former farmers, and non-farmers all produce maple syrup. The
   concept of embeddedness provides a framework for understanding how
   producers understand their involvement with maple syrup, by highlighting
   the social and cultural context of economic action. An embeddedness
   perspective emphasizes how other work activities, household relations,
   the surrounding community, and the resource environment shape the
   possibilities for and understandings of minor resource production
   activities. Maple syrup generally only supplemented the household income
   of the 76 producers interviewed. Producers articulated a cultural
   economy of syrup production centered on its contribution to overall
   livelihood, cultural identity, and lifestyle. Reasons included managing
   risks, making seasonal use of land and labor resources, developing a
   retirement income, demonstrating a rural, agrarian identity, and
   strengthening family and community ties. Implications for policy include
   the place of minor resource production activities in securing rural
   livelihoods and providing cultural anchors in rural regions experiencing
   demographic and economic change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Typically, using data from a nonexperimental study, quantitative
   sociologists model one or more outcomes as a function of independent
   variables, interpreting the resulting parameter estimates as effects.
   This article compares the usual approach to causal inference in
   sociology with an alternative approach that builds explicitly on a
   counterfactual account of causation. The comparison is relevant because
   sociologists typically interpret (incorrectly) parameter estimates
   obtained using the first approach as supporting causal statements that
   are counterfactual. To make matters concrete, the author reconsiders an
   attainment model of Featherman and Hauser, who are interested in
   comparing the effects of family background on achievement, by sex and
   time. This analysis suggests the coefficients in the regressions of
   respondent's education and occupational status on background should not
   be interpreted as effects. However because a child's sex is determined
   without regard for his or her subsequent achievements, sex may be viewed
   as randomly assigned, justifying treating sex as the cause and the
   background variables as covariates. Unfortunately, the way in,which the
   data were collected preclude such a treatment.</td>

   corroboration of Simmel's revision of neo-kantian epistemology for
   sociology with Husserl's phenomenology, and the parallel discussion of
   Simmel and Husserl concerning cognitive levels and exact and
   morphological eide. Simmel's analysis of dyads is explored as an
   exemplar of his eidetic insights. An important consequence of this
   demonstration is the vindication establishing the scientific legitimacy
   of Simmel's methodology regarding the sociology of the forms of
   association. Woven throughout is discussion concerning the doctrine of
   the complementarity of eidetic and empirical science. Simmel's
   methodology is shown to have been ahead of its time through conjoining
   these two modes of scientific investigation.</td>

   with whom they have prior noncommercial relationships? Using data from
   the economic sociology module of the 1996 General Social Survey, we
   document high levels of within-network exchanges. We argue that
   transacting with social contacts is effective because it embeds
   commercial exchanges in a web of obligations and holds the seller's
   network hostage to appropriate role performance in the economic
   transaction. It follows that within-network exchanges will be more
   common in risky transactions that are unlikely to be repeated and in
   which uncertainty is high. The data support this view. Self-reports
   about major purchases are consistent with the expectation that exchange
   frequency reduces the extent of within-network exchanges. Responses to
   questions about preferences for in-group exchanges support the argument
   that uncertainty about product and performance quality leads people to
   prefer sellers with whom they have noncommercial ties. Moreover, people
   prefer to avoid selling to social contacts under the same conditions
   that lead buyers to seek such transactions; and people who transact with
   friends and relatives report greater satisfaction with the results than
   do people who transact with strangers, especially for risk-laden
   exchanges.</td>

   and their ability to make use of "the sociological imagination" (Mills
   1959). Like any instructional method, professors must carefully plan and
   structure internships to ensure that they are effective. Whenever

   by showing how the strengths and weaknesses of methods commonly used to
   compare institutions or regions reappear in comparisons between times.
   The discussion then turns to alternative approaches. The use of
   narrative and of path dependency to construct explanatory sequences are
   strategies that strike a welcome balance between causal generalization
   and historical detail. But these approaches typically fail to identify
   either the causal mechanisms or the trajectories that link events in
   different eras. These gaps can be filled by rethinking sequences of
   events across periods as reiterated problem solving. Successive U.S.
   industrial relations regimes since 1900 are used to illustrate this
   methodological strategy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Influenced by classical sociology, constructionist tradition and Pierre
   Bourdieu's writings, this article examines the capital of Russian
   bankers who are perceived as the prime movers of Russia's transition to
   the market. The bankers were selected as subjects for analysis because
   they represent profit-making enterprises in a country where money and
   capital had pejorative meanings prior to the recent capitalist-style
   reforms. It was not money but social relations that served as a primary
   medium of exchange in the Soviet system. Exploring what constitutes the
   major 'currency' in the new Russia, this article also questions whether
   the bankers' constructions of self and society differ from the
   prevailing code of the Russian/Soviet cultural repertoire that is seen
   as anti-individualistic, anti-materialistic and anticapitalist. Relying
   upon a survey of 484 bankers and 61 interviews with managers from Moscow
   and St Petersburg commercial banks, the article comes to the conclusion
   that these bankers possess substantial holdings in the form of money and
   social resources, and are also culturally well equipped for market
   experiences. However, their economic, social and cultural capital is
   only partially converted into symbolic capital interpreted as the most
   universal form of capital. Inadequacy of symbolic capital may question
   the legitimacy of other economic, social and cultural assets, and have
   negative repercussions for market-building in Russia.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lifetime employment was a cornerstone of the Chinese socialist system
   constructed under Mao. In this system organizations served the function
   of social security and as a result, many organizations were overburdened
   with bloated work forces and retirees that drew from organizational
   coffers well into old age. Labor contracts fundamentally alter this
   system, as they allow firms to end the socialist institution of lifetime
   employment. Yet there is significant variation on the
   institutionalization of labor contracts in organizations. Based on a
   sample of 81 films in industrial Shanghai, I show that organizations
   that are experiencing uncertainty in the economic transition are more
   likely to institutionalize labor contracts on an organizationwide basis.
   There are two types of ol organisational uncertainty in the economic
   transition: economic uncertainty and administrative uncertainty In cases
   of economic uncertainty, firms that lost money in 1990 and firms that
   are burdened by large forces of retired workers are more likely to place
   their workers on labor contracts. In the case of administrative
   uncertainty firms that are at the highest levels of the industrial
   hierarchy are also significantly more likely to place their workers on
   labor contracts. Although these upper level firms were the most
   protected under the command economy: these are being forced to handle
   the greatest among the responsibilities in the economic transition and
   as a result, they experience the greatest sense of being set adrift by
   the state.</td>

   utopian in stressing the greater mastery and control made possible by
   recent innovations in information technology. The utopian theme
   underscores the technical outcomes of innovations and highlights their
   benefits for ameliorating social problems. By contrast, our work
   suggests that many of the social problems in contemporary society are a
   consequence of recent innovations in information technology. We argue
   that postindustrial theorists are correct in stressing mastery over
   certain technical problems but incorrect in slighting the destabilizing
   effect innovations have on organizations and the markets in which these
   organizations participate. These destabilizing effects complicate
   organizational strategies by increasing market risk and uncertainty.
   Since most organizations are risk aversive, social problems are created
   as organizations externalize their costs and pass along risk to other,
   more dependent actors. Illustrations from two institutions, politics and
   the economy, indicate that many postindustrial innovations are
   associated with heightened competition as well as greater risk and
   uncertainty across the institutional order. We conclude that
   postindustrial technology introduces no net gain in managing the
   complexities of the social world. Risk and control are both integral to
   technological innovation and constitute the paradox of
   postindustrialization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study employs interlocking analytical devices from the perspectives
   of several disciplines to explore members' meanings through definitions
   of "high technology" given by workers in design engineering. The
   comparative analysis employs concepts from art history, sociology of
   culture, anthropology and science studies to explore the appeal of "high
   technology" in comparison with the aura of original artworks and the
   status accrued by symbolic tools. Additionally, the role standardization
   has played in the development of engineering as a profession is explored
   in historical context as are the recurring themes of speed and "the
   new." The findings reveal that how engineers use new technologies in the
   world of messy practice and their conceptual framework regarding
   so-called "high technology" do not map well onto one another. The study
   illustrates the perspective of science and technology studies that views
   all technology as socially shaped and society shaping, its construction
   accomplished through messy patched-up practices rather than clean,
   linear paths or perfect techniques.</td>

   come from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of Bulgarian
   SOEs for the period fr-om 1989 (the last year under communism) to 1993
   (three years after major macroeconomic shifts). We investigate how
   changes in authority structure, work organization, technology marketing
   strategy, and organizational boundaries during these years affected
   organizational performance in 1993. We also assess the degree of path
   dependence in performance and the role of competitive industry
   conditions. Numerous organizational changes made by SOEs during early
   transition had little effect on performance. Yet organizational
   performance from 1989 to 1993 was highly path-dependent, although this
   dependence was mediated by the competitive conditions: Stronger markets
   displayed less path dependence. Overall the results favor the
   interpretations derived from selected neo-institutional and ecological
   perspectives of organizational sociology over neoclassical economic
   interpretations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article explores the ways that the feminist organization
   Sociologists for Women in Society(SWS) has become an arena of change in
   the discipline of sociology, academic institutions, and larger society.
   We begin with an examination of feminist models of power and change,
   followed by a brief history of SWS and an exploration of the use of
   power in sociology, academia, and beyond. We find that SWS has
   influenced both the organizational governance structures of sociology
   (such as the American Sociological Association) and the production of
   sociological scholarship. As a result, the presence of women is more
   apparent than ever before, and sociological paradigms are more inclusive
   and attentive to the voices of "outsiders." Academic institutions have
   been challenged and changed by an SWS presence and the monitoring of
   women's experiences in the academy. Beyond the discipline and academia,
   SWS strives to participate in the making of public policy that affects
   women's lives and to be a presence both domestically and internationally
   in issues affecting the status and well-being of women. We conclude with
   the recommendation that sociologists use their experiences and knowledge
   to create change in the institutions where women practice and the world
   in which they live.</td>

   grounds of moral autonomy and heteronomy (rule-from-another as opposed
   to rule-from-oneself) on classical sociological theory, arguing that
   both Weber and Durkheim understood sociology to have a contribution to
   make in the debate,with Kant over the grounds of ethical action. Both
   insisted that the only possible ethical action was one within the bounds
   of rational knowledge that was inherently authoritative, but this sat
   uneasily with their focus on the relation between concrete social
   authority and the authoritativeness of beliefs in the sociology of
   religion. In rejecting Comte's explicit avowal of the embodiment of
   moral authority in the secular priesthood of sociologist, Weber and
   Durkheim had to paper over the social authority supporting the
   formulation of this rational knowledge. Each then produced a sociology
   of knowledge without a well-specified mechanism, in turn encouraging the
   development of the sociology of knowledge as ct flawed sub-discipline.</td>

   socially defined, publicly visible beings of intersubjective experience.
   I argue that the sociology of the person proposed by Durkheim and Mauss
   is more accurately described as a sociology of institutions of the
   person and neglects both folk or ethnopsychologies of personhood and the
   international production of persons. I draw upon the work of Goffman to
   develop a sociology of the person concerned with means, processes, and
   relations of person production. I also propose that the work of Goffman,
   Foucault, and others provides insights into the contemporary technology
   of person production and into how its control and use affects relations
   of person production. I conclude with a brief outline of the theoretical
   connections among institutions of the person, folk psychologies, the
   social constitution of the person, and the prospect of a distinctively
   sociological psychology.</td>

   associated with using a laptop computer and presentation software during
   lectures. This discussion is informed by our own experience as well as
   end of the semester grades and student course evaluations from six
   sections of introductory social statistics that were taught between the
   fail of 1995 and the spring of 1997. Direct student quotes are used
   throughout the paper to emphasize particular points and to provide
   insight into students' perspectives on the computer presentations. Based
   on this objective and subjective evidence, we conclude that computer
   presentations can act as useful tools in courses like social statistics
   and methods. These presentations encourage classroom interaction,
   heighten interest, and provide a structure to lectures that can
   facilitate student comprehension and performance. This article also
   discusses potential problems that arise when using this technology.</td>

   more precise by borrowing simple assumptions from Carley's constructural
   model and from the symbolic interactionist perspective. My arguments
   amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption
   of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of
   social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple
   assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social
   construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally
   undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time.
   The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural
   homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or
   the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the
   information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory
   positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social
   differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated
   social systems such as organizations and societies. I consider
   implications of this theory for the origins of sociodemographic
   dimensions, the study of inequality, and the sociology of culture.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to objectively
   measure. This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that
   typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors.
   Systematic errors, or "biases," are the focus of this paper. Campbell
   and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the
   best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors,
   but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding
   for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We
   show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more
   relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can
   examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the
   potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic
   errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
   subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR
   papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the
   reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for
   comparable-worth investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do
   far more to understand the systematic error present in their subjective
   variables.</td>

   approach to the topic of social relations (Cerulo 1997; Cerulo and Ruane
   1997; Cerulo, Ruane, and Chayko 1992). With few exceptions, literature
   on the subject dichotomizes social relations with reference to the scope
   of the interaction (small group versus large group) and the mode by
   which social actors connect (direct connections versus mediated
   connections). Further, many researchers implicitly rank the social value
   of each relational form. Sociologists typically identify a society's
   primary and most valuable relations as the result of direct, physically
   copresent exchange, exchange involving relatively few interactants. In
   contrast, secondary relations often are characterized as faceless,
   impersonal, ingenuous, and fleeting-the result of large-group exchange
   established via mediated or mechanized connections. Cerulo (1997)
   suggested the need to reformulate any definition of social relations
   built upon the small group/large group or the direct/mediated
   dichotomies. She presented several critical elements upon which new
   definitions could be built. In this piece, we configure those elements,
   building six new analytic taxonomies-tools we hope will provoke a richer
   discussion of connecting, interacting, and resulting forms of social
   relations.</td>

   an alternative approach for formulating models-one based on
   simultaneously modeling univariate marginal logits and marginal
   associations-can lead to models that are more directly relevant for
   addressing the kinds of questions arising in those cases. In this
   article, the authors explore some of the similarities and differences

   a marginal modeling approach. It has been noted in past literature that
   the model of statistical independence is conveniently represented within
   both approaches to specifying models for cross-classifications of

   of models overlap, as well as some important differences. The authors do
   not present a complete characterization of the conditions describing the
   intersection of the two families of models but cover many of the models
   for bivariate contingency tables and for three-way contingency tables

   among survivors of stroke. The episodes of crying analyzed here took
   place during interviews including the patients, the patients' spouses,
   and an interviewer. This investigation innovates on past studies within
   the sociology of emotions by concentrating on the interpersonal
   dimension of emotional displays of persons with brain damage. This study
   also contributes to research on stroke patients' "pathological crying"
   from the field of neuropsychology because it concentrates on the social,
   and not only the neurological or otherwise individual-level, nature of
   such crying. We first present overviews of both the sociology of
   emotions and the neuropsychology of poststroke emotionalism and address
   how our study contributes to both fields. We then discuss our
   participants and method of analysis and finally present our findings
   with respect to the techniques of the management of crying exhibited by
   the stroke patients' interlocutors as well as by the patients
   themselves.</td>

   An overview of "Teaching Sociology" indicates that probably only a small

   argued that college professors are free to teach radical theory, but
   that radical pedagogy is hindered by institutional constraints. The

   by, market competition. The tradition is to test such arguments with
   market concentration data; firms with stronger control over their market
   can afford the long-run investment of R&amp;D. Network theory has broadened
   our understanding of how competition is a function of structure within
   and beyond a market. Producers earn high profit margins to the extent
   they are few and their customers and suppliers are many and
   disorganized. The first condition is measured by the traditional
   concentration ratio for a market. The second condition is measured by
   the network constraint of suppliers and customers. My purpose in this
   paper is to describe how our understanding of the market competition
   effect on innovation is enriched when the concentration measure of
   marker competition tradition in economics is replaced with the network
   model of market competition now prevalent in sociology. Results indicate
   that markets facing competitive environments, in high constraint market
   positions, show greater R&amp;D intensity and faster rates of innovation
   than do industries facing less competitive pressure. These effects
   persist even with controls for technological opportunity and
   appropriability, in contrast to traditional models using only
   concentration data to measure competition. (C) 1998 Academic Press.</td>

   general, we now know that low income groups and communities of color are
   disproportionately exposed to toxic wastes. In this paper I argue that
   future research requires a shift in methodological approach. Learning
   how groups come to be exposed to toxic wastes requires an understanding
   of the organizational processes that shape decisions regarding
   production practices and regulatory enforcement strategies. I conclude
   by making three claims: (I) Documenting that disempowered groups are
   exposed to toxic wastes more than other groups is important.
   Disentangling whether race or class matters more is more dubious. (2) If
   we want to make claims about process, we should study process and not
   outcomes. (3) Insofar as we have to study outcomes, we should be more
   aware of which outcomes we want to study and what types of inferences we
   are able to draw from outcomes.</td>

   framework for understanding age as accomplished, i.e., as something that
   is both a process and the outcome of ongoing interactional work. The
   common expression "act your age" provides the useful metaphor of
   performance. We perform our own age constantly, but we also give meaning
   to other ages and to age more generally in our actions and interactions,
   our beliefs and words and feelings, our social policies. This essay
   offers two routes to the conclusion that age is accomplished. The first
   involves drawing parallels between the study of age and the study of
   gender The second route uses Existing scholarship, which recognizes that
   age is far more social than chronological. I draw on work in the social
   constructionist, symbolic interactionist, and life course traditions to
   develop the framework of age-as-accomplished and to show its potential
   to organize much of what we already have leaned about age and aging.</td>

   in nonmetro labor markets, the emergence of producer services as st
   catalyst of socioeconomic growth, and federal spending. Using a model
   that is informed by a variety of perspectives in sociology and economic
   geography, and commuter zones (CZs) as spatial units of analysis, we
   estimate the effects of manufacturing concentration, producer service
   concentration, and federal spending on per capita income, per capita
   earnings, and private nonfarm employment growth during the 1983-1988
   business cycle recovery. The OLS and interaction models show that all
   three factors help explain why metro areas outperformed nonmetro areas
   during this time period. The effects of producer service concentration,
   however, best fit with our expectations. Implications of our findings

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article suggests that American sociology has developed a defacto
   tradition in the sociology of the marked that devotes greater
   epistemological attention to "politically salient" and "ontologically
   uncommon" features of social life, Although the "unmarked" comprises the
   vast majority of social life, the "marked" commands a disproportionate
   share of attention from sociologists. Since the marked already draws
   more attention within the general culture, social scientists contribute
   to re-marking and the reproduction of common-sense images of social
   reality This has important analytic consequences. This article argues
   for developing a stronger tradition in a sociology of the unmarked that
   explicitly foregrounds "politically unnoticed" and taken-for-granted
   elements of social reality. Three strategies are proposed toward this
   end: (1) reversing conventional patterns of markedness to foreground
   what typically remains unnamed and implicit, (2) marking everything by
   filling in all the shades of social continue so that each shares the
   same degree of epistemological ornamentation, and (3) developing an
   analytically nomadic perspective that observes social phenomena from

   Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari developed concepts that have important
   and often profound implications for social theory and practice. Two of
   these, sense and segmentarity provide us,with entirely new ways to view
   sociological problems of meaning and structure. Deleuze conceives sense
   independently of both agency and signification, That is, sense is
   neither the manifestation of a communicating subject nor a structure of
   language-it is noncorporeal, impersonal, and prelinguistic, in
   his,words, a "pure effect or event." With Guattari, Deleuze notes that
   it is not a question of how subjects produce social structures, but how
   a "machinics of desire" produces subjects. In Deleuze and Guattari,
   desire is not defined as a want or a lack, but as a machinery of forces,
   flows, and breaks of energy. The functional stratification we witness in
   social life is only the molar effect of a more primary segmentation of
   desire that occurs at the molecular level, at the level of bodies. In
   Deleuze and Guattari, bodies are not just human bodies, but "anorganic"
   composites or mixtures, organic form itself being a mode of the body's
   subjectification. The problem of the subject, and thus of the
   constitution of society, is first a problem of how the sense of bodies
   is produced through the assembly of desiring-machines. The subject, we
   could sag: is the actualization of desire on the incorporeal surface of
   bodies.</td>

   writings of Bourdieu, Loury, and Coleman, among other authors. It
   distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their
   dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature
   emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits
   mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these
   positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also
   deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
   four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples.
   Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an
   individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final
   sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I
   argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability,
   social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However,
   excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.</td>

   sociology in Japan. The sociological discipline in Japan has made
   remarkable progress since World War II. The rapid economic growth during
   the 1960s, which was prompted by Western influence, had an effect on the
   direction of the discipline's development. After providing a brief
   overview of historical events, I consider scholarly publications during
   the last 30 years to illuminate substantive trends in sociological
   research. As might be predicted, the changing substantive interests of
   Japanese sociologists have been in many ways a response to societal
   changes and needs. I also examine the trends in theory, methods, and
   empirical research. A content analysis of articles published in the
   major Japanese sociological journals shows the growing emphasis on
   theoretical scholarship and the decreasing emphasis on empirical
   research in recent years. The conclusion presents some considerations
   concerning the future direction of Japanese sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The protection of habitat for an officially designated "threatened"
   species, the Northern Spotted Owl, is widely seen as having endangered
   the survival of a very different "species," namely the rural American
   logger. In spite of the widespread agreement on this point, however, it
   is not clear just how many jobs have been endangered, over just how long
   a period, due to the protection of spotted-owl habitat and of the
   environment more broadly. In the present paper, we analyze longer term
   employment trends in logging and milling, both nationally and in the two
   states of the Pacific Northwest where the spotted-owl debate has been
   most intense, to determine the length of time over which such
   environmental protection efforts have been creating the loss of logging
   and milling jobs. There are three potential key "turning points" since
   the start of high-quality employment data in 1947-the 1989 controversy
   over the federal "listing" of the Northern Spotted Owl under the
   Endangered Species Act, the earlier increase in environmental
   regulations accompanying the first Earth Day in 1970, and the
   still-earlier "locking up" of timber after the passage of the Wilderness
   Protection Act in 1964. We also examine the effects of two other
   variables that have received considerable attention in the ongoing
   debates-levels of U.S. Forest Service timber harvests and the exporting
   of raw logs. We find that the 1989 listing of the spotted owl has no
   significant effect on employment-not even in the two states where the
   debate has been most intense. Instead, the only statistically
   significant turning point came with the passage of the Wilderness Act in
   1964. The direction of the change, however, was precisely the opposite
   of what is generally expected. Both nationally and in the Pacific
   Northwest, the greatest decline in timber employment occurred from 1947
   until 1964-a time of great economic growth, a general absence of
   "unreasonable environmental regulations," and growing timber harvests.
   The period since the passage of the Wilderness Act has been one of
   increased complaints about environmental constraints, but much less
   decline in U.S. logging employment. If logging jobs have indeed been
   endangered by efforts to protect the environment in general and
   spotted-owl habitat in particular, what is needed is a plausible
   explanation of how the influence of the owls could have begun more than
   forty years before the species came under the protection of the
   Endangered Species Act.</td>

   parenting by examining the theoretical relationship between the mother
   identity and mothers' emotional response of jealousy to father-child
   interactions. Using identity theory, we predict that in response to
   father-child interactions, mothers with a more prominent mother identity
   will report the emotional experience of jealousy, and mothers with a
   more salient mother identity will report coping strategies designed to
   reduce the jealous experience. Since prominence captures the affective
   dimension of an identity, it should be tied to one's emotional response
   in a situation. Further, while salience captures the behavioral
   dimension of an identity, it should be related to the coping strategies
   which follow from and manage one's emotional response in a situation.
   The results confirm these expected relationships. We discuss not only
   how emotion may serve to maintain the mother identity, but also how
   mothers' emotion may unintentionally serve to maintain social structural
   arrangements with respect to parenting.</td>

   individual development and academic achievement for undergraduate
   students are student involvement, student integration, and high effort
   at academic tasks (e.g., Astin 1984; Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini
   1991; Terenzini and Wright 1987). Student involvement and integration
   are often measured by frequency of academic and social interactions with
   faculty members, participation in student organizations, integration
   into the major program, and participation in research projects. These
   experiences can be conceived of as part of the academic and professional
   socialization of students and often occur outside the traditional
   college classroom. In this paper, we discuss the importance of these
   out-of-class experiences and review the literature on outcomes of this
   "other" or "informal" curriculum. In addition, we argue, by sharing some
   data on academic and professional socialization from students, faculty
   members, and departments, that most departments do not adequately
   provide these beneficial opportunities. After a discussion of barriers
   to providing these experiences, we conclude with a call, and some

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Courses on quantitative research methods play a central role in many
   undergraduate programs in sociology. However, students' anxiety over the
   courses is a major concern for instructors. Many students perceive the
   subject as inherently uninteresting and difficult. This paper describes
   an experiment designed to introduce aspects of quantitative reasoning
   into a large substantively focused class in the social sciences. The
   experiment assessed whether students can learn quantitative reasoning
   skills in the context of a large "nonmethods" class in sociology. The
   experiment measured students' mastery of these skills by comparing their
   competence at quantitative reasoning at the beginning and end of the
   class term. The results revealed that students' abilities to interpret
   and manipulate empirical data increased significantly. Further, the
   increase occurred independent of students' basic reasoning skills as
   measured by baseline SAT verbal and math scores. This paper discusses
   the implications of these findings for teaching quantitative methods in
   sociology undergraduate curricula.</td>

   statistics class required of all sociology, psychology and business

   exercises were expected to improve student performance and student

   quasi-experimental design was used to compare student performance for a

   with a similar group of students after the introduction of the computer

   important part of the sociology major and that the acquisition of
   computer skills should be regarded as a curriculum goal in and of itself

   understanding political divisions in democratic polities lies with
   membership in social groups. Much recent scholarship, however, has
   argued that political cleavages arising out of social group memberships
   have declined. This study investigates these claims, analyzing the
   magnitude of and interrelationship among four major social
   cleavages-race, religion, class, and gender-in U.S. presidential
   elections since 1960. We improve over dichotomous measures of religion
   and class and introduce statistical models that permit measurement of
   relative shifts in the vote choice of the core groups making up each
   cleavage. Our results do not support claims about the declining
   magnitude of social cleavages. The race cleavage has increased
   considerably since 1960, and the gender cleavage more modestly during
   this period, while the class cleavage has remained stable, and the
   religion cleavage has declined slightly. We find evidence of a slight
   increase in social group cleavages in presidential elections from 1960
   through 1992. Net of change in the race cleavage, the overall social
   cleavage has been stable during this period.</td>

   1990 are used to demonstrate an historical shift in the definition of
   "nature" from resource to life-sustaining global ecosystem. This newer
   scientific model increased nature's relevance to world society, and thus
   catalyzed an exponential rise in international discourse and activity
   concerning the environment. The effect is evident in event-history
   analyses of the rate at which international environmental treaties were
   formed during the period 1870-1990. Two organizational changes also
   played a role in the proliferation of international environmental
   treaties: the overall structuration of the world polity had a positive
   effect, and the consolidation of an official intergovernmental
   environmental domain had a negative effect, even with the effects of
   population growth and industrial degradation held constant.</td>

   normative evaluation of managerial acts in organizational contexts. We
   test several propositions on the relationship between social status and
   normative;evaluation derived from Donald Black's theoretical framework
   on social control. The research design consists of a factorial survey of
   200 managers. Each respondent evaluated the seriousness of a normatively
   questionable managerial act. In each vignette, the perpetrator's social
   status was systematically manipulated in either a high or a low
   condition. The results generally support the argument that the higher a
   manager's social status the less vulnerable that individual is to
   unfavorable normative evaluations, holding constant the act. The paper
   closes with discussion of our findings in light of social structural and
   rational choice perspectives on informal social control in
   organizations. Additionally, we discuss methodological issues related to
   experimental research on informal social control in organizations, the
   consistency of our findings with those from previous studies of social
   control across diverse settings, potential;theoretical applications and
   extensions of Black's framework in organizational contexts, and
   practical implications for the implementation of corporate codes of
   conduct and corporate dispute resolution systems.</td>

   argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from
   affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals
   purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community
   in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating
   themselves with others who share their values and preferences and

   epistemological argument did not appear in its completed form until the
   1912 publication of The Elementary Forms of the Religions Life. There
   Durkheim outlined a theory of enacted social practice as the foundation
   for an epistemology. Yet neither Durkheim's contribution to a theory of
   social practice nor his epistemological argument have been recognized as
   such. The early critics played a pivotal role in creating and
   perpetuating this misunderstanding. The first highly negative wave of
   criticism in English, which treated Durkheim's arguments as naive,
   inadequate philosophy, appeared between 1915 and 1924. Inadequate as
   these initial criticisms were, citations show that they have been
   heavily relied upon. On these critics' authority, scholars rejected
   Durkheim's epistemology altogether, focusing instead on his sociology of

   Philadelphia Plan-a crucial moment in the shaping of federal equal
   employment law. Tying together political sociology's concept of policy
   feedback with legal and cultural sociology's concept of culture as a
   resource, the article explains how actors who were hampered by the
   explicit language used to embed equal opportunity values into law turned
   apparent constraint into an opportunity to transform law. The article
   simultaneously illuminates an underdeveloped aspect of equal employment
   law's unfolding and builds more general theory to help explain how law's
   language, general cultural values expressed in law, and alternative
   methods used to interpret law mediate the effects of past law on future
   law. Defining concepts of value centrality and explicitness of legal
   language, the article uses its case study to suggest hypotheses about
   how variation in centrality of cultural values and explicitness of
   language used to incorporate these values into law affect variation in
   mobilization of different types of cultural strategies by actors

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx
   are complementary, contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist
   society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's
   critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of
   reification, Georg Lukacs contended that the combination of Marx's and
   Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially
   transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By
   comparing Lukacs's theory of reification with Habermas's theory of
   communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian
   Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of "doing theory" has shifted
   from Marx's critique of economic deter terminism to Weber's idea of the
   inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an
   important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself
   as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions
   of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social
   value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second
   step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to
   Each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of
   communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of
   social organization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The process is traced whereby crucially important, multiple denotations
   of classical sociology's key notion referring to social position-the
   Weberian German concept of Stand-have been stripped to create a
   simplified and inaccurate representation of social inequalities. Some
   historical material from central Europe is surveyed, with a brief look
   at Japan, to demonstrate validity problems created by blanket
   application of the culturally specific, streamlined notions of
   status/class. As an alternative, a notion of contingent social closure
   argues that relaxing the modernizationist assumptions of a single
   transition from estate to status/class increases the
   comparative-historical sensitivity of research on social structure,
   inequality, and stratification. A dynamic reading of Polanyi suggests a
   reconceptualization of institutions as the "raw material" of social
   change. This might help to avoid the outdated contrast of the "West" vs.
   its "Others".</td>

   early resource mobilization and political process models. They remain
   limited, however. by their retention of dichotomous conceptions of
   culture and structure in the emergence of protest, of cultural and
   instrumental orientations in ongoing collective action, and of cultural
   and political targets of protest. As a result, they have neglected,
   respectively, continuities between structured inequalities and the
   movement challenges that are made to them, the cultural shaping of
   instrumentally rational decisionmaking, and the strategic possibilities
   that lay in cultural challenge made within the sphere of institutional
   politics. I draw on recent theorizing in the sociology of culture and on
   several case studies of collective action in order to highlight these
   lacunae and to propose analytical alternatives.</td>

   advantages over conventional methods and a comparison with recently
   developed relevant models To overcome the obstacle that existing
   statistical software cannot directly estimate the Yamaguchi model the
   author has developed a method that converts estimated parameters from
   standard multinomial logit estimation into parameters of the Yamaguchi
   model. This method makes it possible and easier for researchers to
   estimate the Yamaguchi model using standard statistical software and a
   simple programming of linear transformation. The method is simple and
   straightforward and thus merits application to an analysis of
   interdependence with panel darn. This article also provides a detailed
   empirical example to illustrate an application of the method.</td>

   conflicts that pitted qualitative against quantitative sociology; the
   fledgling discipline of sociology against medicine, psychiatry, and
   psychology; and advocates of therapy for addicts against those who would
   simply punish them. By casting the meaningful experience of drug effects
   exclusively in terms of symbolically mediated mental representations of
   brute physiological sensations, Lindesmith's theory posits an
   epistemologically untenable dualism between mental and bodily perception
   that unnecessarily limits the explanatory scope of sociological
   research. As an alternative to this dualism, a praxiological approach to
   the meaning of drug-induced behavior and experience is proposed.</td>

   ''core'' conceptions of theory and method that remain entrenched in
   sociology textbooks. In conjunction with recent developments in history
   and philosophy of science, sociologists of science speak of the disunity
   of science and describe the local-historical origins of particular
   scientific facts and laws. ''Core'' sociology textbooks devote no
   attention to the methodological implications of recent sociology of
   science. Elementary textbooks present upbeat versions of the discipline
   that emphasize sociology's scientific methodology; they describe
   sociological methods as implementations of a general research process
   designed along hypothetico-dedective lines. Viewed from the vantage
   point of SSK, such widely disseminated elementary versions of sociology
   promote an asociological conception of science. In this paper we suggest
   that the ''epistemic flattening'' accomplished by SSK's research on the
   natural sciences provides a valuable antidote to current anxieties about
   the coherence and scientific status of sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Emerging from recent social and political struggles, the notion of
   'civil society' can and should be transformed into a sociological
   concept on both the theoretical and empirical level. This means going
   beyond the Marxist and social democratic understandings of civil society
   as a world of selfish economic interests, on the one hand, and beyond
   the liberal equation of civil society with legal protections of
   individual rights, on the other. Civil society should be conceptualized
   as a realm of solidarity, a 'we-ness' that simultaneously affirms the
   sanctity of the individual and these individuals' obligations to the
   collectivity. The solidary sphere, in principle and in practice, can be
   differentiated not only from markets and states but from such other
   noncivil spheres as religion, family and science. Yet differentiation
   does not preclude tension and conflict over boundaries. Civil solidarity
   is 'compromised' and 'distorted' by these boundary relations, and also
   by competing, more primordial definitions of community, such as race,
   language, nation, territory, and ethnicity. While civil society can be
   identified with 'universal reason' in a philosophical sense, in
   sociological terms it must be articulated by more concrete and
   identity-related symbolic constructs. For this reason, sociological
   approaches to civil society must be tied to cultural sociology, to
   theories of symbolic codes and narratives.</td>

   ape of increasing interest to sociologists. In the case of high-culture
   literary texts, the central evaluation process takes place through canon
   formation. We explore the mechanisms of canon formation and of cultural
   valorization processes more generally by analyzing the critical history
   of Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Published in
   1937 to lukewarm reviews, the novel is currently considered a core
   canonical text. We specify three processes involved in the
   reconstruction of Hurston's novel and in the establishment of the
   African American literary canon: (I) the application of new evaluative
   criteria, (2) the reconstruction of textual meaning through newly
   available interpretative strategies, and (3) changes in the
   institutional and organizational environment that allowed new claims on
   high-status critical positions to be made by those previously outside
   the literary hierarchy. The implications of this study for theoretical
   models of cultural valorization in sociology are considered.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article argues that the medical record is an important focus for
   sociological research. In medical work, the modern patient's body that
   Foucault has so aptly described is produced through embodied, materially
   heterogeneous work, and the medical record plays a crucial role in this
   production. It does not simply represent this body's history and
   geography; it is a central element in the material rewriting of these.
   Simultaneously, the record fulfills a core role in the production of a
   body politic. As the record is involved in the performance of the
   patient's body, it is also involved in the performance of the clinic in
   which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that different records
   and different practices of reading and writing are intertwined with the
   production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic, and bodies of
   knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical record affords
   the interplay and coordination of divergent worlds. Seen as a site where
   multiple stories about patients and organizations are at stake,
   including the interoperability between these stories, the medical record
   becomes highly relevant both analytically and politically.</td>

   This field has had a history of ethnographic and qualitative research
   since ifs beginnings. Because few studies in medical sociology derive
   from immersion in a setting, the authors examine those qualitative works
   in which researchers and subjects had sustained contact. They focus only
   on major areas in which ethnographic contributions have clustered: (1)
   disability, chronic illness, and terminal illness; (2) caring and
   curing; (3) medical sociology in aging research; (4) socialization into
   health care professions; and (5) the ethnography of ethics. Throughout
   this review, the added value of ethnographic research to each specific
   area is noted. Ethnographic research has enriched medical sociology with
   its emphasis an descriptive detail, meanings, ongoing processes, and
   concepts. The article ends with a discussion of methodological
   considerations for conducting research and a summary statement.</td>

   reduces the amount of violence in human societies. Are they right? I
   review the cross-cultural and cross-national evidence on the impact of
   the state on the most common form of extreme violence-lethal conflict
   (i.e., war, rebellion, homicide, and execution). Drawing on the
   sociology of conflict management (Black 1993), I argue that the
   relationship between the state and lethal conflict is nor negative as
   Hobbesian theory predicts. Rather, it appears to be U-shaped. A
   combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political
   science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when
   state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or
   centralized. Between these extremes, in less centralized states, lethal
   conflict typically declines.</td>

   compatible reading materials is discussed, as is the challenge of
   introducing small-group work to provide more direct exposure to the
   privileges and disadvantages in students' lives. Four semesters of
   small-group work are summarized in the content analyses of students'
   responses to four questions: What is a source of pride in your
   racial/ethnic background When have you been discriminated against? When
   have you discriminated against others? How are you privileged? Results
   reveal an implied white racism, frank gender discrimination toward
   women, a tendency to personalize and individualize discrimination toward
   others, and perceived class privilege with regard to education. These
   findings are discussed within the context of the systems of inequality
   approach, within the context of the course, and within the wider

   sustainable development. Taught by three primary professors and
   augmented by various on-site discussants, the semester-long curriculum
   integrated sociology and political economy with agricultural ecology.
   Our guiding philosophy dictated that the curriculum be empirically
   based, involve working collaboratively, and utilize multidisciplinary
   investigation. Faculty members and students worked together in a number
   of sites throughout the country to investigate the human and
   environmental problems of sustainability. Students were open to
   interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field
   reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is
   challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that
   this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This
   report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also
   considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a
   learning community.</td>

   revision of the sociology major to promote greater ''study in depth.'' A
   key recommendation in the report is that the major include at least four
   levels of sequencing. These consist of introductory courses, skills
   courses, advanced substantive courses, and capstone courses. St. Cloud
   State University revised its sociology major to incorporate many of the
   recommendations in the ASA report. An initial revision of the major
   omitted the third level of sequencing, but a recent revision includes
   all four levels. Faculty members concerns about scheduling, enrollments,
   and autonomy slowed the pace of change and influenced the content of the
   major. The experience of St. Cloud State University suggests that
   implementing the ''study in depth'' guidelines is a difficult but
   rewarding process.</td>

   contends that sociological theory presents reified constructs no more
   based in reality than are fictional accounts. Kenneth Burke's logology
   predates and adequately addresses postmodernism's valid charges against
   sociology. At the same time, logology avoids the idealistic tendencies
   and ethical pitfalls of radical forms of postmodernist deconstruction,
   which acknowledge neither pretextual and extratextual worlds nor the way
   sin which experience is embodied. While not fully articulated, Burke's
   logology gives primacy to an embodies, social world prior to text
   (body-as-World). Sociology can strengthen both its theoretical arsenal
   and its response to postmodernism by reacknowledging and reclaiming
   Burke's logology.</td>

   human sciences while having very little influence on the arts of
   sciences. This variation is explained using a sociological framework
   emphasizing the organizational forms that underpin or are implicit in
   epistemological positions. The fine arts and the harder sciences are,
   respectively, too weakly and too strongly organized to be open to
   epistemological influence. By contrast, the human sciences might
   plausibly be organized either more loosely or more tightly, and
   epistemological argument is used in part to urge movement in one or the
   other direction. This persvective is applied to the academic study of
   literature both historically and in relation to a current
   epistemological dispute between realist and relativist scholars. The
   argument is unresolvable in practice, it is argued, because of
   constraints on scholarly interpretation set by consumers. Parallels are

   coherence, or class background of the state bureaucracies, and of
   institutional characteristics that ensure state effectiveness. This view
   has several problems: it assumes what has to be explained, makes it
   difficult to understand changes in state autonomy, and tends to make
   autonomy the characteristic of strong, cove states. This paper calls for
   a new approach to study state autonomy, one in which power is a
   characteristic of a relationship, not of actors or organizations
   (Emerson 1962), and uses this approach to examine changes in state-class
   relationships based on taxation during the mid 1930s in Bolivia. The
   paper then argues that state autonomy depends on the relative costs of
   state policies and on the availability of political allies to the state
   vis-a-vis the opposing economic elite. This approach allows us to
   specify the power dependence of the state on a gir,en class, the
   conditions under which that relative dependence changes in favor of the
   state, and is applicable to both weak and strong states.</td>

   replete with tabular demonstrations of the stacking phenomenon Many of

   presentation: Percents should be computed in the direction of the causal
   factor. This procedure allows one to contrast the distribution of the
   dependent variable between/among categories of the independent variable
   and enables determining what differences if any, exist between/among
   categories of the independent variable. The consequences of this
   violation for stacking studies is that, technically, position appears to
   affect race whereas, logically race affects position played. Because so
   many competent researchers have published tables that run the ''wrong

   andragogical teaching techniques for a multidisciplinary classroom.
   Field research was conducted by undergraduate students at a popular
   social setting: local urban and suburban malls. The objective of the
   assignment was to explore critically the basic sociological concepts of
   stratification along such dimensions as race, class, gender, ethnicity,
   and nationality. By extending classroom heuristics into the social world
   of ''everyday life,'' this approach enables students to explore a
   familiar social place-the postindustrial shrine to American consumption
   culture-through the critical lens of the sociological imagination. The
   application of sociological principles learned in the classroom to the
   larger community or ''real world'' helps to enhance the relevance of
   sociology as a scientific discipline to students when they return to the
   traditional academic setting. Although the paper is based on experiences
   from a multidisciplinary class (N=63) that was not trained in
   qualitative research techniques, the assignment can be utilized
   effectively in more advanced undergraduate and graduate courses,
   including research methods classes.</td>

   sociological discourse as the core organizing features of modern
   societies. Yet such economically centered models of stratification often
   disregard factors like physical violence and the intra-household
   distribution of resources that shape power and autonomy for all groups.
   Using a sample of textbooks from 1983 through 1988, we examine
   ''mainstream'' sociology, that is, the sociology that teachers,
   students, and textbook publishers have treated as nonproblematic. We
   show how stratification analysis is applied to class, race, and gender
   in profoundly unequal ways. Rather than integrating macro, meso, and
   micro levels of social structure as interactive and mutually
   determinative in their discussions of race, class, and gender,
   introductory sociology textbooks segregate stratification processes.
   They discuss class at the societal (or macro) level of analysis, gender
   at the individual (or micro) level, and race at a group (or meso) level.
   We analyze the quantitative and qualitative elements of the coverage of
   class, race, and gender in indexes, texts, pictures, and captions, and
   suggest that attention to feminist theories of gender would produce a
   more integrated, multilevel, and interactive view. of stratification.</td>

   year later. We found that: (1) small percentages, because of the size of
   the metropolitan area population, translated into large absolute numbers
   for personal disaster behavior; (2) social class (or socioeconomic
   status) was important as a differentiating factor in earthquake-related
   behavior; (3) there was little dissatisfaction with organizational
   efforts to deal with the earthquake consequences along with (4) no
   noticeable increase in dissatisfaction from the time of the initial
   impact up to the year's anniversary of the disaster; (5) the
   earthquake-related sheltering and housing of people was not as
   problematical as the extensiveness of the activity might suggest; (6)
   the volunteering pattern of individuals was quite complex; (7) there was
   extremely heavy mass media usage in the earthquake aftermath; and (8)
   earthquake victims learned little from their experience on how to
   prepare for future disasters. The paper primarily uses these
   generalizations from the survey findings to advance eight basic themes
   about human behavior in disasters that might be comparatively examined
   in future cross-societal studies.</td>

   related to pesticide use and water quality issues is evidenced by
   several trends. These trends include the increasing documentation of
   water pollution by farm pesticides, the changing characteristics of farm
   ownership and operator tenure, and evolutions in resource policy and
   protection planning. This paper utilizes a theoretical approach to the
   sociology of land tenure to interpret results from an investigation of
   landlord involvement in environmental decision making regarding
   pesticide selection on rented land. Eight counties with high
   susceptibility of water contamination by pesticides were selected for
   study. Structured, in-person interviews were administered to in-county
   landlords, and a mail survey was used to poll out-of-county landlords.
   Results indicate that participation is generally low with very little
   difference between landlord groups. Renters make most of the
   organizational and operational decisions on rented farmland. Landlord
   participation is predominantly based on economic, rather than on social
   or environmental, factors. Furthermore, while economic variables are
   important predictors of participation for both groups, gender and social
   ties to the renter tend to increase local landlord involvement, but not
   absentee involvement. These results have important implications for both
   federal programs and further research on land tenure and environmental
   stewardship.</td>

   idea, far from being a poor-bashing, ideological ploy, is firmly
   grounded in a Marxist critique of capital and ifs productive

   constructivist sociology of science, Andrew Pickering advertises novel
   conceptual resources for social theorists. fn fact, he tenders nothing
   less than a fundamental reordering of social thought. By invoking the
   concept of "material agency," Pickering seeks to redefine the
   relationship between "Nature " and "Society," while dismissing the
   "humanist bias" inherent in sociological inquiry. However, for all its
   ambition and good intentions, posthumanism delivers only analytical
   inconsistencies, the consequences of an uneasy synthesis of pragmatist
   and poststructuralist influences. When translated into the language of
   conventional sociological theory, these problems surface as an
   inadequate treatment of human agency The works of the original
   pragmatists, particularly C.S. Peirce and G.H. Mead, illustrate how the
   objectives of posthumanism can be achieved without decentering,
   suggesting a renewed appreciation of "humanist" sociologies.</td>

   organization-environment relations, very little research has examined
   its possible limits. Under what circumstances might the neoinstitutional
   predictions regarding organizational inertia, institutional isomorphism,
   the legitimacy imperative, and other fundamental beliefs be overshadowed
   by? more traditional sociological theories accentuating organizational
   adaptation, variation, and the role of specific global and local
   technical environmental demands? We analyze longitudinal data from 1971
   to 1986 for 631 private liberal arts colleges facing strong
   institutional and increasingly strong technical environments. Our
   findings reveal surprisingly little support neoinstitutional
   predictions. (I) Many liberal arts colleges changed in ways contrary to
   institutional demands by professionalizing or vocationalizing their
   curricula; (2) global and local technical environmental conditions, such
   as changes in consumers' references and local economic and demographic
   differences, were strong predictors of the changes observed; (3) schools
   Became less, rather than more, homogeneous over time; (4) schools

   environmental sociology to date, going on to propose ways in which the
   existing research can be used as a foundation for a new generation of
   research into the 21st century. It argues that environmental
   sociologists need to avoid the omphaloskepsis that sometimes afflicts
   other fields of sociology, but that there is a real opportunity to do
   so. Three options appear particularly promising: (a) broadening the
   now-established base of sociological research that deals systematically
   with environmental variables; (b) devoting greater attention to the ways
   in which socially constructed ''definitions of the situation'' may
   contribute to (and not simply permit the evading of) the environmental
   problems that societies face; and (c) beginning more line-grained
   analyses of the connections between specific human activities
   (particularly economic activities) and specific components of the
   physical environment. Contributions to date have clearly established the
   fact that such connections exist; the work of a much broader range of
   sociologists will be needed, however, to help develop an improved
   understanding oi the nature, causes, and extent of those connections.</td>

   extensive and broad; however, it is ghettoized, with the majority of
   citations confined to a chapter on race. Ghettoization is coupled with a

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.</td>

   texts, medical accounts are beginning to classify the fetus as a baby.
   In investigating this transformation, I focus upon two cognitive
   processes: the splitting of the fetus apart from the pregnant woman and
   the concurrent lumping of two distinct mental entities-a fetus and an
   infant into one new medical category: the fetus-infant. In addition,
   textual evidence shows a shift in cognitive orientation away from
   classifying fetuses based on gestational age to an emphasis on what I
   term functional age. Further, new knowledge enables physicians to affect
   functional age, making the fetus with mature function in utero
   conceptually no different from a baby.</td>

   hegemonic Western culture's intersubjective notions of how to carve lip

   sociologists of cognition have still to consider this sociomental

   social construction, collective agreement, and socialization. While
   objective danger certainly exists, perceptions of danger do not derive
   directly from observation of the empirical world. The objective
   environment provides only inconsistent and ambiguous information,
   permitting ample room for socially constructed beliefs. Three cognitive
   frameworks-the Cautious, Confident and Neutral frameworks-organize
   perceptions of safety and danger. Each framework begins with a default
   assumption about safety and danger and ''marks'' certain items as
   different from this default. In shaping expectations, these frameworks
   also contribute to perceptions of horror, humor, excitement and fear.
   Finally, I use these frameworks to analyze the psychological concept
   ''phobia'' as a sociological phenomenon.</td>

   Goffman-and search for those findings, observations, concepts, or
   analyses which have found purchase across the discipline and which
   seemingly defy the forces of theoretical balkanization. This
   interparadigmatic dialogue on Goffman can be realized only if a
   concerted effort is made to bring together representatives of

   attention from sociologists, the importance of methodological
   preferences has been overlooked. We examine an influential model of
   theory growth in social science. This model focuses on theory. We show
   how recent work in the sociology of science suggests an equally
   important place for methodological preference in guiding social
   research. Bringing in method allows us to recognize that what often
   passes for fundamental metatheoretical differences among subfields in
   sociology actually consists of minor squabbles over resource allocation.
   We show that not only does social theory grow strategically through
   theoretical research programs, but that the different forms of
   theoretical work in sociology serve to integrate the work of diverse
   researchers in a less efficient but still effective manner.</td>

   occurs in talk-in-interaction. The practice of agreeing with another by
   repeating what they have said is shown to constitute the action of
   confirming an allusion-that is, confirming both its ''content'' and its
   prior inexplicit conveyance. The author reviews the past treatment of
   ''action'' in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an
   empirically grounded account. The account of ''confirming allusions'' is
   offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several
   instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and
   used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration
   of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is
   formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic
   techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it
   implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of
   repetition in talk-in-interaction. Tn conclusion, the significance of
   both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture
   and for sociological theory is discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>By any standard, nonrationality is an undertheorized concept in
   sociology. This paper attempts to open a discussion on nonrationality by
   analyzing one of the most fruitful theorizations of the concept:
   Simmels. Simmel developed a theory that placed nonrationality on the
   same plane with rationality and attributed to the former a role as
   fundamental as the latter's in the foundations of action, and as central
   as the latter's in the generation of existential meanings. The gradual
   eclipse of the nonrational elements of life in the expanses of a modern,
   highly rationalized world imply, then, an impoverishment of being. I
   argue that Simmel's theory of the nonrational can serve as a model
   capable of enriching our understanding of society and of the person and
   can, in this sense, serve as a counterpoint to current sociological
   theories that emphasize the rational elements of life and conceive the
   person in primarily rational terms.</td>

   prevailing sensibility with perfect clarity. Here, ky contrast, I draw
   upon writings from Durkheim's later "religious" period to show how
   Durkheim has special relevance today for debates in the
   historical-comparative field. I examine how his substantive writings
   shed light on current discussions regarding civil society; how his
   analytical insights help to show how action within civil society as well
   as other historical contexts is channelled by cultural,
   social-structural, and social-psychological configurations (plus
   transformative human agency); and how his ontological commitment to a
   "relational social realisin" contributes to ongoing attempts to rethink
   the foundations of historical-comparative investigation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Jeffrey Alexander and Giuseppe Sciortino take my 1992 ASR article as an
   occasion to mount a critique of tendencies that they discern throughout
   my recent writings on the early intellectual career of Talcott Parsons.
   I should like to reciprocate the compliment by using this commentary not
   only to address specific objections that they raise, but to step back
   from these criticisms to examine their connection to Alexander's work
   more generally. My claim is that as a tool for analyzing the development
   of ideas-the development, that is, of various intellectual products or
   kinds of social-scientific knowledge-Alexander's work is fundamentally
   antisociological. Since my own goal has been to work out a sociology of
   ideas, we necessarily clash-albeit in more serious and consequential
   ways than Alexander and Sciortino identify.</td>

   teaching technique in large introductory sociology courses have been
   well documented. In this paper we report our extension of this technique
   to experiments in surveys. Using two forms of the in-class
   questionnaire, we implemented experiments in response framework,
   response order, and question order in surveys conducted in spring and
   fall, 1993 and 1994. The results of the experiments were presented in
   simplified form to the mass introductory classes and in greater detail
   to junior-level research methods classes in spring 1995. The goal in
   presenting this material to research methods students is to encourage
   critical thinking and informed skepticism about questionnaire design
   specifically, and data-generating procedures more generally In this
   paper we include some examples of experiments and describe how they were
   introduced and discussed in, research methods classes.</td>

   whether, compared to personal networks in urban settings, personal
   networks in rural settings contain ties of greater intensity and role
   multiplexity, are based more on kinship and neighborhood solidarities
   rather than on friendship, are smaller, are denser, and have greater
   educational, race-ethnic, and religious homogeneity, but less age and
   gender homogeneity. Our results are generally consistent with these

   data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in southwestern
   Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing
   possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial
   communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network
   analysis to contribute to the resolution of these and other

   This view ignores his considerable achievements using the methodology of

   lectures on the history of French education (The Evolution of

   for substantive illustrations of his approach. Finally I explore certain
   points of intersection between Durkheim's approach to history and

   history and the opposition between prospective and retrospective
   (''teleological'') strategies of historical analysis.</td>

   dozen more books on how to construct scientific theories in the seven
   years after 1965 marked the beginning of the end of; rather than the end
   of the beginning of the theory construction movement in sociology.
   Although the formal mode of theory construction is dead now, efforts

   System, Change and Conflict. The paper argues that little of that
   controversy remains, but that several key issues have taken on new forms

   communities and changes in the built environment. I draw on data from a
   case study of land-use discourse in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to
   explore the ways in which imagery shapes the rhetoric available for
   land-use debate and how this, in turn, affects changes in zoning. Of
   particular importance in this process are heritage narratives. These
   broad renditions of a community's history are a form of constitutive
   rhetoric. When successful, they create an audience to whom subsequent
   appeals can be made, and they set boundaries on the content and
   direction of public discourse. The analysis suggests that communication
   and rhetorical processes are central to ecological change and that to
   dismiss these phenomena in favor of macrostructural forces is to miss a
   significant aspect of the human dimensions of local change and of the
   processes through which places are stratified.</td>

   on deviance take an individual-level approach; groups are brought in

   groups of different kinds (not only cults and communes), arguing that
   such groups are important sources of deviant behavior and are relatively
   neglected in deviance studies. Particular attention is given to
   ''deviance production groups''-groups that take in ''normal'' people and
   turn them into deviants, to some extent, such as the Branch Davidians,
   the Ku Klux Klan, and witches' covens. The course is also distinctive in
   its degree of emphasis on sociological concepts and theory, its
   complementing of other deviance courses, and its dependence on group
   discussions and presentations during class. Lectures are relatively
   infrequent; students are expected to use a study guide and to learn
   substantially from an instructor-prepared text on the deviant groups
   covered.</td>

   failure to match theoretical and conceptual advances with appropriate

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The current decline of the developmentalist paradigm, and its view of
   the rural as increasingly residual, revitalizes rural sociology. The
   blossoming of studies of rurality and ecology is paralleled by the
   growing currency of globalization as an object of analysis. This is more
   than a coincidence-in fact, globalization crystallizes local diversity.
   The two phenomena go hand in hand. But each needs to be understood as an
   historical construct; that is, they need to be problematized. In
   problematizing ''globalization,'' I argue that it must be understood as
   a post-developmentalist construct. The postwar goal of national
   development, institutionalized in the international Bretton Woods
   regime, has run its course-dramatized by the assault on developmentalist
   states and institutions in the monetarist regime established under the
   auspices of the 1980s debt crisis. The nationally oriented institutions
   of the developmentalist era are now being replaced by globally oriented
   institutions under the legitimizing cloak of efficiency and financial
   credibility. Related to this trend, producing communities scramble to
   reposition themselves either through finding niches in a new global
   economy or through resistance to global pressures. Either way, there is
   a new emphasis on defining the local. This article explores the
   conjunction of global and local definition.</td>

   major contributors to environmental sociology. In part, this is because
   several areas of longstanding rural sociological interest (e.g.,
   sociology of resource management and outdoor recreation, studies of
   resource-dependent communities) essentially came to be redefined as
   environmental sociology during the 1970s. The most significant role of
   rural sociologists in building environmental sociology, however, has
   perhaps been the fact that the material and biophysical nature of the
   phenomena they have traditionally studied contributed to a general
   predisposition to recognize the ''materiality'' of social structure and
   social life. I assess the major strategies that have been developed for
   theorizing this materiality and then indicate some of the most critical
   lines of debate and dissension. I argue that if these debates are
   examined in their specifics-rather than as incompatible perspectives or
   ''paradigms''-some opportunities for synthesis become apparent. Some
   suggested avenues of synthesis are set forth.</td>

   and the social relationships of peripheral settings have provided
   substantive boundary and conceptual meaning to rural sociology,
   propelled its evolution, and left it with a legacy of strengths,
   weaknesses, and challenges. A willingness to tackle the dimension of
   space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists
   apart fr om other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with
   general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial
   covering laws, and proto-typical relationships of modern or Fordist
   development settings. Conceptual openings have left sociologists
   questioning their past agenda. Coupled with the ''creative marginality''

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Collective violence is often social control: self-help by a group. It
   typically defines and responds to conduct as deviant. When unilateral
   and nongovernmental, it appears in four major forms-lynching, rioting,
   vigilantism, and terrorism-each distinguished by its system of liability
   (individual or collective) and degree of organization (higher or lower).
   Following Donald Black's paradigm of pure sociology, the central
   assumption is that collective violence varies with its location and
   direction in social space-the conflict structure. I offer ten
   propositions that predict and explain the likelihood and severity of
   collective violence in general and the four forms of collective violence
   in particular Conflict structures with a high degree of relational

   one sexuality, and one gender, congruent with each other and fixed for
   life. Postmodern feminists and queer theorists have been interrogating
   bodies, desires, and genders, but sociology has not. Deconstructing sex,
   sexuality and gender reveals many possible categories embedded in social
   experiences and social practices. As researchers, as theorists, and as
   activists, sociologists have to go beyond paying lip service to the
   diversity of bodies, sexualities, genders. The sociologist's task should
   be to deconstruct the conventional categories of sex, sexuality, and
   gender and build new complex, cross-cubing constructs into research
   designs. There are revolutionary possibilities inherent in rethinking
   the categories of gender, sexuality and physiological sex. Sociological
   data that challenge conventional knowledge by reframing the questions
   could provide legitimacy for new ways of thinking. Data that undermine
   the supposed natural dichotomies on which the social orders of most
   modem societies are still based could radically alter political
   discourses that valorize biological causes, essential heterosexuality,
   and traditional gender roles in families and workplaces.</td>

   invites knowing the probable future consequences of contemplated

   Sociology-explicitly, rigorously, critically and objectively-focusing on
   achieving freedom and wed-being for human beings Think (4) globally and
   (5) holistically, even when working locally. (6) Take the meaning of
   time seriously and explore the real though sometimes hidden, alternative
   present possibilities for the not-yet-evidential future. (7) View people
   as active agents who strive to create the futures that they want. And
   (8) in defining society, emphasize expectation, choice, and decision as
   people, through historical actions, construct society by attempting to
   transform their images of desirable futures into social realities.</td>

   Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism has largely
   failed to influence the development of sociological theory in the United
   States. Because it has been read almost exclusively as a study of the
   "role of ideas" in economic development, its diverse and multifaceted
   theoretical contributions generally have been neglected. This study
   explicitly calls attention to The Protestant Ethic as a theoretical
   treatise by examining this classic in reference to four major debates in
   postwar sociological theory in the United States. Moreover, it
   demarcates an array of major parameters in American theorizing. The
   conclusion speculates upon the reasons for the strong opposition to The
   Protestant Ethic's theoretical lessons and argues that a style of
   theorizing unique to sociology in the United States has erected firm
   barriers against this classic text.</td>

   implications for the way in which social research is and should be

   competing causal explanations are misdirected. Further; the emphasis on
   causation in contemporary sociology is often misdirected.</td>

   years of Rural Sociology; this note employs a similar analytic
   frame-work for the 292 articles and research commentaries published from
   1986 to 1995. While particular topics ebb and flow in terms of their
   importance, there continues to be a consistent focus on the substantive
   issues of traditional concern. Predictions in 1985 as to what the next
   retrospective would show proved to be fairly accurate. Applied empirical
   and quantitative studies continue to dominate the pages of the journal,
   but other types (e.g., qualitative and historical studies) now appear
   with greater frequency. The theoretical foundation of rural sociology
   has been enriched with conceptual frameworks from general sociology and
   other social sciences. New twists on the traditional concerns of
   agricultural constituencies and rural community leaders have broadened
   the range of topics addressed, reflecting the major social structures,
   processes, and issues currently affecting rural peoples and communities.
   The article concludes with an interpretation of recent trends and
   speculations on future directions.</td>

   phenomena assumed by positivism and existing in the world of nature in
   ways that prevent the successful use of that traditional approach.
   Agency, the ability to choose among alternatives where the choice makes
   an important difference, exists in social phenomena but has no
   counterpart in nature and cannot be dealt with adequately by positivism.
   A technological science perspective is suggested as an alternative for a
   science of sociology that can deal with the reality and importance of
   agency. Eight differences between the traditional perspective and the
   alternative are sketched. The alternative requires changes in the kind
   of generalized knowledge produced and the way it is produced,
   accumulated, and refined. The changes, though seemingly small, would
   produce a major reconstruction of much of sociology; such changes could
   result in important progress by the field of sociology.</td>

   science perspective for sociology based on a theory of humans as
   technological agents and an epistemology that includes ethical values.
   As with any sociological perspective, however, Warner and England's
   comments help to focus on and understand some aspects of social life and
   not others. This commentary provides a complementary focus by
   emphasizing the dialectical relationship between human agency and
   technological agency. Furthermore, I argue that a dialectical view is
   necessary for grounding Warner and England's theoretical argument and
   for acting on their ethical argument. Implications of a dialectical
   perspective for the meaning and politics of technology are explored. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the suitability of ''science'' as a
   metaphor for sociology.</td>

   perspective for sociology is a helpful effort to maintain a balance
   between our emphasis on agency and creativity and on the constraining
   side of society. We emphasize agency as part of a dialectic between
   human effort and societal resistance for three reasons. First, it forces
   reconceptualization of the nature of the science of sociology by
   shifting from a positivist mode to one that is pragmatic. The meaning of
   scientific findings changes. Second, agency has been ignored
   historically while constraint has been overemphasized. We seek to
   establish a balance by reentering the notion of agency into sociological
   discourse. Third, agency is a mechanism for modifying constraints and
   solving the problems associated with social technologies. In the closing
   paragraphs of the reply, we suggest that the view under discussion be
   seen as an ethical pragmatism. Agency forces us to ethical questions and
   a pragmatic understanding of science.</td>

   other relations, such as capitalist and class relations, were also
   present. This article seeks to reestablish, contrary to the revisionist
   view, the centrality of lineage in African precolonial societies to
   allow for a paradigmatic shift that repudiates evolutionism and brings
   precolonial societies back to the center of the African debate. Because
   in such a reoriented debate Africa ceases to be marginalized and on the
   fringes of other historical experiences, the shift allows,
   paradoxically, the integration of scholarship on Africa into universal
   social theory.</td>

   is different from those that have appeared in the literature. In
   contrast to the ideological and technical readings, it suggests that the
   origins of the crisis are to be found in the hermeneutic challenge that
   has resulted from the linguistic and multicultural turns. Both of these
   developments have given rise to new discourses within the academy that
   are competing with subfields such as the sociology of the arts and
   race/ethnic relations. The nature and impact of this new competition is
   examined in greater detail through the case of the sociology of race.
   The analysis reveals that these competitive challenges are hermeneutic
   in nature and not primarily technical or ideological. The paper
   concludes with some suggestions for crisis resolution.</td>

   theories is not as widespread in sociology as it is in most scientific
   disciplines. This brief articles explains how modeling is a distinctive
   activity from either ''theory'' or ''empirical analysis'' but how it
   informs both and connects them. Simulation models are artificial objects
   created to translate theoretical generalizations into specific scenarios
   involving states (variables and/or actors) and rates (the dynamic causal
   laws hypothesized to generate change over time in the states).
   Simulation models are analyzed to understand the full range of
   implications of theoretical statements as they apply to producing
   historical realizations under particular circumstances. Simulation
   analysis operates by a method of experimentation, unlike mathematical
   modeling and statistical modeling. The strengths and limitations of
   these three approaches to studying models are discussed and suggested to
   be complementary rather than competitive with each other. Last, this
   article briefly points out some of the unique features of the exemplars
   that compose the remainder of this special issue of Sociological

   feminist theory? Notwithstanding indications of increasing openness to
   feminist theory, journals and texts on sociological theory reflect a
   continuing pattern of neglect. Identify reasons for this pattern;
   including tensions resulting from the introduction of gender as a
   central analytical category: Nor only does gender challenge the
   dichotomous categories that define sociology's boundaries and identity,
   it also displaces the discipline's central problematic of modernity. The
   significance of this displacement is apparent when the discipline's
   responses to feminist and postmodernist theory are compared I discuss
   the relevance of feminist theoretical work to contemporary issues in
   sociological theory, with specific attention to the synthetic nature of
   feminist theorizing to work on rethinking power resistance, and
   oppression, and to efforts to effect a conceptual shift from
   ''either/or'' to ''both/and'' thinking and to establish new grounds for
   assessing knowledge claims.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the ''political culture
   concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly Habermas's account of the
   Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original
   political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory
   in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture
   is used in a way that is neither political nov cultural. Explaining this
   peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its
   companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number
   2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself
   is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here
   called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual
   relationships that combine into Angle-American citizenship theory. The
   method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to
   analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and
   dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in
   cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative,
   and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical
   findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called
   the Angle-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an
   epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a
   metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in
   political sociology.</td>

   any sort for graduate students. In the past 20 years, however, concern
   for teaching excellence has increased, as has evidence of the

   teaching assistants and graduate students teaching their own courses
   receive formal training, an indication of little change in the

   mean by ''the sociological imagination,'' and how they implement this
   concept. We argue that sociologists, like academics in other
   disciplines, fry to speak in a certain ''voice'' which provides a unique
   analytical framework but is distinct from the jargon of the discipline.
   Our second, empirical goal is to assess why students do or do not learn
   the ''voice'' of sociology. We found that certain background
   characteristics df students hinder or help the development of this
   voice. In addition, contradictory, confusing, and competing
   pedagogies-both within sociology and across disciplines-impede the
   development of the sociological imagination.</td>

   implosion of the Soviet empire in 1989-1990 - may be obtained by
   recombining aspects of the sociology of religion analyses of Weber and
   Durkheim. In particular, their complementary notions of 'charisma' and
   'collective effervescence' provide an understanding of how social actors
   in coercive secular states, confronted by a seeming monopoly of the use
   of physical force, are able, in certain exceptional circumstances, to
   mobilise and disarm the state. The assembling of the societal or
   national community is the background to Weber's discussion of
   charismatic leadership and the foreground to Durkheim. The 'velvet
   revolutions' of 1989 in various countries of Eastern Europe may be seen
   as manifestations of an historical moment of 'collective effervescence'
   in which the assembled collectivity itself, more than individual

   materials. Efforts to site such facilities have been uniformly
   unsuccessful, due largely to strong public opposition. Although
   supporters of such facilities often emphasize the potential for local
   economic development and other opportunities, opponents focus on a
   variety of threats involving potential risks associated with waste
   disposal. Survey data collected in rural areas of Nevada and Nebraska
   where nuclear waste disposal facilities have been proposed reveal that
   respondents' positions on issues of perceived health and safety risks,
   trust in responsible agencies, anticipated local economic effects, and
   concerns about environmental contamination are key variables predicting
   local response. Even in areas where there may be substantial local
   support for economic opportunities associated with the facilities,
   broad-based fears about nuclear materials and a legacy of distrust in
   the agencies responsible for managing nuclear wastes suggest that
   proposals for such facilities will almost inevitably continue to
   generate strong public opposition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociological efforts to understand environment-society relationships
   fall primarily into four conceptual categories. The first three,
   involving analytical separation, analytical primacy, and balanced
   dualism, all draw distinctions between biophysical and social aspects of
   human experience, with subsequent analyses being based on these a priori
   distinctions. The fourth or constructivist approach questions this
   naturalized dichotomy, calling attention instead to mutual contingency
   or conjoint constitution: What we take to be ''physical facts'' are
   likely to be strongly shaped by social construction processes, and at
   the same time, what we take to be ''strictly social'' will often have
   been shaped in part by taken-for-granted realities of the physical
   world. Technology offers important opportunities for tracing these
   interconnections, being an embodiment of both the physical and the
   social. The point is illustrated with a long-term historical analysis of
   a specific physiographic feature-a mountain-that has undergone little
   overt physical change over the centuries, but has undergone repeated
   changes in its social meanings and uses. Few of the changes would have
   been possible in the absence of the mountain's physiographic
   characteristics; similarly, few would have occurred in the absence of
   changing sociocultural definitions and possibilities. The challenge for
   sociology is not just to recognize the importance of both the physical
   and the social factors, and certainly not to argue over the relative
   importance of the two, but to recognize the extent to which what we rake
   to be ''physical'' and ''social'' factors can be conjointly constituted.</td>

   Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation

   explicated in this article. Adapting means altering life and self to
   accommodate to bodily losses and limits and resolving the lost unity
   between body and self It means struggling with rather than against
   illness. The process of adapting consists of three major stages: (1)
   experiencing and defining impairment, (2) making bodily assessments and,
   subsequently, identity trade-offs, as ill people weigh their losses and
   gains and revise their identity goals, and (3) surrendering to the sick
   self by relinquishing control over illness and by flowing with the
   experience of it. Adapting seldom occurs only once. Rather chronically
   ill people are forced to adapt repeatedly as they experience new losses.
   The data consist of 115 interviews about experiencing chronic illness
   and 25 more focused interviews about the body in chronic illness. The
   strategies of grounded theory provided the methods for completing the
   analysis.</td>

   positive correlation between the prestige of the departments where
   scientists received their degrees and the prestige of the departments
   where they obtained jobs, especially their first jobs. This correlation
   held regardless of previous research performance. Two limitations
   associated with these studies are (1) their almost exclusive focus on
   the hard sciences, and (2) their inability to inform a theoretical
   comparison between the hard and soft sciences. This study uses data on
   new sociology Ph.D.s who obtained their first job in Ph.D.-granting
   departments between 1985 and 1992 in order to assess whether the
   stratifying mechanisms in the hiring of sociologists are similar to
   those in the hard sciences. The results are generally consistent with
   previous findings for the hard sciences and suggest that job placement
   in sociology values academic origins over performance. The two strongest
   determinants of the prestige of a first job are the prestige of the
   Ph.D.-granting department and the selectivity of the undergraduate
   institution. In contrast, the effects of predoctorate single- or
   first-authored publications and of mentor's recognition are weak, though

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I explore a set of contradictions crucial to Durkheim's work, that
   revolve around the issue of whether modern society (i.e., industrial
   capitalism) is structured according to the principle of individual
   mobility or the principle of caste. Specifically, I analyze Durkheim's
   theories of race, class, and sex to determine if they describe modern
   society in terms of individuals or in terms of castes. I find that
   Durkheim has both a dominant and a subordinate theory for each category.
   I also find that his theories of race and class differ significantly
   from his theories of sex. Durkheim's dominant theories of race and class
   and his subordinate theory of sex are theories of individuals in modern
   society. Conversely, his dominant theory of sex and his subordinate
   theories of race and class are theories of castes in modern society. I
   view Durkheim's social theory as a quintessential construction of
   modernity, and I view Durkheim as a quintessential liberal ''of sorts.''
   I conclude that the contradictions at the heart of Durkheim's social
   theory are contradictions at the heart of modern society-and at the
   heart of liberal ideology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with a recent trend toward the revival of
   the ''political culture concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly,
   Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in
   common with the original political culture concept associated with
   Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases,
   the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither
   political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central
   problem addressed in this article and one to follow I hypothesize that
   this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an
   historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual
   network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into
   Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology
   of concept formation is introduced to analyze historically and
   empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual
   network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and
   sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional
   analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual
   network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American
   citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of
   social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that
   continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.</td>

   professional socialization were studied by employing data from 309 PhD
   students in 16 graduate programs in sociology.  Using Rosenbaum's

   of social psychological integration, this study examines students'
   access to initial funding, resources in the department, indicators of
   prior ability, current professional activities, mentoring processes, and
   social psychological factors for their effects on socialization into the
   academic profession.  Access to initial funding and to mentoring have
   substantial effects on PhD students' professional socialization, but
   prove to be less than rational processes in the graduate program.  This
   socialization process is found to be based more on particularistic than
   on universalistic criteria in the allocation of departmental resources
   and mentoring.  Implications for graduate student mentoring, funding,
   and divergent career paths are highlighted.</td>

   introductory sociology textbooks and the scholarly activity of their
   respective authors.  Although all four texts use a wide array of source
   material to support their positions, we found substantial differences in
   the sources selected as noteworthy, including a heavy reliance on
   nonacademic sources such as newspapers and weekly magazines.  The use of
   popular sources was associated with the author's scholarly publication
   records:  stronger records coincided with a more scientifically grounded
   presentation of the discipline.  Despite the limitations of the standard
   introductory textbook, we view it as the best way to convey the content
   of sociology.  Also, because most students probably base their
   perceptions of sociology on the introductory course, the textbook plays
   a pivotal role:  how source materials are used to present sociology in
   introductory textbooks may affect students' perceptions about the
   utility of the discipline.</td>

   scientific study of social order.  Recently this scientific foundation
   has been attacked by both liberals and conservatives.  The attacks have
   left the discipline vulnerable both inside and outside academia.  This
   paper argues that other sciences have faced similar problems.  By
   following their example and by teaching sociology courses as laboratory
   sciences, we are most likely to legitimate the knowledge of the
   discipline and overcome public and student skepticism.  Improvements in
   computer software offer a growing number of laboratory options for
   classroom use, including surveys of students, which permit scientific
   demonstrations of social facts.  Although such surveys are not new to
   the discipline, they should be used more frequently to overcome
   students' skepticism and to motivate students to pursue independent
   social investigations.</td>
