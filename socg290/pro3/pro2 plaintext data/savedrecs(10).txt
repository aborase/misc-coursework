AB Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical
   work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative
   consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth
   outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have
   documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the
   macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with
   delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among
   adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between
   mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing
   differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for
   delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue.
   Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the
   most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes
   that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem
   behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential
   and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and
   substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both
   observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and
   delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future
   research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Peter L. Berger's work offers his readers a window into the human drama
   in all its dimension: political, economic and social. He invites his
   readers to think intensely, endlessly, and shamelessly about the doings
   of man. Through a comparative analysis of Invitation to Sociology this
   paper discusses Berger's contributions to the sciences of man in terms
   of methodological individualism, the theory of unintended consequences,
   spontaneous sociability, institutional analysis, and freedom. In so
   doing, I hope to show that Berger's work demonstrates the intellectual
   power of spontaneous order analysis and the link between the humanistic
   project in sociology and our understanding of the human condition in
   general and the freedom of the individual in society in particular.

AB Invitation to Sociology makes known that sociology is a coherent and
   value-added academic discipline. In exploring the continuing relevance
   of Invitation to Sociology, the time is ripe to reconsider sociology as
   a value-added intellectual enterprise. This paper answers this question:
   What does sociology have to offer beyond what the humanities and its
   sister social sciences already provide? This paper answers this question
   by identifying the four elements that compose the sociological
   tradition. These elements are social action; embeddedness; social
   problems; and social construction. I argue that these elements are more
   pronounced in sociology than in any other academic discipline, and hence
   contribute to the value-added character of sociology.

AB Although Berger and Luckmann do not specifically discuss the market,

   Indeed, the market is a product of social action that has an objective
   and subjective reality. Inspired by Berger and Luckmann's work, this
   paper will describe the social construction of the market. Specifically,
   it will focus on the Austrian understanding of the market. It is my
   contention that the Austrians have articulated a "sociology of the

AB To comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA (1990), many
   buildings were retrofitted to make at least one entry accessible to
   people in wheelchairs. ADA called for "full and equal enjoyment:" and as
   a civil rights act, it follows the precedent from Brown vs. The Board of
   Education that "separate is not equal." Do the retrofitted separate
   entries offer full and equal enjoyment to the older front entries? In
   answer to this question, this paper reports two studies. The first had a
   diverse sample of thirty adults evaluate the pleasantness of 29 entry
   routes (twelve main, twelve retrofitted, and, as deflectors, five
   accessible entries for new buildings). The second obtained responses to
   the same routes from a sample of 24 individuals who use a wheel chair or
   other aid to walking. The results showed that each group judged the
   retrofitted routes as less appealing than the main routes. However,
   route complexity (or length), when added to the model replaced the
   effect of route type. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the
   retrofitted entries do not provide equal enjoyment to the main entry
   routes. Better design might improve the appeal of the retrofitted entry
   experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well documented that aging is associated with cognitive declines
   in many domains. Yet it is a common lay belief that some aspects of
   thinking improve into old age. Specifically, older people are believed
   to show better competencies for reasoning about social dilemmas and
   conflicts. Moreover, the idea of aging-related gains in wisdom is
   consistent with views of the aging mind in developmental psychology.
   However, to date research has provided little evidence corroborating
   this assumption. We addressed this question in two studies, using a
   representative community sample. We asked participants to read stories
   about intergroup conflicts and interpersonal conflicts and predict how
   these conflicts would unfold. We show that relative to young and
   middle-aged people, older people make more use of higher-order reasoning
   schemes that emphasize the need for multiple perspectives, allow for
   compromise, and recognize the limits of knowledge. Our coding scheme was
   validated by a group of professional counselors and wisdom researchers.
   Social reasoning improves with age despite a decline in fluid
   intelligence. The results suggest that it might be advisable to assign
   older individuals to key social roles involving legal decisions,
   counseling, and intergroup negotiations. Furthermore, given the
   abundance of research on negative effects of aging, this study may help
   to encourage clinicians to emphasize the inherent strengths associated
   with aging.

AB Background: Alcohol consumption has important health-related
   consequences and numerous biological and social determinants.
   Objective: To explore quantitatively whether alcohol consumption
   behavior spreads from person to person in a large social network of
   friends, coworkers, siblings, spouses, and neighbors, followed for 32
   years.
   Design: Longitudinal network cohort study.
   Setting: The Framingham Heart Study.
   Participants: 12 067 persons assessed at several time points between
   1971 and 2003. Measurements: Self-reported alcohol consumption (number
   of drinks per week on average over the past year and number of days
   drinking within the past week) and social network ties, measured at each
   time point.
   Results: Clusters of drinkers and abstainers were present in the network
   at all time points, and the clusters extended to 3 degrees of
   separation. These clusters were not only due to selective formation of
   social ties among drinkers but also seem to reflect interpersonal
   influence. Changes in the alcohol consumption behavior of a person's
   social network had a statistically significant effect on that person's
   subsequent alcohol consumption behavior. The behaviors of immediate
   neighbors and coworkers were not significantly associated with a
   person's drinking behavior, but the behavior of relatives and friends
   was.
   Limitations: A nonclinical measure of alcohol consumption was used.
   Also, it is unclear whether the effects on long-term health are positive
   or negative, because alcohol has been shown to be both harmful and
   protective. Finally, not all network ties were observed.
   Conclusion: Network phenomena seem to influence alcohol consumption
   behavior. This has implications for clinical and public health
   interventions and further supports group-level interventions to reduce
   problematic drinking.

AB We show that differences in social orientation and in cognition that
   exist between cultures and social classes do not necessarily have
   counterparts in individual differences within those groups. Evidence
   comes from a large-scale study conducted with 10 measures of independent
   vs. interdependent social orientation and 10 measures of analytic vs.
   holistic cognitive style. The social measures successfully distinguish
   between interdependence (viewing oneself as embedded in relations with
   others) and independence (viewing oneself as disconnected from others)
   at the group level. However, the correlations among the measures were
   negligible. Similar results were obtained for the cognitive measures,
   for which there are no coherent individual differences despite the
   validity of the construct at the group level. We conclude that
   behavioral constructs that distinguish among groups need not be valid as
   measures of individual differences.

AB Objectives. Under an ecodevelopmental framework, we examined lifetime
   segmented assimilation trajectories (diverging assimilation pathways
   influenced by prior life conditions) and related them to quality-of-life
   indicators in a diverse sample of 258 men in the Pheonix, AZ,
   metropolitan a rea.
   Methods. We used a growth mixture model analysis of lifetime changes in
   socioeconomic status, and used acculturation to identify distinct
   lifetime segmented assimilation trajectory groups, which we compared on
   life satisfaction, exercise, and dietary behaviors. We hypothesized that
   lifetime assimilation change toward mainstream American culture (upward
   assimilation) would be associated with favorable health outcomes, and
   downward assimilation change with unfavorable health outcomes.
   Results. A growth mixture model latent class analysis identified 4
   distinct assimilation trajectory groups. In partial support of the study
   hypotheses, the extreme upward assimilation trajectory group (the most
   successful of the assimilation pathways) exhibited the highest life
   satisfaction and the lowest frequency of unhealthy food consumption.
   Conclusions. Upward segmented assimilation is associated in adulthood
   with certain positive health outcomes. This may be the first study to
   model upward and downward lifetime segmented assimilation trajectories,
   and to associate these with life satisfaction, exercise, and dietary
   behaviors. (Am J Public Health. 2010;100:669-676.

AB We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the
   mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the
   realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound
   transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the
   international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home,
   the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal
   bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show
   that World War II mobilization played an important role. First,
   Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent
   military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft
   manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing
   intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered
   significantly greater losses where both non-white population and
   aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate
   accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and
   path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years
   left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare
   reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall
   of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we
   demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies
   undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This
   intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an
   inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social
   welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and
   abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.

   criminology. This article examines the provenance of the violence around
   which Playboy's dizzying text swirls, namely, a tragicomic parricide
   seemingly twice committed. In particular, we ask: is the text plausible?
   Though Synge's authorial intentions are not open to complete
   reclamation, we explore first, his self-stated reliance on the actual
   cases of William Maley and James Lynchehaun and, second, whether the
   representation(s) of parricide in Playboy more or less accurately
   reflected the presence and character of parricide at the time the
   controversial play was being imagined and first performed in 1907. The
   culture wars and associated media frenzy over the play provide an
   ever-looming backcloth against which to interpret the meanings of
   intergenerational violence in a colonial society lurching towards
   national self-determination.

AB To date, the great majority of human paternal investment studies have
   focused on the effects that men have on their preadolescent children,
   mainly in terms of child care and provisioning. These qualifications
   limit the ways in which paternal investment is viewed, potentially
   obscuring a more complete understanding of the importance of paternal
   care. In this study, I explore how paternal investment in
   post-adolescent sons can have measurable benefits on the social and
   reproductive careers of young men. Using data from a group of Martu
   Aborigines living in Australia's Western Desert, I investigate the
   importance of fathers and other elder male relatives to the timing of
   young men's initiation, as well as how that timing correlates to future
   reproductive success. The presence of both biological fathers and father
   figures promoted an earlier age at initiation, and early age at
   initiation was found to predict both the likelihood that a young man
   currently has a child and his current number of known offspring. These
   results demonstrate that paternal investment, when construed more
   broadly, can have measurable benefits on the social and reproductive
   careers of young men.

AB To examine the importance of kin selection in shaping human societies,
   this study analyzed the kinship system practiced in traditional China
   for two millennia and teased apart its underlying genetic and other,
   presumably cultural, components. The results demonstrate that, in the
   traditional patrilineal Chinese family, both genetic relatedness and the
   cultural factor of generation were important in determining kinship
   status for male agnates (genetically related relatives). For female
   agnates, however, only genetic relatedness was important. Another
   surprising finding was that the influence of gender was not as important
   as genetic relatedness. The most interesting finding in this study,
   however, was that kin selection and culture (i.e., seniority in
   generation and age) played vastly different roles in different lineages
   in the Chinese family: for collateral (indirect) agnates, genetic
   relatedness was the most important factor in determining their kinship
   status, but for lineal (direct) agnates, its importance was overridden
   by seniority in generation and age, a cultural factor. Several other
   bio-cultural factors also explained a considerable amount of variance in
   kinship status. Since kinship profoundly affected, and was often the
   foundation of, the legal and social systems in dynastic China, kin
   selection, while its strength may differ remarkably between lineal and
   collateral relatives, could act as a selective force in Chinese families
   [Current Zoology 56 (2): 182-189,2010].

   associated with womens increasing educational attainment and
   consequential changes in their propensity to marry, in educational
   assortative mating and in labour-force participation. We find that

   significantly associated with increased odds of a lifetime diagnosis of
   panic disorder as well as a current (past-year) diagnosis of panic
   disorder. Current (past-year) marijuana use was significantly associated
   with both lifetime and current panic attacks, but not current or
   lifetime panic disorder. Results are discussed in relation to the novel

AB Recent studies have suggested that exposure to rudimentary alcohol cues
   activates mental representations of alcohol expectancies in long-term
   memory, thereby promoting expectancy-consistent behavior changes.
   However, reliance in these previous studies on self-report measures
   raises the possibility that prior findings were an artifact of
   experimental demand. The present study was aimed at ruling out this
   alternative explanation by reinvestigating the effects of alcohol
   priming on nonconsumptive behavior using an implicit measure of social
   disinhibition. In three experiments, participants were exposed to either
   alcohol or control beverage images, then asked to type as quickly as
   possible the first word that came to mind in response to a series of
   provocative (e.g., feces) and neutral (e.g., chair) stimulus words.
   Participants' response times were surreptitiously measured. Results
   revealed that participants exposed to images of alcohol, relative to
   control beverages, were faster to generate free associations to
   provocative, but not neutral, words, suggesting enhanced social
   disinhibition. This effect was limited to conditions of heightened
   evaluation, ruling out alternative explanations based on knowledge
   activation or arousal. Participants reported no suspicions regarding the
   connection between the image viewing and free association tasks nor any
   awareness that their response times had been collected. Results suggest
   that the behavioral effects of alcohol priming do not result from demand
   characteristics and offer the first evidence that exposure to
   rudimentary alcohol-related stimuli may suffice to influence social
   disinhibition in a manner akin to that expected to result from actual or
   placebo alcohol consumption.

   mixed methods within disciplines in the social/behavioral sciences.
   Research presented in this article is unique in that it examines
   prevalence rates across multiple disciplines using an established
   cross-disciplinary classification scheme. Results indicate that there
   are significant differences in the methods employed (quantitative,
   mixed, qualitative) in pure (psychology, sociology) as opposed to
   applied ( education, nursing) disciplines. The prevalence rate for mixed
   methods research is higher in applied (16%) compared with pure
   disciplines (6%). Quantitative methods and the underlying
   postpositivistic paradigm are prevalent in articles from "elite''
   journals from pure disciplines, especially psychology. Methodological
   issues are discussed, including the importance of the sampling
   procedures employed in prevalence rates studies.

AB Over the past 50 years, cognitive neuroscience has emerged as the
   dominant player in research on thought. In an effort to keep their
   voices heard, social psychologists, anthropologists, political
   scientists and even economists have joined cognitive neuroscientists in
   lively dialog. But many sociologists are stubbornly clinging to the
   sidelines, honoring - and in some cases strengthening rigid intellectual
   boundaries. Triggered by DiMaggio's (I 997) well sounded call to action,
   a distinct group of sociologists are challenging such boundaries and
   pursuing a new path. In this essay, I discuss several recent works that
   constitute a new and powerful page in cognitive sociology, and more
   broadly, in the study of culture and cognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB A growing literature in sociology examines external classification
   systems, usually implemented in the context of industries.
   Classification systems are analogous to the structure of individual
   cognition, though the specific nature of the link between these external
   classification systems and individual cognition is usually unexplored.
   This paper uses the example of the World Bank's lending classifications
   to examine the relationship between rules and classification and to
   argue that the organizational context of classification is central to
   assessing the cognitive impact of classification. The paper adds these
   results to existing work on external classification systems to provide a
   framework for understanding the range of possible relationships between
   external classification systems and the cognition of individuals. (C)

AB In this article I use a unique theoretical lens that incorporates work
   from sociology and cognitive psychology in order to address the question
   of how various forces (both institutional and internal) propel actors to
   "switch" from one role performance to another. I present data from
   in-depth interviews with 60 working parents from a variety of
   occupations to illustrate a process I call "mental weighing". Through
   mental weighing, actors sort and sift through various contextual cues
   and internal indicators to focus on (i.e., give weight to) those factors
   that are in line with the desired role performance. I itemize two
   different weighing activities: voluntary pushes and involuntary pulls.
   In describing these activities, I note the various ways that culture
   both enables and constrains the social actor. In this way, the study
   addresses the important question of what gives culture its pervasive
   influence while providing much called-for empirical evidence of
   sociocognitive practices in action. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   intersection of culture and cognition in attempting to explicitly
   formulate the cognitive underpinnings of these two approaches in terms
   of the assumptions that they make about cultural acquisition,
   transmission and externalization. Our analysis suggests that in spite of
   very important differences in emphasis and explanatory range, toolkit
   and strong practice-theoretical approaches are complementary, although
   the specific types of modal situation for which each of them is best
   suited need to be more clearly specified. We develop a framework that
   shows how the two approaches can be deployed in conjunction as well as
   specifying the modal settings and situations that each will be more
   likely to handle best as well as those in which they will run into
   trouble. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a seronegative inflammatory
   arthritis found in up to 5 to 42% of patients with psoriasis. As current
   instruments do not fully capture health-related quality of life (HR-QOL)
   in PsA from the patient's perspective, we piloted a novel application of
   "willingness-to-pay" (WTP) as a Patient Reported Outcome to measure the
   relative impact of PsA in 8 domains of HR-QOL.
   Methods: Fifty-nine PsA patients were interviewed on 8 WTP HR-QOL
   domains (physical, emotional, sleep, work, social, self-care, intimacy,
   and concentration). Participants were asked to rank the 8 domains of
   health in order of HR-QOL impact. In each domain, participants were
   asked whether PsA affected that domain, whether they were willing to pay
   for a cure in that domain, and the amount they were willing to pay.
   Median WTP amounts were compared with the proportion of participants
   affected by and willing to pay in each domain. Responses in US dollars
   were interpreted as strength of preference rather than absolute monetary
   values.
   Results: The majority of participants were white (98%), >= 45 years of
   age (70%), insured (98%), and earned >$65,000/yr (66%). The physical
   domain was most affected by PsA; intimacy and concentration were ranked
   lowest. Participants reported a wide range of WTP amounts ($0 to
   $1,000,000), and median WTP amounts were highest in the physical, work,
   sleep, and self-care domains. Related domains elicited median WTP
   amounts that were highly correlated. No significant differences in
   median WTP amounts were found across ages, genders, and income levels
   for the different domains.
   Conclusions: WTP is a novel quantitative patient-perspective measure
   that is comprehensible and feasible to administer in PsA patients. It
   represents a unique tool for capturing the complex manifestations of PsA
   and its impact on the individual, allowing the quantification of
   specific HR-QOL parameters and providing the potential for comparison
   across various disease processes in a given individual. (C) 2010

AB This is the second part of a two part article. In Part I, a social
   systems theory was applied to the analysis of hazardous technology and
   socio-technical systems, their complex dynamics, and risky dimensions
   and likelihood of accidents. It identified many of the diverse human
   risk factors associated with complex technologies and socio-technical
   systems, thus contributing knowledge toward preventing - or minimizing
   the likelihood of - accidents or catastrophes. This second part of the
   article will systematically address the broader issues of risk
   conceptions, analysis, and management in contemporary society including
   policy and other practical aspects. The social systems perspective and
   its derivations are contrasted to such impressionistic conceptions as
   those of Ulrich Beck. Section 1 of the paper introduces the topic of
   risk as a discursive concept in contemporary society. Our point of
   departure is the social system approach introduced in Part I, which is
   contrasted to that of Ulrich Beck, who eschews systematic theorizing at
   the same time that he denigrates empirical sociology. The section
   stresses that contemporary society is not so much threatened by high
   risks all around (as in Ulrich Beck’s “risk society”) but is more
   characterized by its developed risk discourses (a great deal owing to
   Beck himself), risk consciousness, risk theorizing, and risk management.
   What is truly characteristic of modern society are discretionary powers
   to determine dimensions, levels, and regulation of risk, that is,
   choices can be made whether or not to develop a technology, whether or
   not to not to tightly regulate it, for instance limiting or banning its
   use or whether or not to allow its widespread application, and under
   what conditions. Section 2 provides a brief review of our social systems
   framework, actor-system-dialectics (ASD) theory. Section 3 treats risk
   and risk analysis in a systems perspective, emphasizing the limitations
   of risk assessment and the risk management of complex, hazardous
   systems. Section 4 considers several principles which may serve to guide
   policy-making and regulation with respect to the hazards and risks of
   complex technologies and socio-technical systems. 
X4 Nuestro punto de partida es la perspectiva de sistemas sociales
   introducido en la Parte I - o sea la dinámica actor-sistema, en
   contraposición a perspectivas de tipo Ulrich Beck, que particularmente
   rechazan el teorizar sistemático a la vez que niegan valor a la
   sociología empírica. Este articulo enfatiza que la sociedad
   contemporánea (por Beck definida como “sociedad de riesgo”) es
   caracterizada tanto más por los extendidos discursos acerca del riesgo
   (curiosamente mucho de esto debido al mismo Beck) - elaboraciones
   teóricas acerca del riesgo, gestiones del riesgo, sensibilización a la
   noción de riesgo -, que por los riesgos a que efectivamente estaría
   expuesta. Lo que es verdaderamente característico de las sociedades
   modernas es el enorme poder discrecional que estas tienen para
   determinar las dimensiones, niveles y regulación del riesgo. Esto quiere
   decir que la sociedad moderna tiene la opción de desarrollar o no
   diversos tipos de tecnología y de cuan estrictamente debe la tecnología
   ser regulada, estableciendo límites y condiciones de uso, o
   prohibiéndola en su totalidad. 
Y4 O ponto de partida deste artigo é a teoria dos sistemas sociais
   apresentada na parte I, ou seja, a dinâmica actor-sistema, em
   contraposição a perspectivas como a de Ulrich Beck, que, em particular,
   rejeita o teorizar sistemático, ao mesmo tempo que denigre a sociologia
   empírica. Este artigo salienta que a sociedade contemporânea (definida
   por Beck como “sociedade de risco”) não é tão ameaçada por riscos
   elevados, sendo antes caracterizada pelos discursos generalizados de
   risco (em grande parte devido ao próprio Beck) - elaborações teóricas
   acerca do risco, formas de gestão do risco, consciência de risco. O que
   é verdadeiramente uma característica da sociedade moderna é a existência
   de poderes discricionários para determinar dimensões e níveis de risco,
   assim como medidas reguladoras. Por outras palavras, na sociedade
   moderna existe a opção de arquitetar, ou não, uma tecnologia, regulá-la
   fortemente, ou não, limitar ou banir o seu uso, permitir, ou não, a sua
   aplicação generalizada, bem como definir em que condições isso pode
   ocorrer. 
Z4 Le point de départ de cet article est la théorie des systèmes sociaux
   présentée dans la partie I, c’est-à-dire la dynamique acteur-système,
   par opposition à des perspectives telles que celles d’Ulrich Beck, qui
   rejette en particulier la théorisation systématique, tout en dénigrant
   la sociologie empirique. Cet article souligne que la société
   contemporaine (définie par Beck comme “société de risque”) n’est pas si
   menacée par des risques importants, mais plutôt caractérisée par les
   discours généralisés du risque (en grande partie à cause de Beck
   lui-même) - élaborations théoriques sur le risque, modes de gestion du
   risque, conscience du risque. Ce qui caractérise vraiment la société
   moderne c’est l’existence de pouvoirs discrétionnaires pour déterminer
   les dimensions et les niveaux de risque. Autrement dit, on a le choix de
   développer ou non une technologie, de la réguler fortement ou non, de
   limiter ou de banir son utilisation, de permettre ou non son application
   généralisée, ainsi que de définir dans quelles conditions cela doit être

AB The teaching and learning movement in sociology in general and within
   the American Sociological Association specifically has a surprisingly
   long history. This history can be divided into three periods of
   activity: early efforts (1905 to 1960), innovation and implementation
   (1960 to 1980), and the institutionalization of gains (1980 to 2009).
   Beginning in the first period, sociologists interested in teaching and
   learning focused cycles of attention on the introductory sociology
   course in higher education, high school sociology courses, and the
   formation of sections within the American Sociological Association. Hans
   Mauksch led a period of significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Many of those gains were then institutionalized under the leadership of
   Carla Howery beginning in the 1980s. Publication related to teaching and
   learning, which was once spread throughout numerous outlets has, over
   time, become focused in Teaching Sociology. This article presents an
   investigation of the past and present of the teaching and learning
   movement in sociology and offers some suggested direction for the
   movement's future.

   the multilevel approach: a newly required research seminar for graduate
   students, an approach to teaching research methods in a joint seminar of
   graduate and undergraduate students, and an approach to teaching
   undergraduate research methods that includes having graduate students
   model research techniques for undergraduates. The authors then assess
   each of these components based on course evaluations and additional data
   gathered from participants. The authors conclude with a series of
   suggestions about how this model might be expanded and developed further

   history and biography by situating the stories told by the women within
   the larger sociohistorical contexts in which they live. The article
   proceeds in four sections. The first section provides an overview of
   service learning and its benefits. This is followed by a detailed
   description of the service-learning project. In the third section, the
   author draws from a postclass survey, course evaluations, and her
   observations to illustrate the ways in which the project enhances

AB The purpose of this article is to document how a course in the
   fundamentals of sociology encouraged students to rethink negative
   impressions about people with AIDS. Multimethod, active learning
   processes were utilized to introduce the sociological imagination,
   critical thinking, and theory and methods in sociology. The intent was
   to apply basic sociological knowledge to a real-world issue, HIV/AIDS in
   a global perspective. In the process of developing basic skills in
   sociology, a consistent change was noted in students' self-reported
   impressions about people with AIDS in each of four semesters (N = 160).
   Catastrophic contagion characterized their impressions at the beginning
   of the semester; humanizing attributes (encouragement and empowerment)
   replaced catastrophic contagion at the end of the semester. Implications
   of these findings for teaching and learning, and deconstructing HIV/AIDS
   stigma, are discussed.

AB In-depth interviewing is now a common method in sociology. Although
   there are many potential benefits of in-depth interviewing assignments
   for both majors and nonmajors, few have developed tools one can use to
   teach this method at the first and second year, especially in
   substantive classes where instruction in interviewing is constrained by
   time and practical circumstances. In this note, the authors present an
   in-class exercise and tip sheet they developed to teach beginning
   undergraduates how to conduct quality in-depth interviews. Comparative
   analysis of students' preliminary and final interview guides, as well as
   the results of a student survey, support the teaching effectiveness of
   the workshop and tip sheet.

AB Current drug discovery is impossible without sophisticated modeling and
   computation. In this review we outline previous advances in
   computational biology and, by tracing the steps involved in
   pharmaceutical development, explore a range of novel, high-value
   opportunities for computational innovation in modeling the biological
   process of disease and the social process of drug discovery. These
   opportunities include text mining for new drug leads, modeling molecular
   pathways and predicting the efficacy of drug cocktails, analyzing
   genetic overlap between diseases and predicting alternative drug use.
   Computation can also be used to model research teams and innovative
   regions and to estimate the value of academy industry links for
   scientific and human benefit. Attention to these opportunities could
   promise punctuated advance and will complement the well-established
   computational work on which drug discovery currently relies.

AB Theoretical models suggest that social networks influence the evolution
   of cooperation, but to date there have been few experimental studies.
   Observational data suggest that a wide variety of behaviors may spread
   in human social networks, but subjects in such studies can choose to
   befriend people with similar behaviors, posing difficulty for causal
   inference. Here, we exploit a seminal set of laboratory experiments that
   originally showed that voluntary costly punishment can help sustain
   cooperation. In these experiments, subjects were randomly assigned to a
   sequence of different groups to play a series of single-shot public
   goods games with strangers; this feature allowed us to draw networks of
   interactions to explore how cooperative and uncooperative behaviors
   spread from person to person to person. We show that, in both an
   ordinary public goods game and in a public goods game with punishment,
   focal individuals are influenced by fellow group members' contribution
   behavior in future interactions with other individuals who were not a
   party to the initial interaction. Furthermore, this influence persists
   for multiple periods and spreads upto three degrees of separation(from
   person to person to person to person). The results suggest that each
   additional contribution a subject makes to the public good in the first
   period is tripled over the course of the experiment by other subjects
   who are directly or indirectly influenced to contribute more as a
   consequence. These results show experimentally that cooperative behavior
   cascades in human social networks.

AB Troubled sleep is a commonly cited consequence of adolescent drug use,
   but it has rarely been studied as a cause. Nor have there been any
   studies of the extent to which sleep behavior can spread in social
   networks from person to person to person. Here we map the social
   networks of 8,349 adolescents in order to study how sleep behavior
   spreads, how drug use behavior spreads, and how a friend's sleep
   behavior influences one's own drug use. We find clusters of poor sleep
   behavior and drug use that extend up to four degrees of separation (to
   one's friends' friends' friends' friends) in the social network.
   Prospective regression models show that being central in the network
   negatively influences future sleep outcomes, but not vice versa.
   Moreover, if a friend sleeps <= 7 hours, it increases the likelihood a
   person sleeps <= 7 hours by 11%. If a friend uses marijuana, it
   increases the likelihood of marijuana use by 110%. Finally, the
   likelihood that an individual uses drugs increases by 19% when a friend
   sleeps <= 7 hours, and a mediation analysis shows that 20% of this
   effect results from the spread of sleep behavior from one person to
   another. This is the first study to suggest that the spread of one
   behavior in social networks influences the spread of another. The
   results indicate that interventions should focus on healthy sleep to
   prevent drug use and targeting specific individuals may improve outcomes
   across the entire social network.

AB Aims: To review the patterns, contexts and impacts of alcohol use
   associated with commercial sex reported in the global literature.
   Methods: We identified peer-reviewed English-language articles from 1980
   to 2008 reporting alcohol consumption among female sex workers (FSWs) or
   male clients. We retrieved 70 articles describing 76 studies, in which
   64 were quantitative (52 for FSWs, 12 for male clients) and 12
   qualitative. Results: Studies increased over the past three decades,
   with geographic concentration of the research in Asia and North America.
   Alcohol use was prevalent among FSWs and clients. Integrating
   quantitative and qualitative studies, multilevel contexts of alcohol use
   in the sex work environment were identified, including workplace and
   occupation-related use, the use of alcohol to facilitate the transition
   into and practice of commercial sex among both FSWs and male clients,
   and self-medication among FSWs. Alcohol use was associated with adverse
   physical health, illicit drug use, mental health problems, and
   victimization of sexual violence, although its associations with
   HIV/sexually transmitted infections and unprotected sex among FSWs were
   inconclusive. Conclusions: Alcohol use in the context of commercial sex
   is prevalent, harmful among FSWs and male clients, but under-researched.
   Research in this area in more diverse settings and with standardized
   measures is required. The review underscores the importance of
   integrated intervention for alcohol use and related problems in
   multilevel contexts and with multiple components in order to effectively
   reduce alcohol use and its harmful effects among FSWs and their clients.

AB The authors examined the relation between individual and neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) and type 2 diabetes incidence among
   African-American women in the prospective Black Women's Health Study.
   Participants have completed mailed biennial follow-up questionnaires
   since 1995. US Census block group characteristics were used to measure
   neighborhood SES. Incidence rate ratios were estimated in clustered
   survival regression models. During 12 years of follow-up of 46,382
   participants aged 30-69 years, 3,833 new cases of type 2 diabetes
   occurred. In models that included both individual and neighborhood SES
   factors, incidence rate ratios were 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.15,
   1.43) for < 12 years of education relative to >= 17 years, 1.57 (95%
   confidence interval: 1.30, 1.90) for household income <$15,000 relative
   to >$100,000, and 1.65 (95% confidence interval: 1.46, 1.85) for lowest
   quintile of neighborhood SES relative to highest. The associations were
   attenuated after adjustment for body mass index, suggesting it is the
   key intermediate factor in the pathway between SES and diabetes. The
   association of neighborhood SES with diabetes incidence was present even
   among women who were more educated and had a higher family income.
   Efforts to reduce the alarming rate of diabetes in African-American
   women must focus on both individual lifestyle changes and structural
   changes in disadvantaged neighborhoods.

   important roles in justifying decisions about (1) how research problems
   are defined in drug development, (2) evidentiary standards used in
   testing drug "success", and (3) clinical trial methodology. As a result,
   attending to the social aims at stake in particular research contexts
   will produce more rational methodological decisions as well as more

AB This article argues that social selection pressures in recent human
   evolution were primarily responsible for the emergence of modern
   cognition. These selection pressures took three specific forms: (1)
   Increased security and stability, which reduced allostatic load on
   developing children, facilitating expanded working memory development;
   (2) increased opportunities for mother infant joint engagement, which
   created positive selection for more sophisticated forms of cognition;
   and (3) increased pressure on ritualized behavior associated with both
   mother-infant joint engagement and the construction and maintenance of
   an unprecedentedly complex adult social world. These pressures directly
   affected the development of the behavioral trait of effortful control in
   children. Effortful control is closely linked with executive functions,
   including working memory. Effortful control also shows characteristics
   that make it a prime candidate for rapidly spreading, culturally driven
   changes that were prevalent late in human evolution.

AB BACKGROUND: Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in the
   survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continue to
   exist. The authors of this report hypothesized that these differences
   result from inequities in access to care and in response to therapy.
   METHODS: Patients with HCC (n = 20,920) were identified from the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and
   patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCC (n = 4735) were
   identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database.
   Clinical and pathologic factors were compared after patients were
   stratified by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: The survival of patients with
   HCC improved over time for all racial, ethnic, and income groups (P
   <.001). Black and low income individuals had the poorest long-term
   survival (P <.001). On multivariate analysis, black race was predictive
   of the poorest survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence
   interval [CI], 1.09-1.22; P <.001), whereas Asian race was associated
   with the best survival (HR, 0.87; 9S% Cl, 0.83-0.91; P <.001). After
   liver transplantation, black patients had the worst graft survival and
   overall survival (median survival [MS], 30.5 months and 39.7 months,
   respectively; P <.001), whereas Hispanics had the best survival (MS,
   83.4 months and 86.6 months, respectively; P <.001). In a multivariate
   analysis of transplantation patients, race and ethnicity were associated
   significantly with outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Significant racial and ethnic
   disparities in the outcome of patients with HCC persist despite the
   receipt of comparable treatment. The authors concluded that further
   investigations are warranted to identify the reasons for the stark
   disparity in outcomes between black patients and Hispanic patients after
   liver transplantation for HCC. Cancer 2010;116:1367-77. (C) 2010

   descriptively compared with earlier published reports on mid century
   women's social clock projects (Helson et al. Journal of Personality and

AB Advances in urban sociology now depend on developing the temporal
   dimensions of ethnographic data. For public place behavior, the need is
   to follow people before, through, and after the sites where
   fly-on-the-wall researchers traditionally have observed them. To
   understand how people economically exploit a city's public life,
   researchers must follow market responses that discount and redistribute
   initial advantages. For explaining the formation of neighborhoods, a
   multiphase social theory is required. Drawing examples from Los Angeles,
   nine historical processes are shown to have shaped a substantively wide
   range of cases, including officially preserved, Orthodox Jewish,
   affluent totemic, low-income ethnic immigrant, and homeless service
   areas. A historical approach shows that the social character stamped
   onto a neighborhood early in its history is often effaced or reversed by
   later processes, identifies new formative processes, and locates the
   major turning point in a different period, the 1960s, than do theories
   stressing globalization and deindustrialization.

AB This article analyzes the relation between the development of religious
   institutions and neighborhood formation in the main Jewish Orthodox
   neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Melrose-La Brea neighborhood, an
   ethnically Jewish area since the 1930s, was transformed by religious
   place entrepreneurs from the East Coast in the 1970s. The emerging
   Orthodox community, however, was not principally populated by converting
   secular Jews. Instead, by developing prestigious institutions, religious
   place entrepreneurs made it into a viable destination for Orthodox Jews
   across the United States. Contrary to 'supply side' models developed in
   the sociology of religion, I then argue that institutional 'supply' may
   be successful without producing local 'religious demand'. Moving from a
   market metaphor to examine the role of far reaching networks, I contend
   that the success of religious place entrepreneurs in this case emerged
   from the relation between institutional development, the production of
   neighborhood identity, and population movements within an ethnic
   geography.

AB The epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a global phenomenon, and
   the magnitude of its increase in incidence and prevalence in low- and
   middle-income countries (LIMIC) has potentially major implications for
   those high-income countries that characterize much of the developed
   world. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the
   world and approximately 80% of all cardiovascular-related deaths occur
   in LIMIC and at a younger age in comparison to high-income countries.
   The economic impact in regard to loss of productive years of life and
   the need to divert scarce resources to tertiary care is substantial. The
   'epidemiologic transition' provides a useful framework for understanding
   changes in the patterns of disease as a result of societal and
   socioeconomic developments in different countries and regions of the
   world. A burning but as yet unanswered question is whether gains made
   over the last four decades in reducing cardiovascular mortality in
   high-income countries will be offset by changes in risk factor profiles,
   and in particular obesity and diabetes. Much of the population
   attributable risk of myocardial infarction is accountable on the basis
   of nine modifiable traditional risk factors, irrespective of geography.
   Developing societies are faced with a hostile cardiovascular
   environment, characterized by changes in diet, exercise, the effects of
   tobacco, socioeconomic stressors, and economic constraints at both the
   national and personal level in addition to exposure to potential novel
   risk factors and perhaps a genetic or programmed foetal vulnerability to
   CVD in later life. There are major challenges for primary and secondary
   prevention including lack of data, limited national resources, and the
   lack of prediction models in certain populations. There are two major
   approaches to prevention: public health/community-based strategies and
   clinic-based with a targeted approach to high-risk patients and
   combinations of these. There are concerns that in comparison with
   communicable diseases, cardiovascular and chronic diseases have a
   relatively low priority in the global health agenda and that this
   requires additional emphasis.

AB Social anthropology at INCAP evolved through a series of stages The

   nutritional research more effective. In a second phase, emerging in the
   1960s, anthropology examined the nutrition process in the population,
   especially as it was manifested in child care and feeding, lactation,
   and population growth and in the relation of economic process to
   nutritional progress. In the 1970s, anthropology once more became an
   adjunct of nutritional research Anthropological awareness was introduced
   into project planning, and field studies were undertaken by way of
   shaping the research process to work in accord with local realities In
   the 1980s and 1990s, there was a shift away from more descriptive
   research to research directed to supporting and facilitating specific
   nutrition and health behavior change.

AB Based on a 1900 census sample of 34,166 post-reproductive females (>= 45
   years), the birth month effect was put to the test, for both lifetime
   fertility as well as child survival, controlling for maternal birth
   cohort (1826-1835, 1836-1845, 1846-1855), Duncan's SEI, urbanity,
   nativity, literacy and marital duration. Testing for potential cohort
   effects did not indicate a temporal trend in fertility by maternal birth
   month (seasonal Mann-Kendall test, p=0.578), while a minute increase in
   offspring survival was detected (p<0.001, Sen's estimator of slope=0.02,
   95% CI=0.02 to 0.03). Further analyses of the maternal birth month
   effect on child survival were therefore seized. For lifetime fertility,
   ANOVA results indicated that maternal birth month was a major predictor
   for total offspring count (F(11,) (33606)= 1809.0, p<0.001), accounting
   for 37.2% of the total variability. In addition to main effects, a
   statistically significant interaction effect was observed (F(538,
   33606)=2.2, p<0.001), with a corresponding effect size of eta(2)=0.40.
   Planned contrasts revealed that birth-month-specific differences in
   fertility achieved statistical significance (F(11, 31718)=1712.9,
   p<0.001), while post-hoc multiple comparisons for literacy and nativity
   displayed an inverse relationship with fertility, which meets
   demographic expectations. Controlling for all factors of interest,
   models of cohort-specific offspring counts (independent ANOVAs for
   1826-1835: F(157, 3467)=26.3, p<0.001; 1836-1845: F(182, 10299)=75.5,
   p<0.001; 1846-1855: F(199, 19859)=137.9, p<0.001) indicated that women
   born in the first half of the year (particularly, January, February,
   April and May) achieved above-average parity, while those born in the
   latter half (namely, July, October, November and December) displayed
   markedly lower fertility averages. These monthly disparities are in line
   with previous observations and appear to be linked to seasonal optimal
   ripening of the oocyte or seasonal preovulatory over-ripeness ovopathy
   (Jongbloet, 1992).

AB Background: The relative effects of race/ethnicity and other
   sociodemographic factors, compared to those of attitudes and beliefs on
   willingness to have cancer screening, are not well understood.
   Methods: We conducted telephone interviews with 1148 adults (31% African
   American, 27% Puerto Rican American, 43% white) from 3 cities in
   mainland United States and Puerto Rico. Respondents reported their
   sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes about barriers and
   facilitators of cancer screening, and willingness to have cancer
   screening under 4 scenarios: when done in the community vs one's
   doctor's office, and whether or not one had symptoms.
   Results: Racial/ethnic minority status, age, and lower income were
   frequently associated with increased willingness to have cancer
   screening, even after including attitudes and beliefs about screening.
   Having screening nearby was important for community screening, and
   anticipation of embarrassment from screening for when there were no
   cancer symptoms. Associations varied across 4 screening scenarios, with
   the fewest predictors for screening by one's doctor when there were
   symptoms.
   Conclusions: Sociodemographic characteristics not only were related to
   willingness to have cancer screenings in almost all cases, but were
   generally much stronger factors than attitudinal barriers and
   facilitators. Cancer screening campaigns should affect attitudinal
   change where possible, but should also recognize that targeting
   screening to specific population groups may be necessary.

AB OBJECTIVE: Racial disparities in American health care outcomes are well
   documented. We investigated racial disparities in hospital mortality and
   adverse discharge disposition after brain tumor craniotomies performed
   in the United States from 1988 to 2004. We explored potential
   explanations for the disparities.
   METHODS: The data source was the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We used
   multivariate ordinal logistic regression corrected for clustering by
   hospital and adjusted for age, sex, primary payer for care, income in
   postal code of residence, geographic region, admission type and source,
   medical comorbidity, treatment year, hospital case volume, and
   disease-specific factors. Random-effects pooling was also used.
   RESULTS: A total of 99 665 craniotomies were studied. Hospital mortality
   and adverse discharge disposition (any discharge other than directly
   home) were more likely in black patients than others for all tumor
   types. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
   blacks were: hospital craniotomy mortality (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.32-2.03;
   P < .001), and adverse discharge disposition (OR, 1.43; 95% CI,
   1.31-1.56; P < .001). Medicaid patients had higher mortality, while
   private-pay patients had lower mortality. Hospital annual case volume
   was lower for black and Hispanic patients and for those with Medicaid as
   the primary payer in pooled analyses, whereas patients with private
   insurance received care at higher-volume hospitals. Black patients
   generally presented with higher disease severity, including more
   emergency or urgent admissions (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.54-1.89; P < .001);
   more hemiparesis and hemiplegia for primary tumors, meningiomas, and
   metastases (P < .04 for all); and more hydrocephalus for acoustic
   neuromas (P = .1).
   CONCLUSION: Black patients died more often or had an adverse discharge
   disposition after tumor craniotomies in the United States in the period
   studied (1988-2004). Blacks had more severe disease at presentation and
   were treated at lower-volume hospitals for surgery. Other socially
   defined patient groups also showed disparities in access and outcomes of
   care.

AB Theories of music origins and the role of musical emotions in the mind
   are reviewed. Most existing theories contradict each other, and cannot
   explain mechanisms or roles of musical emotions in workings of the mind,
   nor evolutionary reasons for music origins. Music seems to be an enigma.
   Nevertheless, a synthesis of cognitive science and mathematical models
   of the mind has been proposed describing a fundamental role of music in
   the functioning and evolution of the mind, consciousness, and cultures.
   The review considers ancient theories of music as well as contemporary
   theories advanced by leading authors in this field. It addresses one
   hypothesis that promises to unify the field and proposes a theory of
   musical origin based on a fundamental role of music in cognition and
   evolution of consciousness and culture. We consider a split in the
   vocalizations of proto-humans into two types: one less emotional and
   more concretely-semantic, evolving into language. and the other
   preserving emotional connections along with semantic ambiguity. evolving
   into music. The proposed hypothesis departs from other theories in
   considering specific mechanisms of the mind brain, which required the
   evolution of music parallel with the evolution of cultures and
   languages. Arguments are reviewed that the evolution of language toward
   becoming the semantically powerful tool of today required emancipation
   from emotional encumbrances. The opposite, no less powerful mechanisms
   required a compensatory evolution of music toward more differentiated
   and refined emotionality. The need for refined music in the process of
   cultural evolution is grounded in fundamental mechanisms of the mind.
   This is why today's human mind and cultures cannot exist without today's
   music. The reviewed hypothesis gives a basis for future analysis of why
   different evolutionary paths of languages were paralleled by different
   evolutionary paths of music. Approaches toward experimental verification
   of this hypothesis in psychological and neuroimaging research are
   reviewed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: There has been substantial research on psychosocial and
   health care determinants of health disparities in the United States (US)
   but less on the role of modifiable risk factors. We estimated the
   effects of smoking, high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose, and
   adiposity on national life expectancy and on disparities in life
   expectancy and disease-specific mortality among eight subgroups of the
   US population (the "Eight Americas") defined on the basis of race and
   the location and socioeconomic characteristics of county of residence,
   in 2005.
   Methods and Findings: We combined data from the National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System to estimate unbiased risk factor levels for the Eight Americas.
   We used data from the National Center for Health Statistics to estimate
   age-sex-disease-specific number of deaths in 2005. We used systematic
   reviews and meta-analyses of epidemiologic studies to obtain risk factor
   effect sizes for disease-specific mortality. We used epidemiologic
   methods for multiple risk factors to estimate the effects of current
   exposure to these risk factors on death rates, and life table methods to
   estimate effects on life expectancy. Asians had the lowest mean body
   mass index, fasting plasma glucose, and smoking; whites had the lowest
   systolic blood pressure (SBP). SBP was highest in blacks, especially in
   the rural South-5-7 mmHg higher than whites. The other three risk
   factors were highest in Western Native Americans, Southern low-income
   rural blacks, and/or low-income whites in Appalachia and the Mississippi
   Valley. Nationally, these four risk factors reduced life expectancy at
   birth in 2005 by an estimated 4.9 y in men and 4.1 y in women. Life
   expectancy effects were smallest in Asians (M, 4.1 y; F, 3.6 y) and
   largest in Southern rural blacks (M, 6.7 y; F, 5.7 y). Standard
   deviation of life expectancies in the Eight Americas would decline by
   0.50 y (18%) in men and 0.45 y (21%) in women if these risks had been
   reduced to optimal levels. Disparities in the probabilities of dying
   from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes at different ages would
   decline by 69%-80%; the corresponding reduction for probabilities of
   dying from cancers would be 29%-50%. Individually, smoking and high
   blood pressure had the largest effect on life expectancy disparities.
   Conclusions: Disparities in smoking, blood pressure, blood glucose, and
   adiposity explain a significant proportion of disparities in mortality
   from cardiovascular diseases and cancers, and some of the life
   expectancy disparities in the US.

   never been constant in any location, but human-induced changes
   associated with greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use are new and rapidly
   shifting conditions for rural communities and regions across the planet.
   Rural sociologists have long been carving out the contours of this topic
   through research on family well-being, rural livelihoods, community, and
   the environment. Now climate change and subsequent policy responses
   present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of
   this article is to assess lines of research and theory that consider and
   direct our understanding of the impacts of climate change, the ways it
   might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and
   communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global
   realignment. As climate-change impacts and policy responses begin to
   impinge on rural populations, the first line of resistance and
   participation will be the rural community. The distribution of rewards
   from climate-change mitigation is broad and diffuse; the distribution of
   costs, compromised livelihoods, and community disruption often is
   focused.

AB P>The effects of highways on transforming human society and promoting
   population change have been investigated in several disciplines,
   including geography, sociology, economics, and planning. Currently, the
   primary highway construction activity in the nation is highway
   expansion; however, this expansion has not been the focus of much of the
   existing literature. This research examines the role that highway
   expansion plays in the process of population change. Specifically, this
   research proposes an integrated spatial regression approach to study the
   impacts of highway expansion on population change in the 1980s and 1990s
   in Wisconsin at the minor civil division level. The integrated approach
   thoroughly considers the factors that influence population change,
   appropriately examines the spatial variations of their impacts,
   simultaneously incorporates spatial lag and spatial error dependence,
   and systematically selects the optimal neighborhood structure. The
   findings suggest that the impacts of highway expansion on population
   change differ across rural, suburban, and urban areas: There are only
   indirect effects in rural areas, both direct and indirect effects in
   suburban areas, and no statistically significant effects in urban areas.
   Overall, highway expansion serves as a facilitator of population change
   within the framework of growth pole theory and location theory.

   re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in

   contradicted by the theorizing of Florida and others. The results for
   seven socio-demographic variables show a trend toward increasing
   similarity in the majority of socio-demographic variables in all types
   of spatial units examined. However, we observe increasing heterogeneity
   in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic
   characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with
   the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data,
   suggesting that theories of social change and spatial characteristics
   may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the

AB The nature of social cognition-how we "know about" the social world-is
   one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we
   know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it.
   Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely,
   what we will call "political ideology"-that is, people's self-placement
   on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We
   focus on that understanding that is in some ways the "ur-form" of social
   cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social
   formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these
   self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the
   development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is,
   when citizens develop such a "political ideology," what does this mean,
   and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their
   subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by
   using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a
   hypothetical policy.

   especially in terms of how NASSS could expand its social network and its

AB Background and Purpose-The purpose of this study was to evaluate stroke
   patient-proxy agreement with respect to social determinants of health,
   including depression, optimism, and spirituality, and to explore
   approaches to minimize proxy-introduced bias.
   Methods-Stroke patient-proxy pairs from the Brain Attack Surveillance in
   Corpus Christi Project were interviewed (n = 34). Evaluation of
   agreement between patient-proxy pairs included calculation of intraclass
   correlation coefficients, linear regression models (ProxyResponse =
   alpha(0) + alpha(1)PatientResponse +delta, where alpha(0) = 0 and
   alpha(1) = 1 denotes no bias) and kappa statistics. Bias introduced by
   proxies was quantified with simulation studies. In the simulated data,
   we applied 4 approaches to estimate regression coefficients of stroke
   outcome social determinants of health associations when only proxy data
   were available for some patients: (1) substituting proxy responses in
   place of patient responses; (2) including an indicator variable for
   proxy use; (3) using regression calibration with external validation;
   and (4) internal validation.
   Results-Agreement was fair for depression (intraclass correlation
   coefficient, 0.41) and optimism (intraclass correlation coefficient,
   0.48) and moderate for spirituality (kappa, 0.48 to 0.53). Responses of
   proxies were a biased measure of the patients' responses for depression,
   with alpha(0) = 4.88 (CI, 2.24 to 7.52) and alpha(1) = 0.39 (CI, 0.09 to
   0.69), and for optimism, with alpha(0) = 3.82 (CI, -1.04 to 8.69) and
   alpha(1) = 0.81 (CI, 0.41 to 1.22). Regression calibration with internal
   validation was the most accurate method to correct for proxy-induced
   bias.
   Conclusion-Fair/moderate patient-proxy agreement was observed for social
   determinants of health. Stroke researchers who plan to study social
   determinants of health may consider performing validation studies so
   corrections for proxy use can be made. (Stroke. 2010;41:510-515.)

AB The discourse on climate politics so far is an expert and elitist
   discourse in which peoples, societies, citizens, workers, voters and
   their interests, views and voices are very much neglected. So, in order
   to turn climate change politics from its head onto its feet you have to
   take sociology into account. There is an important background assumption
   which shares in the general ignorance concerning environmental issues
   and, paradoxically, this is incorporated in the specialism of
   environmental sociology itself - this is the category of 'the
   environment'. If 'the environment' only includes everything which is not
   human, not social, then the concept is sociologically empty. If the
   concept includes human action and society, then it is scientifically
   mistaken and politically suicidal.

AB This study tests the specific hypothesis that the 9R/9R genotype in the
   VNTR of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) exerts a general protective
   effect against a spectrum of risky behaviors in comparison to the 10R/9R
   and 10R/10R genotypes, drawing on three-time repeated measures of risky
   behaviors in adolescence and young adulthood on about 822 non-Hispanic
   white males from the Add Health study. Our data have established two
   empirical findings. The first is a protective main effect in the DAT1
   gene against risky behaviors. The second finding is that the protective
   effect varies over age, with the effect prominent at ages when a
   behavior is illegal and the effect largely vanished at ages when the
   behavior becomes legal or more socially tolerated. Both the protective
   main effect and the gene-lifecourse interaction effect are replicated
   across a spectrum of most common risky behaviors: delinquency, variety
   of sexual partners, binge drinking, drinking quantity, smoking quantity,
   smoking frequency, marijuana use, cocaine use, other illegal drug use,
   and seatbelt non-wearing. We also compared individuals with the
   protective genotype and individuals without it in terms of age, physical
   maturity, verbal IQ, GPA, received popularity, sent popularity, church
   attendance, two biological parents, and parental education. These
   comparisons indicate that the protective effect of DAT1*9R/9R cannot be
   explained away by these background characteristics. Our work
   demonstrates how legal/social contexts can enhance or reduce a genetic
   effect on risky behaviors.

AB This paper explores the evolution of humans as social beings and the
   implications of this for economic theory and policy. A major flaw in
   Walrasian economics is the assumption of "self-regarding"
   agents-economic actors make decisions independently of social context
   and without regard to the behavior of other consumers and firms. Truly
   other-regarding behavior, such as altruism and altruistic punishment,
   cannot be fully captured in the standard economic model. Standard
   economic assumptions about human behavior make pure altruism an
   irrational "anomaly" that cannot survive the evolutionary selection
   process. However, recent findings from neuroscience, behavioral
   economics evolutionary game theory and animal behavior have paved the
   way for a realistic, science-based, and policy-relevant foundation for
   economic theory. Other-regarding emotions such as altruism, love, and
   envy are an essential part of the human experience. We use the Price
   equation, showing the feasibility of the evolution of group selection of
   altruistic preferences, to explore some of the implications of this
   phenomenon for economic theory and policy. We explore evidence that the
   human capacity for empathy evolved from primates and suggest that this
   was the precursor for human morality. We suggest that if we drop the
   assumption that fitness is equated with the consumption of market goods,
   pure altruism is no longer fitness reducing, particularly in western
   societies. We also examine individual preferences for altruism in terms
   of their effect on well being. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Nutrition scientists are showing growing interest in the
   diet patterns of preagricultural (hunter-gatherer) humans. Retrojected
   preagricultural diets are reportedly predominantly net base producing in
   contrast to the net acid-producing modern Western diets.
   Objective: We examined the dietary net acid load [net endogenous acid
   production (NEAP)] for 229 worldwide historically studied
   hunter-gatherer societies to determine how differences in
   plant-to-animal (P:A) dietary subsistence patterns and differences in
   the percentage of body fat in prey animals affect the NEAP.
   Design: With the use of 1) ethnographic data of dietary P:A ratios of
   hunter-gatherer populations, 2) established computational methods, and
   3) knowledge that fat densities of animal foods consumed by
   hunter-gatherers varied between 3% and 20%, we computed the NEAP for the
   diets of 229 populations in 4 different models of animal fat densities
   (model A, 3%; model B, 10%; model C, 15%; model D, 20%).
   Results: As P:A ratios decreased from 85:15 to 5:95, the NEAP increased
   from -178 to +181 mEq/d (model A) and from -185 to +120 mEq/d (models B
   and Q. Approximately 50% of the diets consumed by the 229 worldwide
   hunter-gatherer populations were net acid producing (models B and Q. In
   model D, 40% of the diets were net acid producing.
   Conclusions: Our data confirm that the NEAP of hunter-gatherer diets
   becomes progressively more positive as P:A ratios decline. The high
   reliance on animal-based foods of a worldwide sample of historically
   studied hunter-gatherer populations renders their diets net acid
   producing in approximate to 40-60% of subgroups of P:A ratios. Only
   further investigations can show the implications of these findings in
   determining the NEAP of human ancestral diets. Am J Clin Nutr

AB In recognition of the important role that fathers play in the lives of
   young children in Haiti, a public health organization instituted
   fathers' clubs in 1994 as a strategy to improve the health outcomes of
   children. Fathers' clubs focus on child and family health education. To
   evaluate the effectiveness of fathers' clubs, we examined the health of
   children born in Haitian villages with and without active fathers' clubs
   and compared results for the two groups. The presence of a fathers' club
   in a child's birth village had a positive effect on vaccination status,
   growth monitoring, and vitamin A supplementation after we controlled for
   socioeconomic status, time, and the quality of the village health agent.
   Child weights and mortality were not affected by the fathers' clubs. (Am

AB Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century
   U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy,
   scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds
   significance for different populations with competing political agendas
   (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of
   community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as
   naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape
   the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute
   sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of
   community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic
   political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and
   around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze
   how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might
   provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first
   explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking
   both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely
   characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary
   sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct
   or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the
   construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of
   class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race.
   Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance
   of these developments.

AB The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational
   sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30
   years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and
   develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths
   become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens
   when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as
   "accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh?
   Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide
   answers and reveal "recoupling'' processes through which institutional
   myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected
   become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling
   accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that
   teachers labeled "turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of
   the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by
   "inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities,
   social interactions, and meaning-making processes.

AB Much research has been conducted on ethnic differences in sexuality, but
   few studies have systematically assessed the importance of acculturation
   in sexual behavior. The present study assessed general differences in
   normative sexual practices in healthy Euro-American, Asian, and Hispanic
   populations, using measures of acculturation to analyze the relative
   effects of heritage and mainstream cultures within each group. A total
   of 1,419 undergraduates (67% Euro-American, 17% Hispanic, 16% Asian; 33%
   men, 67% women) completed questionnaires which assessed sexual
   experience and causal sexual behaviors. In concordance with previous
   studies, Asians reported more conservative levels of sexual experience
   and frequency of sexual behaviors, fewer lifetime partners, and later
   ages of sexual debut than Euro-American or Hispanic counterparts.
   Hispanic reported sexual experiences similar to that of Euro-Americans.
   There was a significant interaction between mainstream and heritage
   acculturation in predicting number of lifetime sexual partners in Asian
   women such that the relationship between heritage acculturation and
   casual sexual behavior was stronger at lower levels of mainstream
   acculturation. On the other hand, in Hispanic men, higher levels of
   mainstream acculturation predicted more casual sexual behavior (one-time
   sexual encounters and number of lifetime sexual partners) when heritage
   acculturation was low but less casual sexual behavior when heritage
   acculturation was high. These results suggest that, for sexual behavior,
   Hispanic men follow an "ethnogenesis" model of acculturation while Asian
   women follow an "assimilation" model of acculturation.

AB Although it has been hypothesized that culture and religion play an
   important role in sexuality, the relative roles of acculturation and

   often empirically explored. The present study assessed differences in
   sexual attitudes in Euro-American, Asian, and Hispanic American
   populations using measures of acculturation to analyze the relative
   effects of heritage and mainstream cultures, as well as religiosity,
   within each ethnic group. A total of 1,415 college students (67%
   Euro-American, 16% Hispanic, 17% Asian; 32% men, 68% women) completed
   questionnaires which assessed attitudes towards homosexuality, gender
   role traditionality, casual sex, and extramarital sex. In concordance
   with previous studies, Asians reported more conservative sexual
   attitudes than did their Hispanic and Euro-American peers. Hispanics
   reported sexual attitudes similar to that of Euro-Americans. For both
   Hispanic and Asians, higher acculturation predicted sexual attitudes
   similar to that of Euro-Americans. For Asian, Hispanic, and
   Euro-American women, there was a significant interaction between
   intrinsic religiosity and spirituality such that the relationship
   between conservativism of sexual attitudes and intrinsic religiosity was
   stronger at higher levels of spirituality. In Euro-Americans and Asians,
   intrinsic religiosity and religious fundamentalism strongly predicted
   conservative sexual attitudes; while still significant, these
   relationships were not as pronounced in the Hispanic sample, implying an
   ethnic-by-religious effect. Novel to this study, acculturation did not
   mediate the relationship between religiosity and sexual attitudes,
   indicating that ethnic differences in religiosity effects were distinct
   from acculturation.

AB Background: The safety and efficacy of paliperidone extended-release
   tablets (paliperidone ER) in patients with acute symptoms of
   schizophrenia have been described in 3 randomized, double-blind, 6-week,
   placebo-controlled, fixed-dose, Phase III clinical trials. The validity
   and reliability of the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) scale, both
   in patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia and those with
   stabilized symptoms, have also been reported.
   Objective: The aim of this work was to estimate the treatment benefit of
   paliperidone ER compared with placebo in terms of improvements in
   personal and social functioning as measured by the PSP scale in 3
   controlled clinical trials.
   Methods: Data were derived from 3 paliperidone ER multicenter Phase III
   pivotal studies of patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia. Each
   study included a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and
   active-controlled, parallel-group, 6-week treatment period with an
   open-label extension of paliperidone ER treatment. Patients were
   randomized to receive paliperidone ER, olanzapine 10 mg, or placebo once
   daily. Paliperidone ER doses were 3, 9, and 15 mg/d in 1. study; 6,9,
   and 12 mg/d in another; and 6 and 12 mg/d in the third. Collectively,
   1306 intent-to-treat patients received placebo or paliperidone ER in
   these 3 trials. Most (61.7%) were white; 21.6% were black, 8.8% were
   Asian, and 7.9% were of another race. The mean age ranged from 36.3 to
   39.4 years across treatment groups. Multiple analyses were applied to
   PSP data (for which higher scores indicate better personal and social
   functioning) from these paliperidone ER studies: between-group minimum
   important difference (MID) estimates; responder analyses; between-group
   cumulative frequency comparisons of PSP change from baseline to end
   point; and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) estimates.
   Results: Standardized differences and effect sizes between paliperidone
   ER and placebo in PSP mean change from baseline to end point ranged from
   0.52 to 0.85 for all paliperidone ER doses. Observed between-group
   differences (paliperidone ER minus placebo) in PSP mean change from
   baseline to end point exceeded the between-group MID of 7 points at all
   paliperidone ER doses. The percentage of patients achieving at least one
   10-point category improvement in the PSP was higher with all
   paliperidone ER doses (range, 49.6%-63.6%) than placebo (33.1%) (P <
   0.005). Across the distribution of all possible PSP scores, the
   percentage of patients achieving any level of change appeared to be
   greater for paliperidone ER than for placebo at all doses. Derived NNTs
   for improved personal and social functioning based or paliperidone ER
   trials ranged from 3.3 to 6.1. The improvement in personal and social
   functioning achieved by patients receiving paliperidone ER during the
   double-blind studies was maintained throughout the 52-week, open-label
   extension studies, as assessed using multiple definitions of response;
   subjects in the placebo arm during double-blind treatment appeared to
   achieve and maintain improved functioning when switched to paliperidone
   ER for the extension studies.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that paliperidone ER had a meaningful
   treatment benefit with respect to improving personal and social
   functioning in these patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB We report quantitative estimates of intergenerational transmission and
   population-wide inequality for wealth measures in a set of
   hunter-gatherer populations. Wealth is defined broadly as factors that
   contribute to individual or household well-being, ranging from embodied
   forms, such as weight and hunting success, to material forms, such as
   household goods, as well as relational wealth in exchange partners.
   Intergenerational wealth transmission is low to moderate in these
   populations but is still expected to have measurable influence on an
   individual's life chances. Wealth inequality (measured with Gini
   coefficients) is moderate for most wealth types, matching what
   qualitative ethnographic research has generally indicated (if not the
   stereotype of hunter-gatherers as extreme egalitarians). We discuss some
   plausible mechanisms for these patterns and suggest ways in which future
   research could resolve questions about the role of wealth in
   hunter-gatherer social and economic life.

AB Pastoralist societies are often portrayed as economically egalitarian,
   reflecting the volatile nature of livestock herds and the existence of
   multiple institutions that allow for the redistribution of wealth as a
   form of insurance. Motivated by an interest in the role of
   intergenerational transmission in structuring persistent inequality, we
   examine the extent of intergenerational transmission of material wealth
   (four measures) and embodied wealth (one measure) for four pastoral
   populations from different parts of the world (East Africa, West Africa,
   and southwest Asia). We find substantial levels of intergenerational
   transmission and marked economic inequality. We argue that the high
   correspondence between the material wealth of parents and offspring
   reflects the importance of the family in the transmission of wealth
   through bequests, positive assortment by wealth in the domains of
   marriage and herd management, and positive returns to scale as might
   occur when raising or defending large herds. We conclude that the
   analysis of intergenerational transmission provides new insights into
   the much-debated extent of egalitarianism among pastoralists.

AB We present empirical measures of wealth inequality and its
   intergenerational transmission among four horticulturalist populations.
   Wealth is construed broadly as embodied somatic and neural capital,
   including body size, fertility and cultural knowledge, material capital
   such as land and household wealth, and relational capital in the form of
   coalitional support and field labor. Wealth inequality is moderate for
   most forms of wealth, and intergenerational wealth transmission is low
   for material resources and moderate for embodied and relational wealth.
   Our analysis suggests that domestication alone does not transform social
   structure; rather, the presence of scarce, defensible resources may be
   required before inequality and wealth transmission patterns resemble the
   familiar pattern in more complex societies. Land ownership based on
   usufruct and low-intensity cultivation, especially in the context of
   other economic activities such as hunting and fishing, is associated
   with more egalitarian wealth distributions as found among
   hunter-gatherers.

AB This paper uses data from eight past and present societies practicing
   intensive agriculture to measure the transmission of wealth across
   generations in preindustrial agricultural societies. Focusing on
   embodied, material, and relational forms of wealth, we compare levels of
   wealth between parents and children to estimate how effectively wealth
   is transmitted from one generation to the next and how inequality in one
   generation impacts inequality in the next generation. We find that
   material wealth is by far the most important, unequally distributed, and
   highly transmitted form of wealth in these societies, while embodied and
   relational forms of wealth show much weaker importance and transmission.
   We conclude that the unique characteristics of material wealth, and
   especially wealth in land, are key to the high and persistent levels of
   inequality seen in societies practicing intensive agriculture. We
   explore the implications of our findings for the evolution of inequality
   in the course of human history and suggest that it is the
   intensification of agriculture and the accompanying transformation of
   land into a form of heritable wealth that may allow for the social
   complexity long associated with agricultural societies.

AB Premodern human societies differ greatly in socioeconomic inequality.
   Despite much useful theorizing on the causes of these differences,
   individual-level quantitative data on wealth inequality is lacking. The
   papers in this special section provide the first comparable estimates of
   intergenerational wealth transmission and inequality in premodern
   societies, with data on more than 40 measures of embodied, material, and
   relational wealth from 21 premodern societies representing four
   production systems (hunter-gatherers, horticulturalists, pastoralists,
   and agriculturalists). Key findings include (1) the importance of
   material, embodied, and relational wealth differs significantly across
   production systems, with material wealth more important in pastoral and
   agricultural systems; (2) the degree of wealth transmission from parent
   to offspring is markedly higher for material wealth than embodied and
   relational wealth; (3) aggregate wealth is transmitted to a higher
   degree among pastoralists and agriculturalists; (4) the degree of
   inequality is greater for material wealth; and (5) the degree of
   intergenerational transmission of wealth is correlated with wealth
   inequality. Surprisingly, horticulturalists exhibit no greater wealth
   inequality or intergenerational wealth transmission than do
   hunter-gatherers, while pastoralists are very similar to
   agriculturalists. We discuss how these trends may have favored the
   emergence of institutionalized inequality, as intensified forms of
   production made material wealth transmission increasingly important.

AB Max Weber famously wrote that world images determine the tracks along
   which societies move. This article examines the relation between world
   images and the so-called tracks of society, which in this metaphor
   resemble the current concept of institution. This concept is now
   associated with the 'new institutionalisms' in social science and has no
   connection to the civilizational level of analysis that Weber used. This
   article reexamines Weber's usage of the terms and employs the terms to
   analyze differences in the principles of legitimacy between those
   emerging in the West and those in China, differences that Weber himself
   did not recognize.

   greater health problems in childhood but also aspects of their
   socioeconomic status become biologically incorporated through both
   critical periods of development and cumulative effects, leading to poor
   health outcomes as adults. We explore 3 main influences related to
   child's socioeconomic status that impact long-term health: the material
   environment, the social environment, and the structural or community

AB BACKGROUND: Minority women are more likely than white women to choose
   tubal sterilization as a contraceptive method. Disparities in rates of
   unintended pregnancy may help explain observed racial/ethnic differences
   in sterilization, but this association has not been investigated.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations among race/ethnicity, unintended
   pregnancy, and tubal sterilization.
   DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analysis of data from a
   nationally representative sample of women aged 15-44 years [65.7% white,
   14.8% Hispanic, and 13.9% African American (AA)] who participated in the
   2002 National Survey of Family Growth.
   MAIN MEASURES: race/ethnicity, history of unintended pregnancy, and
   tubal sterilization. A logistic regression model was used to estimate
   the effect of race/ethnicity on unintended pregnancy while adjusting for
   socio-demographic variables. A series of logistic regression models was
   then used to examine the role of unintended pregnancy as a confounder
   for the relationship between race/ethnicity and sterilization.
   KEY RESULTS: Overall, 40% of white. 48% of Hispanic, and 59% of AA women
   reported a history of unintended pregnancy. After adjusting for
   socio-demographic variables, AA women were more likely (OR: 2.0; 95% CI:
   1.6-2.4) and Hispanic women as likely (OR: 1.0: 95% CI: 0.80-1.2) as
   white women to report unintended pregnancy. Sterilization was reported
   by 29% of women who had ever had an unintended pregnancy compared to 7%
   of women who reported never having an unintended pregnancy. In
   unadjusted analysis, AA and Hispanic women had significantly higher odds
   of undergoing sterilization (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.9 and OR: 1.4: 95%
   CI: 1.2-1.7, respectively). After adjusting for unintended pregnancy,
   this relationship was attenuated and no longer significant (OR: 1.2: 95%
   CI: 0.95-1.4 for AA women and OR: 1.3:95% CI: 1.0-1.6 for Hispanic
   women).
   CONCLUSION: Minority women, who more frequently experience unintended
   pregnancy, may choose tubal sterilization in response to prior
   experiences with an unintended pregnancy.

AB Objective Both the size and diversity of an individual's social network
   are strongly and prospectively linked with cardiovascular morbidity and
   mortality. Social relationships may influence cardiovascular outcomes,
   at least in part, via their impact on physiologic pathways influenced by
   stress, such as daytime blood pressure (BP) levels. However, scant
   research has examined whether social relationships influence key
   nocturnal pathways, such as nocturnal BP dipping.
   Methods The current study examined the degree to which social
   integration, as measured by participants' reported engagement in a range
   of different types of social relationships, and the frequency of daily
   social contacts influence the ratio of night/day mean arterial pressure
   (MAP) in a community sample of African-American and white men and women
   (N = 224). In addition, we examined the degree to which observed
   associations persisted after statistical adjustment for factors known to
   covary with nocturnal BP, including objective measures of sleep,
   catecholamines, health behaviors, and comorbidities.
   Results In fully adjusted models, there was a significant association
   between both social integration and frequency of social contacts and the
   ratio of night/day MAP, indicating that socially isolated individuals
   were more likely to have blunted nocturnal BP-dipping profiles. There
   was also a significant interaction between social contact frequency and
   ethnicity, suggesting that the benefits of social relationships were
   particularly evident in African-Americans.
   Conclusions These findings contribute to our understanding of how social
   integration or conversely, social isolation, influences cardiovascular
   risk. J Hypertens 28: 265- 271 (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health |

AB Patients with HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell
   carcinoma (HNSCC) are significantly different with regard to
   sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics that clinicians may use
   to assume tumor HPV status.
   Machine learning methods were used to evaluate the predictive value of
   patient characteristics and laboratory biomarkers of HPV exposure for a
   diagnosis of HPV16-positive HNSCC compared to in situ hybridization, the
   current gold-standard.
   Models that used a combination of demographic characteristics such as
   age, tobacco use, gender, and race had only moderate predictive value
   for tumor HPV status among all patients with HNSCC (positive predictive
   value [PPV] = 75%, negative predictive value [NPV] = 68%) or when
   limited to oropharynx cancer patients (PPV = 55%, NPV = 65%) and thus
   included a sizeable number of false positive and false negative
   predictions. Prediction was not improved by the addition of other
   demographic or behavioral factors (sexual behavior, income, education)
   or biomarkers of HPV16 exposure (L1, E6/7 antibodies or DNA in oral
   exfoliated cells).
   Patient demographic and behavioral characteristics as well as HPV
   biomarkers are not an accurate substitute for clinical testing of tumor
   HPV status. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The fashion modeling industry has long been criticized for using
   excessively thin and exclusively Anglo-looking models in advertising and
   runway shows. How do fashion producers make decisions to hire models,
   and why is the fashion model aesthetic defined so narrowly? Based on
   participant observation and interviews with modeling agents and clients
   in New York and London, the current study explains how producers in the
   modeling industry weigh their decisions on two publicly polemical
   issues: slenderness and racial exclusion. As workers in cultural
   production, agents and clients face intense market uncertainty when
   selecting models. In the absence of objective standards, they rely on
   conventions, imitation, and stereotypes to guide their decisions.
   Producers hire fashion models to articulate market-specific versions of
   femininity. In the commercial market, they emphasize demographics,
   racial inclusion, sex appeal and attainable beauty; in the high-end
   editorial market, they seek distinction, sexual unavailability and
   rarefied beauty. As cultural producers, agents and clients ultimately
   reproduce culture by fashioning femininity along race and class lines.

AB Tests of the racial threat hypothesis, linking the racial composition of
   place to various measures of social control, find that where there are
   greater percentages of blacks, more punitive criminal justice policies
   are implemented. Just as the criminal justice system continues to get
   tougher on crime despite stagnant crime rates, it is also clear that
   schools are becoming harsher toward student misbehavior and delinquency
   despite decreases in these school-based occurrences. However, only a
   very limited number of studies have been able to partially explain this
   trend of intensifying social control in schools. Using a national sample
   of 294 public schools, the present study is the first to test the racial
   threat hypothesis within schools to determine if tire racial composition
   of students predicts greater use of punitive controls, regardless of
   levels of misbehavior and delinquency. Results of multivariate analyses
   support the racial threat perspective, finding that schools with a
   larger percentage of black students are not only more likely to use
   punitive disciplinary responses, but also more likely to use extremely
   punitive discipline and to implement zero tolerance policies. They also
   use fewer mild disciplinary practices and restitutive techniques: In
   addition, racial threat is more influential when school delinquency and
   disorder are lower.

   then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core
   sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of
   Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in
   many academic fields, especially health research and education;
   Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of
   politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion
   dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing
   surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates,
   increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and
   the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is
   increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative
   data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations,
   Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent
   and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet
   surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data,
   and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of
   participation in stigmatized Internet research and actively engage in
   the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the
   utility and validity of Internet-based data collection.

AB In this article the authors draw attention to the most recent and

   developments in life course sociology as the starting point, the authors
   detail the complementary strength in sequence analysis in this field.
   They argue that recent advantages of sequence analysis were developed in
   response to criticism of the original work, particularly optimal
   matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and
   culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods & Research. The
   debate triggered a "second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new
   technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors
   bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected
   advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually
   contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in
   less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling
   the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that "anybody who
   believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to
   social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much

AB This special monograph issue builds on sociology of health and illness
   scholarship and expands the analytical lens to examine how old people,
   healthcare professionals, and technology designers create, use, and
   modify science and technology to negotiate and define health and
   illness. Far from passive consumers, elders are technogenarians,
   creatively utilising and adapting technological artefacts such as
   walking aids and medications to fit their needs. This publication adds
   theoretical and empirical depth to our understanding of the multiple and
   overlapping socio-historical contexts surrounding ageing bodies and
   ageing enterprises, including the biomedicalisation of ageing that
   includes the rise of anti-ageing or longevity medicine; and the rise of
   gerontechnology industries and professions -- fields that largely accept
   the ageing body as a given. This collection sociologically investigates
   how and where these two trends overlap and diverge in relation to a
   global context of ageing and ageism, and calls for further scholarship
   in this area. Combining science and technology studies and sociology of
   health and illness frameworks together provides an empirical basis from
   which to analyse technogenarians in action, as well as the stakeholders
   and institutions involved in the ageing, health, and technology matrix.

   susceptibility to infectious agents or diets have evolved and are being
   discovered with modern methods. Some of these evolutionary relations
   require a perspective of tens of thousands of years, whereas other
   changes are observable in real time. The implications and applications
   of evolutionary understanding are important to our current programs and

AB Background: Languages differ greatly both in their syntactic and
   morphological systems and in the social environments in which they
   exist. We challenge the view that language grammars are unrelated to
   social environments in which they are learned and used.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a statistical analysis of
   >2,000 languages using a combination of demographic sources and the
   World Atlas of Language Structures-a database of structural language
   properties. We found strong relationships between linguistic factors
   related to morphological complexity, and demographic/socio-historical
   factors such as the number of language users, geographic spread, and
   degree of language contact. The analyses suggest that languages spoken
   by large groups have simpler inflectional morphology than languages
   spoken by smaller groups as measured on a variety of factors such as
   case systems and complexity of conjugations. Additionally, languages
   spoken by large groups are much more likely to use lexical strategies in
   place of inflectional morphology to encode evidentiality, negation,
   aspect, and possession. Our findings indicate that just as biological
   organisms are shaped by ecological niches, language structures appear to
   adapt to the environment (niche) in which they are being learned and
   used. As adults learn a language, features that are difficult for them
   to acquire, are less likely to be passed on to subsequent learners.
   Languages used for communication in large groups that include adult
   learners appear to have been subjected to such selection. Conversely,
   the morphological complexity common to languages used in small groups
   increases redundancy which may facilitate language learning by infants.
   Conclusions/ Significance: We hypothesize that language structures are
   subjected to different evolutionary pressures in different social
   environments. Just as biological organisms are shaped by ecological
   niches, language structures appear to adapt to the environment (niche)
   in which they are being learned and used. The proposed Linguistic Niche
   Hypothesis has implications for answering the broad question of why
   languages differ in the way they do and makes empirical predictions
   regarding language acquisition capacities of children versus adults.

   substance use, and reported substance use/intentions to use were
   examined in a study of low income, urban, high school freshmen from
   American ethnic minority groups. Regression analyses showed evidence for
   two mediators. The relationship between a tendency to depend upon
   parents to cope with problems and increased substance use was mediated
   by lowered perceptions of harm from use. The relationship between a
   tendency to use substances to cope with problems and increased substance
   use was mediated by increased tolerance for and use by friends. (C) 2009

AB To address the lack of research examining within-person processes
   associated with the maintenance of abstinence from substance use, this
   study examines both associations between negative affect and social
   experiences and same-day levels of substance use cravings among college
   students in 'Twelve-Step' substance abuse recovery and the role of
   coping strategies in moderating these within-day associations. The
   sample consisted of 1222 end-of-day reports made by 55 recovering
   college students, 39 males and 16 females. Findings include that daily
   cravings were predicted by same-day negative affect and each of four
   negative social experiences. Moreover, each of these within-day
   associations was moderated by individuals' levels of avoidance coping.
   In contrast, problem-solving coping only moderated the associations
   between negative affect and cravings. These findings document a
   within-day mechanism through which coping strategies, especially
   avoidance coping, may influence daily variation in cravings and in turn
   affect abstinence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This chapter addresses the issue of how special collective ritual events
   operate and influence actors' emotional states and commitment to a
   group. It is argued that in such events (e.g., rallies, holiday
   celebrations, and religious ceremonies) the greater the emotional
   intensity experienced by persons, the greater will be their commitment
   to and solidarity within the group. A model is proposed, which
   identifies several factors involved in such a process. The model builds
   on a body of theory and research, "structural ritualization theory
   (SRT)," which focuses on the role symbolic rituals play in social
   interaction and the generation and transformation of social structure.
   Four factors play a crucial role in the model: focus of attention,
   interactional pace, interdependence, and resources. Several of these
   factors also involve subcomponents that are identified and discussed.
   Attention is directed to how the formulation presented here is
   influenced by, and differs in certain ways from, classic and
   contemporary analysts including those working in the areas of social
   psychology and the sociology of emotions. Various examples are provided
   to illustrate the ability of the model to understand collective ritual
   events. Directions for further theory development and possible research
   investigating the arguments of the theory are also discussed.

   social-network specific interactions and norms. Primary motivations for
   visiting female sex workers included peer pressure, stress reduction,
   and fulfilling a need for an intimate and emotional support. Male
   clients' decisions about condom use were influenced by their perceived

AB In many settings worldwide, HIV-positive individuals have experienced a
   significant level of stigma and discrimination. This discrimination may
   also impact other family members affected by the disease, including
   children. The aim of our study was to identify factors associated with
   stigma and/or discrimination among HIV-affected youth and their
   HIV-positive caregivers in central Haiti. Recruitment of HIV-positive
   patients with children aged 10-17 years was conducted in 2006-2007. Data
   on HIV-related stigma and/or discrimination were based on interviews
   with 451 youth and 292 caregivers. Thirty-two percent of caregivers
   reported that children were discriminated against because of HIV/AIDS.
   Commune of residence was associated with discrimination against children
   affected by HIV/AIDS and HIV-related stigma among HIV-positive
   caregivers, suggesting variability across communities. Multivariable
   regression models showed that lacking social support, being an orphan,
   and caregiver HIV-related stigma were associated with discrimination in
   HIV-affected children. Caregiver HIV-related stigma demonstrated a
   strong association with depressive symptoms. The results could inform
   strategies for potential interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma and
   discrimination. These may include increasing social and caregiver
   support of children affected by HIV, enhancing support of caregivers to
   reduce burden of depressive symptoms, and promoting reduction of
   HIV-related stigma and discrimination at the community-level.

   self-management (N=1217), this study examined the prevalence,
   correlates, and characteristics (intensity, distress, and impact) of
   depressive symptoms, and the self-care strategies used to manage those
   symptoms in PLHAs in five countries. The proportion of respondents from
   each country in the total sample reporting depressive symptoms in the
   past week varied and included Colombia (44%), Norway (66%), Puerto Rico
   (57%), Taiwan (35%), and the USA (56%). Fifty-four percent (n=655) of
   the total sample reported experiencing depressive symptoms in the past
   week, with a mean of 4.1 (SD 2.1) days of depression. Mean depression
   intensity 5.4 (SD 2.7), distressfulness 5.5 (SD 2.86), and impact 5.5
   (SD 3.0) were rated on a 1-10 scale. The mean Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies Depression Scale score for those reporting depressive symptoms
   was 27 (SD 11; range 3-58), and varied significantly by country.
   Respondents identified 19 self-care behaviors for depressive symptoms,
   which fell into six categories: complementary therapies, talking to
   others, distraction techniques, physical activity, medications, and
   denial/avoidant coping. The most frequently used strategies varied by
   country. In the US sample, 33% of the variance in depressive symptoms
   was predicted by the combination of education, HIV symptoms,
   psychological and social support, and perceived consequences of HIV
   disease.

   to measure HIV-related felt stigma in a group of People living with
   HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Puerto Rico. The researchers conducted a two-phase
   cross-sectional study with 216 participants (60, first phase; 156,
   second phase). The first phase consisted of the cultural adaptation of
   the scale; the second evaluated its psychometric properties. After
   conducting a factor analysis, a 17-item scale, the HIV Felt-Stigma Scale
   (HFSS), resulted. Participants completed the Puerto Rico Comprehensive
   Center for the Study of Health Disparities Socio-demographic
   Questionnaire, the HFSS, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the
   Sexual Abuse dimension of the History of Abuse Questionnaire; the case
   managers completed the Case Manager Stigma Guide with subjects. The HFSS
   measures four dimensions: personalized stigma, disclosure concerns,
   negative self-image, and concern with public attitudes. The alpha and
   Pearson correlation coefficients (0.91 and 0.68, respectively) indicated
   satisfactory validity and reliability; the scale suggested adequate
   convergent validity. The HFSS is a culturally sensitive instrument that
   fills the existing gap in the measurement of felt stigma in
   Spanish-speaking PLWHA.

   Policies and guidelines that rely on arbitrary value limits for

AB Detection of deception and confirmation of truth telling with
   conventional polygraphy raised a host of technical and ethical issues.
   Recently, newer methods of recording electromagnetic signals from the
   brain show promise in permitting the detection of deception or truth
   telling. Some are even being promoted as more accurate than conventional
   polygraphy. While the new technologies raise issues of personal privacy,
   acceptable forensic application, and other social issues, the focus of
   this paper is the technical limitations of the developing technology.
   Those limitations include the measurement validity of the new
   technologies, which remains largely unknown. Another set of questions
   pertains to the psychological paradigms used to model or constrain the
   target behavior. Finally, there is little standardization in the field,
   and the vulnerability of the techniques to countermeasures is unknown.
   Premature application of these technologies outside of research settings
   should be resisted, and the social conversation about the appropriate
   parameters of its civil, forensic, and security use should begin.

AB Background: Injection drug is the second most frequent HIV/AIDS exposure
   in the United States. Social support and depression may mediate risky
   behaviors among drug injectors. Objectives: To describe differences in
   perceived social support and depressive symptoms between male and female
   injection drug users, and to describe factors associated with depressive
   symptoms. Methods: Using respondent-driven sampling, we recruited and
   interviewed injection drug users in Houston, Texas. Data were from the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National HIV Behavioral
   Surveillance Program. We used the short Center for Epidemiologic Studies
   Depression Scale (CES-D 10) and scales for perceived social support from
   family, friends, and significant others from the Multidimensional Scale
   of Perceived Social Support. Four-hundred seventy-one participants had
   complete data and were included in this analysis. Results: Seventy-five
   percent of male and female participants had CES-D scores indicating
   depressive symptoms. In a multivariate logistic regression, depressive
   symptoms among men were positively associated with frequent use of
   speedballs (injecting heroin and cocaine together) and never having
   tested for HIV, and negatively associated with perceived social support
   from a special person. Among women, depressive symptoms were positively
   associated with currently smoking cigarettes, having no health
   insurance, and more years of injection drug use, and negatively
   associated with perceived social support from a special person.
   Conclusions: Lack of social support from a special person or significant
   other was associated with depressive symptoms in both males and females.
   Our findings suggest that depression and social support should be
   addressed when developing HIV prevention programs among injection drug
   users.

AB In this note, we highlight an important consideration of Larry Moss's
   life's work, the continual struggle within economics against racism.
   Larry initiated and supported the symposium on eugenics published by the
   American Journal of Economics and Sociology in July 2005. He edited the
   volume Social Inequality, Analytical Egalitarianism and the March Toward
   Eugenic Explanations in the Social Sciences in August 2008. These
   constitute obvious signs of Larry's concern.
   He conjectured that the Trinity College Dublin political economists who
   held the Whately professorship should be thought of as a school. Such a
   school was in fact identified in 1850 by an outsider who pointed to
   their shared opposition to racial explanations within an institutional
   setting. That shared opposition allowed them to speak against the narrow
   interests of the rulers of the country. Of course, other political
   economists of the time, Mill in particular, were also emphatic in their
   anti-racism. Thus, not only do we need to take up Larry's challenge to
   describe the Trinity College school but we must also seek its
   connections with the Scottish-English group of anti-racists.

AB The authors assessed the extent to which socioeconomic status (SES) and
   the personality factors termed the "big 5" (neuroticism, extraversion,
   openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness) represented
   confounded or independent risks for all-cause mortality over a 10-year
   follow-up in the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) cohort
   between 1995 and 2004. Adjusted for demographics, the 25th versus 75th
   percentile of SES was associated with an odds ratio of 1.43 (95%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.11, 1.83). Demographic-adjusted odds ratios
   for the 75th versus 25th percentile of neuroticism were 1.38 (95% CI:
   1.10, 1.73) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.84) for conscientiousness, the
   latter evaluated at high levels of agreeableness. Modest associations
   were observed between SES and the big 5. Adjusting each for the other
   revealed that personality explained roughly 20% of the SES gradient in
   mortality, while SES explained 8% of personality risk. Portions of SES
   and personality risk were explained by health behaviors, although some
   residual risk remained unexplained. Personality appears to explain some
   between-SES strata differences in mortality risk, as well as some
   individual risk heterogeneity within SES strata. Findings suggest that
   both sociostructural inequalities and individual disposition hold public
   health implications. Future research and prevention aimed at
   ameliorating SES health disparities may benefit from considering the
   risk clustering of social disadvantage and dispositional factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify factors associated with high antenatal
   psychosocial stress and describe the course of psychosocial stress
   during pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from an
   ongoing registry. Study participants were 1522 women receiving prenatal
   care at a university obstetric clinic from January 2004 through March
   2008. Multiple logistic regression identified factors associated with
   high stress as measured by the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile stress
   scale.
   RESULTS: The majority of participants reported antenatal psychosocial
   stress (78% low-moderate, 6% high). Depression (odds ratios [OR], 9.6;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-17.0), panic disorder (OR, 6.8; 95%
   CI, 2.9-16.2), drug use (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-12.5), domestic violence
   (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.3), and having >= 2 medical comorbidities (OR,
   3.1; 95% CI, 1.8-5.5) were significantly associated with high
   psychosocial stress. For women who screened twice during pregnancy, mean
   stress scores declined during pregnancy (14.8 +/- 3.9 vs 14.2 +/- 3.8; P
   < .001).
   CONCLUSION: Antenatal psychosocial stress is common, and high levels are
   associated with maternal factors known to contribute to poor pregnancy
   outcomes.

AB Background: Similar to the well-documented racial inequities in health
   status, disease burden, healthcare access, and hospitalization, studies
   have generally found higher rates of hospitalization resulting from
   ambulatory care-sensitive conditions for blacks compared to whites.
   Beyond identifying disparity in rates of disease or risks of
   hospitalization, identifying disparity in age at hospitalization may
   provide deeper insight into the social and economic effects of
   disparities on individuals, families, and communities.
   Purpose: The objective of this paper is to evaluate potential racial
   disparities in age of preventable hospitalizations as measured by
   ambulatory care-sensitive conditions.
   Methods: Differences in mean age at hospitalization for ambulatory
   care-sensitive conditions were evaluated in a nationally representative
   sample of 6815 hospital discharges using the 2005 National Hospital
   Discharge Survey. Linear regression using robust SE procedures was used
   to evaluate differences among nine chronic and three acute conditions.
   Analyses were conducted in 2008.
   Results: After adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, blacks
   were hospitalized >= 5 years earlier than whites across all conditions
   combined and for chronic and acute conditions separately. The largest
   differences were seen for uncontrolled diabetes (adjusted difference=
   -12.0 years) and bacterial pneumonia (adjusted difference= -7.5 years).
   Conclusions: Racial disparities in age at preventable hospitalization
   exist across a spectrum of conditions. This difference in age at
   hospitalization places an undue burden on individuals, families, and
   society with long-term health and financial sequelae. Promoting equity
   in disease prevention, management, and treatment should be a priority of
   any healthcare reform efforts. (Am J Prev Med 2010;38(1):54-60) (C) 2010

AB Low family socioeconomic position is a net of related conditions-low
   income, material deprivation, single-parent family structure, low
   educational level, minority ethnic group membership, and immigrant
   status. According to ecological theory, proximal contexts experienced by
   children, including family, material resources, out-of-school
   experiences, schools, neighborhoods, and peers, are mediators of poverty
   effects. Developmental timing of exposure to poverty conditions and the
   processes by which effects occur differ for cognitive and social domains
   of development. Understanding how contexts combine and interact is as
   important as understanding their independent influences. Effects may be
   cumulative, but advantages in one context can also ameliorate
   disadvantages in others. Although research is typically based on
   unidirectional causal models, the relations between the developing child
   and the contexts he or she experiences are reciprocal and transactional.
   Finally, although income inequality has increased greatly, little is
   known about the influences of relative poverty and social inequality on
   human development.

AB Standards and standardization aim to render the world equivalent across
   cultures, time, and geography. Standards are ubiquitous but
   underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in
   modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works.
   Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse
   theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the
   emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of
   making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple
   outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with
   totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for
   careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences
   of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.

AB This review suggests that the sociology of intellectuals is being
   converted into a sociology of interventions, i.e., instead of focusing
   on a certain social type, it analyzes the movement by which knowledge
   and expertise are mobilized to inform a value-laden intervention in the
   public sphere. We first demonstrate that the classical sociology of
   intellectuals was centered on a problematic of allegiance that no longer
   seems productive. In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular
   social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into
   the public sphere. We then review two literatures that distance
   themselves from the classical problematic and that could be integrated
   under the common rubric of a sociology of interventions: The first
   literature analyzes intellectual fields and markets. It moves away from
   the sociology of intellectuals by multiplying the relevant actors and
   depersonalizing the term "intellectual" so that it no longer stands for
   a social type but for the capacity to make a public intervention, a
   capacity to which many different actors lay claim. The second literature
   analyzes the public deployment of expertise. It multiplies not simply
   the actors laying claim to the mantle of the intellectual, but the
   formats and modes of intervention itself, i.e., the different ways in
   which knowledge and expertise can be inserted into the public sphere.

   decades. While its proponents are well aware of this field's
   contributions and relevance, we focus here on demonstrating its merit to
   the broader sociological community. We do so by addressing the following
   questions: What is music, sociologically speaking? How do individuals
   and groups use music? How is the collective production of music made
   possible? How does music relate to broader social distinctions,
   especially class, race, and gender? Answering these questions reveals
   that music provides an important and engaging purchase on topics that
   are of great concern to sociologists of all stripes-topics that range
   from the microfoundations of interaction to the macro-level dynamics of
   inequality.

AB A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social
   network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the
   relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising
   recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison,
   critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques
   for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to
   classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same
   time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as
   providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as
   a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a
   new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis
   that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of
   "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the
   cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly
   permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social
   networks.

AB While much of economic sociology focuses on the stabilizing aspects of
   markets, the social movement perspective emphasizes the role that
   contentiousness plays in bringing institutional change and innovation to
   markets. Markets are inherently political, both because of their ties to
   the regulatory functions of the state and because markets are contested
   by actors who are dissatisfied with market outcomes and who use the
   market as a platform for social change. Research in this area focuses on
   the pathways to market change pursued by social movements, including
   direct challenges to corporations, the institutionalization of systems
   of private regulation, and the creation of new market categories through
   institutional entrepreneurship. Much contentiousness, while initially
   disruptive, works within the market system by producing innovation and
   restraining capitalism from destroying the resources it depends on for
   survival.

AB The inverse relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and
   unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and poor
   nutrition have been well demonstrated empirically but encompass diverse
   underlying causal mechanisms. These mechanisms have special theoretical
   importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities
   in many other components of health, involve something more than the
   ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of
   broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we
   classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet,
   and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that
   specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear
   support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES
   disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies
   that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.

   by major granting agencies, focusing on both the quantity and

   percent more likely to die during the follow-up period, net of

   more than 5,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in combination with
   principal components analysis to characterize population ancestry of
   individuals in this study. We show that non-Hispanic white and
   Mexican-American respondents differ significantly with respect to BMI
   and differ on the first principal component from the genetic data. This
   first component is positively associated with BMI and accounts for
   roughly 3% of the genetic variance in our sample. However, after
   controlling for this genetic measure, the observed ethnic differences in
   BMI remain large and statistically significant. This study demonstrates
   a parsimonious method to adjust for genetic differences among individual
   respondents that may contribute to observed differences in outcomes. In
   this case, adjusting for genetic background has no bearing on the
   influence of self-identified ethnicity.

AB Background: Impairments in social competence are among the most
   prevalent sequelae of traumatic brain injury and present a major barrier
   to a person returning to a productive life. The recent increased
   incidence of TBI among military personnel and the subsequent
   difficulties these individuals face reintegrating into society
   accentuates the need for efficacious social competence treatment
   interventions for the TBI population.
   Method and results: This paper outlines the theoretical model and
   clinical application of Group Interactive Structured Treatment (GIST)
   for Social Competence. GIST-Social Competence is a structured
   cognitive-behavioural group therapy model addressing the underlying
   cognitive, communicative and emotional impairments impeding social
   competence after TBI. A recent randomized control trial (RCT) funded by
   the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research
   demonstrated the efficacy of this programme. GIST integrates the
   principles of established cognitive-behavioural therapy, group therapy
   and holistic neuro-rehabilitation in a manualized 13 week intervention
   combining a structured curriculum with a group therapy format. The
   structured cognitive-behavioural approach allows even those with
   significant underlying deficits (including self-awareness, memory,
   problem-solving, etc.) to benefit from this intervention.
   Conclusion: The GIST model can be applied to other treatment areas in
   TBI rehabilitation. Clinical observations from application of GIST with
   military personnel are reviewed.

   course for assessing theoretical frameworks in sociology and their
   applications to education, as well as to disability studies.
   Essentially, student voices offer opportunities for critical
   self-reflection as a disability studies scholar, as well as for
   reflection on the contributions of disability studies and sociology as a
   whole, leading to a transformative vision of the central tenets and
   tasks before us. The approach taken throughout this analysis is informed

AB After three decades of exceptional economic growth, China has become a
   global economic powerhouse. As the economy has grown, though, so have
   China's environmental challenges, causing enormous socioeconomic
   consequences for China and the rest of the world. The global financial
   crisis has prompted China to create more domestic demand for consumption
   and implement massive infrastructure construction. Although China has
   the second-largest total gross domestic product (GDP) in the world, its
   per capita GDP is still much lower than per capita GDP of developed
   countries: there is much room for further increase in GDP and consequent
   environmental challenges. Despite China's many efforts to protect the
   environment and improve resource use efficiency, increasing
   environmental pollution and resource scarcity have become a severe
   bottleneck for sustainable development. Because of China's size, these
   and other challenges and opportunities have huge implications for the
   world. However, literature related to China's various environmental
   challenges and rapid changes is scattered. In this article, we outline
   China's socioeconomic transformation, synthesize China's environmental
   challenges and their interrelationships, illustrate impacts of
   environmental challenges on human well-being in China and beyond, and
   offer a systems approach to addressing environmental sustainability.

AB Shyness is associated with social-emotional maladjustment in some, but
   not all, children. The ability to flexibly regulate attention under
   conditions of potential conflict may protect shy children from
   developing internalizing problems. In the current study, the
   associations between shyness, the N2 event related potential (ERP)
   response, and social-emotional adjustment were examined in a sample of
   36 typically developing 9- to 13-year-old children. It was hypothesized
   that the N2 amplitude, an ERP measure associated with aspects of
   cognitive and attention control, would moderate the associations between
   shyness and social-emotional functioning (negative attribution style,
   social self-perceptions, social anxiety). Shyness was unrelated to
   behavioral or ERP measures collected during a modified Flanker task;
   however, shyness and N2 amplitude were alone and in combination
   associated with all three measures of social adjustment. In general,
   shyness was associated with poor outcomes primarily among children with
   relatively large amplitude, or enhanced, N2 responses. The results are
   discussed in terms of the role of conflict sensitivity in the regulation
   of attention and emotions associated with shyness and the importance of
   studying the combined influences of reactive and self-regulatory aspects
   of temperament in relation to adjustment in childhood.

AB Scholarly accounts of young men's violence have remained remarkably
   consistent over time: the use of violence emerges in response to focal
   concerns that strongly emphasize autonomy, respect, and the defense of
   reputation, and is indicative of the import of hegemonic masculinities
   on the streets. Yet, despite persistent gender gaps in the use of
   violence, recent research suggests that young women use violence more
   often than commonly believed, and their violence is likewise tied to
   concerns about status and respect. Given scholarly attention to the
   functions of violence for accomplishing masculinity, this raises the
   interesting question of whether and how young men maintain the equation
   of masculinity with violence when faced with the reality of young
   women's violence. Drawing from the sociology of accounts and research on
   gender, language, and discourse, we analyze in-depth interviews with 39
   urban African-American young men to compare how they construct and make
   sense of boys' and girls' violence in the context of conversations about
   the nature and meanings of violence.

AB Addressing the environmental challenges of the 21st century requires
   substantial changes to the way modern society views and manages
   ecosystems. In particular, many authors contend that fundamental
   transformation of the largely sectoral, expert-centered
   ecosystem-management institutions of modern, Western societies is
   needed. There is increasing agreement that more adaptive, integrated,
   collaborative ecosystem-management approaches, interlinked at multiple
   scales, would improve society's ability to sustainably manage complex
   social-ecological systems. Therefore, understanding processes of
   transformation, and factors that may enable transformation in ecosystem
   management, has become an active research area. We explore
   ecosystem-management transformations using a social-innovation
   framework. Based on three local-level case studies of transformation in
   freshwater management, we provide a pilot assessment of factors that may
   promote the emergence and adoption of integrated, collaborative
   ecosystem-management approaches. Our analysis suggests that ongoing
   environmental degradation, increasing environmental awareness, and
   shifting societal values are creating fertile ground for the emergence
   and adoption of new approaches to ecosystem management. Based on the
   case studies we examined, we suggest that initiatives that foster
   environmental awareness and attachment to local ecosystems, develop
   capacity for social entrepreneurship in the environmental arena, promote
   dialogue between key stakeholders, and provide institutional support to
   new institutions may facilitate the emergence of integrated,
   collaborative ecosystem-management approaches.

AB Despite the fact that swidden agriculture has been the subject of
   decades of research, questions remain about the extent to which it is
   constrained by demographic growth and if it can adapt to environmental
   limits. Here, social network analysis is used to analyze farmer
   labor-exchange networks within a chronosequence of five Q'eqchi' Maya
   villages where swidden agriculture is used. Results suggest that changes
   in land-use patterns, network structure, reciprocity rates, and levels
   of network hierarchy may increase the resilience of these villages to
   changes in the forest's agricultural productivity caused by ongoing
   agricultural activity. I analyze the suitability of subsistence-versus
   market-oriented agricultural labor for reciprocal labor exchange and
   develop a novel interpretation of labor reciprocity that highlights how
   unreciprocated exchanges, when they occur within the context of a
   network, may limit overexploitation of the forest. The variability
   observed in labor-exchange network structure across villages suggests
   that Q'eqchi' swidden can maintain its identity under changing
   conditions. This important characteristic of resilient systems is
   explored by analyzing a village case study where a serious demographic
   exodus dramatically impacted their labor network. The resulting picture
   of Q'eqchi' swidden agriculture is one of resilience rather than
   homeostasis. Reorganization of labor-exchange networks helps to maintain
   a village's cohesion, and ultimately this limits pioneer settlements and
   may slow overall rates of deforestation.

AB Relationships between humans and nature take multiple forms. This is a
   fundamental issue in conservation but one that is often neglected,
   leading to poor conservation outcomes. It is thus imperative that we
   come to understand better the complex relationships between humans and
   nature. To do so, we need to examine "nature" and the often assumed
   dichotomy between humans and nature. We conducted a qualitative social
   research inquiry to explore the societal relationships with nature in
   the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve in Chile. From the results, we developed
   a framework that illustrates how different "natures" are created in the
   three-way relationship among the individual, society, and the physical
   world. We further discuss the implications of the co-existence of
   various "natures" in one place. Their explicit consideration bears
   important potential for improving conservation practice. The framework
   can then serve as a heuristic tool for uncovering and addressing
   challenges in other conservation contexts.

AB Ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchy are all concepts
   that have been developed to explain abrupt and often surprising changes
   in complex socio-ecological systems that are prone to disturbances.
   These types of changes involve qualitative and quantitative alterations
   in systems' structures and processes. This paper uses the concepts of
   ecological resilience, adaptive cycles, and panarchies to compare
   ecological and human community systems. At least five important findings
   emerge from this comparison. 1) Both systems demonstrate the multiple
   meanings of resilience-both in terms of recovery time from disturbances
   and the capacity to absorb them. 2) Both systems recognize the role of
   diversity in contributing to resilience. 3) The comparison highlights
   the role of different forms of capital and 4) the importance of
   cross-scale interactions. 5) The comparison reveals the need for
   experimentation and learning to build adaptive capacities. All of these
   ideas have broad implications for attempting to manage complex systems
   with human and ecological components in the face of recurring natural

   as to what the implications are of different social adaptations to
   long-term vulnerability of small-scale human societies. A stylized
   agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making
   on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact
   of various assumptions concerning storage, exchange, sharing, and
   migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored.
   Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population
   levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population
   stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate
   variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the
   level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and
   with whom to exchange.

AB Accounts of the adaptive responses of northern aboriginal peoples

   Practices include clearing of trees, burning of berry patches and
   construction of fish weirs. This paper examines the adaptive capacity of
   the northern aboriginal community of Wemindji, east coast James Bay, in
   relation to long term landscape changes induced by coastal uplift
   processes. Associated changes are noticeable within a human lifetime and
   include the infilling of bays, the merger of islands with the mainland,
   as well as shifts in vegetative and wildlife communities. In response,
   generations of Cree hunters have actively modified the landscape using a
   variety of practices that include the construction of mud dykes and the
   cutting of tuuhiikaan, which are corridors in the coastal forest, to
   retain and enhance desirable conditions for goose hunting. We provide an
   account of the history, construction, and design of these features as
   well as the motivations and social learning that inform them. We reveal
   a complex and underappreciated dynamic between human resistance and
   adaptation to environmental change. While landscape modifications are
   motivated by a desire to increase resource productivity and
   predictability, they also reflect an intergenerational commitment to the
   maintenance of established hunting places as important connections with
   the past. Our findings support a revised perspective on aboriginal human
   agency in northern landscape modification and an enhanced role for
   aboriginal communities in adaptive planning for environmental change.

   reflects a legacy of past responses to institutional disturbances
   initiated at the larger, national system scale. Beginning with the
   Communist Revolution in 1957 and continuing through the next two
   decades, centralized forest regulations imposed a mismatch between the
   scale of management and the scale of the ecological processes being
   managed. A newly implemented forest property rights policy is shifting
   greater control over the management of forest resources to individuals
   in rural communities. Collective forest users will be allowed to manage
   commodity forests for profit through the transfer of long-term leases to

   accountability, used as a proxy for good governance, and people's
   perception of CBNRM benefits were documented through 236 individual

   These complex concepts were captured in order to strengthen performance
   assessments of CBNRM. Horizontal accountability was weak across the five
   conservancies studied and conservancy leaders could transfer more
   information to their constituents. Smaller and older conservancies
   displayed higher rates of information transfer, but horizontal
   accountability was not linked to different levels of socioeconomic
   benefits. In order to properly study the potential connections between
   good governance and the provision of socioeconomic benefits within
   CBNRM, the measures used in this study require further refinement.

AB Disturbances to key aspects of ecological systems, including
   biodiversity loss, climate change, pollution and natural resource
   degradation, have become a major concern to many policy analysts.
   Instead of learning from the study of biological complexity however,
   social scientists tend to recommend simple panaceas, particularly
   government or private ownership, as 'the' way to solve these problems.
   This paper reviews and assesses potential solutions for such overly
   simplified institutional prescriptions, referred to here as the 'panacea
   problem'. In contrast to these simple prescriptions, recent research
   efforts are now illustrating the diversity of institutions around the
   world related to environmental conservation. The complexity of working
   institutions, however, presents a challenge to scholars who equate
   scientific knowledge with relatively simple models that predict optimal
   performance if specific institutional arrangements are in place. Dealing
   with this complexity has led to the development of frameworks as
   meta-theoretical tools. The institutional analysis and development (IAD)
   framework has been used over the last three decades as a foundation for
   a focused analysis of how institutions affect human incentives, actions
   and outcomes. Building on this foundation, the social-ecological systems
   (SES) framework has recently enabled researchers to begin the
   development of a common language that crosses social and ecological
   disciplines to analyse how interactions among a variety of factors
   affect outcomes. Such a framework may be able to facilitate a diagnostic
   approach that will help future analysts overcome the panacea problem.
   Using a common framework to diagnose the source, and possible
   amelioration, of poor outcomes for ecological and human systems enables
   a much finer understanding of these complex systems than has so far been
   obtained, and provides a basis for comparisons among many systems and
   ultimately more responsible policy prescriptions.

AB The purpose of the present study was to generate both culture-specific
   and universal design and operational guidelines for smart homes.
   Questionnaire surveys were performed in the USA and South Korea to
   collect data on preferences for various aspects of the design and
   operation of smart homes. The factors that the survey participants
   considered most important were derived through factor analyses of the
   survey data and the responses of Americans and Koreans were compared to
   generate culture-specific guidelines. The five factors derived were: 1)
   environmental connection and control; 2) smart devices (appliances) and
   their control; 3) physical safety and security concerns; 4) comfort and
   relaxation issues; 5) control restriction issues. The two cultures
   showed different preference structures with statistical significance for
   all five factors. Prediction capability of the derived factors was also
   examined through multiple regressions for buying intention, interest,
   self-vision of living, moving intention, living satisfaction and
   perceived time and effort savings. 'Environmental connection and
   control' and 'smart devices (appliances) and their control' seemed to be
   the most influential factors for Americans and Koreans, respectively.
   Statement of Relevance:Analysis of a survey of design and operational
   preferences for smart homes yielded five factors on which US and South
   Korean respondents differed. These factors form the basis for
   culture-specific guidelines, which, along with universal guidelines,
   should be followed in design of user-centred smart homes.

AB Background: Elder self-neglect is an important public health issue.
   However, little is known about the characteristics of self-neglect and
   its association with social factors among community-dwelling
   populations. Objectives: (1) To examine the sociodemographic,
   health-related and psychosocial characteristics of reported elder
   self-neglect; (2) to examine the association of social network and
   social engagement with reported self-neglect. Methods: Population-based
   study conducted from 1993 to 2005 of community-dwelling subjects (n =
   9,056) participating in the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP).
   Subsets of the CHAP subjects (n = 1,812) were identified for suspected
   self-neglect by the social services agency, which also assessed the
   severity. This reported group was compared with the unreported group in
   the CHAP across the sociodemographic, health-related and psychosocial
   variables. Logistical regressions were used to assess the association of
   social factors and self-neglect. Results: Older age, women,
   African-Americans, and those with lower education or lower income were
   more likely to be reported for self-neglect. Those reported for
   self-neglect were more likely to have lower levels of cognitive and
   physical function, nutritional status, psychosocial function and a
   higher number of medical comorbidities. After adjusting for confounders,
   lower levels of social network and social engagement were significantly
   associated with an increased risk of reported self-neglect. Among the
   reported cases of self-neglect, the study found increased trends of
   older age, women, African-American, lower income, lower cognitive and
   physical function, lower social engagement and a higher number of
   chronic medical conditions with self-neglect severity. Conclusion:
   Reported self-neglect elders have multiple sociodemographic,
   health-related and psychosocial characteristics that are different than
   elders not reported. Lower levels of social network and social
   engagement were associated with increased risk of self-neglect.

AB Sources associated with 19th century stature variation have been widely

   paper illustrates that 19th century US white statures were positively
   associated with a broad combination of wealth, equality, and
   environmental characteristics. Individuals from geographic areas
   characterized by low wealth and high inequality had shorter statures.
   After controlling for various factors, direct sunlight - the primary
   source of vitamin D - was also positively associated with stature. After
   controlling for wealth, inequality, and insolation, farmers were taller
   than workers in other occupations. These wealth, insolation, and
   socioeconomic relationships are significant across the stature
   distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All lights reserved.

   how community characteristics interact with family and individual
   practices to create the conditions under which children develop
   expertise in navigating multiple cultural worlds and identities. Core
   constructs and propositions about the nature of relations are derived
   from a multidisciplinary review of extant scholarship. To illustrate an
   application of the model, we compare two waves of immigration to the US
   from the Indian subcontinent and derive potential hypotheses about how
   differences in immigration history and circumstances of settlement in
   the host country are associated with the processes of negotiating

AB The acculturation gap-distress model purports that immigrant children
   acculturate to their new culture at a quicker pace than their parents,
   leading to family conflict and youth maladjustment. This article reviews
   literature on the acculturation gap-distress model, showing that
   acculturation gaps function in unique ways depending on many social and
   contextual variables. In contrast to the original model, which only
   discusses 1 type of acculturation gap, there are at least 4 types of
   acculturation gaps: (1) the child is more acculturated than the parent
   in the host culture, (2) the child is less acculturated than the parent
   in the host culture, (3) the child is more acculturated than the parent
   in the native culture, and (4) the child is less acculturated than the
   parent in the native culture. A review of research indicates that each
   of these types of gaps function in unique ways. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

AB This paper examines the consumption of online news at the place of work
   and during work hours, which are relatively new temporal and spatial
   coordinates of news consumption for large segments of the population.
   This novel phenomenon is analysed to make descriptive and conceptual
   contributions to scholarship on news consumption, in particular, and
   technology and society, in general. Descriptively, the analysis reveals
   the emergence of discontinuous features of online consumption 'at work'
   within the context of continuity in some elements of news consumption in
   print and broadcast media. Conceptually, the analysis underscores the
   continued relevance of the notions of routines, space, time, and
   sociability to make sense of news consumption. But, it also shows the
   need to renew the understanding of how each of these conceptual tools
   matter when the media change from print and broadcast to digital and the
   practices of consumption coincide with those of work. The paper also
   suggests revisiting the boundaries between work and home and between the
   instrumental and leisure purposes of consuming communication
   technologies.

   analytical techniques to assess ICT user versus non-user perceptions
   about the role technology plays in enhancing work effectiveness,
   increasing workloads, and accelerating the pace of life. I also
   investigate whether different devices or applications, used in different
   contexts (for work, for personal needs, or both), influence worker
   assessments of productivity and demands in different ways. I find that:
   (1) the frequency of computer, email, and cell phone use positively
   influences assessments that ICT use is connected to greater workplace
   effectiveness, an increased work load, and an accelerated pace of life;
   (2) computer and email use is linked more reliably to assessments
   regarding workplace effectiveness and work load than cell phone use; and
   (3) while both personal and work-related forms of ICT use influence
   productivity and pace-of-life assessments, work-related use only appears
   linked to assessments of increasing work demands. Overall, the findings
   indicate that perceptions about the social consequences of ICT use
   depend both on what device or application is used (computers versus cell
   phones), as well as the context (work versus personal) of this use.

AB In this paper we apply theory and research from sociology and social
   psychology to the problem of collective information sharing and exchange
   on the internet. We investigate the relationships between pre-existing
   dispositions to be cautious towards others, the propensity to exert more
   or less effort as a function of group affiliation, and contribution
   towards a collective goal. We find that individuals with average or
   lower levels of general caution are more likely to contribute to a
   collective pool of information, providing support for Yamagishi's (2001)
   argument that less cautious individuals exhibit a type of social
   intelligence by engaging in risky but potentially rewarding social
   interactions. Consistent with the literature on social loafing, we find
   that abstract group affiliations have a negative effect on information
   sharing behaviour. However, the effect of group affiliation is mediated
   by one's level of general caution. We argue that pre-dispositions to
   engage in socially risky situations are a critical element of
   individuals' decisions to contribute to online information sharing
   systems or not.

AB Purpose - The goal of my study is to investigate women's tattooing in a
   phenomenological way, and to go in-depth into a "handful" of eases with
   the purpose of discussing tattooed women's daily lives and experiences.
   The main purpose of this study is to contribute to the scholarly
   literature on the sociology of the body, and particularly to women and
   tattoos.
   Methodology/approach - Open-ended conversational interviews and feminist
   phenomenological methods together shed light on the possible connection
   between gendered attitudes about women's bodies and tattoos and tattooed
   women's personal feelings of beauty and femininity.
   Findings In this particular chapter, I describe the connections between
   women's tattoos: (1) personal or individual beauty and (2) femininity.
   Findings show that although women tend to think that tattooing goes
   against current societal beauty norms and ideas of femininity, many
   women feel that their tattoos make them more beautiful.
   Originality/value of chapter - This study offers important insights into
   the social experiences of extensively tattooed women and, therefore,
   contributes to a more sociological and gender-specific glimpse of
   women's lives and tattooing. My discussion of and findings on tattooed
   women's lived experiences, however partial should promote wider
   conceptualizations of the tattooing phenomenon, allow a wealth of tattoo
   meanings and experiences to come into the spotlight, and point to new
   ways to study tattoos and gendered bodies in the future.

AB Purpose and approach - This research explores gender and gender
   inequality in representation in state legislatures among African
   Americans, Hispanics, and white Americans. Using 10 states with the
   largest concentrations of African Americans in the population and 10
   with the largest concentrations of Hispanics in 2003, a parity index was
   used to compare each race/sex group's share of each state's population
   with that group's share of seats in the state legislature. Parity ratios
   were also constructed for white women and white men in both sets of
   states.
   Findings - White men dominate all the state legislatures surveyed here;
   white women are severely underrepresented as are Black women, Hispanic
   women, and Hispanic men. Black men are slightly but not greatly
   underrepresented in political office in these states. A consistent
   pattern is that the higher the representation of any group of males, the
   greater is the gap between women and men.
   For Black and white women in both sets of states, having a high
   proportion of women who are college graduates, who are employed, and who
   work as managers or professionals and garner larger earnings increases
   their chances for election, but this pattern is not observed among
   Hispanic women.
   Implications - These findings are significant because they bring
   together previously disparate insights from political science and
   sociology; highlight differences between women and men and among people
   from different ethnic groups; and reveal the importance of an
   intersectional approach for understanding the representation of diverse
   groups in political office.

AB Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is one of the world's worst parasitic
   killers, second only to Malaria, claiming thousands of lives every year.
   More than three fifths of the world's VL cases occur in the Indian state
   of Bihar alone. While some research has been conducted with emphasis on
   the effects of climatic variables on the VL incidence rate, rigorous
   analysis of the effects of socio-economic variables is still lacking. In
   this paper a regression model is developed that describes the
   relationship between VL incidence rate and a variety of socio-economic
   factors. It uses data from 2005 and explains 92% of the observed
   variance. In addition, a stepwise regression model is also used to
   identify the most important factors that facilitate the prevalence of
   the VL disease. A discussion on how to most effectively distribute
   Bihar's limited resources on various control measures to decrease the
   incidence of VL is also presented.

AB The development of an enormous culture gap, in which no individuals of
   advanced societies possess even a billionth of the non-genetic
   information possessed by their entire society, has threatened a global
   collapse of civilisation. Critical parts of that gap must be rapidly
   bridged so that problems such as climate disruption, toxification of the
   Earth, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and the decay of the
   epidemiological environment can be satisfactorily attacked. The
   essential need is to alter human behaviour to put society on a route to
   sustainability; one cheering development is a growing interest in the
   Millennium Assessment of Human Behaviour (MAHB), whose goal is to do
   just that.

AB Purpose: To describe social support for weight loss shared by members of
   a large Internet weight loss community.
   Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods study with surveys (n = 193) and
   interviews (n = 13) of community members along with a content analysis
   of discussion forum messages (n = 1924 messages). Qualitative data were
   analyzed for social support themes.
   Results: Survey respondents were primarily white (91.4%) and female
   (93.8%) with mean age 37.3 years and mean body mass index 30.9. They
   used forums frequently, with 56.8% reading messages, 36.1% replying to
   messages, and 18.5% posting messages to start a discussion related to
   weight loss on a daily or more frequent basis. Major social support
   themes were encouragement and motivation, mentioned at least once by
   87.6% of survey respondents, followed by information (58.5%) and shared
   experiences (42.5%). Subthemes included testimonies, recognition for
   success, accountability, friendly competition, and humor. Members valued
   convenience, anonymity, and the non-judgmental interactions as unique
   characteristics of Internet-mediated support.
   Conclusion: This Internet weight loss community plays a prominent role
   in participants' weight loss efforts. Social support within Internet
   weight loss communities merits further evaluation as a weight loss
   resource for clinicians to recommend to patients. Understanding these
   communities could improve how health professionals evaluate, build,
   harness, and manipulate social support for weight loss. (C) 2009

AB Geospatial technologies are rapidly becoming adopted by advocacy groups
   engaged in non-governmental monitoring of human rights abuses. Limited
   available funding puts constraints on the amount of time staff can
   perform Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote-sensing tasks.
   Therefore, semi-automated techniques are forthcoming in order to
   facilitate data-analysis tasks aimed at sharing information about
   violent conflict and human rights abuses. As a contribution to these
   efforts, this paper details classification of a pre-conflict image,
   binary partitioning of the classification results, application of
   morphological filters, estimation of total number of pre-conflict
   structures and overlay of the refined information onto the post-conflict
   image for damage assessment in Darfur, Sudan. We present a novel
   application of geospatial technologies and image-processing techniques
   aimed at expediting the dissemination of critical information necessary
   to inform the public and policy makers of detailed multi-temporal
   analyses of evidence of human rights abuses.

AB Property owners in fire-prone communities have been identified as key
   stakeholders in the wildfire dilemma. Although past research has
   examined stakeholder characteristics and their behaviours, less is known
   about how small-scale social processes among stakeholders might shape
   mitigation decision-making and related actions. This manuscript
   highlights the role informal social interactions play in building
   bridges among full-time and part-time residents that facilitate the
   spread of wildfire information and galvanise small-scale cooperative
   efforts to reduce wildfire risk. Data from in-depth interviews conducted
   with residents in six fire-prone Colorado communities indicate that
   these interactions create bridging capital that links those who are not
   likely to be the direct recipients of wildfire outreach efforts to those
   who are.

AB With file rapid urbanization in China, the country faces significant
   challenges in Sustainable urban development and actively explores novel
   ways to expand urban areas while conserving natural resources. Radical
   changes in city planning are being made to switch to sustainable
   development, with new cities being designed to be ecologically friendly
   guided by principles like carbon neutrality and self-sufficiency. This
   paper introduces the development of the Dongtan eco-city project on
   Chongming Island, Shanghai and describes how it addresses issues
   including energy, water, waste, transportation, ecosystem, and social
   and economic development in its design. The lessons and challenges of
   eco-city development based on the Dongtan experience are also discussed.
   If the vision of a zero-carbon emissions sustainable city is
   successfully realized, Dongtan will serve as a model for developing
   similar cities across China and the rest of the developing world.
   Currently, the development of this project is behind schedule and
   whether the eco-city plan will materialize or not is in question. Even
   though the project remains mostly oil the drawing boards, the planning
   and preliminary development or Dongtan eco-city have generated
   significant enthusiasm for green buildings and influenced plans for
   other sustainable urban development projects in China.

AB A cross-cultural comparison between U.S. and Hong Kong preschoolers
   examined factors responsible for young children's analogical reasoning
   errors. On a scene analogy task, both groups had adequate prerequisite
   knowledge of the key relations, were the same age, and showed similar
   baseline performance, yet Chinese children Outperformed U.S. children on
   more relationally complex problems. Children from both groups were
   highly susceptible to choosing a perceptual or semantic distractor
   during reasoning when one was present. Taken together, these
   similarities and differences suggest that (a) cultural differences can
   facilitate better knowledge representations by allowing more efficient
   processing of relationally complex problems and (b) inhibitory control
   is an important factor in explaining the development of children's

AB Hegemonic masculinity in the contemporary United States involves
   control, domination, competition, aggression, and the devaluing of
   women. Hogging, a practice whereby men seek out women they deem
   unattractive or fat for sexual purposes, has been largely overlooked by
   scholars. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to explore
   hogging from a sociology of masculinities perspective. Interviews and
   content analyses were conducted to learn about why men hog and what they
   are able to achieve from this behavior. These data indicate that most
   men who participate in this behavior are concerned with how hogging
   affects their relationships with their male peers. Men who hog achieve
   status in their peer groups by gaining sexual access to women they see
   as 'easy'. Even men who do not engage in sexual activity gain from the
   sexual encounters of their peers, by either participating in 'bets' or
   being entertained by the stories their peers tell them about hogging.
   Hogging, then, is less about the encounters with women and more about
   homosociality.

   then build a model to represent processes of perception and belief core
   to social theories. To do this, we define our multimodal language and
   then add substantive constraints that specify the inferential behavior
   of modalities for perception, default, and belief. We illustrate the
   deployment of this language to the theory of legitimation proposed by
   Hannan, Polos, and Carroll (2007). This article aims to call attention

AB Rational choice theory (RCT) developed in sociology in part as a
   reaction to the lack of cumulative scientific work in the field (Boudon
   2003). One of the significant appeals of RCT within sociology was its
   capacity to provide a simple model of social action at the micro-level
   that facilitated derivations of macro-level consequences in the
   aggregate. A critique from sociology as well as psychology is the
   tendency for rational choice theories to avoid consideration of the more
   emotional determinants of behavior. We delineate some of the ways in
   which emotions can affect "rational" choices directly or indirectly,
   modify the process of decision-making entirely, or serve as alternatives
   to RCT as determinants of behavior. In so doing we hope to stimulate
   further theory and empirical work on the specific linkages between
   emotions, rationality, and behavior. In our concluding section we
   mention the possibility of future connections with further developments
   not only in economics (e.g. behavioral economics) but also new research
   in neuroscience on the determinants of both emotions and behavior
   (Science May, 2010).

   compliance with National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and
   International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Track and
   Field Hammer Facility Recommendations at Division I universities in the
   USA, and to determine factors related to perceptions of facility safety.
   Design/methodology/approach - A 35-item survey instrument was
   distributed to 279 applicable schools with a 28 percent response rate.
   Multiple regression analysis was utilized to determine factors
   significantly related to overall perception of safety.
   Findings - A total of 78.1 percent participants in the study report
   compliance with the NCAA minimum recommendations and 38 percent also
   meet the IAAF standards. Analysis of the perceived safety reported by
   coaches reveal a significant prediction equation. Further analyses
   reveal significant risk involving some current facilities guidelines.
   Practical implications - The NCAA may need to examine their present
   hammer facility guidelines and consider alignment with the new standards
   of the IAAF.
   Originality/value - The paper creates a new application of statistical
   analyses for risk perception in a specific sport setting.

AB This volume includes two major explanations of the meltdown that I
   critically discuss. The first is a "normal accident theory" arguing that
   the complexity and coupling of the financial system caused the failure.
   Although these structural characteristics were evident, I argue that the
   case does not fit the theory because the cause was not the system, but
   behavior by key agents who were aware of the great risks they were
   exposing their firms, clients, and society to. The second interpretation
   is a neoinstitutional one, emphasizing that ideologies, worldviews,
   cognitive frames, mimicry, and norms were the source of behaviors that
   turned out to be disastrous for the elites and others. The implication
   is that elites were victims, not perpetrators. I argue that while
   ideologies, etc,, can have real effects on the behavior of many firm
   members and society in general, in this ease financial elites, to serve
   personal ends, crafted the ideologies and changed institutions, fully
   aware that this could harm their firms, clients, and the public.
   Complexity and coupling only made deception easier and the consequences
   more extensive. For anecdotal evidence I examine a decade of
   deregulation, examples of elected representative, regulatory officials,
   firms, and the plentiful warnings.

AB Both neoclassical and Keynesian economists have widely favored the use
   of equilibrium models to understand economic activity, but dramatic
   periods of change such as the current global economic downturn are
   poorly understood by assuming equilibrium. The economist Joseph
   Schumpeter tried to inject dynamism and disequilibrium into economic
   models by arguing for the role of entrepreneurs in creating
   microeconomic change, and for examining long-term macroeconomic change
   as represented in business cycles. No economist, including Schumpeter,
   has ever connected these two approaches to change and these approaches
   are not typically used as alternative and complementary ways of viewing
   transformation over time. We suggest that these theories can be
   connected in a "mesoeconomic" institutional analysis rooted in economic
   sociology; we demonstrate this connection by examining the US commercial
   building industry. This industry has changed in qualitatively distinct
   ways over the past two centuries in what we call market orders, economic
   orders sometimes lasting for decades or more. In each market order,
   entrepreneurs of different sorts are able to flourish and push forward
   institutional changes that result in long-term economic shifts. Credit
   and finance have been pivotal influences in each market order, a factor
   supporting Schumpeter's focus on entrepreneurial action and speculation
   and one not largely discussed today. We view the recent disruption of
   financial markets as a signal of the destruction of a reigning market
   order.

AB The NYU Health Sciences Libraries created an account on Twitter, a
   microblogging service, as a new outreach tool marketed to students,
   faculty, and staff. The team used Twitter to promote resources, events,
   and news. Twitter is a part of a pipeline of information that also
   includes the library's Web site and Facebook. Although it is difficult
   to measure the effectiveness of a social networking tool, the overhead
   of using Twitter is so low that it merits consideration.

TI Elevated cortisol during play is associated with age and social

AB Background: The hallmark characteristic of autism is impaired reciprocal
   social interaction. While children find social interaction
   stress-reducing, many children with autism may find social interaction
   stress-inducing. The current study was designed to examine stress
   responsivity as measured by cortisol by comparing children with autism
   to neurotypical peers during an ecologically valid 20-minute playground
   paradigm.
   Methods: The experiment involved sets of three children: a child with
   autism, a neurotypical child, and a confederate. Participants included
   45 prepubescent males between 8 and 12 years of age (21 with autism and
   24 neurotypical children).
   Results: Children with autism showed fewer initiations (chi(2)(1) =
   4.03, P = 0.044), rejected initiations from others more (chi(2)(1) =
   7.10, P = 0.008) and spent less time interacting during motor (F(1,43) =
   16.7, P = 0.0002) and cooperative (F(1,43) = 14.78, P = 0.0004) play.
   Repeated measures analysis of the cortisol values revealed a significant
   model (chi(2)(4) = 22.76, P < 0.0005) that included time of measurement,
   diagnosis and age as main effects and an interaction between diagnosis
   and age. Thus, as age increased among children with autism, they
   experienced enhanced cortisol levels while age did not modify expected
   cortisol levels for typical children. Stress responsivity was associated
   with more peripheral equipment play for motor (chi(2)(3) = 12.3, P =
   0.006) and cooperative (chi(2)(3) = 8.24, P = 0.04) play as well as
   reduced nonverbal social skills during motor (chi(2)(1) = 5.52, P =
   0.018) and cooperative play (chi(2)(1) = 4.53, P = 0.033).
   Conclusions: Overall, children with autism engaged in fewer social
   overtures and spent less time interacting than typically developing
   peers during play. The peer interaction paradigm resulted in
   significantly higher levels of cortisol in many children with autism.
   Distinct patterns emerged within the autism group based on developmental
   (older), biological (cortisol responder) and behavioral patterns
   (peripheral group interaction). The enhanced cortisol response was
   observed in children who voluntarily engaged in interaction; thus, it
   does not support the notion of a response to social threat. Rather, it
   appears to reflect attendant metabolic preparedness and enhanced arousal
   from engaging socially. The data suggest that many children with autism
   activate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses in relatively benign
   social situations, which appears to be a function of age and level of
   social engagement. The findings support the need to teach coping
   strategies in addition to fundamental social skills to youth with
   autism.

AB Voros's article is a historical exploration of the idea of the 'Jewish
   question'. It follows a semantic approach and argues that the 'Jewish
   question' is an ideological construct that played a principal role in
   the development and dissemination of anti-Jewish ideas and the
   problematization of the presence of Jews in modern Central Europe. Voros
   focuses on the development of the concept of the 'Jewish question'
   within sociological theory, and the role of sociology in its general
   advance in public discourse in Hungary between 1900 and 1920. She
   describes a discursive process in the course of which antisemitic
   discourse gradually lost its designation as 'antisemitism' and was
   transformed into what was seen as legitimate social analysis and
   political critique. Voros suggests that historians of Central Europe pay
   more analytical attention to the history of the concept and use the term
   'Jewish question' as a historically specific object of analysis rather
   than an ambivalent analytical category.

AB OBJECTIVE: By using behavioral outcome measures of children who were
   born preterm, we evaluated differences between children who were born at
   term and children who were born at extremely low (ELBW; <1000 g) and
   very low birth weights (VLBW; 1000-1499 g) and assessed the relationship
   of birth weight, socioeconomic status, and cognitive ability to
   behavioral outcome.
   METHODS: We studied a total of 104 children (aged 7-16 years). Of these,
   49 had a preterm birth (31 of ELBW and 18 of VLBW). The remaining 55
   were healthy control subjects. Children were administered tests of
   cognitive ability. Parents and teachers completed behavioral
   assessments. Multivariate analyses of covariance assessed differences
   between children who were born at term and those who were born of ELBW
   and of VLBW on behavioral measures. Hierarchical linear regressions were
   used to assess relationships among biological (birth weight),
   environmental (socioeconomic status), intellectual, and behavioral
   variables.
   RESULTS: Children who were born at term had fewer parent reports of
   hyperactivity/inattention and depression/anxiety symptoms than children
   of ELBW and VLBW. Teacher ratings were not significant between groups.
   Birth weight was consistently the strongest predictor of parent ratings
   of behavioral outcome, and intelligence level did not seem to mediate
   this relationship.
   CONCLUSIONS: Negative behavioral sequelae of preterm birth remain
   significant in middle childhood and adolescence, although the
   contribution of multiple factors to neurobehavioral outcome is complex.
   Research to assess these relationships, integrated with anatomic and
   functional neuroimaging, is needed to advance knowledge and improve
   outcomes for children who are born preterm. Pediatrics 2010; 125:

AB This essay develops a patrimonial model of shifting political relations
   between central and subordinate authority-levels in the history of
   territorial settlements on the Upper Guinea Coast. The model-drawn from
   Weberian political sociology-identifies centrifugal tensions in those
   relations, and provides a heuristic for analyzing regional causal
   factors shaping political change. The argument highlights the paradox of
   patrimonial systems, namely the political and ideological mechanisms
   used to create social integration-political and economic reciprocity
   between patrons and clients, the charisma of patrimonial rulers,
   clientalist personal loyalty and support, patriarchical ethos,
   gerontocracy, etc.-are the same mechanisms structuring conflict and
   instability when a changing political economy provides new resources and
   opportunities, or constraints. The Weberian patrimonial model provides
   an important key to solving that paradox.

AB Objectives. To analyze the association between parental perceptions of
   the social environment and walking and biking to school among
   10-14-year-olds.
   Methods. Surveys were conducted with 432 parents of 10-14-year-olds in
   the San Francisco Bay Area during 2006 and 2007; the final sample size
   was 357. The social environment was measured with a 3-item scale
   assessing child-centered social control. Unadjusted and adjusted
   differences in rates of active travel to school were compared between
   families reporting high levels of social control in their neighborhood
   and those reporting low or neutral levels of social control. Adjusted
   differences were computed by matching respondents on child and household
   characteristics and distance to school.
   Results. Of children whose parents reported high levels of social
   control, 37% walked or hiked to school, compared with 24% of children
   whose parents reported low or neutral levels. The adjusted difference
   between the two groups was 10 percentage points (p = 0.04). The
   association was strongest for girls and non-Hispanic whites.
   Conclusions. Higher levels of parent-perceived child-centered social
   control are associated with more walking and biking to school.
   Increasing physical activity through active travel to school may require
   intervention programs to address the social environment. (C) 2009

AB The concept of social control was formalized with the establishment of
   sociology as a scientific discipline in America in the last two decades
   of the 19th century. Two early American sociologists in particular,
   Edward A. Ross and Lester F. Ward, were instrumental in the movement to
   conceptualize social control and illustrate its applicability with
   regard to various social phenomena. During Ross's time social control
   has undergone extensive refinement, represented most recently in Chriss'
   typology of social control consisting of informal, legal, and medical
   control. In this chapter, informal control is explored specifically as
   it relates to the control of sexual activity and food quests beginning
   in human antiquity.

AB Preferences for the racial neighborhood composition differ significantly
   between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of
   Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica,
   CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if
   mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently
   published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social
   distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations
   using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30,
   185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this
   process empirically through a case study of a university housing system
   that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation
   between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the
   larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep
   roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact,
   residence assignment procedures are completely "color-blind." Thus a
   college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of
   preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks
   continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing
   applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to
   halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that
   percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for
   black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist
   preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect
   is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference
   has important consequences for the residential separation process. (C)

   inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status
   hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of
   Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor
   model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on
   perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute
   homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the
   single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This
   allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the
   individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the
   propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four
   waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally
   support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality,
   reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements
   in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB While environmental sociology has imported many macro theorists from the
   larger discipline, it has almost completely ignored Goffman. The primary
   project of this article is to fill that gap by proposing and initiating
   a Goffmanesque environmental sociology of everyday life, primarily
   through Goffman's 1974 work, Frame Analysis. In doing so we address two
   issues central to environmentally relevant everyday experience: (1) the
   commonplace appreciation of oNature,o such as that experienced at parks,
   on hikes, and being outdoors generally, and (2) the commonsensical
   notions of onatureo and onaturalnesso as used in everyday conduct. In
   the first task, we make a contribution both to Goffman's frame analytic
   theory and to environmental sociological theory with our notion of an
   out-in-nature frame. In the second task, we undertake to identify and
   formalize for environmental sociology instances implicit in Frame
   Analysis of how notions of nature mask social interests.

AB Studies of the anthropogenic contributors to greenhouse gas emissions
   have increased markedly in recent years. However, not all greenhouse
   gases have received their deserved attention. This study tests the
   theoretically derived assertion that foreign investment dependence
   increases the emissions of one such neglected greenhouse gas, nitrous
   oxide. Findings of the cross-national ordinary least squares (OLS)
   regression analysis of 44 countries show that foreign investment
   dependence is associated with higher levels of nitrous oxide emissions.
   However, the findings are contingent upon the sector of investment. That
   is, primary-sector investment is associated with higher levels of
   emissions, whereas secondary-sector investment is not. The findings
   support the theory of foreign investment dependence while also
   underscoring the need to study these sorts of structural relationships
   at the sector level.

AB The theory of ecologically unequal exchange posits that through the
   vertical flow of exports from less-developed countries, the stratified
   world economy enables more-developed countries to externalize their
   environmental costs. It is further argued that this externalization of
   environmental costs increases forms of environmental degradation within
   the borders of less-developed countries. To evaluate key aspects of the
   theory, we test the hypothesis that less-developed countries with
   relatively higher levels of primary-sector exports sent to
   more-developed countries exhibit greater rates of deforestation,
   1990-2005. Findings for multivariate regression analyses confirm the
   hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional results
   indicate that deforestation is positively associated with total
   population growth and negatively associated with both economic
   development and the presence of environmental international
   nongovernmental organizations.

AB Event history data constitute a valuable source to analyze life courses,
   although the reliance of such data on autobiographical memory raises
   many concerns over their reliability. In this paper, we use Swedish
   survey data to investigate bias in retrospective reports of employment
   biographies, applying a novel model-based latent Markov method. A
   descriptive comparison of the biographies as reconstructed by the same
   respondents at two interviews carried out about 10 years apart reveals
   that careers appear simpler and less heterogeneous and have fewer
   elements and episodes when reported at a point long after their
   occurrence, with a particularly high underreport of unemployment. Using
   matching techniques, the dissimilarity between the two reconstructions
   turns out to be unaffected by respondents' sociodemographic
   characteristics but particularly affected by the occurrence of
   unemployment spells and career complexity. Using latent Markov models,
   we assume correlated errors across occasions to determine the
   measurement error and to obtain a more reliable estimate of the (true)
   latent state occupied at a particular time point. The results confirm
   that (correlated) measurement errors lead to simplification and
   conventionalism. Career complexity makes recall particularly problematic
   at longer recall distances, whereas unemployment underreporting also
   happens very close to the interview. However, only a small fraction of
   respondents make consistent errors over time, while the great majority
   makes no errors at all.

   attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender
   equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual
   relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes
   within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether

   policies basically fulfilled their purpose, but led to unintended

AB This analysis extends prior research on racial inequality in arrest
   rates by testing opposing hypotheses derived from the civic community
   tradition in sociology. One interpretation of this perspective suggests
   that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an
   abundance of civic institutions, and civically engaged citizens should
   exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand,
   recent writings exposing a potential "dark side'' of social capital
   suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties.
   Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S.
   counties, the current analysis examines these competing hypotheses
   regarding the effects of civic community. Results suggest mixed support
   for both the traditional and "dark side'' predictions. Implications for
   theory and empirical research are discussed.

AB The purpose of this research was to investigate whether sociologists in
   particular and institutions in general are perceived to make life easier
   for people who are different in terms of sexual orientation, race/ethnic
   identity, or religious affiliations by being more accepting and
   supportive. A sample of 74 heads of sociology departments was surveyed.
   T-tests were used to determine the level of support among departments
   and institutions. Results indicate that sociology department chairs in
   public colleges, those in nonreligious programs, and those in larger
   institutions were generally more supportive of minorities than those in
   private, religious, and/or smaller institutions.

AB In this address, I review available published presidential addresses
   written by presidents of various sociological organizations as a way of
   thinking about sociology and what sociologists may find important. Using
   Eller's categorizations, I divide the articles into three types
   including (1) query of the profession in which the author discussed the
   history of sociology or its future; (2) a call for new directions in
   methodologies or theories within sociology; and (3) a focus on the
   author/president's research. Then, I focus on what is missing in most
   presidential addresses given by sociologists: sociologists' role as
   educators and the impact we have upon students. I find that most
   presidential addresses do not include any or only passing nods to our
   responsibilities as teachers. I end the address with a call to consider
   our responsibilities and impact as teachers.

AB The Stanford School of Organizational Sociology has influenced the
   development and direction of healthcare organizations as a field of
   research in several very significant ways. This chapter will provide a
   focused review of the major paradigms to develop from work at Stanford
   from 1970 to 2000, much of which involved the study of processes and
   structures within and surrounding healthcare organizations during this
   period. As a subarea of organizational theory and health services
   research, healthcare organizations embrace both theory-based research
   and applied research, and they borrow concepts, theories, and method,5
   from medical sociology, organizational theory, healthcare administration
   and management, and (to a more limited extent) health economics and
   decision theory. The bulk of this chapter will focus on Jour major
   themes or paradigms from research on healthcare organizations that grew
   from work by faculty and students within the Stanford School of
   Organizational Sociology: Health Care Outcomes, internal Organizational
   Dynamics, Organizations and Their Environments, and Organizational
   Systems of Care and Populations of Care Providers. Following our
   examination of these four paradigms, we will consider their implications
   for current and future debates in health services research and
   healthcare policy.

   sonic practices of EIN. examining how participants construct shared

   construct shared meanings with nonpractitioners shapes the art world of
   EIN and has relevance for the resources available to EIN. In this way. I
   show how sonic practices are involved in the formation of the

AB This article investigates account strategies that individuals employ to
   neutralize identity threats caused by breakups from romantic
   relationships. I distinguish three narrative frames for such accounts:
   dumper, dumpee, and consensus narratives. Individuals who employ a
   consensus narrative frame provide accounts by default: they deny that
   any harm was done to anyone. Dumpers dismissed the breakup's
   conflictuality, used externalization strategies, and depicted themselves
   as empathetic. Dumpees used externalization strategies and denials of
   injury, emphasized their agency, and pointed out valuable changes of
   self. I then analyze the results from a phenomenological perspective to
   identify connections between accounting practices and the structure of
   the self. I argue that accounting for traumatic breakups is important
   for the development of schemes that guide perception, action, and the
   interpretation of biography.

   proposed for this requirement: integrating the knowledge base supplied
   by the regular curriculum, contributing to students' future roles as
   informed citizens, and preparing for study in graduate programs, among
   others. However, few studies have empirically explored the substance of
   the senior seminars and capstones offered across a discipline or studied
   their organization, requirements, and pedagogy. In the present article,
   the authors describe the results of a survey of sociology and psychology
   departments in the western United States regarding their senior seminar

AB Because lecture-based teaching limits student learning, many instructors
   are interested in pedagogical strategies that support critical thinking,
   student participation, and group discussion in large classrooms.
   Audience response systems, or "clickers," are an emerging tool for
   addressing this problem, but predominant pedagogical models for clicker
   use developed in the natural sciences often do not encourage the
   "inquiry-guided learning" that is useful in sociology. This article
   introduces readers to clicker technology and outlines a new pedagogical
   model for clicker use designed to address sociological learning goals,
   including critical thinking, applications of concepts to real-life
   experiences, and critiques of sociological methods. The authors discuss
   the effects of clickers for classroom interaction and students'
   experiences in three undergraduate sociology courses, using quantitative
   and qualitative data about students' perceptions of the effects of this
   pedagogical model on learning. The results suggest that the model
   positively affects participation, critical thinking, and classroom
   interaction dynamics. The authors conclude with practical suggestions
   for instructors considering implementing clickers; in sociology courses.

   strong points of several cooperative learning methods, with additional
   features that help ensure the quality of discussion questions and
   encourage students to read course materials more carefully, prior to
   class. The author has found interteaching to be an effective
   organizational and instructional approach for introductory-level
   sociology courses. The method-produces more focused class discussions as
   well as more focused lectures. Moreover, it is an effective way to
   engage students in sociological theory and research.

AB Recently, a growing contingent of "evolutionary sociologists" has begun
   to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from
   evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of
   sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of
   either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers
   and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with
   research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences.
   These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new
   opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's
   relevance to sociology. In this article, the authors review key issues
   pertaining to evolutionary explanations of social behavior, offer
   clarifications and explanations of several issues that are sometimes
   misrepresented and misunderstood, and provide specific suggestions for
   instructors who are interested in updating and improving the quality of
   instruction on this important topic.

AB Historical reversals highlight a basic methodological problem: is it
   possible to treat two successive periods both as independent cases to
   compare for causal analysis and as parts of a single historical
   sequence? I argue that one strategy for doing so, using models of path
   dependency, imposes serious limits on explanation. An alternative model
   which treats successive periods as contrasting solutions for recurrent
   problems offers two advantages. First, it more effectively combines
   analytical comparisons of different periods with narratives of causal
   sequences spanning two or more periods. Second, it better integrates
   scholarly accounts of historical reversals with actors' own narratives
   of the past.

   the production, publication and reception of the around 300 aphorisms
   that Simmel produced. His close relationship to Gertrud Kantorowicz is
   discussed, since she was given the legal right to many of Simmel's
   aphorisms when he died and also assigned the task of publishing them by
   Simmel. The main themes in Simmel's aphorisms are presented: love, Man,
   philosophy, Lebensphilosophie and art. Two of Simmel's aphorisms are
   also given an extended analysis. It is suggested that the skill of
   writing a good aphorism, both when it comes to style and content, has
   much to do with what we call the art of compression . It is also
   suggested that what ultimately attracted Simmel to the form of aphorism
   was its capacity to hint at something that is richer than the reality we
   are currently experiencing.

AB Social theorists have long recognized that changes in social order have
   cultural consequences but have not been able to provide an
   individual-level mechanism of such effects. Explanations of human
   behavior have only just begun to explore the different evolutionary
   dynamics of social and cultural inheritance. Here we provide
   ethnographic evidence of how cultural evolution, at the level of
   individuals, can be influenced by social evolution. Sociocultural
   epistasis-association of cultural ideas with the hierarchical structure
   of social roles-influences cultural change in unexpected ways. We
   document the existence of cultural exaptation, where a custom's origin
   was not due to acceptance of the later associated ideas. A cultural
   exaptation can develop in the absence of a cultural idea favoring it, or
   even in the presence of a cultural idea against it. Such associations
   indicate a potentially larger role for social evolutionary dynamics in
   explaining individual human behavior than previously anticipated.

AB People often reason egocentrically about others' beliefs, using their
   own beliefs as an inductive guide. Correlational, experimental, and
   neuroimaging evidence suggests that people may be even more egocentric
   when reasoning about a religious agent's beliefs (e.g., God). In both
   nationally representative and more local samples, people's own beliefs
   on important social and ethical issues were consistently correlated more
   strongly with estimates of God's beliefs than with estimates of other
   people's beliefs (Studies 1-4). Manipulating people's beliefs similarly
   influenced estimates of God's beliefs but did not as consistently
   influence estimates of other people's beliefs (Studies 5 and 6). A final
   neuroimaging study demonstrated a clear convergence in neural activity
   when reasoning about one's own beliefs and God's beliefs, but clear
   divergences when reasoning about another person's beliefs (Study 7). In
   particular, reasoning about God's beliefs activated areas associated
   with self-referential thinking more so than did reasoning about another
   person's beliefs. Believers commonly use inferences about God's beliefs
   as a moral compass, but that compass appears especially dependent on
   one's own existing beliefs.

AB Node characteristics and behaviors are often correlated with the
   structure of social networks over time. While evidence of this type of
   assortative mixing and temporal clustering of behaviors among linked
   nodes is used to support claims of peer influence and social contagion
   in networks, homophily may also explain such evidence. Here we develop a
   dynamic matched sample estimation framework to distinguish influence and
   homophily effects in dynamic networks, and we apply this framework to a
   global instant messaging network of 27.4 million users, using data on
   the day-by-day adoption of a mobile service application and users'
   longitudinal behavioral, demographic, and geographic data. We find that
   previous methods overestimate peer influence in product adoption
   decisions in this network by 300-700%, and that homophily explains >50%
   of the perceived behavioral contagion. These findings and methods are
   essential to both our understanding of the mechanisms that drive
   contagions in networks and our knowledge of how to propagate or combat
   them in domains as diverse as epidemiology, marketing, development
   economics, and public health.

AB Background: Leaders are struggling to care for the estimated 143,000,000
   orphans and millions more abandoned children worldwide. Global policy
   makers are advocating that institution-living orphans and abandoned
   children (OAC) be moved as quickly as possible to a residential family
   setting and that institutional care be used as a last resort. This
   analysis tests the hypothesis that institutional care for OAC aged 6-12
   is associated with worse health and wellbeing than community residential
   care using conservative two-tail tests.
   Methodology: The Positive Outcomes for Orphans (POFO) study employed
   two-stage random sampling survey methodology in 6 sites across 5
   countries to identify 1,357 institution-living and 1,480
   community-living OAC ages 6-12, 658 of whom were double-orphans or
   abandoned by both biological parents. Survey analytic techniques were
   used to compare cognitive functioning, emotion, behavior, physical
   health, and growth. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate
   the proportion of variability in child outcomes attributable to the
   study site, care setting, and child levels and institutional versus
   community care settings. Conservative analyses limited the community
   living children to double-orphans or abandoned children.
   Principal Findings: Health, emotional and cognitive functioning, and
   physical growth were no worse for institution-living than
   community-living OAC, and generally better than for community-living OAC
   cared for by persons other than a biological parent. Differences between
   study sites explained 2-23% of the total variability in child outcomes,
   while differences between care settings within sites explained 8-21%.
   Differences among children within care settings explained 64-87%. After
   adjusting for sites, age, and gender, institution vs. community-living
   explained only 0.3-7% of the variability in child outcomes.
   Conclusion: This study does not support the hypothesis that
   institutional care is systematically associated with poorer wellbeing
   than community care for OAC aged 6-12 in those countries facing the
   greatest OAC burden. Much greater variability among children within care
   settings was observed than among care settings type. Methodologically
   rigorous studies must be conducted in those countries facing the new OAC
   epidemic in order to understand which characteristics of care promote
   child wellbeing. Such characteristics may transcend the structural
   definitions of institutions or family homes.

AB Compared with more explicit racial slurs and statements, biased facial
   expressions and body language may resist conscious identification and
   thus produce a hidden social influence. In four studies, we show that
   race biases can be subtly transmitted via televised nonverbal behavior.
   Characters on 11 popular television shows exhibited more negative
   nonverbal behavior toward black than toward status-matched white
   characters. Critically, exposure to prowhite (versus problack) nonverbal
   bias increased viewers' bias even though patterns of nonverbal behavior
   could not be consciously reported. These findings suggest that hidden
   patterns of televised nonverbal behavior influence bias among viewers.

AB Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to
   exhibit universal patterns(1-19). The size distributions of casualties
   both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have
   separately been shown to follow approximate power-law
   distributions(6,7,9,10). However, the possibility of universal patterns
   ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of
   within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the
   sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts
   exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human
   insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains
   conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules
   of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology
   of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common
   decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent
   hypotheses about modern insurgency(18-20), is robust to many
   generalizations(21), and establishes a quantitative connection between
   human insurgency, global terrorism(10) and ecology(13-17,22,23). Its
   similarity to financial market models(24-26) provides a surprising link
   between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.

AB Objectives: We evaluated changes in characteristics of clients
   presenting for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) before and during
   care and treatment center (CTC) scale-up activities in Moshi, Tanzania,
   between November 2003 and December 2007.
   Methods: Consecutive clients were surveyed after pretest counseling, and
   rapid HIV antibody testing was performed. Trend tests were used to
   assess changes in seroprevalence and client characteristics over time.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the
   contribution of changes in sociodemographic and behavioral risk
   characteristics, and symptoms, to changes in seroprevalence before and
   during CTC scale-up.
   Results: Data from 4391 first-time VCT clients were analyzed. HIV
   seroprevalence decreased from 26.2% to 18.9% after the availability of
   free antiretroviral therapy and expansion of CTCs beyond regional and
   referral hospitals. Seroprevalence decreased by 27% for females (P =
   0.0002) and 34% for males (P = 0.0125). Declines in seropositivity
   coincided with decreases in symptoms among males and females (P <
   0.0001) and a more favorable distribution of sociodemographic risks
   among females (P = 0.002). No changes in behavioral risk characteristics
   were observed.
   Conclusions: Concurrent with the scale-up of CTCs, HIV seroprevalence
   and rates of symptoms declined sharply at an established freestanding
   VCT site in Moshi, Tanzania. If more HIV infected persons access VCT at
   sites where antiretrovirals are offered, freestanding VCT sites may
   become a less cost-effective means for HIV case finding.

AB The management of nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) terrorism
   events is critical to reducing morbidity and mortality in the next
   decade; however, initial patient care considerations and protective
   actions for staff are unfamiliar to most front-line clinicians. High
   explosive events (bomb and blast) remain the most common type of
   terrorism and are easy to detect. Conversely, some types of terrorist
   attacks are more likely to be unsuspected or covert. This paper explains
   the current threat of terrorism and describes clues for detection that
   an event has occurred. Specific criteria that should lead to a high
   suspicion for terrorism are illustrated. The manuscript outlines initial
   actions and clinical priorities for management and treatment of patients
   exposed to nuclear/radiological, biological, chemical and combined
   agents (for example an explosion involving a chemical agent). Examples
   of terrorist events include: a nuclear explosion, an aerosolised release
   of anthrax (biological), dissemination of sarin in a subway (chemical),
   and the detonation of a radiologic dispersion device or "dirty bomb"
   (combined explosive and radiological). Basic principles of
   decontamination include potential risks to healthcare providers from
   secondary exposure and contamination. Unique issues may hinder clinical
   actions. These include coordination with law enforcement for a crime
   scene, public health entities for surveillance and monitoring, hazardous
   materials teams for decontamination, and the media for risk
   communications. Finally, the importance of personal preparedness is
   discussed.

AB Background: Although discrimination has been identified as a potential
   determinant of existing racial/ethnic health disparities, no sutdies
   have investigated whether racial discrimination contributes to
   disparities in physical activity.
   Purpose: The primary aim Of the current study was to examine the
   association between interpersonal racial discrimination and physical
   activity.
   Methods: Baseline data were collected during 2004-2005 among a
   predominately black and Hispanic sample of adult residents living in 12
   low-income-housing sites in Boston MA (n=1055). Residents reported
   experiences of lifetime racial discrimination during
   interviewer-administered surveys and wore a pedometer for 5 days to
   measure physical activity. For analyses, performed in 2009, linear
   regression models with a cluster design were conducted to predict
   physical activity, measured as steps per day.
   Results: Nearly 48% of participants reported ever experiencing racial
   discrimination, and discrimination was most commonly experienced on the
   street or in a public setting. No association was found between
   discrimination and physical activity, when examined in bivariate,
   multivariable, or race-stratified models.
   Conclusions: The current results indicate that self-reported racial
   discrimination is not a key determinant of physical activity among
   residents living in low-income housing. However, additional research is
   warranted to address current limitations of this, study. (Am J Prev Med

AB Objectives. We examined potential pathways by which time in the United
   States may relate to differences in the predicted probability of
   past-year psychiatric disorder among Latino immigrants as compared with
   US-born Latinos.
   Methods. We estimated predicted probabilities of psychiatric disorder
   for US-born and immigrant groups with varying time in the United States,
   adjusting for different combinations of covariates. We examined 6
   pathways by which time in the United States could be associated with
   psychiatric disorders.
   Results. Increased time in the United States is associated with higher
   risk of psychiatric disorders among Latino immigrants. After adjustment
   for covariates, differences in psychiatric disorder rates between
   US-born and immigrant Latinos disappear. Discrimination and family
   cultural conflict appear to play a significant role in the association
   between time in the United States and the likelihood of developing
   psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions. Increased perceived discrimination and family cultural
   conflict are pathways by which acculturation might relate to
   deterioration of mental health for immigrants. Future studies assessing
   how these implicit pathways evolve as contact with US culture increases
   may help to identify strategies for ensuring maintenance of mental
   health for Latino immigrants. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:2247-2254.

   are made supports healthful food options.
   Purpose This study aims to review research that examines factors having
   an influence on food choices in social environments, physical
   environments, and macroenvironments.
   Methods A snowball strategy was used to identify relevant peer-reviewed
   studies and reviews, with a focus on research completed in the US and
   published within the past 10 years.
   Results Research has identified a number of environmental factors
   associated with dietary intake; however, the majority of completed
   studies have methodological limitations which limit their credibility to
   guide interventions and policy changes.
   Conclusions Future research will need to emphasize multilevel
   investigations, examine how associations vary across population
   subgroups, develop a standard set of measures for assessing food

AB Sexual initiation during adolescence has important demographic and
   health consequences for a population, yet no systematic analysis of
   changes in the timing of sexual initiation has been conducted in
   Nigeria. Two rounds of national surveys conducted in 1990 and 2003 were
   used to examine changes in the timing of sexual initiation among female
   adolescents in Nigeria. Multivariate survival analysis using Cox
   proportional hazards models was used to assess changes in the risk of
   sexual initiation and to identify the correlates of first sex. Contrary
   to what has been reported in several Nigerian studies, there was no
   decline in age at first sex among Christian adolescents. Age at first
   sex did not change significantly for Christian adolescents, although
   premarital sex appears to have increased-primarily due to an increase in
   the age at marriage. Age at first sex did increase among Muslim women.
   Premarital sex remained low among Muslim women. A number of
   socioeconomic variables were associated with the timing of sexual
   initiation. Weekly exposure to the mass media was associated with
   earlier sexual initiation. The degree to which an environment was
   liberal or restrictive was a key determinant of the timing of sexual
   initiation in Nigeria. The findings also illustrate the important role
   of socioeconomic factors in determining the timing of sexual initiation
   in Nigeria. As secondary education increases in Northern Nigeria,
   additional increases in the age at sexual debut are likely among Muslim
   women. The study raises concerns about the influence of the mass media
   on the timing of first sex in Nigeria. The evidence of an absence of
   changes in the timing of sexual initiation among Christian women in more
   than a decade implies that programs which aim to delay the timing of
   sexual initiation in Southern Nigeria may have limited success. With age
   at marriage already high among Christian women, programs that focus on
   abstinence until marriage may also be pursuing an approach with limited
   chances of success.

AB The Quantum Co-Evolution Unit: An Example of 'Awa (Kava- Piper
   methysticum G. Foster) in Hawaiian Culture. The process of co-evolution
   occurs in many kinds of relationships and on various scales. One example
   of a co-evolutionary relationship is that of a plant and a culture with
   which it interacts. Such relationships are dynamic and ever changing.
   Researchers have discussed this concept and its implications for
   decades, yet no quantifiable unit or standardized scale has been
   accepted with which to measure this change. The theoretical "quantum
   co-evolution unit" (QCU) is proposed as the smallest measurable scale of
   interactions between plants and people. A collection of QCUs for a
   linked plant and human population would be its "ethnobotanical
   population." This could be measured at various points in time to
   quantify the changing relationships between plants and people. These
   models set up a structure to discuss methodologies for quantifying
   co-evolutionary relationships such as are seen in the evolution of
   ethnobotanical populations. The co-evolving relationship between 'awa
   (kava-Piper methysticum) and Hawaiian culture is used as an example to
   illustrate this idea.

   ideas. The integrity of much quantitative research is compromised,

   data offer important correctives to this problem. We illustrate the
   interplay of quantitative and qualitative research methods by examining

   that he made a contribution in raising important issues about the role
   of theory in ethnography. The responses to his review that address this
   issue, especially those by Anderson and Duneier, are also important
   because they help to broaden our understanding of how theory is used in
   ethnographic research. What we take from this exchange is that good
   ethnography is theory driven, and is likely to be much more reflective
   of inductive theoretical insights than those that are purely deductive.
   Moreover, we show that in some ethnographic studies the theoretical
   insights are neither strictly deductive nor inductive, but represent a
   combination of both.

   (HPV) vaccine, which prevents many cervical cancers, and male
   circumcision as potential HIV preventive. In the United States, attempts
   to mandate HPV vaccination have activated intense concerns about female
   "promiscuity," whereas talk of promoting circumcision against HIV has
   triggered scant anxiety about American boys' sexuality. The authors show
   how intersections among gender, sexuality, race, and age have shaped
   responses to these two containment technologies-and how the
   technologies' deployment both relies on and reproduces meanings of
   gender and sexuality that constitute the omnipresent " double standard."
   The analysis develops an original feminist sociology of containment,
   explicating how social relations shape the innovation, reinvention, and
   use of technologies to contain particular sorts of bodies, fluids, and
   sexual practices-by whom, under what conditions, and for what purposes.

   (Lawton and Nahemow 1973) is proposed as a theoretical framework for
   understanding, assessing, and optimising family-based caregiving. This
   paper presents findings from a qualitative study of informal
   rehabilitation caregiving provided to elderly stroke survivors in
   Thailand. Four main rehabilitation dimensions (biological,
   psychological, social, spiritual) are identified, as are three main
   caregiver needs (information, assistance, and support). We suggest that
   while the Person-Environment Model is useful in developed nations, it is
   perhaps more valuable in societies where fewer options to family-based
   eldercare exist, and thus where effective informal eldercare is more
   critical. Implications for education and training of health care
   providers are also discussed.

AB While anti-ageing medicine may be defined by efforts to control human
   aging, individual motivation to utilise anti-ageing medicine proves to
   be multifaceted. Qualitative, in-depth interviews with 15 people who
   have used anti-ageing medicine reveal that the turn to anti-ageing
   medicine may be more about disillusionment with allopathic medicine than
   it is about controlling bodily aging. By contextualising people's use of
   anti-ageing medicine within their lifelong body regimen 'careers', and
   looking closely at the first career sequence, which is characterised by
   a questioning of tradition the tradition of allopathic medicine new
   perspectives behind the rise of anti-ageing medicine are offered. Shared
   grievances with mainstream medicine tend to be situated around both the
   medical delivery and the medical treatment. Rather than reject the
   values associated with biomedicine, as is often the case with
   alternative health enthusiasts (Siahpush 1998), those using anti-ageing
   medicine seek out an 'alternative' biomedicine that they perceive to
   offer more satisfactory solutions to their problems.

AB From the earliest days of the Soviet Union, the people of Tajikistan
   were allowed to have small "kitchen gardens" attached to their homes or
   in the vicinity of their apartments in which they could augment their
   diets with fresh food and also keep a milk cow and perhaps chickens.
   Over time however, families began to produce far more than they needed
   and would sell the surplus in local markets, along roads, and even in
   nearby cities-an early example of market-oriented, investment
   agriculture in Central Asia. By the end of the Soviet era, as much as
   one third of food sold in the markets was from kitchen gardens. In
   post-independence Tajikistan, these gardens have allowed families facing
   civil war, drought, and demodernization to feed themselves and earn some
   extra income. This paper describes the historic geography, layout and
   crops of kitchen gardens, and provides quantitative data on the economic
   importance of these gardens.

AB First-person reports of oocyte donors, years after their donation, can
   give valuable information about medical complications of oocyte
   donation, as well as changes potentially required in procedures and
   priorities of US-based in vitro fertilization (IVF) centers. This paper
   reports findings from an online survey of former oocyte donors.
   The instrument was an author-constructed questionnaire completed online
   on the Donor Sibling Registry website. Questions assessed women's
   accounts of medical complications, contact with the infertility clinic
   through which they had provided ova, and information exchange or contact
   with people conceived from their ova.
   Responses were received from 49.1% of the 287 donors with valid e-mail
   addresses. The 155 respondents completed the survey an average of 9.4
   years after their first donation. Reported medical complications
   included ovarian hypersensitivity syndrome (30.3%) and infertility
   (9.6%). Subsequent to ova donation, 2.6% of women reported that they had
   been contacted by the IVF clinic for medical updates. On the
   questionnaire, 34.2% of women reported that medical changes they thought
   would interest donor children; half said that they had attempted to
   report these changes to the clinic with variable results. Many, who did
   not report such information, did not realize they could or should.
   Donors said that they frequently had not sought information about
   pregnancy outcomes because of confusion about the definition of
   'anonymity' or 'confidentiality'.
   US-based IVF clinics need to give clearer guidelines to anonymous oocyte
   donors about follow-up information exchange. Additional long-term
   studies are needed to ascertain oocyte donors' risks of infertility or
   cancer.

AB Objectives: To evaluate a social network approach to develop an
   adolescent cohort for HIV vaccine preparedness and investigate
   characteristics that influence recruitment.
   Methods: We summarize baseline data from a prospective cohort study that
   included 4 sessions over 6 months. Fifty-nine HIV-infected adolescent
   and adult patients of a family-based HIV clinic named significant others
   and indicated willingness to involve them in this study. Sixty-two
   adolescent and adult significant others not known to be HIV infected
   were enrolled. Logistic regression was used to estimate factors
   associated with willingness.
   Results: Participants identified 624 social network members including
   276 adolescents (44%). Network member's awareness of the index's HIV
   positivity (P < 0.01) and older age (P = 0.05) affected willingness.
   Respondents were less willing to invite drug-risk alters (P = 0.006).
   Adolescents were willing to invite more adolescents than were adults (P
   < 0.0001). Adolescents younger than 18 years old reported fewer sexual
   and drug-using risk behaviors than expected.
   Conclusions: HIV-infected patients are willing to recruit their social
   networks, provided concerns about disclosure of HIV status are
   addressed. Using social networks to identify and recruit adolescent
   populations is appropriate and feasible for vaccine preparedness
   activities, future vaccine trials, and other prevention programs, but
   procedures are needed to selectively identify and retain high-risk
   youth.

   patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Alongside
   traditional religiousness measures, we examined sense of reverence in
   religious and secular contexts. Face-to-face interviews were conducted
   with 177 patients 2 weeks before surgery at a medical center. Medical
   variables were retrieved from the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons'
   Database. Logistic and multiple regression models were performed to
   predict outcomes. Prayer frequencies were associated with reduced
   complications but not hospitalization. Sense of reverence in secular
   contexts predicted fewer complications and shorter hospitalization.
   Controlling for complications reduced the initial influence of reverence
   on hospitalization, suggesting the potential mediation of complications.
   No interaction between demographics and faith factors was evident. The
   role of faith in medicine is complex and context-dependent. Future
   studies are needed on mediating factors.

AB Annie Marion MacLean was a major Chicago sociologist and methodologist.
   She was profoundly influenced by the gendered division of labor in
   sociology during her era. MacLean combined her work with the men and
   women of the early Chicago school of sociology and the women of
   Hull-House, an early social settlement. As a feminist pragmatist,
   MacLean was both a theorist and practitioner who used qualitative and
   quantitative methods. She set precedents in the Chicago school of
   ethnography, participant observation, and critical methodology. MacLean,
   however, was not the "mother" of ethnography. Harriet Martineau holds a
   far stronger claim to be a founding contributor to the origin and
   development of ethnographic methodologies in the social sciences.

AB Based on socio-economic development and population growth, rapid
   Urbanisation is currently happening in China, leading to urban expansion
   and land use changes. This, in turn, affects biodiversity, habitats and
   ecosystem services. It is therefore important to identify and assess the
   impact Of urban development policies (UDP) on ecosystems and their
   components at a policy level. Ji'nan City, the capital of Shandong
   Province in Northern China, has been taken as a case study for assessing
   the ecological impact of UDP. The Study found that, influenced by the
   traditional economy-oriented development strategy, the former UDP of
   Ji'nan City was mainly focused on urban socio-economic growth by
   speeding Lip the construction of urban infrastructure facilities,
   expanding urban built-up areas as well as strengthening the development
   of resource and pollution-intensive industry, which in turn has
   negatively influenced the ecosystem services. The promulgation of
   eco-environmentally friendly UDP Would contribute to protect and
   maintain the ecosystems and their components. Finally, recommendations
   for informing the legislation of new environmentally friendly UDPs and
   furthering the implementation of ecological impact assessment (EcIA) in
   China are proposed.

   recovery homes across the United States regarding their attitudes and
   opinions about renting to these homes, and motivations for community
   service. Results indicated that landlords generally had positive

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of sex and marital status in the
   distribution and consequences of cardiovascular risk factors for stroke.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort.
   SETTING: U.S. national sample, community based.
   PARTICIPANTS: U.S. adults aged 50 and older and their spouses.
   MEASUREMENTS: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) participants born
   between 1900 and 1947 (N = 22,818), aged 50 and older, and stroke-free
   at baseline were followed an average of 9.4 years for self- or
   proxy-reported stroke (2,372 events). Financial resources, behavioral
   risk factors, and cardiovascular conditions were used to predict
   incident stroke in Cox proportional hazard models stratified according
   to sex and marital status (married, widowed, divorced or separated, or
   never married).
   RESULTS: Women were less likely to be married than men. The distribution
   of risk factors differed according to sex and marital status. Men had
   higher incident stroke rates than women, even after full risk factor
   adjustment (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
   1.11-1.34). For both sexes, being never married or widowed predicted
   greater risk, associations that were attenuated after adjustment for
   financial resources. Widowed men had the highest risk (HR = 1.40, 95 %
   CI = 1.1.2-1.74 vs married women). Lower income and wealth were
   associated with similarly high risk across subgroups, although this risk
   factor especially affected unmarried women, with this group reporting
   the lowest income and wealth levels. Most other risk factors had similar
   HRs across subgroups, although moderate alcohol use did not predict
   lower stroke risk in unmarried women.
   CONCLUSION: Stroke incidence and risk factors vary substantially
   according to sex and marital status. It is likely that gendered social
   experiences, such as marriage and socioeconomic disadvantage, mediate
   pathways linking sex and stroke. J Am Geriatr Soc 57:2293-2299, 2009.

AB Numerous studies have examined the influence of victim race on capital
   punishment, with a smaller number focused on victim gender. But death
   penalty scholars have largely ignored victim social status. Drawing on
   Black's (1976) multidimensional theoretical concept, the current
   research examines the impact of victim social status on the district
   attorney's decision to seek the death penalty and the jury's decision to
   impose a death sentence. The data include the population of cases
   indicted for capital murder in Harris County (Houston), Texas, from 1992
   to 1999 (n=5504). The findings suggest that victim social status has a
   robust influence on the ultimate state sanction: Death was more likely
   to be sought and imposed on behalf of high-status victims who were
   integrated, sophisticated, conventional, and respectable. The research
   also has implications beyond capital punishment. Because victim social
   status has rarely been investigated in the broader sentencing
   literature, Black's concept provides a theoretical tool that could be
   used to address such an important omission.

AB This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus

   culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent
   findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the
   analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals
   to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this
   conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied
   metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet
   Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors,
   and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the
   group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for
   either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied
   metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social
   bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of
   embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and
   group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be
   more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than
   is modernist culture.

AB This paper applies concepts from the sociology and anthropology of

   effective safety Culture in the workplace. It highlights unintended
   consequences of combining bureaucratic control and shared governance and
   identifies sources of inertia within already existing safety cultures.
   The data come from focus group interviews with workers in a research and
   development facility of a multinational corporation in the Western U.S.
   It is found that safety protocols, rules, and rhetoric, combined with
   efforts to give workers more responsibility for safety in the workplace,
   create tendencies toward worker alienation, shame with regard to
   injuries, complacency, and fear of bureaucratic processes. Therefore it
   appears that some efforts to create safety culture in the workplace may
   unintentionally undermine the goal of manufacturing safety. (C) 2009

   In this article, we analyze voter choice data from six U.S. presidential

   effects on voter choice.
   Methods
   Voter choice is analyzed over the period 1980 to 2000 with multivariate
   statistical models.
   Results
   A link is found between voter choice and religious identity, where the
   effect of religious identity on voter choice is contingent on location
   within the stratification order defined by race, class, and gender. The
   article proposes a theory to explain the contingent link between voter
   choice and religious identity; the theory is derived from classical
   sociology.
   Conclusion
   In the United States, political behavior related to religious identity
   is contingent on the individual's location within the stratification

AB Objective
   Adolescent weight and depressive symptoms are serious population health
   concerns in their own right and as they relate to each other. This study
   asks whether relationships between weight and depressive symptoms vary
   by sex and race/ethnicity because both shape experiences of weight and
   psychological distress.
   Methods
   Results are based on multivariate analyses of National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data.
   Results
   There are no associations between adolescent girls' weight and
   depressive symptoms, but these associations vary considerably among
   boys. Underweight is associated with depressive symptoms among all boys
   and subpopulations of white and Hispanic boys. Among Hispanic boys,
   those who are overweight (vs. normal weight) have a lower probability of
   reporting depressive symptoms. Finally, among normal weight boys,
   Hispanics and blacks are more likely to report depressive symptoms than
   whites.
   Conclusions
   Findings are a reminder that understanding population health issues
   sometimes requires a focus on subpopulations, not simply the population
   as a whole.

AB Supported by previous empirical work, theory from sociology of religion
   and migration provide testable hypotheses in predicting changes in
   immigrant religious participation surrounding the migratory event. Due
   to data constraints, however, these hypotheses have escaped broad-based
   analysis. Using the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), religious participation
   from pre- to postmigration time periods is found to decrease among
   recent immigrants to the United States. Individual-level characteristics
   (i.e., gender, familial conditions, employment) do not substantially
   explain this decline; alternatively, contextual-level factors (i.e.,
   religious pluralism and religious concentration) partially mediate this
   drop in immigrant religiosity.

AB With larger percentages of high school students entering higher
   education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes
   occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using
   in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class
   structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I
   argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for
   stratification because it is there that students gain access to social
   and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that
   upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources
   that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate
   their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial
   factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources
   further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings
   contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing
   that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the
   outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources
   throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that
   symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent
   relationship between social and cultural capital.

AB The question of the extent to which Durkheim's argument in Division of
   Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work
   of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In
   this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent
   scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of
   "representation" and "dualism" in Durkheim's overall thought. The
   analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism
   is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is
   based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system.
   Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely
   misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of
   Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in
   order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes
   that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the
   primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of
   "individualism." This necessitates the analytical distinction between
   the two conceptions of " the individual," which I label the
   "bio-psychological" and the "sociological."

AB Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an "impulse" toward sociability,
   defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an
   end in itself. While sociability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates
   a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize
   symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans
   engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from
   ethnomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a
   way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to
   interactions among humans. Beginning with a conceptualization of play as
   an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize
   situated interactions, this article argues that humans can engage in
   playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the
   play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of
   the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies
   how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume
   that interactants share intersubjectivity. The article concludes by
   offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities
   of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and
   other situational factors.

AB Institutional differentiation has been one of the central concerns of
   sociology since the days of Auguste Comte. However, the overarching
   tendency among institutionalists such as Durkheim or Spencer has been to
   treat the process of differentiation from a macro, "outside in"
   perspective. Missing from this analysis is how institutional
   differentiation occurs from the "inside out," or through the efforts and
   struggles of individual and corporate actors. Despite the recent efforts
   of the "new institutionalism" to fill in this gap, a closer look at the
   literature will uncover the fact that (1) it has tended to conflate
   macro-level institutions and meso-level organizations and (2) this has
   led to a taken for granted approach to institutional dynamics. This
   article seeks to develop a general theory of institutional autonomy;
   autonomy is a function of the degree to which specialized corporate
   units are structurally and symbolically independent of other corporate
   units. It is argued herein that the process by which these
   "institutional entrepreneurs" become independent can explain how
   institutions become differentiated from the "inside out." Moreover, this
   article offers five dimensions that can be operationalized, measuring
   the degree to which institutions are autonomous.

AB The story of declining rural churches is a powerful one. A story of
   declining rural churches in declining communities is engaging on both
   the cognitive and emotional levels and leads the hearer into the
   powerful narrative of modernization. Yet, it is a story that neglects
   the migration trends into more rural areas. I argue that narrative of
   declining rural churches is a story about moral order, an emotional
   story imbued with a sense of loss for a world inconsistent with the
   world in which most of us live our lives. I suggest that the persistence
   of this story is an expression of the ambivalence some people feel about
   modern life, as they choose new ways of doing things that work for them,
   but at the same time, imagine a loss of the emotional connection
   embedded in the old ways. I suggest we move to thinking about these
   individual rural communities as borderlands in the way that Gloria
   Anzaldua uses the term, and to describe what happens in communities-when
   established residents invite newcomers into their churches-as
   encounters. Furthermore, I show that how the work of ethnographers takes
   place inside of the borderland, and is part of the process of encounter.
   Finally, I argue that for all participants, encounters bring with them
   the possibility of change.

AB Based on socio-economic development and population growth, rapid
   Urbanisation is currently happening in China, leading to urban expansion
   and land use changes. This, in turn, affects biodiversity, habitats and
   ecosystem services. It is therefore important to identify and assess the
   impact Of urban development policies (UDP) on ecosystems and their
   components at a policy level. Ji'nan City, the capital of Shandong
   Province in Northern China, has been taken as a case study for assessing
   the ecological impact of UDP. The Study found that, influenced by the
   traditional economy-oriented development strategy, the former UDP of
   Ji'nan City was mainly focused on urban socio-economic growth by
   speeding Lip the construction of urban infrastructure facilities,
   expanding urban built-up areas as well as strengthening the development
   of resource and pollution-intensive industry, which in turn has
   negatively influenced the ecosystem services. The promulgation of
   eco-environmentally friendly UDP Would contribute to protect and
   maintain the ecosystems and their components. Finally, recommendations
   for informing the legislation of new environmentally friendly UDPs and
   furthering the implementation of ecological impact assessment (EcIA) in
   China are proposed.

AB Methodologies of historical sociology face research problems centered on
   the instability of historical referents, their historical
   non-independence, and the privileging of objective time of the clock and
   calendar. The present essay, by reflecting on an analysis of the
   apocalyptic in the long run (Hall 2009), proposes the potential to solve
   these problems by way of a phenomenology of history, which analyzes the
   enactment and interplay of multiple social temporalities. Whereas
   high-modern theories of modernity tended to portray a secular trend
   toward the triumph of rationalized social order centred in diachronic
   time, analysis of the historical emergence of apocalyptic times in
   relation to other temporalities - especially objective (or diachronic)
   temporalities, the here-and-now, and the collective synchronic - reveals
   that the apocalyptic has survived within modernity through the
   articulation of rationalized diachronic time with the sacred strategic
   time of apocalyptically framed 'holy war.' Overall, the 'empire of
   modernity' is a hybrid formation that bridges diachronic and strategic
   temporalities. Despite diachronic developments that tend toward what
   Habermas described as the colonization of the lifeworld, a
   phenomenological analysis suggests the durability of the here-and-now
   and collective synchronic times. These analyses unveil a research agenda
   that deconstructs the high-modern 'past' versus 'present' binary in
   favour of a model that analyzes the interplay of multiple social forms,
   and thus encourages a retheorization of modernity as 'recomposition'
   encompassing multiple temporalities.

AB This paper proposes a theory-based approach to the understanding of
   social change and illustrates that theory with examples from the history
   and politics of public health. Based in large part on the work of
   anthropologist Marshall Sahlins (see in particular his Islands of
   History published in (1985) William Sewell Jr. has proposed an 'eventful
   sociology.' In this work 'event' is a term of art meaning occurrences in
   human affairs that result in social change. Sewell's approach and that
   of Charles Tilly are in many respects complementary, a major difference
   being Sewell's far greater emphasis on meaning and interpretation by
   engaged actors as essential to understanding of how historical processes
   unfold. In this paper I further elaborate Sahlins' and Sewell's ideas,
   first by showing their connection with concepts that may be more
   familiar to sociologists and, second, by examining the contingent
   character of social change. Drawing on my own research on the history of
   public health, I argue that the transformation of 'happenings' into
   events and of events into meaningful social change are highly contingent
   on the social and political context within which these events occur.
   More generally, I hope to show that 'eventful' sociology is an exciting
   and productive approach to sociological analysis.

AB The evolution of organismality is a social process. All organisms
   originated from groups of simpler units that now show high cooperation
   among the parts and are nearly free of conflicts. We suggest that this
   near-unanimous cooperation be taken as the defining trait of organisms.
   Consistency then requires that we accept some unconventional organisms,
   including some social insect colonies, some microbial groups and
   viruses, a few sexual partnerships and a number of mutualistic
   associations. Whether we call these organisms or not, a major task is to
   explain such cooperative entities, and our survey suggests that many of
   the traits commonly used to define organisms are not essential. These
   non-essential traits include physical contiguity, indivisibility,
   clonality or high relatedness, development from a single cell,
   short-term and long-term genetic cotransmission, germ-soma separation
   and membership in the same species.

AB The question as to whether cultures evolve in a manner analogous to that
   of genetic evolution can be addressed by attempting to reconstruct
   population histories using cultural data. As others have argued, this
   can only succeed if cultures are isolated enough to maintain and pass on
   a central core of traditions that can be modified over time. In this
   study we used a set of cultural data (canoe design traits from
   Polynesia) to look for the kinds of patterns and relationships normally
   found in population genetic studies. After developing new techniques to
   accommodate the peculiarities of cultural data, we were able to infer an
   ancestral region (Fiji) and a sequence of cultural origins for these
   Polynesian societies. In addition, we found evidence of cultural
   exchange, migration and a serial founder effect. Results were stronger
   when analyses were based on functional traits (presumably subject to
   natural selection and convergence) rather than symbolic or stylistic
   traits (probably subject to cultural selection for rapid divergence).
   These patterns strongly suggest that cultural evolution, while clearly
   affected by cultural exchange, is also subject to some of the same
   processes and constraints as genetic evolution.

AB Evolutionary researchers have recently suggested that pre-modern human
   societies habitually practised cooperative breeding and that this
   feature helps explain human prosocial tendencies. Despite circumstantial
   evidence that post-reproductive females and extra-pair males both
   provide resources required for successful reproduction by mated pairs,
   no study has yet provided details about the flow of food resources by
   different age and sex categories to breeders and offspring, nor
   documented the ratio of helpers to breeders. Here, we show in two
   hunter-gatherer societies of South America that each breeding pair with
   dependent offspring on average obtained help from approximately 1.3
   non-reproductive adults. Young married males and unmarried males of all
   ages were the main food providers, accounting for 93-100% of all excess
   food production available to breeding pairs and their offspring. Thus,
   each breeding pair with dependants was provisioned on average by 0.8
   adult male helpers. The data provide no support for the hypothesis that
   post-reproductive females are the main provisioners of younger
   reproductive-aged kin in hunter-gatherer societies. Demographic and food
   acquisition data show that most breeding pairs can expect food deficits
   owing to foraging luck, health disabilities and accumulating dependency
   ratio of offspring in middle age, and that extra-pair provisioning may
   be essential to the evolved human life history.

   occupation. Height, sitting height, estimated leg length, weight, and
   the body mass index in 218 boys and 191 girls in 1972 and 173 boys and
   166 girls in 2000 were compared. Sex-specific MANCOVA was used to
   evaluate SES differences within each year, while sex- and SES-specific
   MANCOVA was used to evaluate differences between years. The prevalence
   of stunting, overweight and obesity was estimated. There were no SES
   differences among boys and girls in 1972 and boys in 2000; low-middle
   and middle SES girls were significantly taller and heavier with longer
   legs than low SES girls in 2000. Within each SES group, children in 2000
   were significantly larger in body size and segment lengths except for
   sitting height in low SES children of both sexes. Estimated secular
   gains increased from low to low-middle to middle SES in both sexes.
   Inequitable gains by SES contributed to an increase in the magnitude of
   differences between SES groups, especially between low SES children on
   one hand and low-middle and middle SES children on the other hand. The
   prevalence of stunting declined while the prevalence of overweight and
   to a lesser extent in obesity increased from 1972 to 2000, more so in

AB Compared to other mammals, human milk is dilute which lowers the
   relative daily cost of lactation allowing women greater flexibility in
   the strategies they use to meet the energy demands of lactation. These
   strategies include increasing dietary intake, reducing energy
   expenditure, and drawing on energy stores. Women are affected by the
   biosocial context in which they live, including norms regarding the
   sexual division of labor and diet and activity patterns during
   lactation, as well as household-level factors such as economic strategy
   and the availability of social support. This paper combines longitudinal
   data on dietary intake, energy expenditure, and body weight of 23
   lactating Amazonian women living in a subsistence-based economy with
   detailed ethnographic data and considers how adherence to the cultural
   norms and the availability of social support contributed to
   intra-population variation in maternal energetic strategies. Dietary
   intake was found to vary more than energy expenditure. Adherence to
   dietary restrictions during the postpartum period of resguardo
   significantly reduced intra-population variation in energy intake. Women
   with social support came closer to achieving energy balance during
   resguardo (t = 2.8; P = 0.01) and peak lactation (t = 2.7; P = 0.02) and

AB Context: Epidemiologists and public health researchers are studying
   neighborhood's effect on individual health. The health of older adults
   may be more influenced by their neighborhoods as a result of decreased
   mobility. However, research on neighborhood's influence on older adults'
   health, specifically, is limited.
   Evidence acquisition: Recent studies on neighborhood and health for
   older adults were identified. Studies were identified through searches
   of databases including PsycINFO, CINAHL, PubMed, Academic Search
   Premier, Ageline, Social Science Citation Index, and Health Source.
   Criteria for inclusion were as follows: human studies; English language;
   study sample included adults aged >= 55 years; health outcomes,
   including mental health, health behaviors, morbidity, and mortality;
   neighborhood as the primary exposure variable of interest; empirical
   research; and studies that included >= 10 neighborhoods. Air pollution
   studies were excluded. Five hundred thirty-eight relevant articles were
   published during 19972007; a total of 33 of these articles met inclusion
   criteria.
   Evidence synthesis: The measures of objective and perceived aspects of
   neighborhood were summarized. Neighborhood was primarily operationalized
   using census-defined boundaries. Measures of neighborhood were
   principally derived from objective sources of data; eight studies
   assessed perceived neighborhood alone or in combination with objective
   measures. Six categories of neighborhood characteristics were
   socioeconomic composition, racial composition, demographics, perceived
   resources and/or problems, physical environment, and social environment.
   The studies are primarily cross-sectional and use administrative data to
   characterize neighborhood.
   Conclusions: These studies suggest that neighborhood environment is
   important for older adults' health and functioning. (Am J Prev Med

AB PURPOSE: In epidemiologic studies, neighborhood characteristics are
   often assigned to individuals based on a single residence despite the
   fact that people frequently move and, for most cancer outcomes, the
   relevant time-window of exposure is not known. The authors evaluated
   residential mobility patterns for a population-based series of childhood
   leukemia cases enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia
   Study.
   METHODS: Complete residential history from I year before birth to date
   of diagnosis was obtained for 380 cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2002.
   All residences were assigned U.S. Census block group designations using
   a geographic information system.
   RESULTS: Overall, two-thirds (65.8%) of children had moved between birth
   and diagnosis, and one-third (34.5%) moved during the first year of
   life. Approximately 25% of the mothers had moved during the year before
   the child's birth. Multivariable analysis indicated greater residential
   mobility to be associated with older age of the child at diagnosis,
   younger age of the mother at child's birth, and lower household income.
   Among those who had moved, residential urban/rural status for birth and
   diagnosis residences changed for about 20% of subjects, and neighborhood
   socioeconomic status for 35%.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neighborhood attribute estimates
   in health studies should account for patterns of residential mobility.
   Estimates based on a single residential location at a single point in
   time may lead to different inferences. Ann Epidemiol 2009; 19:834-840.

AB The rapid diffusion of high performance work organizations (HPWO) has
   attracted the attention of many scholars in sociology and psychology
   over the last three decades. One area in which ongoing debates and
   evidence are inconclusive is the linkage between HPWO and the
   'psychological functioning' of employees, specifically the issues of job
   satisfaction and job stress. This study examines, and thereby extends
   our understanding of, associations between workplace restructuring -
   adopting an 'internalization strategy' within HPWO - with job
   satisfaction and job stress. The findings reveal that the implementation
   of an internalization strategy has raised job satisfaction both directly
   and indirectly, through affecting job characteristics - while indirectly
   increasing job stress as well. The latter occurred because an
   internalization strategy speeds up work pace, develops conflicting
   demands and intensifies conflicts between work and family. The article
   concludes with a short discussion on the theoretical significance of the
   findings and their policy implications for human resource management.

AB Background: Substance use poses a significant threat to the health of
   women, and homeless women are more likely to use alcohol and drugs than
   other women. Addressing risk factors in this population requires a focus
   on the social context of substance use among homeless women.
   Methods: Participants were 445 homeless women who were randomly sampled
   and interviewed in shelter settings about the characteristics of their
   personal networks. Binomial logistic regressions predicted days of binge
   drinking and of using marijuana, crack, cocaine, and methamphetamine or
   other amphetamines in the past 6 months.
   Results: Homeless women with a greater proportion of heavy alcohol users
   in their personal networks had greater odds of engaging in binge
   drinking, and women with a greater proportion of drug users in their
   networks had greater odds of using marijuana, cocaine, crack, and
   methamphetamine or other amphetamines. Women with a greater proportion
   of individuals in their networks that they had met in school or through
   work had lower odds of marijuana, cocaine, and crack use.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest the importance of structural solutions in
   addressing homeless women's alcohol and drug use, including greater
   access to treatment and recovery support for alcohol and drug problems
   as well as depression, and enhancing employment and educational
   opportunities for homeless women. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

AB Childhood socioeconomic position (SEP) is inversely associated with
   cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Obesity in adulthood may
   be a biologic mechanism. Objectives were to systematically review
   literature published between 1998 and 2008 that examined associations of
   childhood SEP with adulthood obesity. Five databases (Cochrane Library,
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science) were searched for studies
   from any country, in any language. Forty-eight publications based on 30
   studies were identified. In age-adjusted analyses, inverse associations
   were found between childhood SEP and adulthood obesity in 70% (14 of 20)
   of studies in females and 27% (4 of 15) in males. In studies of females
   showing inverse associations between childhood SEP and adulthood
   obesity, typical effect sizes in age-adjusted analyses for the
   difference in body mass index between the highest and lowest SEP were
   1.0-2.0 kg/m(2); for males, effect sizes were typically 0.2-0.5 kg/m(2).
   Analyses adjusted for age and adult SEP showed inverse associations in
   47% (8 of 17) of studies in females and 14% (2 of 14) of studies in
   males. When other covariates were additionally adjusted for, inverse
   associations were found in 4 of 12 studies in females and 2 of 8 studies
   in males; effect sizes were typically reduced compared with analyses
   adjusted for age only. In summary, the findings suggest that childhood
   SEP is inversely related to adulthood obesity in females and not
   associated in males after adjustment for age. Adulthood SEP and other
   obesity risk factors may be the mechanisms responsible for the observed
   associations between childhood SEP and adulthood obesity.

AB This article examines the role of civil society in shaping HIV and AIDS
   policies and programs in Brazil. It focuses on the historical context of
   the redemocratization of Brazilian society during the 1980s, when the
   initial response to the epidemic took shape, and emphasizes the role of
   social movements linked to the progressive Catholic Church, the sanitary
   reform movement in public health, and the emerging gay. rights movement
   in the early response to the epidemic in Brazil. It highlights the
   broad-based civil society coalition that took shape over the course of
   the 1990s and the political alliances that were built up shortly after
   the 1996 International AIDS Conference in Vancouver, Canada, to pass
   legislation guaranteeing the right to access to antiretroviral
   treatment. It emphasizes the continued importance of civil society
   organizations-in particular, AIDS-related nongovernmental
   organizations-and leading AIDS activists in exerting continued pressure
   to guarantee the sustainability, of treatment access and the impact that
   action focused on HIV and AIDS has had on the Brazilian public health
   system more broadly, particularly through strengthening health
   infrastructures and providing a model for health-related social
   mobilization.

AB Rising inequalities and high levels of consumption in many capitalist
   economies make understanding the relationship between stratification and
   consumption especially important at the turn of the 21st century. I
   propose that one way to advance this research is to build on work in the
   tradition of Thorstein Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption. This
   scholarship is often disparaged as positing an overly rational and
   manipulative consumer actor. I argue instead that the positional
   consumption literature in the Veblenian tradition offers a more complex
   view of the consumer actor than typically recognized and in particular
   allows an important role for habit, routine, and convention in consumer
   behavior. I identify three major arguments about the influence of habit
   on positional consumption from work in the Veblenian lineage. I conclude
   that incorporating this more complex view of emulative consumption
   produces more satisfying theoretical propositions about the dynamic
   relationship between consumption levels, the standard of living, and
   structures of inequality than typically addressed in research on
   stratification and consumption.

   by the indicator used (median household income by zip code [MIZ],
   maternal educational attainment [MEA], and state insurance coverage [
   MA]), and whether these disparities can be explained by differences in
   medical treatment.
   Study design A cross-sectional analysis of data on patients age <18
   years from the Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF).
   Results Disease severity showed a similar inverse correlation with all 3
   SES measures. The number of stable clinic visits was unrelated to SES.
   Patients with MA had more sick outpatient visits and more courses of
   intravenous (IV) antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations, and were more
   likely to be prescribed all chronic therapies. Low-MIZ patients had
   slightly fewer sick visits and more courses of IV antibiotics, and were
   more likely to receive oral nutrition supplements but less likely to
   receive macrolide prescriptions. Low-MEA patients were less likely to
   receive IV antibiotics at home, more likely to receive oral nutrition
   supplements, but less likely to receive macrolide prescriptions.
   Conclusions CF health outcomes are correlated with the SES spectrum, but
   these disparities are not explained by differential use of health
   services or prescription of chronic therapy. Future investigations
   should focus on the possible impact of environmental exposures and
   differences in disease self-management. (J Pediatr 2009; 155: 634-39).

AB Objective: This research identifies social reinforcers within religious
   institutions associated with alcohol consumption among Korean women in
   California. Method: Data were drawn from telephone interviews with
   female adults (N = 591) selected from a random sampling of persons in
   California with Korean surnames during 2007. Approximately 70% of
   attempted interviews were completed, with 92% conducted in Korean.
   Respondents were asked about any lifetime drinking (yes/no), drinking
   rate (typical number of drinks consumed on drinking days among current
   drinkers), and messages discouraging "excessive drinking" from religious
   leaders or congregants. Bivariable and multivariable regressions were
   used for analysis. Results: Approximately 70.4% of women reported any
   lifetime drinking, and drinkers drank a mean (SD) of 1.10 (1.22) drinks
   on drinking days. About 30.8% reported any exposure to religious
   leaders' messages discouraging excessive drinking, and 28.2% reported
   any exposure to similar messages from congregants. Each congregant's
   message was statistically significantly associated with a 5.1% lower
   probability (odds ratio = 0.775, 95% confidence interval [Cl]: 0.626,
   0.959) of any lifetime drinking. Also, each congregant's message was
   associated with a 13.8% (B = -0.138; 95% Cl: -0.306, 0.029) lower
   drinking rate, which was statistically significant after adjusting for
   covariates using a one-tailed test. Exposure to leaders' messages was
   not statistically significantly associated with any lifetime drinking or
   drinking rate. Conclusions: Social reinforcement in the form of
   religious messages may be one mechanism by which religious institutions
   influence drinking behaviors. For Korean women, messages from
   congregants had a unique impact beyond the traditional religiosity
   indicators. These social mechanisms provide public health
   interventionists with religious pathways to improve drinking behaviors.

AB The notion that social facts can be caused only by other social facts is
   obsolete. Human societies today are affected by biogeochemical change.
   "Developed'' human societies so overuse the finite planet they share
   with "underdeveloped'' societies that the future of all is threatened.
   Medicine's prosthesis concept becomes useful for sociology when extended
   beyond referring to devices for replacing lost body parts or restoring
   impaired sensory powers. If we regard all modern tools and machines as
   prosthetic devices, we see them enabling humans to act as giants-giving
   us colossal resource appetites and huge environmental impacts.
   Prosthetic apparatus (and familiar assumptions) previously useful are
   subject to obsolescence. But there is cultural lag. Conceptual habits
   restrict the way we see our world. The bubble of twentieth century
   experience obstructs our understanding of the future into which we
   giants are plummeting. To explain severe hardships ahead in the
   twenty-first century, sociologists need to break out of our discipline's
   traditional conceptual bubble. Twentieth century expectations have
   become misleading. The basis of past progress (a carrying capacity
   surplus) is gone, replaced by a carrying capacity deficit. Earth's
   diminished carrying capacity will sustain fewer (dinosaur-equivalent)
   Homo colossus than original Homo sapiens.

AB Optimal matching (OM) is a method for measuring the similarity between
   pairs of sequences (e.g., work histories). This article discusses two
   problems with optimal matching. First, the author identifies a flaw in
   OM "indel costs'' and proposes a solution to this flaw. Second, the
   author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of
   OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an
   empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and
   sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM
   and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates
   the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational
   sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human
   capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal
   improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its
   computational complexity. These results point to the need for more
   systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.

AB The population dynamics of preindustrial societies depend intimately on
   their Surroundings, and food is a primary means through which
   environment influences population size and individual well-being food
   production requires labor, thus dependence of survival and fertility on
   food involves dependence of a population's future on its current state
   We use a perturbation approach to analyze the effects of random
   environmental variation on this nonlinear, age-structured system. We
   show that in expanding populations, direct environmental effects
   dominate induced population fluctuations, so environmental variability
   has little effect on clean hunger levels, although it does decrease
   population growth. The growth rate determines the time until Population
   is limited by space This limitation introduces a tradeoff between
   population density and well-being, so population effects become more
   important than the direct effects of the environment. environmental
   fluctuation increases mortality, releasing density dependence and
   raising average well-being for survivors. We discuss the social
   implications of these findings for the long-term fate of populations as
   they transition from expansion into limitation, given that conditions
   leading to high well-being during growth depress well-being during
   limitation (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB OBJECTIVES To explore whether health care, socioeconomic, or personal
   characteristics account for disparities observed in the utilization of
   vasectomy. More than 500 000 vasectomies are performed annually in the
   United States. The safety and efficacy of vasectomy make it a good
   family planning option, yet the factors related to use of male surgical
   sterilization are not well understood. In this analysis, we examined
   differences in vasectomy rates according to factors Such as race and
   socioeconomic status.
   METHODS We analyzed data from the male sample of the 2002 National
   Survey of Family Growth to examine the use of vasectomy among the sample
   of men aged 30-45 (n = 2161). Demographic, socioeconomic, and
   reproductive characteristics were analyzed to assess associations with
   vasectomy.
   RESULTS About 11.4% of men aged 30-45 years reported having a vasectomy,
   representing approximately 3.6 million American men. Although 14.1% of
   white men had a vasectomy, only 3.7% of black and 4.5% of Hispanic men
   reported undergoing vasectomy. On multivariate analysis, a significant
   difference in the odds of vasectomy by race/ethnicity remained, with
   black (odds ratic = 0.20, 0.09-0-45) and Hispanic men (odds ratio =
   0.41, 0.18-0.95) having a significantly lower rate of vasectomy
   independent of demographic, partner, and socioeconomic factors. Having
   ever been married, fathering 2 or more children, older age, and higher
   income were the factors associated with vasectomy.
   CONCLUSIONS After accounting for reproductive history, partner, and
   demographic characteristics, black and Hispanic men were less likely to
   rely on vasectomy for contraception. Further research is needed to
   identify the reasons for these race/ethnic differences and to identify
   factors that impede minority men's reliance on this means of fertility
   control. UROLOGY 74: 1020-1024, 2009. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Small-scale human societies range from foraging bands with a strong
   egalitarian ethos to more economically stratified agrarian and pastoral
   societies. We explain this variation in inequality using a dynamic model
   in which a population's long-run steady-state level of inequality
   depends on the extent to which its most important forms of wealth are
   transmitted within families across generations. We estimate the degree
   of intergenerational transmission of three different types of wealth
   (material, embodied, and relational), as well as the extent of wealth
   inequality in 21 historical and contemporary populations. We show that
   intergenerational transmission of wealth and wealth inequality are
   substantial among pastoral and small-scale agricultural societies (on a
   par with or even exceeding the most unequal modern industrial economies)
   but are limited among horticultural and foraging peoples (equivalent to
   the most egalitarian of modern industrial populations). Differences in
   the technology by which a people derive their livelihood and in the
   institutions and norms making up the economic system jointly contribute
   to this pattern.

AB Economists, demographers and other social scientists have long debated
   the relationship between demographic change and economic outcomes. In
   recent years, general agreement has emerged to the effect that improving
   economic conditions for individuals generally lead to lower birth rates.
   But, there is much less agreement about the proposition that lower birth
   rates contribute to economic development and help individuals and
   families to escape from poverty. The paper examines recent evidence on
   this aspect of the debate, concludes that the burden of evidence now
   increasingly supports a positive conclusion, examines recent trends in
   demographic change and economic development and argues that the
   countries representing the last development frontier, those of
   Sub-Saharan Africa, would be well advised to incorporate policies and
   programmes to reduce high fertility in their economic development
   strategies.

AB Background: Family and friend participation may provide culturally
   salient social support for weight loss in African American adults.
   Methods: SHARE (Supporting Healthy Activity and eating Right Everyday)
   was a 2-year trial of a culturally specific weight loss program. African
   American women and men who enrolled alone (individual stratum, 63 index
   participants) or together with 1 or 2 family members or friends (family
   stratum, 130 index participants) were randomized, within strata, to high
   or low social support treatments; 90% were female.
   Results: At 6 months, the family index participants lost approximately 5
   to 6 kg; the individual index participants lost approximately 3 to 4 kg.
   The mean weight change was not different in high vs low social support
   in either stratum and generally not when high or low support treatments
   were compared across strata. The overall intention-to-treat mean weight
   change at 24 months was -2.4 kg (95% confidence interval, -3.3 kg to
   -1.5 kg). The family index participant weight loss was greater among the
   participants whose partners attended more personally tailored counseling
   sessions at 6 months in the high-support group and at 6, 12, and 24
   months in the low-support group (all P<.05). Also, in the 6-month
   intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of weight loss of the family
   index participants was greater if partners lost at least 5% vs less than
   5% of their baseline weight (respectively, -6.1% vs -2.9% [P=.004], high
   support; and -6.1% vs -3.1% [P=.01], low support).
   Conclusions: Being assigned to participate with family members, friends,
   or other group members had no effect on weight change. Enrolling with
   others was associated with greater weight loss only when partners
   participated more and lost more weight.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine disparities in survival and
   associated factors for patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   and to determine whether racial disparities varied over time (1991-1995,
   1996-1999, and 2000-2002). METHODS: The authors studied 70,901 patients
   aged >= 65 years with stage I-IV NSCLC identified from Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results/Medicare data. Multivariate time-to-event
   survival analyses were completed using Cox proportional regression
   modeling. RESULTS: The 5-year observed lung cancer-specific survival
   rates were 52.7% for whites and 47.5% for blacks with stage I-II
   disease, and 17.7% and 19.6% for whites and blacks, respectively at
   stages III-IV After controlling for standard treatment, socioeconomic
   status (SES), and other factors, there were no significant differences
   in all-cause mortality, or lung cancer-specific mortality between black
   and white patients with stage I-II or III-IV lung cancer. However,
   blacks had an increased risk for overall all-cause mortality at stage
   I-IV (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.35), and
   during 2000-2002 at stage III-IV for all-cause mortality (HR, 1.22; 95%
   Cl, 1.02-1.47) and lung cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.24: 95% CI,
   1.01-1.53). Standard treatment was significantly associated with
   increased survival, whereas poor SES was associated with increased
   mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in
   survival between blacks and whites with NSCLC within stage
   stratifications after adjusting for covariates, except for black
   patients at overall stage for all-cause mortality and at stage III-IV
   diagnosed in 2000-2002. Receiving stage-specific evidence-based standard
   therapy was associated with significantly increased survival. Cancer

AB Researchers in environmental justice contend that low-income communities
   and communities of color face greater impacts from environmental
   hazards. This is also of concern for policy makers, In this context our
   paper has two principal objectives. First, we propose a method for
   creating an index capable of summarizing racial-ethnic and socioeconomic
   inequalities from the impact of cumulative environmental hazards.
   Second, we apply the index to Los Angeles County to illustrate the
   potential applications and complexities of its implementation.
   Individual environmental inequality indices are calculated based on
   unequal shares of environmental hazards for racial-ethnic groups and
   socioeconomic positions. The illustrated hazards include ambient
   concentrations of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and estimates of
   cancer risk associated with modeled estimates for diesel particulate
   matter. The cumulative environmental hazard inequality index (CEHII)
   then combines individual environmental hazards, using either a
   multiplicative or an additive model. Significant but modest inequalities
   exist for both individual and cumulative environmental hazards in Los
   Angeles. The highest level of inequality among racial-ethnic and
   socioeconomic groups occurs when a multiplicative model is used to
   estimate cumulative hazard. The CEHII provides a generalized framework
   that incorporates environmental hazards and socioeconomic
   characteristics to assess inequalities in cumulative environmental
   risks.

AB In times of violence, people tend to hide their valuables, which are
   later recovered unless the owners had been killed or driven away. Thus,
   the temporal distribution of unrecovered coin hoards is an excellent
   proxy for the intensity of internal warfare. We use this relationship to
   resolve a long-standing controversy in Roman history. Depending on who
   was counted in the early Imperial censuses (adult males or the entire
   citizenry including women and minors), the Roman citizen population of
   Italy either declined, or more than doubled, during the first century
   BCE. This period was characterized by a series of civil wars, and
   historical evidence indicates that high levels of sociopolitical
   instability are associated with demographic contractions. We fitted a
   simple model quantifying the effect of instability (proxied by hoard
   frequency) on population dynamics to the data before 100 BCE. The model
   predicts declining population after 100 BCE. This suggests that the
   vigorous growth scenario is highly implausible.

AB By analyzing cross-cultural patterns in five parameters-sex differences,
   male and female trait means, male and female trait standard
   deviations-researchers can better test evolutionary and social
   structural models of sex differences. Five models of biological and
   social structural influence are presented that illustrate this proposal.
   Using data from 53 nations and from over 200,000 participants surveyed
   in a recent BBC Internet survey, I examined cross-cultural patterns in
   these five parameters for two sexual traits-sex drive and
   sociosexuality-and for height, a physical trait with a biologically
   based sex difference. Sex drive, sociosexuality, and height all showed
   consistent sex differences across nations (mean ds = .62, .74, and
   1.63). Women were consistently more variable than men in sex drive (mean
   female to male variance ratio = 1.64). Gender equality and economic
   development tended to predict, across nations, sex differences in
   sociosexuality, but not sex differences in sex drive or height.
   Parameters for sociosexuality tended to vary across nations more than
   parameters for sex drive and height did. The results for sociosexuality
   were most consistent with a hybrid model-that both biological and social
   structural influences contribute to sex differences, whereas the results
   for sex drive and height were most consistent with a biological
   model-that evolved biological factors are the primary cause of sex
   differences. The model testing proposed here encourages evolutionary and
   social structural theorists to make more precise and nuanced predictions
   about the patterning of sex differences across cultures.

   managed their emotions in ways that helped generate self-confidence and
   commitment to their paths. Interviewees engaged in three primary forms
   of emotion work: (1) preparatory emotion work mitigated anxiety and
   bolstered confidence, which motivated them to enter public arenas as
   women; (2) in situ emotion work transformed negative emotions as they
   arose when performing womanhood in public; and (3) retrospective emotion
   work reinterpreted past public performances to neutralize negative and

   admissions variables, (2) Academy variables, and (3) aeronautical status
   had a statistically significant impact on career success. The model was
   97.34 percent accurate in predicting career failure, 12.50 percent
   accurate in predicting career success, and 75.57 percent accurate
   overall. These results suggest determinates of career success largely
   occur after graduation. They also suggest the possibility to identify
   those less likely to achieve career success using admissions and Academy
   variables. Academy leadership may design interventions to increase the
   likelihood cadets will achieve career success.

AB Despite it staggering body of research demonstrating sex differences in
   expressed emotion, very few theoretical models (evolutionary or
   non-evolutionary) offer a critical examination of the adaptive nature of
   such differences. From the perspective of a socio-relational framework,
   emotive behaviors evolved to promote the attraction and aversion of
   different types of relationships by advertising the two most
   parsimonious properties of reciprocity potential, or perceived
   attractiveness as a prospective social partner. These are the
   individual's (a) perceived capacity or ability to provide expedient
   resources, or to inflict immediate harm onto others, and their (b)
   perceived trustworthiness or probability of actually reciprocating
   altruism (Vigil 2007). Depending oil the unique social demands and
   relational constraints that each sex, evolved, individuals should be
   sensitive to advertise "capacit)," and "trustworthiness" cues through
   selective displays of dominant versus submissive and masculine versus
   feminine emotive behaviors, respectively. In this article, I introduce
   the basic theoretical assumptions and hypotheses of the framework, and
   show how the models provide a solid scaffold with which to begin to
   interpret common sex differences in the emotional development
   literature. I conclude by describing how the framework can be used to
   predict condition-based and situation-based variation in affect and
   other forms of expressive behaviors.

AB Background: Provider recommendation for colorectal cancer (CRC)
   screening test has been shown as a strong predictor of patients'
   decision to be screened. Evidence of factors associated with provider
   recommendation remains limited and inconsistent. The present study
   sought to examine the association between provider recommendation for
   colorectal cancer screening and patients' socioeconomic status (SES) and
   insurance Status using national survey data for 2005. Methods: Analyses
   were based on 2948 adult aged 50 and older who participated in the 2005
   Health Information National Trend Survey (HINTS). Multivariate logistic
   regression models were used to determine whether the indicators of SES
   (income and educational level) and insurance status have any impact on
   provider recommendation. Results: Our study found a strong association
   between recall of health care provider recommendation and reported
   recent screening testing after controlling for other patient
   characteristics. When all the study population were included in the
   analysis, those who had lower than high school education and high school
   graduates were less likely to have received provider recommendation than
   those with higher than high school education (OR = 0.49: 95%CI =
   0.32-0.73 and OR = 0.60; 95%CI = 0.47-0.78 respectively). Income and
   insurance were not significant predictors. Education remained
   significantly associated with provider recommendation when only those
   who had made one or more medical visits in the past year were included
   in the analyses. Conclusions: Patient's educational level - but not
   income or insurance status was related to provider recommendation for
   CRC screening. To increase awareness of colorectal cancer risks and the
   benefit of screening, health care providers need to make a concerted
   effort to recommend colorectal cancer screening to all relevant
   patients, regardless of socioeconomic status and other personal
   characteristics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   a modified Andersen model of access to health care. the researchers

AB Background The notion that chronic stress contributes to health
   inequalities by socio-economic status (SES) through physiological wear
   and tear has received widespread attention. This article reviews the
   literature testing associations between SES and cortisol, an important
   biomarker of stress, as well as the summary index of allostatic load
   (AL).
   Methods A search of all published literature on the PubMed and ISI Web
   of Knowledge literature search engines was conducted using broad search
   terms. The authors reviewed abstracts and selected articles that met the
   inclusion criteria. A total of 26 published studies were included in the
   review.
   Results Overall, SES was not consistently related to cortisol. Although
   several studies found an association between lower SES and higher levels
   of cortisol, many found no association, with some finding the opposite
   relationship. Lower SES was more consistently related to a blunted
   pattern of diurnal cortisol secretion, but whether this corresponded to
   higher or lower overall cortisol exposure varied by study. Approaches to
   collecting and analysing cortisol varied widely, likely contributing to
   inconsistent results. Lower SES was more consistently related to higher
   levels of AL, but primarily via the cardiovascular and metabolic
   components of AL rather than the neuroendocrine markers.
   Conclusions Current empirical evidence linking SES to cortisol and AL is
   weak. Future work should standardize approaches to measuring SES,
   chronic stress and cortisol to better understand these relationships.

AB Previous research on unemployment among managers and professionals has
   documented the experience of job loss as stressful because of both
   economic strain and the damage it does to valued identities and
   self-conceptions. Little research, however, has examined the processes
   through which displaced workers collectively attempt to repair this
   damage. Data from participant observation in four support groups, plus
   intensive interviews with twenty-two group members, are used to develop
   an analysis of the self-concept repair strategies used by these
   relatively privileged workers. Five main strategies are identified: (1)
   redefining the meaning of unemployment, (2) realizing accomplishment,
   (3) restructuring time, (4) forming accountability partnerships, and (5)
   helping others. These findings suggest that our understandings of how
   people cope with stressful life events need to take into account the
   social capital available to different groups. A second implication
   concerns our understanding of how the self-concept operates as a source
   of motivation.

AB This research identifies stressors that correlate with depression,
   focusing on acculturation, among female Korean immigrants in California.
   Telephone interviews were conducted with female adults of Korean descent
   (N = 592) from a probability sample from 2006 to 2007. Sixty-five
   percent of attempted interviews were completed, of which over 90% were
   conducted in Korean. Analyses include descriptive reports, bivariate
   correlations, and structural equation modeling. Findings suggest that
   acculturation did not have a direct impact on depression and was not
   associated with social support. However, acculturation was associated
   with reduced immigrant stress which, in turn, was related to decreased
   levels of depression. Immigrant stress and social support were the
   principal direct influences on depression, mediating the effect for most
   other predictors. Stressful experiences associated with immigration may
   induce depressive feelings. Interventions should facilitate
   acculturation thereby reducing immigrant stress and expand peer networks
   to increase social support to assuage depression.

   magnify. Sustain is defined within this paper as to keep in existence or
   to supply with resources or necessities to prevent from falling below a
   given threshold of health or vitality. Barrett et al. (Bioscience
   47:531-535, 1997) illustrated how seven (7) processes (behaviour,
   development, diversity, energetics, evolution, integration, regulation)
   transcend eleven (11) levels of ecological organization, ranging from
   the ecosphere to the cellular. Comprehension of how these processes
   transcend all levels of ecological organization allow programs and
   initiatives (e.g. preserving biotic diversity) to be defined by informed
   incentive, rather than regulatory mandate, within societal systems. We
   describe how the integration of an eighth transcending
   process-aesthetics-is essential in the approach to and managing of
   market and nonmarket capital necessary in sustaining societies.

   whaling cycle reveals strong indivisibility of music, emotions, and
   place based human identity. To illustrate such integrity of the Inupiat
   and their culturally critical bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus), a
   search was made for specific ways in which climate change influences
   Inupiaq spiritual and physical ties with the whale in relation to
   traditional music making. Traditionally, the Inupiat say that it is the
   whale who brings them music, thus no whale harvest means no music
   production. However, when the environment is less predictable, the
   homeland eroded, place based songs gone, and human-whale integrity
   threatened, how specifically are these changes manifested in the
   Inupiat-whale relationship? Providing detailed descriptions of 2005-2006
   nalukataq (midsummer whale feasts), this article examines how
   contemporary Inupiat respond to environmental changes in the emotional

AB Behavioral economics is a relatively new field of economics that uses
   experimental techniques to produce insights about human decision-making.
   One of its key findings is that people's preferences for actions are not
   absolute, but rather relative to some anchor point, and can therefore be
   influenced by changing the anchor. Anchor points can be social norms,
   habits acquired in childhood, or a cultural frame-whether physical
   activity is presented as fun or as drudgery. Physical activity promotion
   can benefit by intervening on these anchors, but doing so is most
   effective when it is undertaken for society as a whole. Behavioral
   economics accordingly suggests that physical activity promotion should
   incorporate attempts at a cultural shift to support individual
   health-promotion efforts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB Background. The increasingly sedentary nature of work and its impact on
   health and productivity indicators demands the promotion of physical
   activity at the worksite.
   Purpose. This paper aims to present considerations for broad-scale
   application of corporate strategies designed to promote physical
   activity among employees and their families through employer-sponsored
   initiatives.
   Approach. The benefits of physical activity are multifold, including
   health and wellbeing and productivity related outcomes. The workplace
   setting may be leveraged to promote physical activity levels through
   frequent and sustained exposures to effective interventions that reach
   employees and, indirectly, their families. Furthermore, employers
   represent a powerful stakeholder group that should leverage its
   influence on health policy initiatives designed to create supportive
   environments inside the workplace as well as the broader community.
   Specific principles, recommendations for action, and considerations for
   the prioritization of initiatives are provided based on essential
   elements for comprehensive programs and health policy initiatives and in
   the context of a social-ecological model and supportive research.
   Conclusions. Physical activity promotion at the worksite should be an
   integrated initiative that measurably improves worker health and
   enhances business performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Background. Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (PAAC) was a
   three-year cluster randomized controlled trial to promote physical
   activity and diminish increases in overweight and obesity in elementary
   school children.
   Methods. Twenty-four elementary schools were cluster randomized to the
   Physical Activity Across the Curriculum intervention or served as
   control. All children in grades two and three were followed to grades
   four and five. Physical Activity Across the Curriculum promoted 90
   min/wk of moderate to vigorous intensity physically active academic
   lessons delivered by classroom teachers. Body Mass Index was the primary
   outcome, daily Physical activity and academic achievement were secondary
   outcomes.
   Results. The three-year change in Body Mass Index for Physical Activity
   Across the Curriculum was 2.0 +/- 1.9 and control 1.9 +/- 1.9,
   respectively (NS). However, change in Body Mass Index from baseline to 3
   years was significantly influenced by exposure to Physical Activity
   Across the Curriculum. Schools with >= 75 min of Physical Activity
   Across the Curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in Body Mass
   Index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of Physical
   Activity Across the Curriculum (1.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.4 +/- 2.0, p = 0.02).
   Physical Activity Across the Curriculum schools had significantly
   greater changes in daily Physical activity and academic achievement
   scores.
   Conclusions. The Physical Activity Across the Curriculum approach may
   promote daily Physical activity and academic achievement in elementary
   school children. Additionally, 75 min of Physical Activity Across the
   Curriculum activities may attenuate increases in Body Mass Index. (C)

AB This paper argues that substantive and sustainable population-wide
   improvements in physical activity can be achieved only through the large
   scale adoption and implementation of policies and practices that make
   being active the default choice and remaining inactive difficult.
   Meta-volition refers to the volition and collective agency of early
   adopter leaders who implement such changes in their own organizations to
   drive productivity and health improvements. Leaders, themselves, are
   motivated by strong incentives to accomplish their organizational
   missions. The meta-volition model (MVM) specifies a cascade of changes
   that may be sparked by structural integration of brief activity bouts
   into organizational routine across sectors and types of organizations.
   MVM builds upon inter-disciplinary social ecological change models and
   frameworks such as diffusion of innovations, social learning and social
   marketing. MVM is dynamic rather than static, integrating biological
   influences with psychological factors, and socio-cultural influences
   with organizational processes. The model proposes six levels of
   dissemination triggered by organizational marketing to early adopter
   leaders carried out by "sparkplugs," boisterous leaders in population
   physical activity promotion: initiating (leader-leader), catalyzing
   (organizational-individual), viral marketing
   (individual-organizational), accelerating
   (organizational-organizational), anchoring (organizational-community)
   and institutionalizing (community-individual). MVM embodies
   public-private partnership principles, a collective investment in the
   high cost of achieving and maintaining active lifestyles. (C) 2009

AB Sociological imagination is a quality of mind that cannot be adopted by
   simply teaching students its discursive assumptions. Rather, it is a
   disposition, in competition with other forms of sensibility, which can
   be acquired only when it is practiced. Adhering to this important
   pedagogical assumption, students were assigned to write their
   sociological autobiography. While in the process of establishing a
   connection between their biography and social history, students were
   encouraged to narrate their life stories using sociological language.
   After completing the project, they were asked to comment on their work.
   Student responses show the positive dimensions involved (including
   unintended therapeutic consequences) and the major hurdles that they
   experienced in executing the assignment. In the latter case, the major
   problem was writing a sociological autobiography qualitatively distinct
   from what might be referred to as "plain autobiography." Results
   reinforce the idea that sociological instruction is better handled when
   sociological imagination is viewed as a linguistic habitus which serves
   both as a medium of communication and an intellectual instrument of
   looking at the social world.

   residents' solo versus joint engagement in shopping, dining, and
   recreational/fitness activities. Using data from the 2006 Greater
   Triangle Travel Survey in North Carolina, individual activity engagement
   is innovatively measured using two indicators: total time spent alone
   and total time jointly spent with household members on a specific
   non-work activity type. The impact of the built environment on non-work
   activity engagement is then estimated using Heckman sample selection
   models along with a seemingly unrelated estimation system. We find that
   residents living closer to parks and department stores on average are
   more likely to participate in out-of-home recreation and shopping
   activities. A comparison of coefficients in solo versus joint engagement
   models shows that park accessibility is much more important to household
   joint participation than to solo participation in recreational
   activities. The research generates new knowledge on how the built
   environment may influence solo versus joint activity engagement
   differently. The findings are useful to urban planners who are
   interested in reviving local economy and promoting active living/social

AB Objective. To determine the factors associated with increased levels of
   fatigue over the course of the disease in systemic lupus erythematosus
   (SLE) patients from LUpus in MInorities: NAture versus nurture, a
   longitudinal multiethnic cohort.
   Methods. Patients with SLE (according to the American College of
   Rheumatology revised and updated criteria) age >= 16 years with a
   disease duration <= 5 years at entry into the cohort, and of Hispanic
   (Texan or Puerto Rican), African American, or Caucasian ethnicity were
   studied. The association between socioeconomic/demographic
   characteristics, health behaviors, behavioral and psychological,
   functional and clinical characteristics, and fatigue was examined using
   generalized estimating equations to account for the longitudinal nature
   of the data.
   Results. A total of 515 patients (similar to 91% female) contributed
   2,609 visits to these analyses. Of these patients, 93 (18.1%) were
   Texan-Hispanic, 101 (19.6%) were Puerto Rican-Hispanic, 169 (32.8%) were
   African Americans, and 152 (29.5%) were Caucasian. The mean +/- SD
   patient age and followup time were 37.2 +/- 12.6 years and 4.7 +/- 3.2
   years, respectively. Variables associated with increased levels of
   fatigue in the multivariable analyses were Caucasian ethnicity, the
   presence of constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss), and higher
   levels of pain, abnormal illness-related behaviors, and helplessness (P
   values between 0.0018 and <0.0001).
   Conclusion. The presence of pain, abnormal illness-related behaviors,
   helplessness, and constitutional manifestations were associated with
   increased levels of fatigue. However, SLE-specific measures, such as
   disease activity and damage, were not. Interventions aimed at decreasing
   fatigue need to take into account these findings.

AB Background: Human populations are structured by social networks, in
   which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes.
   Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create
   a OhiddenO population, so-called because its members are difficult to
   identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of
   exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies
   are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social
   networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit
   their peers, e. g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant
   accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly
   outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis.
   Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.
   g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov
   chain rather than a branching process.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we develop a new methodology based
   on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to
   modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply
   this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in
   Tijuana, Mexico, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and
   sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus,
   syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed
   using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a
   publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either
   expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits
   constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified
   significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates
   assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly,
   IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter;
   and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on
   the number of recruits.
   Conclusions: SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can
   articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the
   traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation
   in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the
   composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising
   critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious
   disease epidemics.

AB The prevailing risk of traffic fatalities is Much larger in rural areas
   compared to urban areas. A number of explanations have been offered to
   explain this including road design, emergency medical service proximity,
   and human factors. This research explored the potential contribution of
   rural driver attitudes that may underlie the increased fatal crash risk
   in rural environments. This analysis examined differences between rural
   and urban drivers in terms of self-reported risk taking for driving
   behaviors associated with fatal crashes and attitudes toward safety
   interventions using a large-scale survey. The results suggested that
   rural drivers engage in riskier behavior, such as not wearing seatbelts,
   because they have lower perceptions of the risks associated with such
   behaviors. Results also Suggested that vehicle type (e.g., pickup trucks
   versus passenger vehicles) may be related to seatbelt compliance and
   frequency of driving under the influence of alcohol. Rural drivers
   perceived the utility of government-sponsored traffic safety
   interventions to be lower than their urban counterparts. This study
   provides insights into the role of the human factor in rural fatal
   crashes and provides policy suggestions for developing safety
   interventions that are designed with respect to the psychosocial factors
   that define the rural culture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Things are not always as they seem. A cursory examination of a table of
   statistics cited in the Weber thesis appears to reveal striking
   differences in the educational 'preferences' of Catholics and
   Protestants. Careful scrutiny, however, on a number of grounds,
   especially in light of the importance that Weber attaches to these
   statistics in the articulation of his thesis, reveals that not only are
   the statistics seriously compromised by errors and omissions, but they
   lead to an evolving state of confusion engendered by scholars who, while
   engaged in the concealment or ostensible correction of these flaws by
   often dubious means, have published changed and conflicting versions of
   Weber's statistics. By examining two recently published new English
   translations of the Weber thesis, this study resolves and clarifies some
   of the uncertainties surrounding the proper interpretation of these
   statistics within the context of Weber's theoretical argument and the
   socio-political climate in which they were produced. The reader is
   invited to explore how reverential bias in classical scholarship
   actually emerges.

AB Background: Neighborhood environment can have a substantial influence on
   the level of physical activity among older adults. Yet, the moderating
   influence of various measures of SES on the association between
   perceived neighborhood safety and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA)
   among older adults remains unknown.
   Purpose: The study was designed to investigate the association between
   perceived neighborhood safety and LTPA in a nationally representative
   sample of older adults, and to evaluate SES characteristics as potential
   effect modifiers in the association between perceived neighborhood
   safety and LTPA.
   Methods: Cross-sectional data from the 2004 Health and Retirement Study
   of older adults aged >= 50 years were used to examine the association
   between perceived neighborhood safety and LTPA. Differences in LTPA were
   evaluated across three measures of SES: education, household income, and
   household wealth. SES was also evaluated as a potential effect modifier
   in the association between perceived neighborhood safety and LTPA. The
   analysis was conducted in 2008.
   Results: An SES gradient in LTPA was noted across measures of SES used
   in this Study. After controlling for SES and demographic characteristics
   and functional limitations, older adults who perceived their
   neighborhood as safe had an 8% higher mean rate of LTPA compared to
   older adults who perceived their neighborhood as unsafe. The association
   was no longer significant when self-rated health was added.
   Additionally, SES was not a significant effect modifier in the
   association between perceived neighborhood safety and LTPA.
   Conclusions: SES, demographic characteristics, and functional
   limitations substantially attenuated the positive association between
   perceived neighborhood safety and LTPA; however, with the inclusion of
   self-rated health, the association was no longer present. This finding
   suggets that self-rated health may mediate this association. The lack of
   significance in the interaction between perceived neighborhood safety
   and SES suggests that prevention efforts to increase physical activity
   among older adults should consider perceptions of neighborhood safety as
   a potential barrier regardless of SES. (Am J Prev Med

AB Objectives. We sought to disentangle the relationships between
   race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and unmet medical care
   needs.
   Methods. Data from the 2003-2004 Community Tracking Study Household
   Survey were used to examine associations between unmet medical needs and
   SES among African American and White women.
   Results. No significant racial/ethnic differences in unmet medical needs
   (24.8% of Whites, 25.9% of African Americans; P=.59) were detected in
   bivariate analyses. However, among women with 12 years of education or
   less, African Americans were less likely than were Whites to report
   unmet needs (odds ratio [OR]=0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.42,
   0.79). Relative to African American women with 12 years of education or
   less, the odds of unmet needs were 1.69 (95% CI=1.24, 2.31) and 2.18
   (95% CI=1.25, 3.82) among African American women with 13 to 15 years of
   education and 16 years of education or more, respectively. In contrast,
   the relationship between educational level and unmet needs was
   nonsignificant among White women.
   Conclusions. Among African American women, the failure to recognize
   unmet medical needs is related to educational attainment and may be an
   important driver of health disparities, representing a fruitful area for
   future interventions. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99:1659-1665.

AB Objectives. We investigated an outbreak of carbon monoxide (CO)
   poisoning after a power outage to determine its extent, identify risk
   factors, and develop prevention measures.
   Methods. We reviewed medical records and medical examiner reports of
   patients with CO poisoning or related symptoms during December 15 to 24,
   2006. We grouped patients into households exposed concurrently to a
   single source of CO.
   Results. Among 259 patients with CO poisoning, 204 cases were laboratory
   confirmed, 37 were probable, 10 were suspected, and 8 were fatal. Of 86
   households studied, 58% (n=50) were immigrant households from Africa
   (n=21), Asia (n=15), Latin America (n=10), and the Middle East (n=4);
   34% (n=29) were US-born households. One percent of households was
   European (n=1), and the origin for 7% (n=6) was unknown. Charcoal was
   the most common fuel source used among immigrant households (82%),
   whereas liquid fuel was predominant among US-born households (34%).
   Conclusions. Educational campaigns to prevent CO poisoning should
   consider immigrants' cultural practices and languages and specifically
   warn against burning charcoal indoors and incorrect ventilation of
   gasoline- or propane-powered electric generators. (Am J Public Health.

AB Context.-Nationally, African Americans are underrepresented in community
   blood donation programs. To increase blood donation by African
   Americans, differences between motivators and barriers to blood donation
   between races should be investigated.
   Objective.-To investigate motivators and barriers to blood donation in
   African American and white blood donors.
   Design.-An 18-item, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire regarding
   demographics and motivators and barriers to donation was completed by
   blood donors at a predominately African American and a predominately
   white fixed donation site.
   Results.-A total of 599 participants (20% African American, 75% white,
   and 5% other) completed the survey. The most commonly reported reasons
   to donate included: because it is the right thing to do'' (45% African
   Americans and 62% white) and "because I want to help save a life'' (63%
   African Americans and 47% white). Unpleasant experiences did not differ
   as a barrier to continue donation between African Americans and whites.
   African Americans placed more importance on donating blood to someone
   with sickle cell disease, convenience of blood donation, treatment of
   donor center staff, and level of privacy during the screening process.
   Conclusions.-These data suggest that in a large metropolitan area,
   reasons for donation among African American and white donors differ. To
   retain and increase donation frequency of African American donors, these
   factors should be considered in creating an African American donor
   recruitment and retention program. (Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2009; 133:

AB Although neighborhood disadvantage has been linked to the development of
   cardiovascular disease, the mechanism through which living in
   impoverished neighborhoods is associated with poor cardiovascular health
   is not well understood. Additionally, it is not clear whether individual
   socioeconomic status (SES) interacts with neighborhood factors to
   influence cardiovascular outcomes. Using multilevel modeling, we
   examined the interaction between neighborhood poverty and individual SES
   on pressor responses to an alpha agonist, phenylephrine (PE), in an
   adult sample of 105 African-Americans and 106 Caucasian-Americans.
   Neighborhood poverty was assessed using census block data gathered from
   the Census Bureau. Education and occupation were used to assess
   individual SES. Pressor responsiveness was calculated as the systolic
   and diastolic blood pressure (BP) response to a 100-mu g PE bolus
   administered intravenously. There was a significant interaction between
   education and neighborhood poverty on pressor responses. Higher
   education was associated with smaller BP responses to PE; but only in
   individuals who lived in neighborhoods in which less than 5% of the
   residents lived below the poverty line. Occupation was unrelated to
   pressor responses to PE. These results suggest that neighborhood
   characteristics play an important role in cardiovascular functioning.

AB Despite growing awareness of the limitations of group-level analyses in
   ethnic studies, research on ethnic conflict has paid virtually no
   systematic attention to variation at the individual or micro level.
   Addressing that gap, the present paper draws upon data from interviews
   conducted with members of two broadly-defined categories recently
   arrived in the Republic of Ireland, Muslims and Nigerians. Results
   indicate that while members of both immigrant categories experience a
   good deal of ethnic conflict or hostility, such conflict is rarely
   collective and invariably varies across individuals. The research data
   are consistent with Donald Black's theory of moralism. Black's theory,
   based on his theoretical system known as pure sociology, predicts that
   ethnic hostility increases with the social inferiority and cultural
   distance of the immigrant, and that higher status immigrants are more
   assertive in responding to hostility, though they experience less of it
   (the status paradox).

   triple-negative (TN) subtype, are largely unknown. We evaluated whether
   anthropometrics, demographics, and reproductive history were associated
   with distinct breast cancer subtypes.
   Invasive breast tumors from a population-based case-control study of 476
   (116 black and 360 white) Atlanta women aged 20-54, diagnosed between
   1990 and 1992, were centrally reviewed and immunohistochemically
   analyzed for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
   human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2); then grouped [TN
   (ER-PR-HER2-); ER-PR-HER2+; ER/PR+HER2+; ER/PR+HER2- (case-only
   reference group)]. Data were from interviews and anthropometric
   measurements; adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
   (CI) were estimated using logistic regression, including both case-only
   and case-control comparisons.
   From the case-only analyses and compared with the ER/PR+HER2- subtype,
   women with TN tumors were more likely to be obese than
   normal/underweight [OR = 1.89 (95% CI = 1.22, 2.92)]. Regardless of HER2
   status, ER-PR- tumors were associated with black race, young age at
   first birth, having a recent birth, and being overweight.
   Distinct breast cancer subtypes have unique sociodemographic,
   anthropometric and reproductive characteristics and possibly different
   pathways for development.

   Age-adjusted and age-specific ICC incidence rates were calculated by

   There was a significant downward trend in ICC incidence during both time

   women were more likely to be diagnosed at late stage or unstaged at
   diagnosis than Non-Hispanic/White women.

   Bivariate analysis showed that lower levels of social integration were
   associated with a lower likelihood of CRC screening for both genders.
   After controlling for sociodemographic variables, the level of social
   integration remained independently associated with CRC screening. The
   link between each component of social networks and CRC screening was
   also examined. Among men, those who did not have friends/family to talk
   to about their health were less likely to be screened (OR 0.48, 95% CI:
   0.30-0.77). Among women, those who were unmarried (OR 0.67, 95% CI:
   0.41-0.93), those who did not have friends/family to talk to about their

   any community organizations (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.43-0.90) were less
   likely to be screened.
   For both men and women, individuals who were socially isolated were less
   likely to get CRC screening compared with individuals who were less
   isolated. The observed gender differences indicate the need for
   investigation of the social context and the meaning of elements of
   social networks in men and women.

AB Forty years ago, Manuel Castells asked whether urban sociology had a
   subject matter and whether the term urban still had meaning-and this
   article reopens these and related questions. It also wonders why today's
   American urban sociology has concentrated on cities, especially big
   ones, concurrently virtually ignoring the three other types of
   communities-suburbs, towns, and rural areas-in which a majority of
   Americans live and work. Further, it argues that this four-community
   typology is logically dubious and empirically obsolete. If the field
   were redefined as a sociology of settlements, analytically more logical
   and substantively more relevant typologies could be developed. Another
   politically and organizationally more realistic alternative would split
   the field into four: a sociology of the city and one concentrating on
   other settlements, with a third field devoted to community studies, and
   the fourth to spatial sociology.

   in their friendships and casual encounters; [Thorne, B., & Luria, Z.
   (1986). Sexuality and gender in children's daily worlds. Social
   Problems, 33,176-190]), has typically been viewed as a childhood
   phenomenon. In the present paper, we review research that suggests the
   phenomenon of sex segregation persists across the life span. We draw
   from a social-constructionist model to synthesize literature documenting
   sex segregation in friendships and aspects of individuals'
   socio-cultural contexts in childhood, adolescence, and early and later
   adulthood. We consider developmental continuities in mechanisms that may
   be associated with sex segregation, including behavioral compatibility,
   communication styles, third-party resistance to other-sex relationships,
   and institutional barriers to other-sex relationships. We discuss how
   these factors may, through a reciprocal process, contribute to and
   result from sex segregation. Finally, we offer recommendations for

AB This paper examines Alfred Schutz's insights on types and typification.
   Beginning with a brief overview of the history and meaning of
   typification in interpretive sociology, the paper further addresses both
   the ubiquity and the necessity of typification in social life and
   scientific method. Schutz's contribution itself is lacking in empirical
   application and grounding, but examples are provided of ongoing
   empirical research which advances the understanding of types and
   typification. As is suggested by illustrations from scholarship in the
   social studies of social science, studies of social identity associated
   with membership categorization analysis, and constructionist social
   problems theory, typification can be found to be central to social
   research whether it is taken up as a largely unacknowledged resource or
   whether it is addressed by different names. The overview and
   illustrations suggest the continuing, widespread, and indeed
   foundational relevance of Schutz's insights into types and typification.

AB beta-Thalassemia is an anemic genetic disorder that remains a major
   global health issue, especially in the globalized era where public
   health, economics, and education are tightly interwoven. Previous
   studies have examined the disease's rate and heredity. This study
   analyzed beta-thalassemia's socioeconomic geography and how it affects
   the afflicted population. We processed survey data and performed data
   mining using self-organizing maps to identify underlying data structure.
   We hypothesized that certain variables mark subgroups within the
   affected population and we aimed at identifying these subgroups and used
   a correlation-based measure to assess the variable's importance to the
   subgroup's distinction. The population's education level was one of the
   major factors that divided it into different subgroups. Our study showed
   that recurring patterns of specific variables separated the affected
   population into disparate subgroups based on their response to
   questionnaires. Future studies can use such tools to delve deeper into
   how other variables (e.g. socioeconomic and genomic) can identify
   subgroups within larger affected populations.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the effectiveness
   of a cultural competency training program designed to improve the
   knowledge and skills of health care providers and administrators
   engaging in cross-cultural, clinical encounters.
   Methods: We conducted an evaluation study among 43 health care
   professionals (health care providers and health administrators) who
   attended a 4-hour cultural competency workshop. We used a post-then-pre
   method of self-reported evaluation to answer a key question: Does
   cultural competency training produce a measurable change in knowledge
   and skills relating to the care of patients from diverse cultural and
   ethnic backgrounds?
   Results: The study findings suggest that there are statistically
   significant change in participants' self-report of knowledge and skills
   related to cultural competency.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that a cultural competency training program
   that integrates key topics as recommended by the Institute of Medicine
   and includes Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in
   Health Care standards improves the knowledge and skills of health care
   providers and administrators. Following the training, the participants
   self-reported not only an enhanced understanding of the health care
   experiences of patients with diverse backgrounds, but also an
   improvement in their skills to effectively work in cross-cultural
   situations. In addition, our study offers a reliable, innovative, and
   time-efficient strategy-post-then-pre method-for evaluating the outcomes
   of 4-hour cultural competency training programs.

   (Perceived Cultural Competency scale) was based on the 3-factor model
   that includes patients' perception of (1) physicians' cultural
   knowledge, (2) physicians' cultural awareness, and (3) physicians'
   cultural skill. The results confirmed that patients' perceptions of

AB Objective: To determine whether any associations exist between cultural
   (racial/ethnic, spiritual/religious) competence and end-of-life
   treatment decisions in hospitalized patients and the potential impact of
   those associations on hospitalists' provision of care.
   Data Sources and Methods: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo, and CINAHL
   databases were searched using the following search terms: cultural
   competence, race, ethnicity, minority, African American, Hispanic, end
   of life, palliative care, advanced care planning, inpatient, religion,
   spirituality, faith, hospitalist, and hospice. We identified studies in
   which spirituality/religion or race/ethnicity was used as a variable to
   study their potential impact on end-of-life treatment decisions in
   hospitalized patients.
   Results: In only 13 studies was spirituality/religion or race/ethnicity
   used to study its effect on end-of-life decisions in hospitalized
   patients. African American patients tended to prefer the use of
   life-sustaining treatments at the end of life, and race/ethnicity did
   not appear to affect decisions to withhold or withdraw certain types of
   life-sustaining technology. Specific spiritual needs were identified
   both within and outside organized religions when members of those
   religions were hospitalized at the end of life.
   Conclusions: End-of-life care may present unique challenges and
   opportunities in culturally discordant hospitalist-patient
   relationships. Culturally competent health care in an increasingly
   diverse population requires awareness of the importance of culture,
   particularly spirituality/religion and race/ethnicity, in the care of
   hospitalized patients at the end of life.

AB This pilot study sought to dismantle the efficacy of culturally specific

   American smokers were randomized into I of 2 conditions: standard
   booklet or culturally specific booklet. The content and length of the
   interventions were identical yet varied in their degree of cultural
   specificity. Three-month follow-up assessments were completed by 70% (N
   = 183) of participants. Dependent variables included content evaluation,
   readiness to quit smoking, and actual behavior change. Evidence
   suggested that the culturally specific material was more effective at
   capturing attention, providing encouragement and gaining interest
   compared to standard materials; however, greater credibility was found
   for standard materials. In addition, greater readiness to quit and more
   24-hour quit attempts were found in the standard condition. No
   differences were found in abstinence rates. In conclusion, culturally
   specific interventions may be preferred over standard approaches among
   African American smokers. Culturally specific approaches, however, may
   not result in greater behavior change. Implications for written
   interventions and cultural specificity ore discussed.

AB This article demonstrates how the content and meaning of California's
   consumer protection laws were shaped by automobile manufacturers, the
   very group these laws were designed to regulate. My analysis draws on
   and links two literatures that examine the relationship between law and
   organizations but often overlook one another: political science studies
   of how businesses influence public legal institutions, and
   neo-institutional sociology studies of how organizations shape law
   within their organizational field. By integrating these literatures, I
   develop an "institutional-political'' theory that demonstrates how
   organizations' construction of law and compliance within an
   organizational field shapes the meaning of law among legislators and
   judges. This study examines case law and more than 35 years of
   California legislative history concerning its consumer warranty laws.
   Using institutional and political analysis, I show how auto
   manufacturers, who were initially subject to powerful consumer
   protection laws, weakened the impact of these laws by creating dispute
   resolution venues. The legislature and courts subsequently incorporated
   private dispute resolution venues into statutes and court decisions and
   made consumer rights and remedies largely contingent on consumers first
   using manufacturer-sponsored venues. Organizational venue creation
   resulted in public legal rights being redefined and controlled by
   private organizations.

AB Environmental social scientists debate whether or not. modern
   development reduces society's impact on the biosphere. The empirical
   research informing the discussion has not yet adequately examined the
   social determinants of municipal solid-waste (MSW) generation, an
   increasingly relevant issue, both ecologically and sociologically. A
   primary problem for this research concerns the increasing exchange of
   MSW across state and county borders. A convenient way to avoid this
   problem is to examine variation between counties with landfills that
   service only the county in which the landfills are located. I applied
   this restriction to a cross-sectional analysis of total MSW generated in
   Texas at the county level for 2006. Using robust regression, this Study
   found that two basic measures of modern development, Population per
   square mile and per capita income, are both positively related to total
   MSW generated at the county level and together explain about 73 percent
   of the variation in the dependent variable. The evidence corroborates
   the metabolic-rift theory. The concentration of people onto smaller land
   areas, or urbanization, and increasing wealth in a capitalist economy
   contribute to the metabolic rupture between human society and the
   environment.

   countries between 1966 and 2000, this article analyzes patterns of
   membership to the International Human Rights Covenants. The analysis
   produced two main conclusions. First, the potential costs associated
   with joining a treaty, rather than its substantive content, motivates
   the decision to join. Treaties that protect different rights but
   establish comparable implementation mechanisms exhibit similar patterns
   of membership, whereas treaties that protect identical rights but
   establish different implementation provisions exhibit dissimilar
   patterns of membership. Second, rates of treaty membership differ by
   level of commitment. Countries that sign human rights treaties differ
   from countries that ratify. Results are interpreted with respect to four
   theories of commitment and compliance: realism, liberalism,
   constructivism, and sociological institutionalism. Theories that
   emphasize the importance of a treaty's costs (realism and
   institutionalism) fare better than theories that prioritize a treaty's
   content (liberalism and constructivism).

   variable and two sets of theoretically distinct control variables. The
   author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and
   democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and
   democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First,
   international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic
   and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to
   conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that
   the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery.
   Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore

AB Complaints about time shortage permeate contemporary western societies.
   Many disciplines, from sociology to economics, have been involved in
   research and theorizing about time shortage, in contrast to the paucity
   of psychological research. This review of the extant heterogeneous
   terminology proposes that chronic time pressure (CTP) be used as
   temporary overarching term, subsuming the objective component of time
   shortage and the subjective-emotional component of being rushed. Feeling
   rushed may lead to the perception of time shortage. The review explores
   how most previous research on CTP used surveys and time-diaries that
   were developed to assess time allocations and have limited usefulness in
   examining subjective temporal experience. The recently developed
   Experience Sampling Method and Daily Reconstruction Method, combined
   with in-depth interviews, augment existing methods and may provide
   detailed analyses of the being rushed component of CTP. Conceptual ties
   to other disciplines and to well-being and stress research are also
   emphasized.

AB What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An
   understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be
   critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We
   hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary
   driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely
   determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities.
   We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of
   accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon
   Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a
   spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative
   framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis
   shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport
   (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high
   labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and
   expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast,
   Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs),
   low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal
   economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development
   near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport
   costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban
   development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related
   foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms
   increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results
   have important implications for the development of policies that may
   lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. (C) 2009 Elsevier

AB A wide variety of metrics is used to quantify features of urbanization
   in ecological studies. Selecting statistically independent measures of
   urbanization depends upon the nature (multivariate collinearity) and
   strength (correlation coefficient) of correlations between urban
   metrics. We evaluated the influence of landscape extent and habitat
   context, factors that commonly differ between studies, on correlations
   between urban metrics. We examined the nature and strength of
   relationships between urban metrics at 1105 sites within Massachusetts,
   USA, including: population, agriculture cover, forest cover, wetland
   cover, dense residential cover, impervious surface cover, road length
   and greenspace cover. At each site, values were measured at five
   extents: 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, I km, and 2 km radii buffers. We also
   investigated the influence of habitat context on correlations by
   measuring values with a 1 km radius buffer for 100 sites within each of
   three habitat contexts (salt marsh, forest, and freshwater marsh).
   Principal component analysis showed that spatial scale did not affect
   the nature of relationships, but habitat context did. The average
   strength of bivariate correlations significantly increased at larger
   extents. and was significantly lower in salt marsh habitat context. Our
   results indicate that no single set of urbanization metrics is
   universally applicable and underline the importance of using a suite of
   statistical techniques to characterize independent aspects of urban

AB Even though people in our contemporary technological society are
   depending on communication, our understanding of the underlying laws of
   human communicational behavior continues to be poorly understood. Here
   we investigate the communication patterns in 2 social Internet
   communities in search of statistical laws in human interaction activity.
   This research reveals that human communication networks dynamically
   follow scaling laws that may also explain the observed trends in
   economic growth. Specifically, we identify a generalized version of
   Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling law between the
   fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and their level
   of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding economic
   growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its
   origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns
   in human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire
   period of the available data of more than 1 year. Further, we provide a
   mathematical framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's
   law to the long-term correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same
   underlying mechanism could be the source of Gibrat's law in economics,
   ranging from large firms, research and development expenditures, gross
   domestic product of countries, to city population growth. These findings
   are also of importance for designing communication networks and for the
   understanding of the dynamics of social systems in which communication
   plays a role, such as economic markets and political systems.

AB Background: Lower rates of screening among minorities and low-income
   populations contribute to colorectal cancer health disparities.
   Therefore, we examined patterns of colorectal cancer screening and
   associations with race-ethnicity, education, and income over time.
   Methods: Repeated cross-sectional data from the Medicare Current
   Beneficiary Survey of noninstitutionalized colorectal cancer-free
   Medicare enrollees ages 65 to 80 years interviewed in 2000 (n = 8,355),
   2003 (n = 7,922), and 2005 (n = 7,646). We examined rates of
   colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy use within 5 years (recent endoscopy),
   colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy use >5 years previously, or fecal occult blood
   test (FOBT) within 2 years.
   Results: Among those included in the analyses, there was a steady
   increase in recent endoscopy rates and decrease in FOBT use over the
   6-year period among all racial, educational, and income groups. During
   each of the survey years, those less educated or in lower-income groups
   were less likely to undergo colorectal cancer screening in a
   dose-response fashion. In multinomial regression analyses that adjusted
   for factors including health insurance, there were no significant
   differences in recent endoscopy or FOBT rates between Blacks or
   Hispanics and Whites, but differences by education and income remained.
   Compared with those in higher-income group, lower-income enrollees had
   lower rates of screening, and differences by income were larger for
   enrollees residing in metropolitan areas.
   Conclusion: Among Medicare beneficiaries, there are persistent
   colorectal cancer screening disparities due to a complex combination of
   socioeconomic disadvantages from lower education and income, place of
   residence, and inadequate insurance. However, insurance alone does not
   eliminate socioeconomic differences in colorectal cancer screening.

AB Perceivers' ability to correctly identify the internal states of social
   targets-known as empathic accuracy (EA)-is critical to social
   interactions, but little work has examined the specific types of
   information that support EA. In the current study, social targets
   varying in trait emotional expressivity were videotaped while discussing
   emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers watched these videos and
   inferred targets' affect while having access to only visual or auditory
   information, or both. EA was assessed as the correlation of perceivers'
   inference and targets' self-ratings. Results suggest that auditory, and
   especially verbal information, is critical to EA. Furthermore, targets'
   expressivity predicted both target behavior and EA, an effect influenced
   by the valence of the events they discussed. Specifically, expressive
   targets produced more nonverbal negative cues, and higher levels of EA
   when perceivers could only see them discussing negative events;
   expressive targets also produced more positive verbal cues, and higher
   levels of EA when perceivers could only hear them discussing positive
   events. These results are discussed in relation to social display rules
   and clinical disorders involving social deficits.

AB This research explores the sociological factors underlying the
   increasing popularity of corporate logo tattoos. The authors draw upon
   critical theory, sociology of the body, and consumption to analyze data
   from in-depth interviews with a small sample of subjects with a
   corporate logo tattoo. Findings suggest that the increasing popularity
   of logo tattoos is a product of the commodification of culture via the
   culture industry. Findings show that the majority of the sample was
   motivated by brand loyalty and self-identification with a brand
   philosophy or lifestyle, while a small minority attempted to alter the
   intended meaning of the logo by appropriating it into a simulated
   meaning. This research suggests that corporate logo tattoos are one way
   that corporations have inscribed themselves onto the bodies and into the
   identities of many of those who acquire them, while others attempt to
   use such body modifications as a way to play with postmodern images.

AB The Female Secondary School Stipend Project in Bangladesh was
   established to increase the enrollment of girls in secondary schools,
   thereby delaying marriage and childbearing. This analysis examined the
   existing data using the social exclusion framework to clarify the
   primary exclusionary factors that have kept girls from education:
   harassment, poverty, and the primacy of marriage and childbirth and
   explored the extent to which the project has diminished such barriers.
   While causality is difficult to establish, data suggest that the stipend
   programme has contributed to the rise in enrollment of girls in
   secondary schools. Questions remain as to the impact of the stipend
   programme on delaying marriage, empowerment of girls and women, and
   enhancing employment opportunities. A thorough assessment of the impact
   is required. The case study suggests that, if the programme design had
   focused on the quality and content of education and the broader economic
   and social context, more opportunities would have been created for
   social and economic participation of girls.

AB According to social exclusion theory, health risks are positively
   associated with involuntary social, economic, political and cultural
   exclusion from society. In this paper, a social exclusion framework has
   been used, and available literature on microcredit in Bangladesh has
   been reviewed to explore the available evidence on associations among
   microcredit, exclusion, and health outcomes. The paper addresses the
   question of whether participation in group-lending reduces health
   inequities through promoting social inclusion. The group-lending model
   of microcredit is a development intervention in which small-scale credit
   for income-generation activities is provided to groups of individuals
   who do not have material collateral. The paper outlines four pathways
   through which microcredit can affect health status: financing care in
   the event of health emergencies; financing health inputs such as
   improved nutrition; as a platform for health education; and by
   increasing social capital through group meetings and mutual support. For
   many participants, the group-lending model of microcredit can mitigate
   exclusionary processes and lead to improvements in health for some; for
   others, it can worsen exclusionary processes which contribute to health
   disadvantage.

   sociology interrogating sport and space, few scholars have attempted to
   situate the lived experiences of cyborg athletes both within the wide
   range of indoor, often more technologized settings, and outdoors in what
   have been considered "wilderness" environments. Furthermore, little work
   has examined the relationship between sport identities, sporting
   environments, and environmental politics. Therefore, this study
   qualitatively examined the lived sporting experiences of 12 competitive
   athletes who trained and competed both indoors and outdoors while using
   an array of sporting technologies. Results showed that athletes
   negotiated the boundaries between human, technology, and nature in
   complex, often contradictory ways, and made moderate connections between
   their cyborg identities and their impact on the environment.

AB Background: Metabolic syndrome has the highest prevalence among
   Mexican-American women. Little information is available for Caribbean
   Hispanics, the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority in the United
   States. We sought to evaluate the frequency of metabolic syndrome and
   its relationship with race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and
   education in women of largely Caribbean Hispanic origin.
   Methods: There were 204 women enrolled in a cross-sectional study who
   had demographics, fasting glucose, lipid profile, waist circumference,
   and blood pressure determined. Metabolic syndrome (defined by the
   National Cholesterol Education Program/Adult Treatment Panel III
   [NCEP/ATPIII]) was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic
   regression to test age, race/ethnicity, education, health insurance, and
   residence on the risk of metabolic syndrome. A P value <0.05 was
   considered significant.
   Results: Mean age was 58 +/- 11 years, Hispanic 44.1% (93% Caribbean),
   non-Hispanic white (NHW) 38.7%, and non-Hispanic black 9.8%. Education
   was some high school (<HS) 33.7%, HS graduate 11.2%, some college 12.9%,
   college graduate 10.1%, and postgraduate 32%. Health insurance was
   Medicaid 47.8% and commercial 52.2%. Area of residence was urban 77.1%
   and suburban 22.9%. The frequency of metabolic syndrome was 42.4%, and
   was increased in Hispanic women (63.3%) versus NHW (29.6%), women with
   <HS (72.6%) versus postgraduate education (32.1%), women with Medicaid
   (57.9% vs. 27.4%) and urban residence (47.5% vs. 27.2%). For all
   comparisons, P < 0.05. Education < HS was linked to increased risk of
   metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5 [1.2-10.0], P = 0.02).
   Hispanic women had the lowest level of education (P < 0.001) and the
   highest frequency of individual metabolic syndrome components (P <
   0.01).
   Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome showed an alarming rate in less educated
   Caribbean Hispanic women and was independently associated with lower
   education level.

AB One of the unintended consequences of decades-long public housing policy
   has been to concentrate the poor within communities that are at the
   extreme end of economic disadvantage. More than in other types of
   disadvantaged communities, living in public housing can sharply
   circumscribe the social world of its residents and isolate them from
   people and social institutions in surrounding areas. This study draws on
   the concepts of social isolation from urban sociology and offending
   "awareness space" from environmental criminology to explain why violence
   rates are dramatically higher in public housing compared to otherwise
   disadvantaged nonpublic housing neighborhoods and, moreover, whether
   residents or outsiders are responsible for the violence. Using homicide
   data for the Southeast Policing Area of Los Angeles (1980 through 1999),
   and relating the location of homicides within and outside of public
   housing to the places of residence of both victims and offenders, our
   research reveals that public housing developments are hotbeds of
   violence involving predominantly local residents. There is no evidence
   that public housing serves as either a magnet for violence by drawing in
   nonlocal offenders, or a generator of violence in surrounding
   neighborhoods. We conclude that this social isolation from the larger
   community can both escalate violence between residents inside public
   housing, but also limit their offending awareness space, such that the
   violence is contained from spreading beyond the development.

AB Exposure to traffic-related pollution (TRP) and tobacco smoke have been
   associated with new onset asthma in children. Psychosocial
   stress-related susceptibility has been proposed to explain social
   disparities in asthma. We investigated whether low socioeconomic status
   (SES) or high parental stress modified the effect of TRP and in utero
   tobacco smoke exposure on new onset asthma. We identified 2,497 children
   aged 5-9 years with no history of asthma or wheeze at study entry
   (2002-2003) into the Children's Health Study, a prospective cohort study
   in southern California. The primary outcome was parental report of
   doctor-diagnosed new onset asthma during 3 years of follow-up.
   Residential exposure to TRP was assessed using a line source dispersion
   model. Information about maternal smoking during pregnancy, parental
   education (a proxy for SES), and parental stress were collected in the
   study baseline questionnaire. The risk of asthma attributable to TRP was
   significantly higher for subjects with high parental stress (HR 1.51
   across the interquartile range for TRP; 95% CI 1.16-1.96) than for
   subjects with low parental stress (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74-1.49;
   interaction P value 0.05). Stress also was associated with larger
   effects of in utero tobacco smoke. A similar pattern of increased risk
   of asthma was observed among children from low SES families who also
   were exposed to either TRP or in utero tobacco smoke. These results
   suggest that children from stressful households are more susceptible to
   the effects of TRP and in utero tobacco smoke on the development of
   asthma.

AB Rationale: Prior research has suggested an association between chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the development of cognitive
   decline; however, these studies have been cross-sectional or small case
   series.
   Objectives: To determine whether COPD increases the risk of cognitive
   decline among older adults surveyed in a large, population-based
   longitudinal cohort.
   Methods: We included data from the 1996 to 2002 waves of the Health and
   Retirement Study, a biennial nationally representative survey. We
   studied respondents who completed cognitive testing in 1996 and at least
   one subsequent survey, and excluded those with unknown history of COPD.
   Clinical history of COPD was based on self-report; severity was
   categorized based on use of oxygen or disease-related activity
   limitations. Our primary outcome was cognitive performance, measured
   using a validated 35-point scale. We examined the effect of COPD on
   cognition using multivariable mixed linear models accounting for
   repeated measurements, adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical
   characteristics.
   Measurements and Main Results: A total of 4,150 adults were included in
   our study. Among them, 12% reported a history of COPD (29% severe, 71%
   nonsevere disease). On repeated measurement, mean cognition scores of
   older adults with both severe and nonsevere COPD were significantly
   lower when compared with adults without COPD (2.6 points [P < 0.001] and
   0.9 points [P < 0,001], respectively). After multivariable adjustment,
   mean scores of adults with severe COPD remained lower (0.9 point [P <
   0.001]), whereas mean score of adults with nonsevere COPD was no longer
   different (P = 0.39) when compared with adults without COPD.
   Conclusions. Severe COPD was associated with lower cognitive performance
   on standardized measurement over time.

   other category of caregiver to perform high-demand tasks, such as
   bathing or feeding. These results suggest that Martu grandmothers are

AB Achievements that attract social rewards in developed countries, such as
   educational qualifications, a prestigious career, and the ability to
   acquire prestige goods, interfere with a woman's ability to achieve
   reproductive success. This tradeoff between cultural and reproductive
   success may have developed because economic development creates an
   evolutionarily novel social environment. In the social environment of
   developed countries, a far smaller proportion of social exchange is
   between kin than in the small-scale communities in which the human brain
   and behavior evolved. Evidence suggests that social interaction between
   non-kin is less likely to encourage behavior that enhances inclusive
   fitness. A model of the cultural change that is likely to result from
   this change in social influence suggests that beliefs and values will
   become increasingly less consistent with the pursuit of fitness (Newson
   et al. [2007]: Evol Hum Behav 28: 199-210). Responses to the World Value
   Survey, which has been carried out in over 70 countries, confirm a
   number of the predictions of this model. In countries where fertility
   began to decline more recently, people appear to perceive the costs of
   having children to be lower relative to the cost of childlessness and
   the benefits of being a parent. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 21:464-471, 2009. (C)

AB Over the last three decades many authors have addressed the demographic
   transition from the perspective of evolutionary theory. Some authors
   have emphasized parental investment factors such as the costs of raising
   children, others have emphasized the effects of mortality and other
   forms of risk, and others have emphasized the biased transmission of
   cultural norms from people of high status. Yet the literature says
   little about the relative strengths of each of these types of
   motivations or about which ones are more likely to serve as the primary
   impetus for large-scale demographic change. In this paper, I examine bow
   each of these factors has influenced the demographic transition in urban
   South India during the course of the 20th century using two measures of
   fertility transition: number of surviving children and age at marriage.
   I find that investment-related, risk-related, and cultural transmission
   predictors all have significant individual effects on the outcome
   variables, which persist when they are entered in combination. When the

AB BACKGROUND
   Ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) may partially reflect
   differences in chronic stress burden that vary by social class and
   exposure to ethnic discrimination. Stress is associated with increased
   endothelin-1 (ET-1). This study examined the relationship of ET-1 to
   socioeconomic status (SES) and to perceived ethnic discrimination among
   black (n = 51) and white (n = 65) adults (mean age 36.5).
   METHODS
   The Perceived Discrimination subscale of the Scale of Ethnic Experience
   measured exposure to discrimination and the Hollingshead Two-Factor
   Index of Social Position assessed SES. Plasma ET-1 was sampled upon
   awakening after an overnight admission.
   RESULTS
   SES and ET-1 levels were similar across ethnic groups, but mean
   discrimination scores were higher among blacks than whites (P < 0.001).
   Multiple regressions found that the SES x ethnicity interaction was
   associated with ET-1 (P < 0.05), after adjustment for gender, resting
   mean arterial pressure (MAP), body mass index (BMI), and exercise
   frequency. Regressions stratified by ethnicity revealed that lower SES
   correlated with higher ET-1 in whites (P < 0.001), but not blacks, and
   accounted for 21% of the variance. Another series of regressions
   revealed an interaction effect of ethnicity by discrimination on ET-1 (P
   < 0.05). Increased discrimination correlated with increased ET-1 among
   blacks (P < 0.05), but not whites, and explained 11% of the variance
   after adjustment for SES, gender, exercise frequency, and socially
   desirable response bias.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Thus, ET-1 levels increased in association with different psychosocial
   burdens in blacks and whites. Plasma ET-1 was higher among whites with
   lower SES and among blacks with higher levels of perceived ethnic
   discrimination, regardless of SES.

AB Bioethics is a relatively new endeavor, emerging as a discourse distinct
   from considerations of moral responsibility occurring within the

   bioethics varies across different social and cultural settings. In
   particular, the article looks at bioethical work in the US and France,
   exploring these different manifestations of the movement toward external
   oversight of those working in medicine and the life sciences. Our
   comparative data demonstrate how pathways of professionalization are
   shaped by contingent cultural and historical factors. We contrast
   'demand' and 'supply' theories of professionalization and suggest that
   the increasing prominence of the bioethical occupation is the result of
   both the professional desires of bioethicists and a concern for the
   public good.

AB BACKGROUND: This study is a cost-benefit analysis that quantifies the
   social and economic benefits to household lead paint hazard control
   compared with the investments needed to minimize exposure to these
   hazards.
   OBJECTIVES: This research updates estimates of elevated blood lead
   levels among a cohort of children <= 6 years of age and compiles recent
   research to determine a range of the costs of lead paint hazard control
   ($1-$11 billion) and the benefits of reduction attributed to each cohort
   for health care ($11-$53 billion), lifetime earnings ($165-$233
   billion), tax revenue ($25-$35 billion), special education ($30-$146
   million), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder ($267 million), and
   the direct costs of crime ($1.7 billion).
   RESULTS: Each dollar invested in lead paint hazard control results in a
   return of $17-$221 or a net savings of $181-269 billion.
   CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial returns to investing in lead hazard
   control, particularly targeted at early intervention in communities most
   likely at risk. Given the high societal costs of inaction, lead hazard
   control appears to be well worth the price.

AB Understanding how setting attributes influence the nature of the visitor
   experience is crucial to effective recreation management. Highly
   influential attributes are useful indicators to monitor within a
   planning framework, such as Limits of Acceptable Change. This study
   sought to identify the setting attributes perceived to have the most
   profound effect on the ability to have "a real wilderness experience"
   and to assess the degree to which attribute importance varied with
   situational context and visitor characteristics. To this end, exiting
   hikers were surveyed at moderate and very high use trailheads in Alpine
   Lakes Wilderness, WA (USA), and Three Sisters Wilderness, OR (USA). They
   were asked about the degree to which encountering varying levels of
   different setting attributes would add to or detract from their
   experience. Attributes with the largest range of effect on experience,
   based on evaluations of different levels, were considered most
   important. The most influential attributes were litter and several types
   of campsite interaction-people walking through camp and number of other
   groups camping close by. The perceived importance of setting attributes
   did not vary much between wilderness locations with substantially
   different use levels, suggesting that conclusions are robust and
   generalizable across wilderness areas. There also was little difference
   in the perceptions of day and overnight visitors. In contrast, we found
   substantial variation in the perceived importance of setting attributes
   with variation in wilderness experience, knowledge, attachment, and
   motivation. Our results validate the emphasis of many wilderness
   management plans on indicators of social interaction, such as number of
   encounters.

AB Efforts to identify factors associated with peer acceptance have
   historically focused on behavioral and social cognitive processes,

   other personal attributes and competencies that are not inherently a
   component of social competence. The current study examined the
   association of three such nonsocial attributes - physical
   attractiveness, athleticism, and academic competence - with peer
   acceptance and whether these associations vary as a function of gender
   and development. In addition, we examined the extent to which peer
   perceptions of these attributes were associated with positive and
   negative patterns of social behavior and whether child attributes
   accounted for unique variance in peer acceptance above and beyond
   indices of social behavior. Use of a large (N = 3183) sample of students
   in grades 2-10 allowed examination of whether the associations of child
   attributes, social behavior, and peer acceptance varied as a function of
   development or gender. All three attributes consistently accounted for
   unique variance in social acceptance and behavior, although their
   relative importance varied. Child gender and grade level were
   significant, but not universal, moderators of these associations.

   that most policy makers do not make gender-specific plans as epidemics
   progress, our research team-which draws upon expertise from both within
   and outside the region-worked together to make programmatic and policy
   suggestions in the Middle East and North Africa region in 5 key areas:
   (1) gender-specific and gender transformative HIV prevention
   interventions; (2) access to quality education and improvements in life
   skills and sex education; (3) economic empowerment; (4) property rights;
   and (5) antiviolence. In short, this work builds upon many ongoing

AB As the HIV/AIDS epidemic has progressed, the role of gender inequality
   in its transmission has become increasingly apparent. Nearly half of
   those living with the virus worldwide are women, and women's
   subordination to men increases their risk of infection and makes it
   harder for them to access treatment once infected. Men, too, suffer from
   harmful gender norms-the expectation that they will behave in ways that
   heighten their risk of HIV infection and that they will be cavalier
   about seeking health care increases their vulnerability to the disease.
   In the Middle East and North Africa, HIV infection rates are low, but
   changing gender norms have the potential to accelerate the spread of the
   disease if gender inequality is not addressed. Improving women's
   education, workforce participation, and social and political
   opportunities is crucial to strengthening health in the region. Work
   with men to shift gender imbalances is a further important task for the
   region's policy-makers and civil society groups.

AB Though still limited in scale, work with men to achieve gender equality
   is occurring on every continent and in many countries. A rapidly
   expanding evidence base demonstrates that rigorously implemented
   initiatives targeting men can change social practices that affect the
   health of both sexes, particularly in the context of HIV and AIDS. Too
   often however, messages only address the harm that regressive
   masculinity norms cause women, while neglecting the damage done to men
   by these norms. This article calls for a more inclusive approach which
   recognizes that men, far from being a monolithic group, have unequal
   access to health and rights depending on other intersecting forms of
   discrimination based on race, class, sexuality, disability, nationality,
   and the like. Messages that target men only as holders of privilege miss
   men who are disempowered or who themselves challenge rigid gender roles.
   The article makes recommendations which move beyond treating men simply
   as "the problem", and instead lays a foundation for engaging men both as
   agents of change and holders of rights to the ultimate benefit of women
   and men. Human rights and other policy interventions must avoid
   regressive stereotyping, and successful local initiatives should be
   taken to scale nationally and internationally.

AB Vertex betweenness centrality is a metric that seeks to quantify a sense
   of the importance of a vertex in a network in terms of its 'control' on
   the flow of information along geodesic paths throughout the network. Two
   natural ways to extend vertex betweenness centrality to sets of vertices
   are (i) in terms of geodesic paths that pass through at least one of the
   vertices in the set, and (ii) in terms of geodesic paths that pass
   through all vertices in the set. The former was introduced by Everett
   and Borgatti [Everett, M., Borgatti, S., 1999. The centrality of groups
   and classes. journal of Mathematical Sociology 23 (3), 181-201], and
   called group betweenness centrality. The latter, which we call
   co-betweenness centrality here, has not been considered formally in the
   literature until now, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we
   show that these two notions of centrality are in fact intimately related
   and, furthermore, that this relationship may be exploited to obtain
   deeper insight into both. In particular, we provide an expansion for
   group betweenness in terms of increasingly higher orders of
   co-betweenness, in a manner analogous to the Taylor series expansion of
   a mathematical function in calculus. We then demonstrate the utility of
   this expansion by using it to construct analytic lower and upper bounds
   for group betweenness that involve only simple combinations of (i) the
   betweenness of individual vertices in the group, and (ii) the
   co-betweenness of pairs of these vertices. Accordingly, we argue that
   the latter quantity, i.e., pairwise co-betweenness, is itself a
   fundamental quantity of some independent interest, and we present a
   computationally efficient algorithm for its calculation, which extends
   the algorithm of Brandes [ Brandes, U., 2001. A faster algorithm for
   betweenness centrality. journal of Mathematical Sociology 25,1631 in a
   natural manner. Applications are provided throughout, using a handful of
   different communication networks, which serve to illustrate the way in
   which our mathematical contributions allow for insight to be gained into
   the interaction of network structure, coalitions, and information flow
   in social networks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Our classrooms are social sites and our analysis of them can be of help

   propose a sensitizing concept, the sociology of the college
   classroom-the application of sociological theory and/or concepts to
   understand social phenomena that take place at the level of the
   classroom and other sites of faculty-student interaction. We situate the
   sociology of the college classroom as a subset of the scholarship of
   teaching and learning and the sociology of higher education, Sociology
   of the college classroom can be a place not only where research meets
   teaching, but it can also be a site where sociological theory meets

AB This article explores the social-psychological process of identity
   negotiation in collaborative teaching, using Erving Goffman's (1959)
   theoretical tradition of dramaturgy to analyze the classroom itself as a
   performance venue. A dramaturgical analysis of collaborative teaching is
   especially significant given this growing pedagogical trend because
   identity negotiation in team teaching has the potential to impact one's
   teaching, one's career, and students' learning. We demonstrate that
   despite the positive outcomes of collaborative teaching for both
   teachers and learners, building a successful team is a process that
   takes time, effective communication, risk taking, and trust. Most
   significantly, sustaining a clear definition of the situation in the
   classroom is a challenge when a teaching team is engaged in the ongoing
   negotiation of roles, power, and course structure-in front of students.
   We argue that making identity claims in a collaborative team teaching
   situation is both more challenging and rewarding than acting alone on
   the classroom stage.

AB Unintended outcomes can derail the best of intentions in the classroom.
   Designing a new course for Honors students provided an opportunity to
   change my traditional teaching style. I envisioned a classroom where
   students enthusiastically became more self-directed learners. I was
   perplexed with mixed reactions from students; while some joined me and
   adopted the model of teaching and learning I proposed, far more than I
   expected resisted this change. Using a sociological framework helped me
   understand that I had overlooked the powerful influence of the larger
   institutional context for shaping and maintaining expectations for
   teacher/student role enactment. I argue that when students' comfort is
   disrupted and their normative role expectations are rendered
   unpredictable or misunderstood, some respond with resistance. Honors
   students, in particular, may be the most resistant to pedagogical
   innovation because they are the most skilled at, and invested in,
   enacting and maintaining the institutionally normative roles.

   Parents' early smoking cessation status was assessed when their children

   their children were aged 17 years. Young adult children's smoking
   cessation, of at least 6 months duration, was assessed at age 28 years.
   Forty Washington State school districts.
   Participants were 991 at least weekly smokers at age 17 whose parents
   were ever regular smokers and who also reported their smoking status at
   age 28. Questionnaire data were gathered on parents and their children
   (49% female and 91% Caucasian) in a longitudinal cohort (84% retention).
   Among children who smoked daily at age 17, parents' quitting early (i.e.
   by the time their children were aged 8) was associated with a 1.7 times
   higher odds of these children quitting by age 28 compared to those whose
   parents did not quit [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI)
   1.23, 2.36]. Results were similar among children who smoked weekly at
   age 17 (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.41, 2.58). There was a similar, but
   non-significant, pattern of results among those whose parents quit late.
   Supporting our earlier findings, results suggest that parents' early
   smoking cessation has a long-term influence on their adult children's
   smoking cessation. Parents who smoke should be encouraged to quit when
   their children are young.

   eighth grade students (43% White, 26% Latino, 7% Asian American/Pacific
   Islander, 3% African American, 14% mixed ethnic origin, and 5% "other")
   ages 11-14 years from southern California. Substance use was collected
   at two time points (fall 2004 and spring 2005) during an academic year.
   Models were run for each substance separately. Results supported an
   association between victimization from bullying and substance use.
   Youths who experienced each type of bullying (mental or physical)
   separately or in combination were more likely to report use of each
   substance in spring 2005. This finding held after controlling for
   gender, grade level, ethnicity and Substance use in fall 2004. (C) 2009

   and attitudes toward drinking-related behaviors. The sample consisted of
   594 NCAA student-athletes from two geographically opposite sites. Norms
   variables utilized a school and gender-specific athletic peer reference
   group. Results indicate that respondents reported greater perceived
   injunctive norms than actual attitudes, and greater perceived
   descriptive norms than actual alcohol use. Further, after accounting for
   demographics and alcohol motivations, perceived injunctive norms were
   the strongest predictors of athletes' attitudes with the final model
   explaining 54% of the variance. Similarly. perceived descriptive norms
   were among the strongest predictors of alcohol use with the final model
   explaining 69% of the variance. Future research may want to use both of
   these perceived norms constructs to create a more salient and targeted
   social norms intervention aimed at reducing risky behavior and
   permissive alcohol-related attitudes among this population. Utilizing
   this strong peer reference group as well as targeting both injunctive
   and descriptive norms may increase the power and saturation of

   theory-based questions about how, and for whom. the program had its
   effects on the outcomes. Participants were 429 families of 6th graders
   enrolled in 33 rural schools located in the Midwestern United States.
   Schools were randomly assigned to conditions. Target adolescents (52%
   female) were interviewed periodically from age 11 to age 22; throughout
   adolescence, information was collected also from the youths' parents.
   Moderation and mediation analyses were conducted using regression
   analysis and structural equation modeling with covariates measured at
   baseline (age 11), mediators measured at posttest (age 12), and the
   outcome measured at the young adult follow-up (age 22). Results showed
   that PDFY reduced the rate of alcohol abuse among target young women,
   with evidence that this effect was mediated by increased prosocial
   skills. The rate of alcohol abuse among PDFY group men was not
   significantly different from that of control group men. Findings have

   has investigated the mechanisms involved. Using data from the General
   Social Survey, a nationally representative biennial survey that in 2002
   and 2004 interviewed 2031 sexually experienced adults, the authors
   examine levels of empathic concern, altruistic values, and the past year
   occurrence of altruistic and reciprocal behaviors among homosexually and
   exclusively heterosexually experienced adults. Overall, women reported
   higher levels of empathic concern and stronger altruistic values,
   relative to men while men reported engaging in a wider variety of
   altruistic behaviors than did women. In gender-specific comparisons,
   homosexually experienced men reported stronger altruistic values than
   did exclusively heterosexual men but levels of empathic concern and the
   range of altruistic and reciprocal behaviors engaged in did not vary
   appreciable. Among women, homosexually experienced women reported
   engaging in a wider range of altruistic behaviors than exclusively
   heterosexual women, but did not differ in their levels of empathic
   concern or strength of altruistic values. Findings support the existence
   of some small sexual orientation-related differences in altruistic
   values and altruistic and reciprocal behaviors. These have implications
   for HIV-related volunteerism. One surprising finding in this study was
   that approximately 17% of homosexually experienced men had donated blood
   in the year prior to interview despite the prohibition against doing so.

AB Background The purpose of the study was to examine the potential of
   adding socioeconomic status (SES) to Framingham Risk Scoring (FRS) to
   improve coronary heart disease (CHD) prediction by SES.
   Methods We assessed the effect of measures of SES (< 12 years of
   education or low income) on model discrimination and calibration when
   added to FRS in a prospective cohort, Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities. We validated use of this model in a second cohort, the
   National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey linked to the
   National Death Index.
   Results Based on FIRS alone, persons of higher and lower SES had a
   predicted CHD risk of 3.7% and 3.9%, respectively, compared with
   observed risks of 3.2% and 5.6%. Adding SES to a model with FRS improved
   calibration with predicted risk estimates of 3.1% and 5.2% for those
   with higher and lower SES, mitigating the discrepancy between predicted
   and observed CHD events for low-SES persons. Model discrimination (area
   under the receiver operator curve) was not significantly affected, and
   consistent findings were observed in the validation sample. Inclusion of
   SES in the model resulted in upgrading of risk classification for 15.1%
   of low-SES participants (95% CI 13.9-29.4%).
   Conclusions Standard FIRS underestimates CHD risk for those at low SES;
   treatment decisions ignoring SES may exacerbate SES disparities. Adding
   SES to CHID risk assessment reduces this bias. (Am Heart J 2009;

PD JUN 2009

AB Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in
   terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories.
   Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences
   in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This
   article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to
   develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant
   hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We
   argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under
   circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that,
   compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare
   participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare
   exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in
   states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using
   individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple
   panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged
   with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine
   immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and
   transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare
   benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire
   account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to
   avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of
   dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment
   discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy
   implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.

AB Cultural traits spread via multiple mechanisms among individuals within
   social groups, including via transmission biases that occur when
   subordinates copy from dominants (prestige transmission), or via common
   cultural trait variants that are favoured over rare ones (consensus
   transmission). Most animal populations are subdivided into social groups
   where cultural learning occurs, yet theoretical studies of cultural
   trait transmission have tended to focus on within-group transmission
   dynamics. We developed an agent-based model of cultural transmission in
   socially structured populations in which a trait arises in one
   individual and either persists until a stable population equilibrium is
   reached, or goes extinct. With this model, we systematically varied
   group size, rates of dispersal among groups, mortality rates,
   transmission characteristics, the benefit of the cultural trait
   (including possibly negative benefits), and whether individuals disperse
   locally or randomly. We used generalized linear models to examine how
   changes in these parameters influence trait extinction, equilibrium
   prevalence and time to equilibrium. Four traits increased the
   probability of extinction: smaller group size, higher background
   mortality, lower transmission rate and more costly traits (although
   costly traits sometimes reached an equilibrium). Local dispersal and
   biased transmission mechanisms (prestige and consensus) had no
   significant effects on extinction probability, and similar patterns were
   found for equilibrium prevalence. We found that a lower dispersal rate
   and local dispersal slowed the time required for a trait to reach
   equilibrium, as did smaller groups, lower transmission rates and lower
   costs. Collectively, these analyses reveal that prestige and consensus
   transmission have weaker effects than other factors associated with
   demographic and social conditions. (C) 2009 The Association for the

AB PURPOSE: Obesity is more common in black women than in white women.
   Racial discrimination is a form of chronic stress that may influence
   weight.
   METHODS: We assessed the association of perceived racism with weight
   change between 1997 and 2005 in 43,103 women from the Black Women's
   Health Study, a prospective follow-up of U.S. black women aged 21-69
   years at entry in 1995. Eight questions about perceptions and
   experiences of racism were asked in 1997 from which two summary
   variables were created: everyday racism (e.g., how often do people act
   "as if you are not intelligent?"), and lifetime racism (e.g., unfair
   treatment due to race "on the job"). Mixed linear regression models were
   used to calculate the multivariate adjusted means for changes in body
   weight across categories of perceived racism.
   RESULTS: Weight gain increased as levels of everyday and lifetime racism
   increased. The mean multivariable-adjusted difference in weight change
   between the highest and the lowest quartile of everyday racism was 0.56
   kg. The mean difference comparing the highest category of lifetime
   racism to the lowest was 0.48 kg.
   CONCLUSION: These prospective data suggest that experiences of racism
   may contribute to the excess burden of obesity in U.S. black women. Ann

   low/moderate-income, urban, U.S., Black, White, and Latino mothers (35)
   and fathers (34) participated in qualitative interviews exploring work
   and family conditions and spillover, food roles, and food-choice coping
   and family-adaptive strategies. Parents expressed a range of evaluations
   from overall satisfaction to overall dissatisfaction as well as
   dissatisfaction limited to work, family life, or daily schedule.
   Evaluation criteria differed by gender. Mothers evaluated satisfaction
   on their ability to balance work and family demands through flexible
   home and work conditions, while striving to provide healthy meals for
   their families. Fathers evaluated satisfaction on their ability to
   achieve schedule stability and participate in family meals, while
   meeting expectations to contribute to food preparation. Household, and
   especially work structural conditions, often served as sizeable barriers
   to parents fulfilling valued family food roles. These relationships
   highlight the critical need to consider the intersecting influences of
   gender and social structure as influences on adults' food choices and
   dietary intake and to address the challenges of work and family
   integration among low income employed parents as a way to promote family
   nutrition in a vulnerable population. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Objective: To examine whether the number of maternal psychopathologies

   in preschool children exposed to disaster, using child behavior ratings
   from multiple informants.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Lower Manhattan, New York, New York.
   Participants: One hundred two preschool child-mother dyads directly
   exposed to the World Trade Center attacks.
   Exposures: Maternal disorders: 2 (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]
   and depression), 1 (depression or PTSD), or none.
   Main Outcome Measures: Maternal depression and PTSD were self-reported.
   Child behavioral problems were rated by mothers and teachers using a
   standardized behavioral checklist. For each informant, we created
   separate dichotomous variables that indicated whether the child's
   behavioral problems were severe enough to be clinically significant. We
   then used an analytic technique (generalized estimating equations) that
   integrates the child behavioral problem ratings by the mother and
   teachers to derive a more reliable indicator of clinically significant
   child behavioral problems.
   Results: The rate of clinically significant child behavioral problems
   increased linearly relative to the number of maternal psychopathologies.
   The number of maternal psychopathologies was associated with a linear
   increase in functional impairment. Compared with children of mothers
   without psychopathologies, children of mothers with depression and PTSD
   were at greater risk for several clinically significant problems,
   notably, aggressive behavior (relative risk, 13.0), emotionally reactive
   behavior (11.2), and somatic complaints (10.5). Boys were more likely to
   have clinically significant behavior problems than were girls.
   Conclusion: Concurrent maternal depression and PTSD was associated with
   dramatic increases in the rate of clinically significant behavioral
   problems in preschool children, particularly boys, 3 years after the
   World Trade Center attacks.

AB Objective: To estimate the proportion of children who receive an

   Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
   Participants: Children retained in kindergarten or first (K/1) grade and
   third grade, presumably for academic reasons, were followed up through
   fifth grade.
   Main Outcome Measure: Presence or absence of an IEP.
   Results: A total of 300 children retained in K/1 and 80 retained in
   third grade were included in the study. Of the K/1 retainees, 68.9%
   never received an IEP during the subsequent 4 to 5 years; of the
   third-grade retainees, 72.3% never received an IEP.
   Kindergarten/first-grade retainees in the highest quintile for
   socioeconomic status and those with suburban residence were less likely
   to receive an IEP than retained children in all other socioeconomic
   status quintiles (adjusted odds ratio, 0.17; 95% confidence interval,
   0.05-0.62) and in rural communities (0.16; 0.06-0.44). Among K/1
   retainees with persistently low academic achievement in math and
   reading, as assessed by standardized testing, 38.2% and 29.7%,
   respectively, never received an IEP.
   Conclusions: Most children retained in K/1 or third grade for academic
   reasons, including many of those who demonstrated sustained academic
   difficulties, never received an IEP during elementary school. Further
   studies are important to elucidate whether retained elementary
   schoolchildren are being denied their rights to special education
   services. In the meantime, early-grade retention may provide an
   opportunity for pediatricians to help families advocate for appropriate
   special education evaluations for children experiencing school
   difficulties.

   Introduction: Cultural differences among crewmembers and mission control
   personnel can affect long-duration space missions. We examine three
   cultural contrasts: national (American vs. Russian); occupational
   (crewmembers vs. mission control personnel); and organizational [Mir
   space station vs. International Space Station (ISS)]. Methods: The Mir
   sample included 5 American astronauts, 8 Russian cosmonauts, and 42
   American and 16 Russian mission control personnel. The ISS sample
   included 8 astronauts, 9 cosmonauts, and 108 American and 20 Russian
   mission control personnel. Subjects responded to mood and group climate
   questions on a weekly basis. The ISS sample also completed a culture and
   language questionnaire. Results: Crewmembers had higher scores on
   cultural sophistication than mission control personnel, especially
   American mission control. Cultural sophistication was not related to
   mood or social climate. Russian subjects reported greater language
   flexibility than Americans. Crewmembers reported better mood states than
   mission control, but both were in the healthy range. There were several
   Russian-American differences in social climate, with the most robust
   being higher work pressure among Americans. Russian-American social
   climate differences were also found in analyses of crew only. Analyses
   showed Mir-ISS differences in social climate among crew but not in the
   full sample. Discussion: We found evidence for national, occupational,
   and organizational cultural differences. The findings from the Mir space
   station were essentially replicated on the ISS. Alterations to the ISS
   to make it a more user-friendly environment have still not resolved the
   issue of high levels of work pressure among the American crew.

AB Background: The only published US study, on racial/ethnic disparities in
   inpatient asthma management was performed in 1989-1990 at a single
   center. The authors reported that black and Hispanic children were
   provided substandard care at hospital discharge compared to white
   children. The purpose of the present analysis was to reexamine this
   important issue in a large multicenter study.
   Methods: A cohort study of 1,232 children and adults hospitalized with a
   physician diagnosis of acute asthma at 30 hospitals in 22 US states was
   used.
   Results: The cohort included 562 children (age range, 2 to 17 years; 39%
   white; 42% black; and 19% Hispanic) and 670 adults (age range, 18 to 54
   years; 44% white; 44% black; and 12% Hispanic). There were no
   significant racial/ethnic differences in the choice of inpatient
   medications or length of stay among either children or adults. At
   hospital discharge, Hispanic children were less likely to receive an
   asthma action plan (37%) compared to white children (60%) or black
   children (63%; p < 0.001). Multivariate adjustment for eight variables
   (including socioeconomic status, hospital admissions for asthma in the
   past year, medication use prior to presentation, physical examination
   findings, and hospital admission location) attenuated the statistical
   significance of this association (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence
   interval, 0.1 to 2.5).
   Conclusions: We did not identify racial/ethnic disparities in the
   inpatient treatment and outcomes for children or adults with acute

   American and 91 European American college students. Participants
   received one of four priming conditions (positive, negative, neutral
   expectancies and control) and completed several measures of
   perfectionism and psychological well-being at pretest and posttest.
   Findings showed that, controlling for pretest scores, priming
   participants with negative outcome expectancies led to higher levels of
   negative perfectionism and lower levels of positive perfectionism, and
   priming participants with positive outcome expectancies led to lower
   levels of negative perfectionism and higher levels of positive affect.
   Differences also emerged between Asian and European Americans in levels
   of perfectionism and the link between perfectionism and well-being.
   Asian Americans had lower levels of subjective well-being and higher
   levels of negative perfectionism than European Americans, and Asian
   Americans were also less susceptible to the effects of positive priming.
   Present findings raise the possibility that cultural differences may
   affect ways of thinking about the past, present and future.

AB An ecosystem approach to human health was adopted in a community-based
   study carried out in Bebnine, an underserved town in Lebanon. The
   objective of the study is to examine the association between women's
   household practices and diarrhea among children in a setting where
   contaminated drinking water and intestinal diseases are common. A total
   of 280 women were randomly selected and interviewed using a structured
   questionnaire. Data were collected on 712 children between the ages of 6
   and 14. The study instrument included determinants of diarrhea such as
   sociodemographic characteristics, water, sanitation, hygiene practices,
   gender variables, and behavioral risk factors. Multivariate regression
   analysis was employed to examine the association between water handling
   practices and diarrhea. The prevalence of diarrhea is 5%. Female
   children are more likely to suffer from diarrhea than male children (OR
   = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.19-5.62). Treatment of drinking water at the household
   level and the use of drinking water for cooking and the preparation of
   hot beverages are protective against diarrhea (OR = 0.15; 95% CI:
   0.03-0.65). Female caretakers' behaviors such as daily bathing and
   seeking medical care at times of illness are protective against diarrhea
   in children. The findings suggest that diarrhea is a gendered health
   problem. Female children, who are generally more involved in household
   activities than male children, are at higher risk of suffering from
   diarrhea. Female caretakers' personal hygiene, household practices, and
   perceptions of diarrhea are additional risk factors. Intervention
   activities would be more effective if based on a better understanding of
   gender roles and household power relations.

   indicates that race, ethnicity, place of residence, age, educational

   enteric bacterial diseases. The lack of specificity of information
   regarding salmonellae and shigellae serotypes may have led to less

   serotype-specific data on incidence, which may be available from
   laboratory-based surveillance systems.

AB Objective: To outline the lessons learned about the use of focus groups
   for the multisite, multi-ethnic longitudinal Study of Women Across the
   Nation (SWAN). Focus groups were designed to identify potential cultural
   differences in the incidence of symptoms and the meaning of
   transmenopause among women of diverse cultures, and to identify
   effective recruitment and retention strategies.
   Design: Inductive and deductive focus groups for a multi-ethnic study.
   Setting: Seven community research sites across the United States
   conducted focus groups with six ethnic populations: African American,
   Chinese American, Japanese American, Mexican American, non-Hispanic
   white, and Puerto Rican.
   Patients or Participants: Community women from each ethnic group of
   color.
   Interventions: A set of four/five focus groups in each ethnic group as
   the formative stage of the deductive, quantitative SWAN survey.
   Main Outcome Measures: Identification of methodological advantages and
   challenges to the successful implementation of formative focus groups in
   a multi-ethnic, multi-site population-based epidemiologic study.
   Results: We provide recommendations from our lessons learned to improve
   the use of focus groups in future studies with multi-ethnic populations.
   Conclusions: Mixed methods using inductive and deductive approaches
   require the scientific integrity of both research paradigms. Adequate
   resources and time must be budgeted as essential parts of the overall
   strategy from the outset of study. inductive cross-cultural researchers
   should be key team members, beginning with inception through each
   subsequent design phase to increase the scientific validity,
   generalizability, and comparability of the results across diverse ethnic
   groups, to assure the relevance, validity and applicability of the
   findings to the multicultural population of focus. (Ethn Dis.

AB Using a large contemporary United States data set, the National

   examines the relationship between parental work schedules and adolescent
   depression at age 13 or 14, paying particular attention to the
   mechanisms that may explain this relationship. Analysis based on
   structural equation modelling showed that increased work at night by
   mothers was significantly associated with a lower quality of home
   environment and fewer meals together, and this mediator was
   significantly linked to increased risks for adolescent depression. In
   addition, evening work by fathers was significantly associated with
   lower paternal closeness and this mediator was significantly associated
   with increases in adolescent depression. In contrast, irregular shifts
   by both mothers and fathers increased the likelihood of mothers knowing
   where the child was and this relationship in turn reduced adolescent
   depression. Implications and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB Drawing from prior research and sociological theorization, this study
   investigates (1) if the transnational organization of production in the
   context of foreign investment dependence contributes to overall levels
   of environmental degradation, and (2) if transnationally controlled
   manufacturing is relatively more or less ecoefficient. To do so, fixed
   effects panel regression analyses of 37 less-developed countries from
   1975-2000 are conducted to assess the effects of secondary sector
   foreign investment on total carbon dioxide emissions and emissions per
   unit of production. Findings indicate that foreign investment in
   manufacturing is positively associated with both outcomes. Additional
   results suggest that total population, level of development, and export
   intensity are all positively associated with total emissions and
   emissions per unit of production. While supporting theorization about
   the environmental impacts of foreign investment, this study also
   underscores the importance of considering both human-ecological and
   political-economic factors when investigating human-caused environmental
   degradation.

AB Ecologically unequal exchange theory posits that the vertical flow of
   exports is a structural mechanism allowing for more-developed countries
   to partially externalize their consumption-based environmental impacts
   to lesser-developed countries. It is argued that these structural
   relationships contribute to environmental degradation in the latter
   while directly suppressing resource consumption opportunities for
   domestic populations, often well below globally sustainable thresholds.
   To assess the validity of the propositions, the authors conduct fixed
   effects and random effects panel regression analyses of the effects of
   the vertical flow of primary sector exports on deforestation and a
   refined per capita footprint measure for two samples of less-developed
   countries, 1970-2000. Results support the stated arguments of
   ecologically unequal exchange theory and point to the need for more
   rigorous comparative analyses to increase our collective understanding
   of the environmental and human well-being consequences of such
   relationships for less-developed countries.

PY 2009
AB The fact that women are more religious than men is one of the most
   consistent findings in the sociology of religion. Miller and Stark
   (2002) propose that a gender difference in risk preference of
   physiological origin might explain this phenomenon. While acknowledging
   the utility of their risk-preference mechanism, we believe that their
   assumption regarding the genesis of this difference is a premature
   concession to biology. Returning to Miller's original paper on gender,
   risk, and religiosity, we draw on power-control theory (PCT), developed
   in the work of John Hagan and colleagues, to introduce a plausible
   socialization account for these differences. We evaluate these claims
   using data from the General Social Survey. Women raised by
   high-socioeconomic status (SES) mothers are less religious than women
   raised by low-education mothers, but mother's SES has little effect on
   men's chances of being irreligious and father's SES has a negligible
   effect on the gender difference in religiosity.

AB Objective: Racism is a mechanism through which racial/ethnic disparities
   occur in child health. To assess the present state of research into the
   effects of racism on child health, a review of the literature was
   undertaken. Methods: A MEDLINE review of the literature was conducted
   between October and November 2007. Studies reporting on empirical
   research relating to racism or racial discrimination as a predictor or
   contributor to a child health outcome were included in this review. The
   definition of "child health" was broad and included behavioral, mental,
   and physical health. Results: Forty articles describing empirical
   research on racism and child health were found. Most studies (65%)
   reported on research performed on behavioral and mental health outcomes.
   Other areas studied included birth outcomes, cardiovascular and
   metabolic diseases, and satisfaction with care. Most research has been
   conducted on African-American samples (70%), on adolescents and on older
   children, and without a uniformly standardized approach to measuring
   racism. Furthermore, many studies used measures that were created for
   adult populations. Conclusions: There are a limited number of studies
   evaluating the relationship between racism and child health. Most
   studies, to date, show relationships between perceived racism and
   behavioral and mental health. Future studies need to include more
   ethnically diverse minority groups and needs to consider studying the
   effects of racism in younger children. Instruments need to be developed
   that measure perceptions of racism in children and youth that take into
   account the unique contexts and developmental levels of children, as
   well as differences in the perception of racism in different
   ethnocultural groups. Furthermore, studies incorporating racism as a
   specific psychosocial stressor that can potentially have biophysiologic
   sequelae need to be conducted to understand the processes and mechanisms
   through which racism may contribute to child health disparities. (J Dev

   recent empirical and theoretical work in history and sociology: (1) the
   formative role of colonial military experience in the careers of the
   German Freikorps officers who provide the material for his analysis and
   (2) the complex historical problem of the facticity of rape in Freikorps

AB This article revisits David W. Galenson's work on the relationship
   between artistic creativity and the life cycle of artists. Galenson
   introduces a simple classification of creativity careers (early vs.
   late-bloomers), relates it to a bipartite typology of creativity
   (conceptual vs. experimental innovators) and builds on this typology to
   explain the decreasing trend of age at which artists were most creative
   over several generations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Drawing on
   Galenson's measures, the present paper uses a different approach to
   overcome possible criticisms to his design. Applying sequence analysis
   to creativity careers of 41 major modern painters, it also yields a
   fairly different story from the one Galenson proposes. In particular, I
   show that a typology of creativity should distinguish between creativity
   occurring within artistic movements and other forms of creativity. This
   distinction is important, for the decrease in age at peak creativity
   over time seems actually driven by the evolution of movement-related
   creativity alone. Investigating the specific issue of creativity over
   the life cycle of artists, and showing that movements and interactions
   play an important part in the picture, the paper thus suggests there is
   something more than the mere individual involved in artistic creativity.

   examined self-rated health in relation to disaster characteristics,
   social resources, and post-disaster outcomes in a sample of adults who
   experienced the 2004 Florida hurricanes. We interviewed a representative
   sample of 1,452 adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 33
   Florida counties that were in the direct path of at least one of the
   2004 hurricanes (Charley, Frances, Ivan, Jeanne). Overall health status
   was assessed using a self-rating format known to be predictive of
   mortality. Poor self-rated health was endorsed by 14.6% of the sample.
   Final multivarlable models showed that poor self-rated health was
   associated with older age (p < 0.001), extreme fear during the hurricane
   (p = 0.03), low social support (p = 0.03), and depression (p = 0.003)
   since the hurricane. Self-rated health following the Florida hurricanes
   was strongly associated with two variables (social support and
   depression) that potentially can be mitigated through targeted
   interventions after disasters. Future work should evaluate secondary
   prevention strategies that can address general health-related concerns
   in the wake of a disaster.

AB Objective: To investigate whether black and white adults benefit
   similarly from perceived social support in relation to blood pressure
   (BP) dipping during sleep. Methods: The Interpersonal Support Evaluation
   List (ISEL, 12-item version), which measures the perceived availability
   of several types of functional social support, was examined for
   interactive effects with race on dipping of mean arterial pressure
   (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
   derived from 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The
   sample consisted of 156 young to middle-aged adults (61 blacks, 95
   whites; mean age = 35.7 years). Results: Mean ISEL scores did not differ
   between racial groups. Controlling for age, body mass index (BMI),
   resting BP, and socioeconomic status (SES), the interaction of social
   support by race yielded associations with nighttime dipping in MAP and
   DBP (p<.001) as well as SBP (p<.01). As ISEL scores increased among
   white participants, the extent of dipping increased in MAP, SBP, and DBP
   (p<.01), explaining 10%, 10%, and 8% of the variance, respectively.
   Conversely, black participants exhibited associations between increasing
   ISEL scores and decreasing levels of dipping in MAP, SBP, and DBP
   (P<.05), accounting for 9%, 8%, and 8% of the variance, respectively.
   Conclusion: As perceived social support increased, white adults received
   cardiovascular benefits as suggested by enhanced nocturnal dipping of
   BP, but black adults accrued risks as evidenced by blunted declines in
   BP during sleep.

AB Objective: To examine whether socioeconomic status (SES) (education,

   oxidative damage, F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2-)IsoPs) and
   gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT); and b) antioxidant nutrients (ascorbic
   acid and carotenoids). We also examine whether the proposed associations
   are mediated by smoking, alcohol consumption, and depression. Risk for
   chronic disease increases with decreasing SES. One pathway by which low
   SES might influence disease risk is by promoting oxidative stress.
   Methods: Data from 1278 participants in the Coronary Artery Risk
   Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study Were used to examine the
   association of SES with oxidation correlates and antioxidant nutrients.
   Education, occupation, health behaviors, and body mass index (BMI) were
   assessed during Years 0, 10, and 15 of the study, income and depression
   were evaluated at Years 10 and 15. F(2-)isoprostanes were measured at
   Year 15, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) at Years 0 and 10, carotenoids
   at Years 0 and 15, and ascorbic acid at Years 10 and 15. Results: Cross
   sectionally, oxidation correlates decreased and antioxidant nutrients
   increased with increasing SES, estimated in several ways, independent of
   age, sex.. race, and BMI Prospectively, lower Year 0 education and
   occupation predicted greater increases in GIST and greater decreases in
   carotenoids over 10 to 15 years. prospective associations of Year 0 SES

AB This article is an exploration of American lesbian and gay activists'
   attitudes towards transgender inclusion in the LGBT movement. Lesbian
   and gay activists articulated different attitudes towards transgender
   inclusion that were inflected by their different subcultural histories
   and ability to make connections personally with transgender issues.
   Through an analysis of 32 semi-structured interviews with Midwestern
   lesbian and gay activists, this article examines the process by which
   lesbian and gay activists become transgender allies through making
   parallels to their own oppression or visible transgender discrimination.
   This research contributes to the existing literature on both collective
   identities and ally identities by contextualizing the formation of ally
   identities within the history of the LGBT movement.

AB References to market phenomena are common enough in the sociology of
   religion, but despite the proliferation of systems of concatenate
   propositions that have been tested with survey and church membership
   data, little has been done to develop the conceptualization of how a
   religious market works. Consequently there is a significant lack of
   correspondence in the literature between the role market phenomena play
   in economics and the role of market-like counterparts in the religious
   field. While there may be some point to offering a correction to
   allegedly market-centered research in the sociology of religion, the
   intent here instead is to take what insights are to be had from the
   study of economic phenomena and draw out their implications for inquiry
   into religion.

AB Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great
   variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality,
   laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex
   behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes
   about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural
   orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual
   attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we
   merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to
   explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality.
   Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and
   Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and
   macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural
   orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a
   greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the
   United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

AB Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that

   performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control
   theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain
   concordance between fundamental sentiments about identities and

   college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different
   instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their
   major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced
   progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental
   ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a
   half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental
   ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly
   support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions

AB White working-class citizens who vote for the Republican Party have been
   fodder for much political discussion and speculation recently, and a
   debate has arisen about the role that "moral values" played in the
   political decision making of this segment of voters. In this article, we
   defend a version of the moral values claim. We show that although the
   Republicans' policies are unpopular, they are bundled with an
   overarching moral framework that is extremely resonant to this set of
   voters, and we use in-depth interviews to uncover this framework. A key
   feature of this framework, on which in the 2004 presidential election
   George W. Bush scored high and John Kerry scored low, is the appropriate
   attitude to wealth, which serves as an indicator for a candidate's
   general moral philosophy and as a heuristic about whether the candidate
   will govern with working-class voters' interests in mind. National
   Election Studies data support the argument that this was a key influence
   on the voting decision in 2004, even controlling for voters' partisan
   identification.

AB Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa
   has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and
   systematically account for the cross-national variation in the
   prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach,
   this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of
   Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that
   legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation
   of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with
   increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand
   repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and
   systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and
   militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate
   that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the
   religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political
   exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of
   economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic
   mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered
   perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.

   participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have
   ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that
   girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack
   interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of
   accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for
   low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying
   Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant
   observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as
   they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their
   participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while
   enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary
   understanding of social construction by illustrating how social
   structure and cultural discourses interact in shaping everyday social

   question by analyzing data from a new, nationally representative survey
   of the American professoriate. Contrary to the view that religious
   skepticism predominates in the academy, we find that the majority of
   professors, even at elite research institutions, are religious
   believers. We go on to examine the distribution of faculty religiosity
   across institutions, fields, and other variables, and identify a number
   of issues that future research-sensitive to the fact that religious
   faith and academic life, at least in the American context, are by no
   means mutually exclusive-should take up.

AB In rural Alaskan communities, high economic, social, and ecological
   costs are associated with fossil fuel use for power generation. Local
   concerns regarding fuel prices, environmental contamination, and the
   effects of global climate change have resulted in increased interest in
   renewable energy sources. In this Study we assessed the feasibility of
   switching from fossil fuels to wood energy in rural Alaskan villages in
   forested regions of interior Alaska. Modeling results based on recent
   data on rural energy use, demographics, economics, and forest dynamics
   indicated that the installation costs of biomass systems would be
   recouped within 10 years for at least 21 communities in the region. In
   addition, results showed that all but the largest remote Communities in
   the interior Could meet all their electrical demand and some heating
   needs with a sustainable harvest of biomass within a radius of 10 km of
   the village. Marketable carbon credits may add ail additional incentive
   for fuel conversion, particularly if U.S. prices eventually rise to
   match European levels. Biomass conversion also offers potential social
   benefits of providing local employment, retaining money locally, and
   reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire near human habitation. This
   analysis demonstrated that conversion to biomass fuels is economically
   viable and socially beneficial for many villages across interior Alaska.

AB Background: Social dominance and physical size are closely linked.
   Nonverbal dominance displays in many non-human species are known to
   increase the displayer's apparent size. Humans also employ a variety of
   nonverbal cues that increase apparent status, but it is not yet known
   whether these cues function via a similar mechanism: by increasing the
   displayer's apparent size.
   Methodology/Principal Finding: We generated stimuli in which actors
   displayed high status, neutral, or low status cues that were drawn from
   the findings of a recent meta-analysis. We then conducted four studies
   that indicated that nonverbal cues that increase apparent status do so
   by increasing the perceived size of the displayer. Experiment 1
   demonstrated that nonverbal status cues affect perceivers' judgments of
   physical size. The results of Experiment 2 showed that altering simple
   perceptual cues can affect judgments of both size and perceived status.
   Experiment 3 used objective measurements to demonstrate that status cues
   change targets' apparent size in the two-dimensional plane visible to a
   perceiver, and Experiment 4 showed that changes in perceived size
   mediate changes in perceived status, and that the cue most associated
   with this phenomenon is postural openness.
   Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that nonverbal cues associated
   with social dominance also affect the perceived size of the displayer.
   This suggests that certain nonverbal dominance cues in humans may
   function as they do in other species: by creating the appearance of
   changes in physical size.

   study was to determine whether retail clinics tend to be located in
   census tracts with higher medical need.
   Methods: The locations of retail clinics as of July 1, 2008, were mapped
   and linked to the 2000 US Census and 2008 Health Resources and Services
   Administration data. Bi-variate analyses and logistic regression models
   with random effects were used to compare the characteristics of census
   tracts with and without retail clinics. To determine whether retail
   clinics followed the underlying distribution of chain stores, the
   location of clinics conditional on there being a chain store was
   analyzed in 6 counties.
   Results: Of the 932 retail clinics, 930 were successfully mapped.
   Eighteen states had no retail clinics, and 17 states had 25 or more
   clinics. Within counties with at least 1 retail clinic, census tracts
   with retail clinics had a lower black population percentage, lower
   poverty rates, and higher median incomes and were less likely to be
   medically underserved areas/populations compared with census tracts
   without retail clinics. Similarly, stores with retail clinics were less
   likely to be located in medically underserved areas compared with stores
   without retail clinics.
   Conclusion: Retail clinics are currently located in more advantaged
   neighborhoods, which may make them less accessible for those most in
   need. Arch Intern Med. 2009; 169(10): 945-949

AB Products, styles, and social movements often catch on and become
   popular, but little is known about why such identity-relevant cultural
   tastes and practices die out. We demonstrate that the velocity of
   adoption may affect abandonment: Analysis of over 100 years of data on
   first-name adoption in both France and the United States illustrates
   that cultural tastes that have been adopted quickly die faster (i.e.,
   are less likely to persist). Mirroring this aggregate pattern, at the
   individual level, expecting parents are more hesitant to adopt names
   that recently experienced sharper increases in adoption. Further
   analysis indicate that these effects are driven by concerns about
   symbolic value: Fads are perceived negatively, so people avoid
   identity-relevant items with sharply increasing popularity because they
   believe that they will be short lived. Ancillary analyses also indicate
   that, in contrast to conventional wisdom, identity-relevant cultural
   products that are adopted quickly tend to be less successful overall
   (i.e., reduced cumulative adoption). These results suggest a potential
   alternate way to explain diffusion patterns that are traditionally seen
   as driven by saturation of a pool of potential adopters. They also shed
   light on one factor that may lead cultural tastes to die out.

AB This study determined ethnic differences in anthropometric measures of a

   of ethnic admixing and socioeconomic status (SES) on the measures.
   Adults who had attended elementary school in Hawaii underwent
   anthropometric measurements and answered questionnaires about their
   educational attainment, income, age, cultural identity, ethnic ancestry,
   and health. Individuals reporting Asian American cultural identity had
   significantly lower mean body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference
   (WC) than others, whereas those with Hawaiian/Pacific Islander cultural
   identity had significantly higher BMI and WC. Educational attainment,
   but not reported family income and age, was significantly related to BMI
   and WC, and differences in educational attainment accounted for the
   increased mean BMI and WC in Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, but did not
   account for the lower mean BMI and WC among Asian Americans. Higher
   percentage of Asian ancestry was significantly correlated with lower BMI
   and WC, whereas higher percentage of Hawaiian/Pacific Islander ancestry
   was significantly correlated with increased BMI and WC. Differences in
   education accounted for the significantly increased BMI in participants
   with a higher percentage of Hawaiian/Pacific Islander ancestry, but did
   not entirely account for the lower BMI in individuals with a higher
   percentage of Asian American ancestry. These results suggest that the
   high rate of obesity and its sequelae seen in Pacific Islanders may be
   more a result of socioeconomic status and lifestyle than of genetic
   propensity, whereas the lower rates of obesity observed in Asian
   American populations are less directly influenced by socioeconomic

   on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model
   integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing
   between "discursive" and "practical" modes of culture and cognition. The
   author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to
   illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he
   finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of

AB I use 10 years of data from a long-term study of lek-mating long-tailed
   manakins to relate the social network among males to their spatial and
   genetic structure. Previously, I showed that the network connectivity of
   young males predicts their future success. Here, I ask whether kinship
   might shape the organization of this "young-boy network". Not
   surprisingly, males that were more socially distant (linked by longer
   network paths) were affiliated with perch zones (lek arenas) that were
   further apart. Relatedness (r) among males within the network decreased
   as social distance increased, as might be expected under kin selection.
   Nevertheless, any role for indirect inclusive fitness benefits is
   refuted by the slightly negative mean relatedness among males at all
   social distances within the network (overall mean r = -0.06). That is,
   relatedness ranged from slightly negative (-0.04) to more negative
   (-0.2). In contrast, relatedness in dyads for which at least one of the
   males was outside the social network (involving at least one
   blood-sampled male not documented to have interacted with other banded
   males) was slightly above the random expectation (mean r = 0.05). The
   slight variations around r = 0 among males of different categories
   likely reflect dispersal dynamics, rather than any influence of kinship
   on social organization. Relatedness did not covary with the age
   difference between males. These results, together with previous results
   for lack of relatedness between alpha and beta male partners, refute any
   role for kin selection in the evolution of cooperative display in this
   lek-mating system.

AB Longitudinal behavioral data generally contains a significant amount of
   structure. In this work, we identify the structure inherent in daily
   behavior with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster
   multimodal data from individuals and communities within the social
   network of a population. We represent this behavioral structure by the
   principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of
   characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an
   individual's behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a
   weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights
   are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the
   day's remaining behaviors with 79% accuracy for our test subjects.
   Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for this dimensionality
   reduction technique to infer community affiliations within the subjects'
   social network by clustering individuals into a "behavior space" spanned
   by a set of their aggregate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make
   it possible to determine the behavioral similarity between both
   individuals and groups, enabling 96% classification accuracy of
   community affiliations within the population-level social network.
   Additionally, the distance between individuals in the behavior space can
   be used as an estimate for relational ties such as friendship,
   suggesting strong behavioral homophily amongst the subjects. This
   approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously
   captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously
   logging location, proximate phones, and communication of 100 subjects at
   MIT over the course of 9 months. As wearable sensors continue to
   generate these types of rich, longitudinal datasets, dimensionality
   reduction techniques such as eigenbehaviors will play an increasingly
   important role in behavioral research.

AB Terrorism is behavior that is both initiated and sustained by actors
   within a social environment. That social environment may vary along a
   continuum from supporting and enabling the behavior, to ignoring or
   being unaware of the behavior, to actively opposing the behavior. This
   article applies social disorganization theory, social capital theory and
   Black's work on terrorism to predict community characteristics likely to
   provide the anonymity required for the development of terrorist activity
   in developed nations. Using the Social Capital Community Benchmark
   Survey and case studies, the article demonstrates how the theory
   predicts and helps explain why the 9/11 terrorists went undetected even
   as they lived in the US.

AB Objective: To characterize the demographic correlates of IVF
   availability and utilization.
   Design: Demographic analysis of public data.
   Setting: Each of the 50 states in the United States was used as a unit
   of analysis.
   Patient(s): Patients undergoing IVF, as demographically estimated.
   Intervention(s): Publicly available data were collected through the
   Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology and the Centers for Disease
   Control. The US Census Bureau data were collected by using software
   available from the Centers for Disease Control.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of physicians performing IVF and the
   number of IVF cycles per 100,000 reproductive-age women were used to
   estimate IVF availability and utilization.
   Result(s): In 2005, 1,031 providers performed 98,242 fresh IVF cycles in
   430 centers. Overall availability was 2.5 IVF physicians per 100,000,
   and utilization was 236 IVF cycles per 100,000. Availability and
   utilization of IVF were highly correlated. Mean IVF availability and
   utilization were significantly higher in states with IVF insurance
   coverage. In adjusted analyses, IVF availability correlated positively
   with mandated insurance coverage, percentage of single persons, and
   median income. Utilization of IVF correlated with IVF availability,
   percentage urbanization, and percentage of individuals :25 years of age
   who had a bachelor's degree.
   Conclusion(S): Lower rates of IVF utilization in some states are
   correlated with a lack of insurance coverage and decreased availability
   of physicians providing this service. (Fertil Steril (R) 2009;91:1630-5.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of
   experimental manipulations of psychosocial exposures and to evaluate the
   sensitivity of a psychosocial questionnaire by determining the factors
   perceived.
   A 50-item questionnaire was developed from the job content questionnaire
   (JCQ) and the quality of worklife survey (QWL). The experiment involved
   simulated work at different physical and psychosocial levels.
   Forty-eight participants were exposed to two levels of one psychosocial
   manipulation (job control, job demands, social support, or time
   pressure).
   Significantly different questionnaire responses supported the
   effectiveness of psychosocial manipulations. Exploratory factor analysis
   revealed five factors: skill discretion and decision authority, stress
   level and supervisor support, physical demands, quality of coworker
   support, and decision-making support.
   These results suggest that psychosocial factors can be manipulated
   experimentally, and that questionnaires can distinguish perceptions of
   these factors. These questionnaires may be used to assess perceptions of
   psychosocial factors in experimental settings.

AB Despite the recognition of cultural influences in child socialization,
   little is known about socialization of emotion in children from
   different cultures. This study examined (a) Gujarati Indian mothers'
   reports concerning their beliefs, affective and behavioral responses to
   their children's displays of anger, sadness, and physical pain, and (b)
   their children's reported decisions to express felt emotion. Eighty
   mothers and their children (between 5 and 9 years) from two urban
   communities (suburban and old city) in Gujarat, India participated.
   Results indicated that Gujarati mothers considered their children's
   expressions of anger and sadness to be less acceptable than physical
   pain, and were more likely to convey to the child that the angry or sad
   expression was unacceptable than with physical pain. Mothers' beliefs
   about the acceptability of their children's displays were correlated
   with their reported behaviors in response to those displays, as well as
   with their children's decisions to express those feelings.
   Within-culture findings indicated that mothers in the old city
   considered their children's expressions to be less acceptable than
   mothers in the suburban community. The findings are discussed in the
   context of collectivist orientation, Hindu ideology, and social
   organization across the two communities that influence mothers' reported
   beliefs and behaviors.

   American, or other race/ethnicity, who participated in the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999-2002.
   Participants with < high school education were 2.5 times less likely
   than participants with a parts per thousand yen high school education to
   have been screened for hypercholesterolemia, after adjusting for age and
   gender (odds ratio: 0.4, 95 % confidence interval: 0.3-0.5, and similar
   across race/ethnic group). Multivariable models for awareness, treatment
   and control showed no significant trends associated with education after
   adjusting for age, gender, race and comorbidities.
   Higher education significantly increased the odds of being screened for
   hypercholesterolemia overall and within each race/ethnic group.
   Education differentials were strongest for hypercholesterolemia
   screening, and weak or no longer apparent for subsequent steps of
   awareness, treatment and control. Focusing public health policy on
   increasing screening for individuals with low education might greatly
   improve their chances of preventing or mitigating morbidity related to
   hypercholesterolemia and subsequent cardiovascular disease.

AB Heavy drinkers prior to college have been shown to increase their
   drinking in college via their self-selection into the Greek societies
   and subsequent Greek influence on their drinking. This study
   characterized the dual mechanisms underlying these processes: (a) the
   Greek selection on the basis of personality and precollege drinking and
   (b) the Greek influence through alcohol-conducive environmental factors.
   Prospective data obtained in the summer prior to college and over the
   first 6 semesters of college (N = 3,099) indicated strong precollege
   drinking-based selection, strong initial influence immediately after
   college entrance, and sustained influence afterward. Impulsivity/novelty
   seeking was associated with Greek affiliation both directly and
   indirectly via precollege drinking, whereas extraversion and neuroticism
   were associated with Greek affiliation largely independent of precollege
   drinking. Greek affiliation was related to higher levels of drinking
   norms immediately after college entrance and alcohol availability by the
   sophomore year, but not afterward, after controlling for prior drinking.
   Findings highlight the diverse mechanisms underlying accentuation of
   risky drinking over the transition to college and during the college
   years, through dynamic interplay between individuals and high-risk
   environments.

AB Objective: This experiment was a systematic examination of how drinking,
   available response time, and levels of internal and external motivations
   to respond without prejudice interact to affect responses in a
   behavioral assessment of the race bias of social drinkers. Method:
   Ninety-one white undergraduate social drinkers (45 women) were randomly
   assigned within gender to alcohol (expect alcohol/receive alcohol),
   placebo (expect alcohol/receive placebo), or simple no-alcohol control
   (expect no alcohol/receive no alcohol) conditions. Participants then
   performed a sequential priming task, the Weapons Identification Task,
   designed to assess race-biased responding, under nonspeeded (2,000 ms)
   or speeded (500 ms) instructional sets. Results: Relative to both
   placebo and simple no-alcohol control groups, participants who consumed
   alcohol to an average peak breath alcohol concentration of .08 exhibited
   higher rates of race-biased errors but only under speeded conditions.
   Further, this effect was moderated by individual differences such that
   alcohol-induced, race-biased errors were elevated among all
   participants, except those whose motives to respond without prejudice
   were primarily internal. Personal motivations to respond without
   prejudice also moderated the responses of participants in the placebo
   group, such that those restrained primarily by external concerns
   uniquely evinced more race-biased errors than participants in the other
   motive groups. Conclusions: Both alcohol intoxication and alcohol
   expectancy can increase race-biased errors but only under speeded
   conditions and in a manner moderated by participants' levels of internal
   and external motives to respond without prejudice. (J. Stud. Alcohol

AB Objective: This study examined the influence of ethnicity on factors
   affecting alcohol-use behaviors in a community sample of white, black,
   and Hispanic youth (N = 323). Conduct problems, positive alcohol
   expectancies, and socioeconomic status were expected to mediate the
   effect of negative affectivity and a paternal history of substance
   dependence on the age at onset of regular drinking and the frequency of
   drinking. Method: Subjects ages 14-21 (57.9% female; 60.7% white) were
   interviewed along with their fathers at baseline (Time 1), and subjects
   only were interviewed again 5 years later (Time 2). A structural
   equation model was used to test a deviance proneness model for
   predicting drinking behaviors and to evaluate differences on model paths
   by ethnicity. Results: Ethnic group membership moderated mediational
   pathways linked to the onset of regular alcohol use but not to drinking
   frequency An increase in the number of childhood conduct problems
   predicted an earlier age at onset of regular drinking for blacks,
   whereas more positive alcohol expectancies were associated with an
   earlier initiation of regular drinking for whites and Hispanics.
   Conclusions: Findings from this Study provide evidence that risk factors
   for alcohol use in adolescents and young adults vary according to ethnic
   group. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 337-345, 2009)

AB Objective: Three independent lines of inquiry have found associations
   between alcohol use and academic performance, sleep and academic
   performance, and alcohol use and sleep. The present study bridges this
   research by examining the links among alcohol use, sleep, and academic
   performance in college students. Method: Personal interview surveys were
   conducted with a random sample of 236 students (124 women) at a liberal
   arts college. The interviews measured alcohol consumption, gender,
   academic class, weekday and weekend bedtimes and rise times, and daytime
   sleepiness; 95% of the sample granted permission to obtain grade-point
   average (GPA) and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores from official
   college records. Results: Ordinary least squares regressions showed that
   alcohol consumption was a significant predictor of four sleep patterns:
   the duration of sleep, the timing of sleep, the difference between
   weekday and weekend night-time sleep hours (oversleep), and the
   difference between weekday and weekend bedtimes (bedtime delay). Women
   and students with late sleep schedules were more apt to report daytime
   sleepiness. SAT score was the strongest predictor of GPA. However,
   gender, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, and daytime sleepiness also
   were significant predictors when other variables were controlled. In
   addition to alcohol's direct relationship with GPA, mediational analysis
   indicated that alcohol had indirect effects on sleepiness and GPA,
   primarily through its effect on sleep schedule. Conclusions: The
   findings show how alcohol use among college students is related to
   sleep-wake patterns and further support the connection between alcohol
   use and grades. (J Stud. Alcohol Drugs 70: 355-363, 2009)

AB Objective: This study examined the relationship between living
   arrangement and heavy episodic drinking among college students in the
   United States. Using social learning theory as a framework, it was
   hypothesized that vicarious learning of peer and family alcohol-use
   norms would mediate the effects of living arrangement on heavy episodic
   drinking. Method: Analyses were conducted using data from the 2001
   Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study, a national survey
   of full-time undergraduate students attending 4-year colleges or
   universities in the United States (N = 10,008). Logistic regression
   models examined the relationship between heavy episodic drinking and
   various measures of living arrangement and vicarious learning/social
   norms. Mediation of the effects of living arrangement was tested using
   both indirect and direct methods. Results: Both student living
   arrangement and vicarious-learning/social-norm variables remained
   significant predictors of heavy episodic drinking in multivariate models
   when controlling for a variety of individual characteristics. Slight
   mediation of the effects of living arrangement on heavy episodic
   drinking by vicarious learning/social norms was confirmed for some
   measures. Conclusions: Although vicarious learning of social norms does
   appear to play a role in the association between living arrangement and
   alcohol use, other processes may underlie the relationship. These
   findings suggest that using theory alongside empirical evidence to
   inform the manipulation of living environments could present a promising
   policy strategy to reduce alcohol-related harm in collegiate contexts.

AB Objective: Lower levels of self-regulation have been associated with
   higher rates of alcohol-related consequences. Self-regulation refers to
   the effortful ability to plan and achieve delayed adaptive outcomes
   through goal-directed behavior, and this skill may play a role in
   adaptive behavioral change. The purpose of this prospective,
   longitudinal study was to test predictions from self-regulation theory
   about the relationship among self-regulation and weekly alcohol
   consumption and alcohol-related consequences over 12 months. Method:
   Participants were 170 heavy drinking college students who provided data
   on alcohol use and consequences at baseline and at 1-, 6-, and 12-month
   assessments. Results: Using a simultaneous latent growth model,
   self-regulation ability predicted the amount of initial alcohol-related
   consequences, the rate of change for alcohol-related consequences, and
   the rate of change for drinks per week. In contrast, self-regulation was
   not related to the initial level of alcohol use. Conclusions:
   Collectively, these results suggest that lower self-regulation ability
   functions as a risk factor for experiencing alcohol-related consequences
   and attenuates naturally occurring reductions in alcohol use and
   consequences over time for heavier drinking college students. (J. Stud.

AB Background Child marriage is a substantial barrier to social and
   economic development in India, and a primary concern for women's health.
   We assessed the prevalence of child marriage-ie, before 18 years of
   age-in young adult women in India, and the associations between child
   marriage and women's fertility and fertility-control outcomes.
   Methods Data from the National Family Health Survey-3 (2005-06) were
   limited to a sample of Indian women aged 20-24 years (n=22807), of whom
   14813 had been or were presently married (ever-married). Prevalence of
   child marriage was estimated for the whole sample. We used regression
   models adjusted for demographics, and models adjusted for demographics
   and duration of marriage to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for the
   associations between child marriage and both fertility and
   fertility-control outcomes, in the ever-married subsample.
   Findings 44.5% of women aged 20-24 years were married before age 18
   years, 22.6% were married before age 16 years, and 2.6% were married
   before age 13 years. Child marriage was significantly associated with no
   contraceptive use before first childbirth (adjusted OR 1.37 [95% CI
   1.22-1.54]), high fertility (three or more births) (7.40 [6.45-8.50]), a
   repeat childbirth in less than 24 months (3.00 [2.74-3.29]), multiple
   unwanted pregnancies (2.36 [1.90-2.94]), pregnancy termination (1.48
   [1.34-1.63]), and female sterilisation (6.68 [5.78-7.60]). The
   association between child marriage and high fertility, a repeat
   childbirth in less than 24 months, multiple unwanted pregnancies,
   pregnancy termination, and sterilisation all remained significant after
   controlling for duration of marriage.
   Interpretation Increased enforcement of existing policies is crucial for
   prevention of child marriage. improved family-planning education,
   access, and support are urgently needed for women married as children,

AB For too long U. S. labor sociology has been reluctant to explore the
   world. By taking a global turn, we have much to learn from labor
   scholars and labor movements in the global South-much to learn about our
   own peculiarities, about the possibilities and obstacles to building
   links across national boundaries, and about the implications of
   "globalization" for both labor organizing and labor studies. In
   particular, the public turn taken by scholars in the global South toward
   their own labor movements holds lessons for a collaboration that is
   always fraught from both sides. These are just some of the issues raised
   by the essays in this issue that examine the history of labor
   sociologies and labor movements in Brazil, China, India, South Africa,
   and South Korea.

AB This article examines the predicament and possibility for the
   development of a public sociology of labor in China. Labor studies that
   take seriously workers' class experience and capacity have been stymied
   by a Communist regime keen on censoring and domesticating sociology as a
   profession as well as fragmenting the interests, identities, and
   mobilization of the working class. Yet, in recent years, persistent
   struggles by Chinese workers themselves have created intense pressure on
   the Chinese state to redefine its position toward labor conflicts. at
   the same time, global labor and academic communities have infused ideas
   and resources that help expand the scope and linkages of labor civic
   activism.

AB This study investigates public preferences toward design and
   environmental aesthetic attributes of an automated transportation
   system-Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) in an urban setting. The goal of the
   study was to understand the perceived visual aesthetic quality of the
   PRT within diverse architectural and natural elements composing the
   town's main spatial and visual structure and to separate the various
   components that determine a cumulative visual experience. We utilized
   human perceptual judgments as indicators of visual aesthetic quality,
   and referred to a psychophysical method to assess the perceived visual
   aesthetic quality of the scenes. Perceptions were captured using a rank
   ordering process of most and least preferred scenes on presented panels
   and responses were analyzed using correlation and regression statistical
   techniques. Results indicate that specific design attributes such as
   pillar shape or size. and type of fascia, did not emerge as
   significantly influencing public perception, while the relationship
   between automated structure and vehicular infrastructure, and the
   position of the observer are particularly important. Overall findings
   indicate that studies conducted on automated transportation should
   consider the effect of context on the perception of the system. The
   findings improve our understanding of visual strengths and weaknesses of
   automated transportation structures within the urban environment and can
   be useful in the planning for similar transportation systems. (C) 2008

AB Despite pervasive exurban development in the United States (US) over the
   last several decades, a lack of relatively precise data has hindered
   basic research, including classification of the types of emerging
   exurban settlement patterns. But because exurbia transcends the
   traditional dichotomy of urban versus rural and metropolitan versus
   nonmetropolitan, standard census data are of limited value in analyzing
   these regions. To address this gap. we made use of a spatially explicit
   population database to indentify and examine the configuration of
   exurban settlement. We developed a multidimensional spatial patch index,
   which captures the variation exurban settlement across the landscape,
   along the lines of shape, size and contiguity typology of exurban
   patches. This index reveals substantial heterogeneity in fine-scale
   pattern not reflected by aggregate measures of exurban settlement
   density.
   Using this index, we then explored to what extent metropolitan
   characteristics commonly believed to influence urban decentralization
   also are associated with the configuration of decentralization. We find
   that while large, contiguous clumps of exurban settlement are correlated
   with these metropolitan characteristics, other exurban pattern types
   (such as isolated or linear patches) are not. Therefore, it appears that
   the factors that contribute to more urban decentralization may also lead
   to greater contiguity and concentration of exurban settlement.
   Additionally, we find that the processes that lead to isolated and
   dispersed exurban settlement may be different from those that foster
   contiguous, concentrated exurban settlement. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The capacity of public parks and recreation environments to promote
   physical activity for low-income communities of color is receiving
   increased attention from researchers and policymakers. As a result,
   several systems to measure park and recreation environments have been
   recently developed. Developing measures is important because they are
   critical to establishing key correlates and determinants that drive
   physical activity and inform intervention strategies. This paper briefly
   reviews recently developed approaches for measuring physical
   environments within public parks and recreation areas. It critiques the
   capacity of these approaches to advance an understanding of how parks
   and recreation settings contribute to physical activity in low-income
   communities of color. Residents of low-income communities of color are
   usually found to have lower physical activity, and this may be due
   partly to a disparity in access to parks and other recreation
   environments.
   Three primary recommendations are presented. First, future measurement
   tools should explicitly reflect inequality in the built environment in
   terms of availability and quality of parks and recreation areas. Second,
   measurement strategies should incorporate research on recreation
   activity and setting preferences important in low-income communities of
   color. Finally, the perceptions of residents of low-income communities
   of color should be reflected in measurement approaches. One strategy for
   incorporating the perceptions is community-based participatory research.
   The rapid development of high-quality tools for measuring parks and
   recreation environments is encouraging. However, existing measures
   should be tested and refined in varying social-ecologic conditions, and
   new tools should be developed specifically for nuances associated with
   low-income minority communities.

AB Obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases are directly related to
   the food environment. We describe how to better assess the food
   environment in specific ethnic minority settings for designing and
   implementing interventions, based on a review of our previous work oil
   the food environment in American Indian reservations, Canadian First
   Nations reserves, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and inner-city
   Baltimore. The types of food stores available within each setting and
   the range of healthy floods available varied greatly across these
   geographic regions. In all settings, proximity to food
   stores/supermarkets, cost, and limited availability of healthful floods
   were common features, which limited access to health-promoting food
   options. Features specific to each population should be. considered in
   an assessment of the food environment, including physical (e.g.,
   openness of stores, mix of types of food sources); consumer (e.g.,
   adequacy of the food supply, seasonal factors); and social (e.g.,
   inter-household food sharing, perceptions of food quality, language
   differences) aspects. The food environments common in low-income ethnic
   subpopulations require special focus and consideration due to the
   vulnerability of the populations and to specific and unique aspects of
   each setting.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between acculturation and sun
   safety among US Latinos.
   Methods. We used linear regression models to analyze data from 496
   Latino respondents to the 2005 Health Information National Trends
   Survey. Using sunscreen, seeking shade, and wearing protective clothing
   were the primary outcomes and were assessed by frequency scales.
   Acculturation was assessed with a composite index.
   Results. In bivariate models, acculturation was negatively associated
   with use of shade and protective clothing and positively associated with
   sunscreen use (all, P <.004). In adjusted models, acculturation was
   negatively associated with seeking shade and wearing protective clothing
   across gender and region of residence (all, P <.05).
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrated both adverse and beneficial
   effects of acculturation on Latinos' risk behaviors relating to skin
   cancer. Education about sun safety is needed for all Latinos and should
   be tailored to different levels of acculturation. Initiatives for
   Latinos who are not yet acculturated could focus on reinforcing existing
   sun-safe behaviors and presenting new ones, such as use of sunscreen;
   initiatives for highly acculturated Latinos might require more resources
   because the objective is behavior modification. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether within-county racial segregation was
   associated with increased odds of violent injury beyond individual risk.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, data on 75310 patients admitted
   with an injury to Pennsylvania hospitals from 1997 to 1999 were analyzed
   to determine the association between county-level racial segregation and
   violent injury. We used multilevel analysis to adjust for individual-
   and county-level factors. Principal components analysis allowed us to
   separate the effect of segregation from other county-level variables.
   Results. After adjustment, greater segregation was associated with
   increased odds of violent injury among Whites (odds ratio [OR]=1.20; 95%
   confidence interval [CI]=1.11, 1.30) and non-Whites (OR=1.45; 95%
   CI=1.28, 1.64). The association was stronger for non-Whites.
   Conclusions. Our results suggested that living in a county with high
   levels of racial segregation was associated with increased odds of
   violence not explained by an individual's own risk. These findings
   represent an important step in understanding the nature of observed
   links between race and violence. Future work should develop prevention
   strategies that simultaneously target community and individual risks.

AB This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882
   to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in
   the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation
   between past levels of lynching and current social control practices
   against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of
   social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we
   hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will
   be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930.
   Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three
   outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but
   the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a
   minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable
   black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal
   hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks,
   and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime
   case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup
   conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control,
   and theories that emphasize minority group threat.

   on St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. This survey was led by Gary Vescelius,
   who at that time was a student at Yale University. The ceramics
   recovered from these investigations were used to refine the island's
   prehistoric chronology and for a settlement pattern analysis. This
   article presents the results of Vescelius' 1951 survey of St. Croix and
   compares his settlement pattern analysis with the results of more recent
   investigations. A geographic information system was created and analysis
   with ArcGIS* Spatial Analyst software used elevation, soil type and

   settlements in inter-island interaction spheres, and the actions and
   behaviors involved in processes of settlement and social organizational
   change has been gained.

AB There is a limited understanding of the complex relationship between

   environmental and psychosocial factors in epilepsy a 'social

   influenced through three pathways (social environment, work and material
   factors). In the 2005 California Health Interview Survey, 246 of 604
   (41%) persons with a history of epilepsy were in poverty, defined as
   <200% Federal Poverty Level (FPL). Multivariable logistic regression
   analyses revealed persons in poverty are not more likely to report a
   history of epilepsy compared to those not in poverty. However, persons
   with a history of epilepsy in poverty were significantly less likely
   than those not in poverty to report taking medication for epilepsy (OR
   0.5) once material factors (annual income and living situation) and
   healthcare access were controlled for in the final sequential model.
   Healthcare practitioners must continue to recognize that connection to
   social services and the cost of medications are significant barriers to
   optimal care in persons with epilepsy. Improved connection to patient
   advocacy organizations and medication assistance programs may help close
   these gaps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Demography plays a large role in cultural evolution through its effects
   on the effective rate of innovation. If we assume that useful inventions
   are rare, then small isolated societies will have low rates of
   invention. In small populations, complex technology will tend lobe lost
   as a result of random loss or incomplete transmission (the Tasmanian
   effect). Large populations have more inventors and are more resistant to
   loss by chance. If human populations can grow freely, then a
   population-technology-population positive feedback should occur such
   that human societies reach a stable growth path on which the rate of
   growth of technology is limited by the rate of invention. This scenario
   fits the Holocene to a first approximation, hut the late Pleistocene is
   a great puzzle. Large-brained hominins existed in Africa and west
   Eurasia for perhaps 150,000 years with, at best, slow rates of technical
   innovation. The most sophisticated societies of the last glacial period
   appear after 50,000 years ago and were apparently restricted to west and
   north-central Eurasia and North Africa. These patterns have no simple,
   commonly accepted explanation. We argue that increased high-frequency
   climate change around 70,000-50,000 years ago may have tipped the
   balance between humans and their competitor-predators, such as lions and
   wolves, in favor of humans. At the same time, technically sophisticated
   hunters would tend to overharvest their prey. Perhaps the ephemeral
   appearance of complex tools and symbolic artifacts in Africa after
   100,000 years ago resulted from hunting inventions that allowed human
   populations to expand temporarily before prey overexploitation led to
   human population and technology collapse. Sustained human populations of
   moderate size using distinctively advanced Upper Paleolithic artifacts
   may have existed in west Eurasia because cold, continental northeastern
   Eurasia-Beringia acted as a protected reserve for prey populations.

AB Background The prevalence of obesity and overweight is rapidly
   increasing in industrialized countries, with long-term health and social
   consequences. There is also a strong social patterning of obesity and
   overweight, with a higher prevalence among women, racial/ethnic
   minorities and those from a lower socio-economic position (SEP). Most of
   the existing work in this area, however, is based on cross-sectional
   data or single cohort studies. No national studies to date have examined
   how social disparities in obesity and overweight differ by age and
   historical period using longitudinal data with repeated measures.
   Methods We used panel data from the nationally representative Monitoring
   the Future Study (19862004) to examine social disparities in
   trajectories of body mass index (BMI) over adulthood (age 1845).
   Self-reported height and weight were collected in this annual US survey
   of high-school seniors, followed biennially since 1976. Using growth
   curve models, we analysed BMI trajectories over adulthood by gender,
   race/ethnicity and lifetime SEP (measured by parents education and
   respondents education).
   Results BMI trajectories exhibit a curvilinear rate of change from age
   18 to 45, but there was a strong period effect, such that weight gain
   was more rapid for more recent cohorts. As a result, successive cohorts
   become overweight (BMI 25) at increasingly earlier points in the life
   course. BMI scores were also consistently higher for women,
   racial/ethnic minority groups and those from a lower SEP. However, BMI
   scores for socially advantaged groups in recent cohorts were actually
   higher than those for their socially disadvantaged counterparts who were
   born 10 years earlier.
   Conclusions Results highlight the importance of social status and
   socio-economic resources for maintaining optimal weight. Yet, even those
   in advantaged social positions have experienced an increase in BMI in
   recent years.

TI Challenging assumptions about womens empowerment: social and economic

AB Background Although considerable research has documented the widespread
   prevalence of spousal violence in India, little is known about specific
   risk or protective factors. This study examines the relationships
   between factors that are often considered to be social and economic
   resources for women and recent occurrence of domestic violence.
   Methods Data were collected from 744 young married women in slum areas
   of Bangalore, India. Unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic
   regression models were used to determine factors associated with having
   been hit, kicked or beaten by ones husband in the past 6 months.
   Results Over half (56) of the study participants reported having ever
   experienced physical domestic violence; about a quarter (27) reported
   violence in the past 6 months. In a full multivariable model, women in
   love marriages (OR 1.7, 95 CI 1.12.5) and those whose families were
   asked for additional dowry after marriage (OR 2.3, 95 CI 1.53.4) were
   more likely to report domestic violence. Women who participated in
   social groups (OR 1.6, 95 CI 1.02.4) and vocational training (OR 3.1, 95
   CI 1.75.8) were also at higher risk.
   Conclusions Efforts to help women empower themselves through vocational
   training, employment opportunities and social groups need to consider
   the potential unintended consequences for these women, such as an
   increased risk of domestic violence. The study findings suggest that the
   effectiveness of anti-dowry laws may be limited without additional
   strategies that mobilize women, families and communities to challenge
   the widespread acceptance of dowry and to promote gender equity.
   Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the complex causal
   relationships between love marriages and domestic violence.

AB Work-family issues of graduate students are nearly invisible, despite
   record numbers of men and women in graduate school during their peak
   childbearing years. Furthermore, very little is known about what, if
   any, services are available for graduate student parents. In this
   article we describe the theoretical and practical tensions between
   society's view of idealized mothering and academia's vision of graduate
   students as idealized workers. We then present results of a survey about
   parental supports for graduate students administered to graduate
   directors of sociology PhD programs. The results demonstrate that few
   official policies exist, most situations are accommodated individually,
   and graduate directors are often unaware of university services for
   graduate student parents. The article concludes with a detailed
   presentation of potential departmental and university initiatives
   designed to support graduate student parents. These initiatives can be
   readily incorporated by graduate departments and universities to help
   curb the leaking pipeline of women in academia.

AB Kidney disease is one of the most striking examples of health
   disparities in American public health. Disparities in the prevalence and
   progression of kidney disease are generally thought to be a function of
   group differences in the prevalence of kidney disease risk factors such
   as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity However, the presence of these
   comorbidities does not completely explain the elevated rate of
   progression from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease
   among high-risk populations such as African Americans. We believe that
   the social environment is an important element in the pathway from CKD
   risk factors to CKD and end-stage renal disease. This review of the
   literature draws heavily from social science anti social epidemiology to
   present a conceptual frame specifying how social, economic, and
   psychosocial factors interact to affect the risks for and the
   progression of kidney disease.

AB Purpose: Racial/ethnic disparities in nocturia prevalence have been
   reported previously. We estimated nocturia prevalence rates by
   race/ethnicity and determined the contribution of socioeconomic status
   to potential differences by race/ethnicity.
   Materials and Methods: The Boston Area Community Health Survey used a
   multistage stratified design to recruit a random sample of 5,501 adults,
   including 2,301 men and 3,200 women, who were 30 to 79 years old.
   Nocturia was defined as voiding more than once per night in the last
   week or voiding more than once per night fairly often, usually or almost
   always in the last month. Self-reported race/ethnicity was defined as
   black, Hispanic and white. Socioeconomic status was defined as a
   combination of education and household income.
   Results: The overall prevalence of nocturia was 28.4% with a higher
   prevalence in black and Hispanic participants compared to white
   participants (38.6% and 30.7%, respectively, vs 23.2%), a trend that was
   consistent by gender. After adjusting for socioeconomic status the
   increased odds of nocturia in Hispanic men disappeared (adjusted OR
   1.04, 95% CI 0.71, 1.52), while the OR in black men was attenuated but
   remained statistically significant (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.12, 2, 21). In
   women the association between race/ethnicity and nocturia was attenuated
   but remained statistically significant after adjusting for socioeconomic
   status.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status accounts for part of the racial/ethnic
   disparities in prevalence of nocturia. The effect of socioeconomic
   status was more pronounced in men and in Hispanic participants, while
   differences in nocturia prevalence remained significant in black men and
   women.

AB Potential fire behaviour and various societal benefits (air pollution
   removal, carbon sequestration, and stormwater runoff) were quantified in
   a California Sierra mixed-conifer forest in (a) untreated conditions,
   (b) after removing all understorey trees <15 cm dbh, and (c) after
   thinning 50% of the stand's total basal area. Potential fire behaviour
   was modelled under constant conditions near a hypothetical development
   by the FARSITE fire behaviour and growth simulator and societal benefits
   were calculated by CITYgreen, both GIS-based software applications.
   Results showed that fire behaviour was considerably moderated by both
   thinning treatments. Modelled societal benefits, however, were largely
   unaffected by either treatment, which may be the result of inherent
   assumptions in the model. Critical elements of sustainable development
   in the wildland-urban interface are discussed, including fuels
   management, enforceable construction standards, sound land-use planning,
   community education, and appropriate suppression resources. Each of
   these components will vary depending on the ecosystem and socioeconomic
   conditions of a given area that is under consideration.

AB One of the major selling points of service-learning courses is their
   potential to mutually benefit communities, universities, and students.
   Although a great deal of research reports numerous pedagogical and
   personal benefits for students-from improved grades and increased civic
   engagement to increased understanding and appreciation of
   diversity-there is relatively little research on the impact of service
   learning on the community. To understand when and how service-learning
   courses benefit the community, we conducted in-depth interviews with
   representatives of local community-based organizations that have worked
   with service learners. We report on the primary benefits and costs
   associated with service-learning courses. We identify three types of
   obstacles to successful service-learning courses: issues related to
   student conduct, poor fit between course and organizational objectives,
   and lack of communication between instructors and organizations. We
   develop practical guidelines for addressing these obstacles and for
   ensuring that service learning fulfills teaching and learning goals and
   provides valuable service to community-based organizations.

AB A course in the sociology of tourism offers an opportunity to examine a

   environment that uses the object of study as the medium of study. This
   article examines how instructors can use tourism to teach the sociology
   of tourism, and thereby help students develop an understanding of the
   subject matter through reflexive examination of classroom practice.
   Drawing on research in the sociology of tourism, it outlines a
   conceptual framework for thinking about tourism as a spatial practice
   that includes semiotic, interpersonal and cultural dimensions. Through
   examples, it shows how these dimensions can be synthesized into a
   pedagogical strategy that uses field trips and classroom learning to
   teach the sociology of tourism. The article addresses logistical and

   students in courses with an IDA component significantly improved their
   performance on quantitative skills tests. Efforts to engage students in
   active learning through the use of computers were associated with
   increased student comfort and greater interest in working with data. In
   turn, students who were comfortable working with data exhibited
   especially high levels of quantitative skill. Although students who were
   taught a wide variety of data analysis skills reported greater interest
   in working with data, those who were taught a more limited range of
   skills achieved higher performance scores. Likewise, students who were
   required to complete assignments and undertake graded examinations that
   tested a wide range of quantitative skills had less interest in working
   with data but achieved greater improvements in their test scores.

AB Globalization magnifies the problems that affect all people and that
   require large-scale human cooperation, for example, the overharvesting
   of natural resources and human-induced global warming. However, what
   does globalization imply for the cooperation needed to address such
   global social dilemmas? Two competing hypotheses are offered. One
   hypothesis is that globalization prompts reactionary movements that
   reinforce parochial distinctions among people. Large-scale cooperation
   then focuses on favoring one's own ethnic, racial, or language group.
   The alternative hypothesis suggests that globalization strengthens
   cosmopolitan attitudes by weakening the relevance of ethnicity,
   locality, or nationhood as sources of identification. In essence,
   globalization, the increasing interconnectedness of people worldwide,
   broadens the group boundaries within which individuals perceive they
   belong. We test these hypotheses by measuring globalization at both the
   country and individual levels and analyzing the relationship between
   globalization and individual cooperation with distal others in
   multilevel sequential cooperation experiments in which players can
   contribute to individual, local, and/or global accounts. Our samples
   were drawn from the general populations of the United States, Italy,
   Russia, Argentina, South Africa, and Iran. We find that as country and
   individual levels of globalization increase, so too does individual
   cooperation at the global level vis-a-vis the local level. In essence,
   "globalized'' individuals draw broader group boundaries than others,
   eschewing parochial motivations in favor of cosmopolitan ones.
   Globalization may thus be fundamental in shaping contemporary
   large-scale cooperation and may be a positive force toward the provision
   of global public goods.

   level.
   Social isolation appears to be negatively related to PA at the level of

AB The Goldschmidt Hypothesis posits that rural community welfare is
   negatively associated with the scale of farms surrounding them. The
   intervening mechanism that links a farm structure dominated by larger
   farms to negative rural community welfare outcomes is polarized class
   structure. There have been a number of studies that have found support
   for the basic relationship between increasing farm scale and negative
   rural community outcomes. However, since Walter Goldschmidt's original
   study was completed in the 1940s, the agricultural market and farming
   structures have changed dramatically. Market structure is now more
   differentiated than in previous decades. Vertical and horizontal
   integration, contract production, organic and other specialty markets,
   and direct marketing are examples of new marketing forms that have
   emerged over the past few decades. In addition, as farm and market
   structure have shifted, some states have enacted public policy to
   forestall negative outcomes related to the industrialization of
   agriculture. Previous studies which measured the effects on rural
   community welfare from the structure of the surrounding farming sector
   have been valuable contributions to the development of the sociology of
   agriculture and have led to increased understanding of agriculture and
   rural development. However, a new generation of studies should be
   undertaken to address the impacts of changing market structure as well
   as assess public policy attempts to mitigate negative impacts of
   agricultural industrialization. To that end I present a discussion of
   conceptual and methodological issues related to such a research program.
   And I offer a conceptual model intended to be useful in guiding future
   research in this area.

AB Objectives. We sought to examine racial and ethnic disparities in the
   recognition of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
   Methods. Within a multisite network, 2568 children aged 8 years were
   identified as meeting surveillance criteria for ASD through abstraction
   of evaluation records from multiple sources. Through logistic regression
   with random effects for site, we estimated the association between
   race/ethnicity and documented ASD, adjusting for gender, IQ,
   birthweight, and maternal education.
   Results. Fifty-eight percent of children had a documented autism
   spectrum disorder. In adjusted analyses, children who were Black (odds
   ratio [OR] = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64, 0.96), Hispanic
   (OR=0.76; CI = 0.56, 0.99), or of other race/ethnicity (OR= 0.65; CI =
   0.43, 0.97) were less likely than were White children to have a
   documented ASD. This disparity persisted for Black children, regardless
   of IQ, and was concentrated for children of other ethnicities when IQ
   was lower than 70.
   Conclusions. Significant racial/ethnic dispatrities exist in the
   recognition of ASD. For some children in some racial/ethnic groups, the
   presence of intellectual disability may affect professionals' further
   assessment of developmental delay. Our findings suggest the need for
   continued professional education related to the heterogeneity of the
   presentation of ASD. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99: 493-498.

   Study of Income Dynamics. We used multivariate regression techniques and
   spline models to estimate the relationship between income in different
   stages of childhood and adult body mass index, overweight, and obesity.
   We controlled for other family characteristics, including income in
   other periods of childhood.
   Results. Mean annual family income in the prenatal and birth years for
   children whose annual family incomes averaged less than $25000 was
   significantly associated with increased adult body mass index, but mean
   annual family income between 1 and 5 years of age and between 6 and 15
   years of age was not.
   Conclusions. Our results indicated that economic conditions in the
   earliest period of life (during the prenatal and birth years) may play
   an important role in eventual anthropometric measures. (Am J Public

AB Cultural capital and hegemonic masculinity are two concepts that have
   received intense attention. While both have received serious
   consideration, critique and analysis, the context or field-specificity
   of each is sometimes ignored. They have been used In a diversity of
   ways. Using ethnographic and interview data from a US male bodybuilding
   community, this studs highlights one useful employment. Hegemonic
   masculinity takes different shapes in different fields of interaction,
   acting as a form of cultural capital: gender capital. Inherent in this
   discussion are the cultural contradictions apparent among individuals
   striving for either physical or ideological embodiments of gender
   capital. Individuals can attempt to embody hegemonic idealizations, but
   bodies are not only inscribed with gender, inscriptions are read, and
   read differently by different social actors and in different settings.
   The capacity of gender capital to remain elusive is precisely what
   enables gender practices and projects like bodybuilding to retain
   passionate participation.

   analysis of publicity materials and media coverage, I reconstruct the
   symbolic frameworks that guide the construction of the event and the
   interpretation of competitors' performances. I also trace the critical
   challenge to the idealized representations of the event, and decode the
   gender ideologies implied in commonly used metaphors. Demonstrating the
   centrality of meaning in musical production and reception, I aim to
   expose the limitations of the production perspective and Bourdieu's
   model of the artistic field, offering in their place a new approach
   based on social performance.

AB Today, ethnographers and qualitative researchers in fields such as urban
   poverty, immigration, and social inequality face an environment in which
   their work will be read, cited, and assessed by demographers,
   quantitative sociologists, and even economists. They also face a demand
   for case studies of poor, minority, or immigrant groups and
   neighborhoods that not only generate theory but also somehow speak to
   empirical conditions in other cases (not observed). Many have responded
   by incorporating elements of quantitative methods into their designs,
   such as selecting respondents 'at random' for small, in-depth interview
   projects or identifying 'representative' neighborhoods for ethnographic
   case studies, aiming to increase generalizability. This article assesses
   these strategies and argues that they fall short of their objectives.
   Recognizing the importance of the predicament underlying the strategies
   - to determine how case studies can speak empirically to other cases -
   it presents two alternatives to current practices, and calls for greater
   clarity in the logic of design when producing ethnographic research in a
   multi-method intellectual environment.

AB Background. The World Health Organization has recently established
   revised child growth standards.
   Objective. To assess how the use of these new standards affects the
   estimated prevalence and socioeconomic distnibution of stunting and
   underweight among children in a large number of low- and middle-income
   countries.
   Methods. We analyzed Demographic and Health Survey data for stunting and
   underweight in 41 low- and middle-income countries employing these new
   standards and compared the results with those produced by analyses of
   the same data using the old growth references.
   Results. For all 41 countries, the prevalence of stunting increases with
   the adoption of the new standards, by 5.4 percentage points on average
   (95% CI: 5.1, 5.7). The Prevalence of underweight decreases in all but
   two of the countries, by an average of 2.9 percentage points (95%, CI:
   2.7, 3.2). The impact of using the new standards on socioeconomic
   inequalities is mixed. For stunting, inequalities tend to rise in
   absolute terms but tend to decline in relative terms. The impact on
   underweight is inconsistent across countries. Poor children suffer most
   from undernutrition, but even among the better-Off children in
   developing countries, undernutrition rates are high enough to deserve
   attention.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that the adoption of the new WHO
   standards in itself is unlikely to affect policies dramatically. They do
   confirm, however, that different strategies are likely to be required in
   these countries to effectively address undernutrition among children at
   different socioeconomic levels.

   29 disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics in
   Puerto Rico and United States Virgin Islands is still in development or
   in early stages. Efforts in the territories are complicated by
   educational and resource barriers that generate a wide gap between the
   islands and the US mainland. Methods: To meet immediate educational
   needs, we conducted in-services for local newborn screening
   professionals. The efficacy of the educational intervention was measured
   by pre and posttest scores and a seminar evaluation. An assessment was
   obtained to document local newborn screening needs and barriers, with
   focus on human resources, intervention, language, social issues,
   education, and communication. Results: Statistical significance was
   found (P value <= 0.05) between pre and posttest scores of the
   educational intervention. Needs and barriers associated with expanded
   newborn screening were also documented. Conclusion: Puerto Rico and
   United States Virgin Islands face different challenges in their
   implementation of expanded newborn screening. The data obtained in the
   present study serves as foundation for the development of public policy
   and long-term educational programs. Genet Med 2009:11(3):169-175.

   a six-month period, with the workforce peaking at 269. Project operation
   supports 10 permanent jobs and expenditures to local businesses and
   households totaling $1.4 million annually. These include easement
   payments to landowners totaling $413,000 the first year. In addition,
   the project is expected to make annual local property tax payments
   totaling $456,000. Wind energy projects do offer substantial economic
   benefits to nearby communities.

AB Social science research on polydrug use among young adult college
   students is scant, adopts definitions of this practice that are often
   devoid of sociocultural context, and emphasizes a very narrow range of
   use patterns. This article, based on ethnographic interviews from a
   study of collegiate prescription drug misuse, expands this focus by
   offering a cultural analysis of polydrug use. Two specific types of
   collegiate polydrug use, simultaneous interaction and sequential
   management, are examined within a cultural framework that relates these
   practices to the expression of two complementary values-control and
   release. The college experience provides young people with a culturally
   sanctioned "time-out" period that affords freedom from many of the
   roles, responsibilities, and other constraints that come to structure
   later adult life. At the same time, college students are expected to
   meet academic and social demands that require organization, initiative,
   and direction. Specific types of polydrug use provide young adults with
   a means to navigate these competing prescriptions that are
   characteristic of contemporary college life.

   soma-influenced sects of esoteric Buddhism that exerted influences from
   India, China and Tibet to Japan. Some of the key components, practices

AB Purpose: The aim of the present study was to examine whether culturally
   diverse adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative health
   care behaviors is associated with the following social and cognitive
   variables: health self-efficacy, value placed on health, perceived
   barriers to health promotion, and perceptions regarding primary
   caregivers' and peers' engagement' in preventative health care
   behaviors.
   Procedure: A cross-sectional study involving 108 high school students in
   health education classes was conducted. The majority of these
   participants (59.3%) identified as a racial minority, and 68% of these
   participants were female.
   Results: Health self-efficacy, value placed on health, and perceptions
   regarding primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in preventative
   health care practices were all significantly correlated with the
   participating adolescents' self-reported engagement in preventative
   health care behaviors. Primary caregivers' and peers' engagement in
   preventative health care behaviors emerged as significant predictors of
   the participating adolescents' preventative health care behaviors.
   Conclusions: Present findings suggest that family and peers are likely
   role models for adolescents in the area of preventative health care
   behaviors. Thus, interventions to promote these behaviors among
   adolescents similar to those in the present study need to be family,
   school, and community-based.

AB A pervasive anti-statism often blinds us to the democratic victories in

   that big government can democratize society and uses historical
   investigation to make the point. The Study of history emancipates its
   from the tyranny of the present. Progressive social change has come
   about in the United States and elsewhere as combined bottom-up, top-down
   initiatives. I present two such cases of democratization during the New
   Deal era. The first is about rural sociologists' participatory-action
   research with local citizens for policy planning. This program, while
   short-lived, fed into the creation of the field of community
   development. The other is a land-reform experiment among poor African
   Americans. In the 1960s these "resettlement communities" became local
   strongholds of the civil-rights movement, and their descendants carry on
   the Struggle today. I use these two historical instances to show that
   big states as well as social scientists have been effective agents of
   democracy, and suggest that they can be again. History then enable us to
   reimagine, re-new, and re-form our democratic tradition of rural
   sociology.

   violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master
   narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on
   studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial
   historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the
   degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two
   key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation
   of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective
   trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war
   Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers'
   speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the
   framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for
   apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification
   of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring
   countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that
   arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial
   conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese
   victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights

AB The structural theory of ecologically unequal exchange posits that
   through the vertical flow of exports from lower-income countries, the
   stratified world economy enables higher-income countries to
   misappropriate global environmental space. Tied to their unsustainable
   consumption levels, this misappropriation by higher-income countries
   leads to the suppression of resource consumption in lower-income
   countries, well below globally sustainable thresholds, which negatively
   impacts the well-being of domestic populations. To evaluate key aspects
   of the theory, I test the hypothesis that lower-income countries with
   elevated levels of exports sent to higher-income countries exhibit lower
   consumption-based environmental demand, measured as per-capita
   ecological footprints. Findings for generalized least squares panel
   regression analyses of 66 lower-income countries from 1975 to 2000
   confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional
   results indicate that the strength of the hypothesized relationship
   increased in magnitude during the 25-year period. These findings hold,
   net of the effects of economic development, ecological conditions, and
   other structural factors.

   in my analyses, I further utilize cognitive theory to outline three
   micro-psychological practices (i.e., routinization, goal targeting, and
   emotional alignment) that respondents apply in their attempt to
   establish the desired association between objects and identities. In

AB Socially housed monkeys have been used as a model to study human
   diseases, The present study examined behavioral, physiological and
   neurochemical measures as predictors of social rank in 16 experimentally
   naive, Individually housed female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca
   fascicularis). The two behavioral measures examined were novel object
   reactivity (NOR), as determined by latency to touch an opaque acrylic
   box placed in the home cage, and locomotor activity assessed In a novel
   open-field apparatus. Serum cortisol concentrations were evaluated three
   times per week for four consecutive weeks, and stress reactivity was
   assessed on one occasion by evaluating the cortisol response to
   adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) following dexamethasone suppression.
   Measures of serotonin (5-HT) function included whole blood 5-HT (WBS)
   concentrations, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the 5-HT
   metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and brain 5-HT
   transporter (SERT) availability obtained using positron emission
   tomography (PET). After baseline measures were obtained, monkeys were
   assigned to four social groups of four monkeys per group. The two
   measures that correlated with eventual social rank were CSF 5-HIAA
   concentrations, which were significantly higher in the animals who
   eventually became subordinate, and latency to touch the novel object,
   which was significantly lower in eventual subordinate monkeys. Measures
   of 5-HT function did not change as a consequence of social rank. These
   data suggest that levels of central 5-HIAA and measures of novel object
   reactivity may be trait markers that Influence eventual social rank in
   female macaques. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Ethnicity can be a means by which people identify themselves and others.
   This type of identification mediates many kinds of social interactions
   and may reflect adaptations to a long history of group living in humans.
   Recent admixture in the US between groups from different continents, and
   the historically strong emphasis on phenotypic differences between
   members of these groups, presents an opportunity to examine the degree
   of concordance between estimates of group membership based on genetic
   markers and on visually-based estimates of facial features. We first
   measured the degree of Native American, European, African and East Asian
   genetic admixture in a sample of 14 self-identified Hispanic
   individuals, chosen to cover a broad range of Native American and
   European genetic admixture proportions. We showed frontal and side-view
   photographs of the 14 individuals to 241 subjects living in New Mexico,
   and asked them to estimate the degree of NA admixture for each
   individual. We assess the overall concordance for each observer based on
   an aggregated measure of the difference between the observer and the
   genetic estimates. We find that observers reach a significantly higher
   degree of concordance than expected by chance, and that the degree of
   concordance as well as the direction of the discrepancy in estimates
   differs based on the ethnicity of the observer, but not on the
   observers' age or sex. This study highlights the potentially high degree
   of discordance between physical appearance and genetic measures of
   ethnicity, as well as how perceptions of ethnic affiliation are
   context-specific. We compare our findings to those of previous studies
   and discuss their implications.

AB Although distinctions between therapy and enhancement are difficult to
   draw with precision, especially in marginal cases, recent Christian
   discussions of enhancement technologies accept the general plausibility
   of distinctions drawn between therapeutic interventions and enhancement
   technologies by appealing to general understandings of nature and human
   nature. However, such appeals continue to be plagued by conceptual
   imprecision on several matters, including the status of nature as a
   source of moral insight, the scope of human responsibility in light of
   God's purposes, and the effects of sin and finitude on human freedom.

AB In the past, the primary threat to the patient as person was a medical
   utilitarianism that would sacrifice the individual for the collective,
   that would coercively (ab)use a person for the sake of an in-group's
   health or happiness. Today, the threat is not only from vainglorious
   social groups but also from valorized genes and genomes. An
   over-valuation of genes risks making persons seem epiphenomenal. A
   central thesis of this article is that religious healthcare
   professionals have unique resources to combat this. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss,

AB Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in network
   research across the physical and social sciences. For social scientists,
   the theory of networks has been a gold mine, yielding explanations for
   social phenomena in a wide variety of disciplines from psychology to
   economics. Here, we review the kinds of things that social scientists
   have tried to explain using social network analysis and provide a
   nutshell description of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory
   mechanisms prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue
   among researchers from across the physical and social sciences who share
   a common interest in understanding the antecedents and consequences of
   network phenomena.

AB Children from low-socioeconomic status ( SES) families, on average,
   arrive at school with smaller vocabularies than children from high- SES
   families. In an effort to identify precursors to, and possible remedies
   for, this inequality, we videotaped 50 children from families with a
   range of different SES interacting with parents at 14 months and
   assessed their vocabulary skills at 54 months. We found that children
   from high- SES families frequently used gesture to communicate at 14
   months, a relation that was explained by parent gesture use ( with
   speech controlled). In turn, the fact that children from high- SES
   families have large vocabularies at 54 months was explained by
   children's gesture use at 14 months. Thus, differences in early gesture
   help to explain the disparities in vocabulary that children bring with
   them to school.

AB Social networks exhibit strikingly systematic patterns across a wide
   range of human contexts. Although genetic variation accounts for a
   significant portion of the variation in many complex social behaviors,
   the heritability of egocentric social network attributes is unknown.
   Here, we show that 3 of these attributes (in-degree, transitivity, and
   centrality) are heritable. We then develop a "mirror network'' method to
   test extant network models and show that none account for observed
   genetic variation in human social networks. We propose an alternative
   "Attract and Introduce'' model with two simple forms of heterogeneity
   that generates significant heritability and other important network
   features. We show that the model is well suited to real social networks
   in humans. These results suggest that natural selection may have played
   a role in the evolution of social networks. They also suggest that
   modeling intrinsic variation in network attributes may be important for
   understanding the way genes affect human behaviors and the way these
   behaviors spread from person to person.
