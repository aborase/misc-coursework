AB Research designs to study alcohol use and abuse have included twin,
   adoption and family history/high risk studies. Results have consistently
   implied a genetic factor in the aetiology of alcohol abuse. However,
   less research has been conducted in search of environmental factors.
   This study uses kinship structure in a large national dataset (the
   National :Longitudinal Survey of Youth) to estimate (using
   DeFries-Fulker analysis) the extent of the shared genetic, non-shared
   genetic, shared environmental and non-shared environmental influences on
   alcohol use. The NLSY kinship sample contained 3890 pairs of cousins,
   half-siblings, full-siblings and twins between the ages of 14 and 21 in
   the initial year of the survey (1979). Estimates of heritability (h(2))
   and shared environment (c(2)) were small to moderate for the entire
   dataset for both light drinking and heavy drinking behaviour, with h(2)
   estimates slightly higher in each case. Non-shared genetic measures of
   self-esteem and locus of control accounted for a significant portion of
   the remaining variance in heavy drinking behaviour. Race and gender
   patterns showed c(2) and h(2) estimates that were also small to moderate
   for both light and heavy drinking behaviour. Significant non-shared
   effects were found for the White group for heavy drinking behaviour, and
   for male pairs for both heavy and light drinking behaviour.
   Additionally, implications and future directions are discussed.

AB Women in India suffer from a high incidence of reproductive disease,
   disability and death. Very little work has been done on men, but a much
   higher incidence of sexual experience outside marriage and sexually
   transmitted diseases (STDs) among males than previously expected for
   this population is now being documented. In north India, women ale
   dependent on their husbands and other family members for health-related
   decisions. Therefore, the behaviour, knowledge and attitudes of men are
   integral to the reproductive health status of couples there. This study
   explores knowledge about three distinct areas of reproductive health
   among 6549 married men in five districts of the northern state of Uttar
   Pradesh, India. Factors contributing to men's knowledge in the areas of
   fertility, maternal health and STDs were investigated. Results showed
   that very few men had basic knowledge in any of these areas. The
   likelihood of reporting knowledge was associated with a set of
   determinants that differed in their magnitude and effect across the
   areas of reproductive health explored. In particular, men's belief about
   the ability of an individual to prevent pregnancy demonstrated an
   independent association with men's knowledge. After controlling for
   factors such as age, parity and educational and economic status, men who
   believed it not possible to prevent a pregnancy were less likely to know
   when during the menstrual cycle women would become pregnant and certain
   facts about STDs, but they were more likely to be able to name two or
   more symptoms of serious maternal health conditions. Possible
   explanations for this trend are discussed.

AB Objectives-The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of marital
   status on the risk of suicide, using a large nationally representative
   sample. A related objective was to investigate the association between
   marital status and suicide by sex.
   Methods-Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to data
   from the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, based on the 1979-1989
   follow up. In estimating the effect of marital status, adjustments were
   made for age, sex, race, education, family income, and region of
   residence.
   Results-For the entire sample, higher risks of suicide were found in
   divorced than in married persons. Divorced and separated persons were
   over twice as likely to commit suicide as married persons (RR=2.08, 95%
   confidence intervals (95% CI) 1.58, 2.72). Being single or widowed had
   no significant effect on suicide risk. When data were stratified by sex,
   it was observed that the risk of suicide among divorced men was over
   twice that of married men (RR=2.38, CI 1.77, 3.20). Among women,
   however, there were no statistically significant differentials in the
   risk of suicide by marital status categories.
   Conclusions-Marital status, especially divorce, has strong net effect on
   mortality from suicide, but only among men. The study showed that in
   epidemiological research on suicide, more accurate results would be
   obtained if samples are stratified on the basis of key demographic or
   social characteristics. The study further observed that failure to
   control for relevant socioeconomic variables or combining men and women
   in the same models could produce misleading results.

AB Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association
   between receptivity to cigarette promotions and smoking uptake in a
   cohort of adolescents.
   Methods and Measures. This was a prospective cohort study of 480 4th- to
   11th-grade students conducted in three rural Vermont K-12 schools.
   Cigarette use was determined by self-report at baseline, 12 months
   (survey 2), and 21 months (survey 3). Proportional odds models were used
   to evaluate smoking uptake as a function of baseline measures of
   cigarette use, receptivity to cigarette promotions, and confounding
   factors, including grade, parental education, peer smoking, and family
   smoking. Adolescents were receptive to cigarette promotions if they
   owned or were willing to use a personal item bearing a cigarette brand
   logo [cigarette promotional item (CPI)]. Smoking status was measured
   using a 6-point ordinal index that combined experience and attitudes: 0
   = never smoker/not susceptible to smoking, 1 = never smoker/susceptible
   to smoking, 2 = puffer (1 cigarette or less in lifetime), 3 =
   non-current experimenter (2-99 cigarettes in lifetime/none in past 30
   days), 4 = current experimenter, and 5 = smoker (greater than or equal
   to 100 cigarettes in lifetime).
   Results. The 480 students were equally distributed across grade at
   baseline. Environmental exposure to smoking was high, and 30% were
   receptive to cigarette promotions at baseline. Higher levels on the
   smoking index at baseline were associated with higher grade in school,
   peer smoking, and receptivity to cigarette promotions. One hundred
   eighty-five students (38.5%) had moved to a higher category on the
   smoking index by survey, of whom 30 had become smokers. Receptivity to
   cigarette promotions at baseline was significantly associated with
   higher smoking uptake, with 48.7% of receptive students moving up one or
   more categories on the smoking index [adjusted proportional odds 1.9
   (95% CI 1.3, 2.9)]. Acquisition of receptivity to cigarette promotions
   was also associated with increased smoking uptake, with those becoming
   receptive in surveys 2 or 3 having significantly higher odds of
   progression [3.6 (1.8, 7.0) and 2.9 (1.5, 5.5), respectively] compared
   with those who did not change. Conversely, those who were receptive at
   one point but became non-receptive in surveys 2 or 3 had lower odds of
   progression [0.4 (0.2, 0.9) and 0.5 (0.3, 1.1), respectively].
   Conclusions This study supports a close linkage between tobacco
   promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond
   baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. Over time,
   the likelihood of smoking uptake is increased when an adolescent
   acquires a CPI or becomes willing to use one and is decreased when an
   adolescent who owns a CPI loses it or becomes unwilling to use it. This
   provides strong evidence that elimination of cigarette promotional
   campaigns: could reduce adolescent smoking. (C) 2000 American Health

AB This article examines the types of research methods sociologists
   studying women and gender use in articles published in mainstream
   journals. The research is based on an analysis of 1,826 gender-content
   articles published between 1984 and 1993 in 15 major sociology journals.
   Specifically, we explore whether feminist-oriented articles use
   different types of data, data collection methods, and statistical
   techniques than other articles addressing women and gender. The
   relationship between the rank of an academic journal, author's sex, and
   type of research method is also examined. We find that a large majority
   of gender-content articles are based on secondary, quantitative data.
   When the first author is a man, articles are somewhat more likely to be
   based on secondary data and to use quantitative statistical techniques.
   In general, we find that feminist research in the discipline is based on
   a melange of methodological approaches, reflecting the contested nature
   of feminist epistemologies.

AB Affirmative action policy in the United States has recently come under
   intense political attack. Opponents have developed strategies to
   eliminate affirmative action using stare referendums, often engaging in
   misleading public campaigns. in this political atmosphere, the role of
   education is significant. For many of our students, introductory
   sociology may be one of the few courses in which they are exposed to
   serious academic discussions about affirmative action. We examine the
   extent to which sociology texts accurately present affirmative action
   policy in the United States using a sample of introductory texts
   published from 1994 through 1997. We critically examine whether material
   presented either confronts or contributes to widespread myths about
   affirmative action policy. We conclude by offering practical suggestions
   to strengthen affirmative action presentations in sociology texts,
   including drawing upon significant empirical and theoretical
   sociological literature about affirmative action too often ignored by
   textbook authors.

AB Experiential learning is a flexible instructional tool, adaptable to
   suit most courses. However, only a minority of instructors use these
   types of assignments in their courses. I examine whether short-term
   experiential learning reduces the drawbacks that may prevent instructors
   from using this instructional technique. I explore instructor and
   student perspectives on three types of short-term exercises:
   observations, participant-observations, and field trips. I find that
   short-term experiential assignments reduce the logistical concerns
   involved in experiential exercises and increase the opportunities for
   analytical reflection, especially for instructors of smaller courses and
   for non-field trip activities, in large introductory lecture courses,
   additional steps to structure the reflection process can successfully
   alleviate many of the problems dealing with lack of analysis. Proper
   selection of exercises included and careful choices about their use in
   courses or units with sensitive subject matter will help increase the
   chance of positive learning outcomes.

AB in this paper we introduce a wonderful video resource that can enhance
   the undergraduate learning experience. The animated television series,
   The Simpsons, can be particularly effective for illustrating
   sociological themes and encouraging critical thinking among today's
   undergraduates. Borrowing from Mills (1959), The Simpsons complements
   teaching philosophies that stress applying the sociological imagination
   to the observation of everyday life. We have found that the show is an
   effective pedagogical tool for demonstrating sociological concepts and
   fostering students' understanding of the course material Students can
   relate to the show and by engaging them in critical discussions, The
   Simpsons is a valuable pedagogical resource to the sociology curriculum.
   The true indication of successful teaching is measured by the students'
   ability to grasp course material effectively, and then use that
   knowledge beyond the classroom. The Simpsons provides an excellent way
   To accomplish this goal.

AB Objectives: To examine the association between type of sexual
   partnership and condom use consistency. Design: A prospective follow-up
   study of women attending two urban clinics for sexually transmitted
   diseases (STD).
   Methods: Sexual diaries recording barrier method, partner initials and
   partner type for each act of intercourse were kept by 869 women. Condom
   use by partner type was evaluated in three ways in the entire group:
   among women who encountered multiple partners, during months in which
   women encountered multiple partners, and within sexual partnerships that
   changed status during the study.
   Results: Consistency of condom use was higher with new and casual
   partners than with regular partners in the entire group and among women
   who encountered multiple partners. In months in which partners of
   different types were encountered, condom-use consistency was higher with
   new and casual partners than with regular partners. Consistent condom
   use decreased in partnerships that changed status from new to regular.
   The female condom was used more often with regular partners than with
   new or casual partners in the entire study group, among women who
   encountered multiple partners, and during months in which a woman
   achieved consistent use with her regular partner.
   Conclusions: This study provides strong evidence that condom use
   behavior is modified by partner type. Observations about condom use and
   partner type made in cross-sectional or retrospective surveys also hold
   in the present longitudinal analyses of individual women and of
   partnerships that change status. The female condom may be an important
   option for achieving consistent protection within stable partner;hips.

AB Objective: To determine whether syringe exchange program use is
   associated with cessation of syringe sharing among high-risk injection
   drug users.
   Design and methods: Between 1992 and 1996, street-recruited injection
   drug users were interviewed and received HIV testing and counseling
   semi-annually, as part of a dynamic cohort study. We examined a cohort
   of 340 high-risk injection drug users for whom two observations,
   6-months apart, were available and who reported syringe sharing at the
   first interview. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed
   to determine the relationship between syringe exchange program use and
   cessation of syringe sharing, while controlling for confounding factors.
   Results: At follow-up interview, 60% (204 of 340) reported quitting
   syringe sharing. High-risk injection drug users who began using the
   syringe exchange program were more likely to quit sharing syringes
   [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (Cl),
   1.35-5.33], as were those who continued using the syringe exchange
   program (AOR,1.98; 95% Cl, 1.05-3.75) in comparison with non-syringe
   exchange program users, while controlling for confounding factors.
   Conclusions: The initiation and continuation of syringe exchange program
   use among high-risk injection drug users is independently associated
   with cessation of syringe sharing. Syringe exchange program use can be
   an important component in reducing the spread of blood-borne infectious
   diseases among high-risk injection drug users. (C) 2000 Lippincott

   Design and setting: A cross-sectional analysis of subjects in an
   observational prospective cohort systematically sampled from free meal
   lines, homeless shelters and low-income, single-room occupancy (SRO)
   hotels.
   Participants: Thirty-four HIV-infected people with a median of 12 months
   of PI therapy.
   Main outcomes: Adherence measured by periodic unannounced pill counts,
   electronic medication monitoring, and self-report; HIV RNA viral load;
   and HIV-1 genotypic changes associated with drug resistance.
   Results: Median adherence was 89, 73, and 67% by self-report, pill
   count, and electronic medication monitor, respectively. Thirty-eight per
   cent of the population had over 90% adherence by pill count. Depending
   on the measure, adherence explained 36-65% of the variation in
   concurrent HIV RNA levels. The three adherence measures were closely
   related. Of 20 genotyped patients who received a new reverse
   transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) when starting a Pi, three had primary
   protease gene substitutions. Of 12 genotyped patients who received a PI
   without a new RTI, six had primary protease gene substitutions (P <
   0.03).
   Conclusion: A substantial proportion of homeless and marginally housed
   individuals had good adherence to PI therapy. A strong relationship was
   found between independent methods of measuring adherence and concurrent
   viral suppression. PI resistance was more closely related to the failure
   to change RTI when starting a PI than to the level of adherence. (C)

AB Roots of the epidemic of alcohol-related problems among many Native
   North Americans are sought in cultural responses to European arrival,
   the role of alcohol in frontier society, and colonial and postcolonial
   policies. Evidence from the historical record is considered within the
   framework of current social science.
   Initially, Native Americans' responses to alcohol were heavily
   influenced by the example of White frontiersmen, who drank immoderately
   and engaged in otherwise unacceptable behavior while drunk. Whites also
   deliberately pressed alcohol upon the natives because it was an
   immensely profitable trade good; in addition, alcohol was used as a tool
   of "diplomacy" in official dealings between authorities and natives. The
   authors argue that further research into the origins of modern
   indigenous people's problems with alcohol would benefit from an
   interdisciplinary "determinants of health" approach in which biological
   influences on alcohol problems are investigated in the context of the
   cultural, social, and economic forces that have shaped individual and
   group drinking patterns.

AB Objectives. This study, guided by the social development model, examined
   the dynamic pattens and predictors of alcohol and marijuana use onset.
   Methods. Survival analysis and complementary log-log regression were
   used to model hazard rates and etiology of initiation with time-varying
   covariates. The sample was derived from a longitudinal study of 808
   youth interviewed annually from 10 to 16 years of age and at 18 years of
   age.
   Results. Alcohol initiation rose steeply up to the age of 13 years and
   then increased more gradually; most participants had initiated by 13
   years of age. Marijuana initiation showed a different pattern, with more
   participants initiating after the age of 13 years.
   Conclusions. This study showed that: (1) the risk of initiation spans
   the entire course of adolescent development; (2) young people exposed to
   others who use substances are at higher risk for early initiation; (3)
   proactive parents can help delay initiation; and (4) clear family
   standards and proactive family management are important in delaying
   alcohol and marijuana use, regardless of how closely bonded a child is
   to his or her mother.

AB Objectives. This study compared trends in adult cigarette smoking
   prevalence in California and the remainder of the United States between
   1978 and 1994.
   Methods. We used data from National Health Interview Surveys and
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System surveys to compare trends in
   smoking prevalence among persons 18 years and older.
   Results. In both California and the remainder of the United States, the
   estimated annual rate of decline in adult smoking prevalence accelerated
   significantly from 1985 to 1990: to -1.22 percentage points per year
   (95% confidence interval [CI]= -1.51, -0.93) in California and to -0.93
   percentage points per year (95% CI= -1.13, -0.73) in the remainder of
   the nation. The rate of decline slowed significantly from 1990 to 1994:
   to -0.39 percentage points per year (95% CI= -0.34, 0.24) in the
   remainder of the United States.
   Conclusions. The presence of an aggressive tobacco control intervention
   has supported a significant decline in adult smoking prevalence in
   California from 1985 to 1990 and a slower but still significant decline
   from 1990 to 1994, a period in which there was no significant decline in
   the remainder of the nation. To restore nationwide progress in reducing
   smoking prevalence, other states should consider similar interventions.

AB Objectives. We examined the impact of a statewide antismoking media
   campaign on progression to established smoking among Massachusetts
   adolescents.
   Methods. We conducted a 4-year longitudinal survey of 592 Massachusetts
   youths, aged 12 to 15 years at baseline in 1993. We examined the effect
   of baseline exposure to television, radio, and outdoor antismoking
   advertisements on progression to established smoking (defined as having
   smoked 100 or more cigarettes), using multiple logistic regression and
   controlling for age; sex; race; baseline smoking status; smoking by
   parents, friends, and siblings; television viewing; and exposure to
   antismoking messages not related to the media campaign.
   Results. Among younger adolescents (aged 12 to 13 years at baseline),
   those reporting baseline exposure to television antismoking
   advertisements were significantly less likely to progress to established
   smoking (odds ratio - 0.49, 95% confidence interval - 0.26, 0.93).
   Exposure to television antismoking advertisements had no effect on
   progression to established smoking among older adolescents (aged 14 to
   15 years at baseline), and there were no effects of exposure to radio or
   outdoor advertisements.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that the television component of the
   Massachusetts antismoking media campaign may have reduced the rate of
   progression to established smoking among young adolescents.

   Methods. Using data fi om the National Health Interview Surveys, we
   calculated smoking prevalence over time with a dynamic population
   demographics model, examining the effects of changes in smoking
   initiation and cessation.
   Results. The draft objective is unattainable solely through decreases in
   smoking initiation. It could be achieved through smoking cessation alone
   only if cessation rates immediately increased by a factor of more than
   3.5. Assuming plausible decreases in initiation and increases in
   cessation, the draft objective is virtually unattainable.
   Conclusions. The health objectives should challenge the status quo but
   be achievable. Formal analysis often can assist in establishing
   reasonable objectives.

   consumption and addiction to smoking are risk factors for the long-term
   continuation of smoking.
   Methods. Using longitudinal data from 986 male smokers, we entered
   cigarettes per day, psychological addiction, age, and education into a
   survival analysis as predictors of continued smoking over a 25-year
   period.
   Results. Younger men and those who smoked more cigarettes per day were
   more likely to remain smokers in the long term. Addition and education
   level were not significant predictors of continued smoking.
   Conclusions. Heavier smokers are more at risk than lighter smokers for
   long-term smoking. It is therefore very important to provide smoking
   cessation treatments for heavy smokers as early as possible after the
   initiation of smoking.

   Methods. Five movies were randomly sampled for each actress, for a total
   of 96 hours of film footage that was analyzed in 11165-minute intervals.
   Results. Leading female actors were as likely to smoke in movies aimed
   at juvenile audiences (PG/PG-13) as in R-rated movies, whereas male
   actors were 2.5 times more likely to smoke in R-rated movies.
   PG/PG-13-rated movies were less likely than R-rated movies to contain
   negative messages about smoking.
   Conclusions. Smoking is highly prevalent in Hollywood films featuring
   popular actresses and may influence young audiences for whom movie stars
   serve as role models.

   patients and possible reasons for this.
   Methods. We prospectively studied hospitalizations of a cohort of TB
   patients.
   Results. HIV-infected homeless patients were hospitalized more
   frequently than other patients, while homeless patients who had no
   insurance or whose insurance status was unknown were hospitalized
   longer. Hospitalization cost $2000 more per homeless patient than for
   other patients. The public sector paid nearly all costs.
   Conclusions. Homeless people may be hospitalized less if given access to
   medical care that provides early detection and treatment of TB infect
   ion and disease and HIV infection. Providing housing and social services
   may also reduce hospital utilization and increase therapy completion
   rates.

AB This article argues that a common organizational practice-the hiring of
   new workers via employee referrals-provides key insights into the notion
   of social capital. Employers who use such hiring methods are
   quintessential "social capitalists," viewing workers' social connections
   as resources in which they can invest in order to gain economic returns
   in the form of better hiring outcomes. Identified are three ways through
   which such returns might be realized: the "richer pool," the "better
   match," and the "social enrichment" mechanisms. Using unique company
   data on the dollar costs of screening, hiring, and training, this
   article finds that the firm's investment in the social capital of its
   employees yields significant economic returns.

   predictors of these behaviors. Data from the National Youth Survey (1)
   included 1,044 adolescents (53.5% male; mean age at year 1 = 13.20).
   Dependent measures were adolescent alcohol use, marijuana use, deviance,
   and academic failure, assessed annually over 4 years. Independent
   measures included age, gender; marital status, income, family time,
   family support, time with friends, friend deviance, knowledge of
   friends, activities, and neighborhood problems. An associative latent
   growth modeling (LGM) analysis showed significant increases and
   relations between the four behaviors in both initial status and
   development. Second-order multivariate LGM analyses indicated that the
   four behaviors could be modeled by a higher-order problem behavior
   construct. Significant effects on the common problem behavior intercept
   or slope included time with friends, deviant friends, age, marital
   status, family time, and support. Additional effects were found to be
   specific to the initial status and slopes of individual problem
   behaviors. Overall, results indicate the importance of assessing the
   relations between adolescent problem behaviors as they change over time
   and identifying the risk and protective factors that have both common

   military personnel and spouses at an East Coast air base to construct a
   measure of base cohesion. A principal components analysis yields two
   relatively stable and independent dimensions from the 50 Likert items we
   constructed. These reliable scales correlate well with measures of work
   unit cohesion and with a measure of neighborhood cohesion (especially
   among respondents in neighborhoods that are an extension of the base).
   They also correlate as well or better than work unit cohesion with

   administered to 333 African Americans, ages 40-70 years, at enrollment
   in a nutrition education study assessed: African-American cultural
   identity (15 items scored 1 (low) to 4 (high)); reference group (two
   questions about perceived success in the Black or White way of
   life-scored as bi-cultural if "yes" to both); personal identity (4 items
   on: self-concept as attractive, self-confident, satisfied and
   friendly-scored 1 (no/not sure) or 2 (yes)); and selected demographic
   and lifestyle variables. Results: Cultural identity factors reflecting
   participation in and belonging to African-American culture and
   bi-cultural reference group were related to higher SES, lower fat diets,
   not smoking, current drinking, and higher leisure time physical activity
   (cultural identity only), particularly in women (P<.001 to P=.06).
   Associations of cultural identity with physical activity and of
   bi-cultural reference group with low-fat eating and not smoking
   (females) remained significant at P<.05 after adjustment for SES.
   Conclusions: A greater emphasis is needed on aspects of cultural
   identity that are positively related to health lifestyles as distinct
   from aspects that might act as barriers.

   hypertension-related messages via programmed telephone calls, and the
   control group participants received spiritual messages only. Both the
   experimental and control group participants received the following:
   printed material on hypertension-related information and regular home
   visits from a health educator to conduct pre-test and post-test
   assessments of hypertension knowledge, pill counts, and blood pressure
   readings. Results: There were no statistically significant improvements
   in hypertension knowledge. By week 4 of the intervention, there was a
   statistically significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood
   pressure for both groups. However, there were no differences between the
   experimental and control groups. Discussion: There was no evidence that
   the telecommunications approach improved older African Americans'

   cross-sectional data from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the

   collected at baseline on 309 urban hypertensive Black men, aged 18-54,
   included: socio-demographics, health status, HBP care behaviors, alcohol
   and illicit drug use, urine screen for illicit drug use, and blood
   pressure (BP). Results: Men using alcohol and illicit drugs were less
   likely to report having medical insurance, having a doctor for HBP care,
   engaging in critical patient behaviors for HBP control, being on HBP
   medications, and compliance with HBP medication regimen. Alcohol and
   illicit drug users were more likely to eat high fat/high salt foods and
   significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes. In comparison to
   abstainers, men who used both alcohol and illicit drugs were
   significantly more likely to have uncontrolled BP and higher systolic
   blood pressure (SBP). Conclusions: Alcohol and illicit drug use were
   negatively associated with HBP care behaviors. Thus, BP was poorly
   controlled in this group of alcohol and illicit drug users. Screening,

   children and girls being less satisfied with their bodies (P<.001 and
   P<.05, respectively). Geographic isolation and lack of amenities in the
   home did not appear to affect body satisfaction or messages from others
   about being too fat or thin; however, geographically isolated students
   were more likely to choose a larger body shape as best looking. Girls of
   appropriate weight were 2.2 times more likely than boys to have been
   told they were too fat. Sixty-one percent of all students surveyed had
   tried to lose weight. These findings, although similar to those for
   non-Hispanic Whites of the same age, are contrary to prevailing ideas
   that American Indians value obesity. In fact, we observed a high level
   of body dissatisfaction among children of appropriate weight,
   particularly girls, and prevalent dieting across all weight categories
   and both genders.

AB We present the first studies to explore the relationship between racial
   discrimination and cigarette smoking among Blacks. One hundred
   fifty-three (Study 1) and 300 (Study 2) Black adults completed a survey
   on their experiences with discrimination and their smoking. Logistic
   regressions revealed that racial discrimination was the best predictor
   of smoking among Blacks in both studies, and was a better predictor than
   status variables. Smoking prevalence rates for Blacks who experience
   frequent vs infrequent discrimination were 26.7% and 6.4%, respectively;
   and for those who experience racial discrimination as extremely vs
   mildly stressful, rates were 42.2% and 20.8%, respectively. We conclude
   that the stress of racial discrimination may play an important role in
   smoking among Blacks and, therefore, warrants further investigation.

PD Spring-Summer, 2000
PY 2000
AB The 1997 standard for race and ethnicity data from the Office of
   Management and Budget requires the collection of data for multiple race
   groups. The aims of this study were to compare characteristics of
   multiple race children and describe race reporting for children within
   interracial and multiple race families. Descriptive statistics were
   estimated using the 1993-1995 National Health Interview Surveys. In this
   time period, 2.6% of children had more than one race reported. Multiple
   race children were a diverse group who differed from each other and
   their single race counterparts. For example, the percent of children
   reported as both Black and White who lived in a two-parent household
   (58.9%), was significantly less than the corresponding percents for
   other multiple race children (65.8%-79.6%), and between the
   corresponding percents for single race Black (42.7%) and single race
   White children (83.2%). The relationships between parental race and
   child's race varied. Although 3.1% of children in two-parent households
   lived with interracial parents, fewer than half of these children had
   more than one race reported. Sociodemographic variables were not
   associated with child's reported race among interracial families. These
   findings indicate that generalizations about multiple race children for
   research or policy purposes will be problematic.

AB The principal aim of this paper is to describe the socio-economic
   context in which the topic of processed complementary feeding in Latin
   America should be examined. Data from CEPAL (Comision Economica para
   America Latina y el Caribe) and from the Demographic Health Surveys
   (DHS) are used to review global trends in urban poverty and malnutrition
   in the region. The phenomena that are unique to urban life and that are
   likely to have an impact on child-care and feeding practices are
   reviewed using data from DHS for six Latin American countries. The
   issues examined include the higher levels of education and of labour
   force participation of urban women, the larger percentage of women who
   head households, and the potentially different family structure and
   social networks, which may affect the availability of substitute child
   care. Urban and rural differences in breastfeeding and complementary
   feeding patterns are also examined to improve our understanding of the
   potential constraints and opportunities for the promotion of processed
   complementary foods in Latin America. Programmatic issues that need to
   be considered in designing and targeting such interventions in largely
   urbanized Latin America are also discussed.

AB To assess whether subtypes of withdrawal could be similarly identified

   diverse cultural contexts were rated on items reflecting reticent,
   solitary-passive, solitary-active, and sociable behaviour (cf. Coplan &
   Rubin, 1998). Linkages of childhood withdrawal to peer group adjustment
   were also investigated using peer sociometric ratings. Findings, based
   on multisample confirmatory factor analysis, indicated that separate
   factors were required to represent the three withdrawn subtypes in each
   cultural setting. However, US and Russian teachers made finer
   discriminations between subtypes than did Chinese teachers. Controlling
   for other withdrawn subtypes, reticent behaviour was uniquely related to
   lower sociometric ratings in all three cultures. Sociability was
   associated with higher sociometric ratings in these diverse settings.
   Findings are interpreted in the light of cultural considerations.

AB This report examines how contemporary middle class urban mothers in
   Beijing, People's Republic of China (PRC), characterise their own
   co-parenting conduct in the family. One hundred mothers of 4-year-old
   preschoolers (95% of whom were only-children) estimated how frequently
   they engaged in several different activities hypothesised to contribute
   to co-parenting solidarity. Mothers also reported on their children's
   academic competence and behavioural adaptation. Self-reported
   co-parenting activities factored into three major dimensions: behaviours
   promoting family integrity, co-parental conflict, and frequency of
   co-parental limit-setting or reprimand activities. Children whose
   mothers reported more frequent and active efforts to promote family
   integrity were rated as more academically competent than their peers.
   Children whose mothers acknowledged more frequent interparental discord
   and conflict were described both as showing more conduct problems, and
   as more anxious than their peers. Child conduct problems were also
   associated with mothers' reports of more regular reprimand activities by
   the co-parenting partners. These co-parenting variables accounted for
   significant proportions of the variance in child behaviour measures over
   and above the contributions of maternal parenting practices. The
   implications of these findings for studies of co-parental conflict and
   solidarity within the PRC, and directions for future co-parenting
   research with Chinese families, are discussed.

AB Standard sociological theories of 'taste-as-refinement', which view
   taste as a means to maintain social distance among different social
   classes, conflict with tastemaking practice in pluralistic societies
   where taste standards are no longer exclusively defined by a society's
   elite strata. To better account for the heterogeneity of tastemaking in
   modem societies, this article suggests a framework for analysis in which
   taste is considered as a collective interpretive activity that unfolds
   in distinct institutional contexts and is shaped by culturally available
   rhetorics of aesthetic judgment. Two conflicting but complementary
   rhetorics are identified: the rhetoric of refinement and the rhetoric of
   authenticity. Drawing on historical studies of taste, the role of
   institutional context for tastemaking is demonstrated. Taste in
   pluralistic society emerges in socially, politically and rhetorically
   contested institutional spaces where it is negotiated among a plurality
   of actors who have recourse to alternative rhetorics and
   classifications.

AB Objectives-To determine whether, in the context of a face to face
   interview, socioeconomic groups differ in their propensity to provide
   details about the amount of their personal income, and to discuss the
   Likely consequences of any differences for studies that use income based
   measures of socioeconomic position.
   Design and setting-The study used data from the 1995 Australian Health
   Survey. The sample was selected using a stratified multi-stage area
   design that covered urban and rural areas across all States and
   Territories and included noninstitutionalised residents of private and
   non-private dwellings. The response rate was 91.5% for selected
   dwellings and 97.0% for persons within dwellings. Data were collected
   using face to face interviews. Income response, the dependent measure,
   was binary coded (0 if income was reported and 1 for refusals, "don't
   knows" and insufficient information). Socioeconomic position was
   measured using employment status, occupation, education and main income
   source. The socioeconomic characteristics of income non-reporters were
   initially examined using sex specific age adjusted proportions with 95%
   confidence intervals. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic
   regression.
   Participants-Persons aged 15-64 (n=33 434) who were reportedly in
   receipt of an income from one or more sources during the data collection
   reference period.
   Results-The overall rate of income nonresponse was 9.8%. Propensity to
   not report income increased with age (15-29 years 5.8%, 30-49 10.6%,
   50-64 13.8%). No gender differences were found (men 10.2%, women 9.3%).
   Income nonresponse was not strongly nor consistently related to
   education or occupation for men, although there was a suggested
   association among these variables for women, with highly educated women
   and those in professional occupations being less likely to report their
   income. Strong associations were evident between income non-response,
   labour force status and main income source. Rates were highest among the
   employed and those in receipt of an income from their own business or
   partnership, and lowest among the unemployed and those in receipt of a
   government pension or benefit (which excluded the unemployed).
   Conclusion-Given that differences in income non-reporting were small to
   moderate across levels of the education and occupation variables, and
   that propensity to not report income was greater among higher
   socioeconomic groups, estimates of the relation between income and
   health are unlikely to be affected by socioeconomic variability in
   income nonresponse. Probability estimates from a logistic regression
   suggested that higher rates of income non-reporting among employed
   persons who received their income from a business or partnership were
   not attributable to socioeconomic factors. Rather, it is proposed that
   these higher rates were attributable to recall effects, or concerns
   about having one's income information disclosed to taxation authorities.
   Future studies need to replicate this analysis to determine whether the
   results can be inferred to other survey and data collection contexts.
   The analysis should also be extended to include an examination of the
   relation between socioeconomic position and accuracy of income
   reporting. Little is known about this issue, yet it represents a
   potential source of bias that may have important implications for
   studies that investigate the association between income and health.

AB Study objective-To examine the effect of a comprehensive prenatal and
   delivery programme administered by nurse-midwives on the risk of low
   weight births among indigent women.
   Study design-Historical prospective study. Birth outcomes among the
   cohort were compared with all county births during the same period,
   adjusting for maternal age and race. Results are expressed as relative
   risks with 95% confidence intervals.
   Setting-An enhanced Medicaid funded pre-natal programme administered by
   nurse-midwives from 1992 to 1994 in Westchester County, New York.
   Participants-Indigent mothers (n=1443), between the ages of 15 and 44,
   who were residents of Westchester County and indicated having Medicaid
   or no health care coverage.
   Results-There were 1474 live among cohort mothers. Mean (SD) gestational
   age was 39.4 (1.9) weeks. Less than 6% of births occurred before 37
   weeks gestation. The mean birth weight of cohort infants was 3365.6
   (518.6) g. Only 4.1% of the cohort births were less than 2500 g.
   Compared with all county births, the cohort showed a 41% reduction in
   the risk of low weight births (RR1bw=0.59, 95%CI: 0.46 to 0.73, p<.001)
   and a 56% reduction when compared with county Medicaid births only
   (RR=0.44, 95%CI: 0.34 to 0.57, p<.005) adjusting for maternal age and
   race. Larger reductions were found for very low weight births.
   Conclusions Mothers need not be considered at high risk for adverse
   pregnancy outcomes based on their socioeconomic status alone. Moreover,
   a comprehensive prenatal programme administered by nurse-midwifes may
   promote a reduction in adverse pregnancy outcomes among indigent
   mothers.

   model was proposed to express the nature of the impact. Structural
   equation modeling was used to evaluate the model separately for men and
   women. Good-fitting, parsimonious models were developed that showed
   substantial similarity for men and women. For men, severity of PTSD
   symptoms was impacted by exposure to combat directly and indirectly
   through fear and sexual harassment. For women, severity of PTSD symptoms
   was impacted by combat indirectly through the same two influences,
   although the mechanisms involving fear and sexual harassment were
   somewhat different. For both genders, moreover, PTSD severity was
   impacted directly by exposure to the dying of the Somali people. These
   similarities suggest that in modern stressful overseas military
   missions, both genders may be susceptible to the same types of risk for
   the development of PTSD. The incidence and impact of sexual harassment
   is particularly noteworthy in the case of men and calls for more
   detailed investigation in future studies.

AB Objective: To determine rates of lifetime suicide attempts in a

   students were surveyed in the state of Hawaii for lifetime suicide
   attempts, Hawaiian cultural affiliation, socioeconomic status, and
   symptoms of depression, substance abuse, aggression, and anxiety.
   Multiple logistic regressions were used on 3,094 subjects to develop
   prediction models for lifetime suicide attempts. Results: Native
   Hawaiian adolescents had significantly higher rates of suicide attempts
   (12.9%) than other adolescents in Hawaii (9.6%). Hawaiian cultural
   affiliation rather than ethnicity was uniquely predictive of suicide
   attempts. Logistic regression indicated that depression, substance
   abuse, grade level, Hawaiian cultural affiliation, and main wage
   earner's education best predicted suicide attempts in Native Hawaiian
   adolescents, while depression, substance abuse, and aggression predicted
   suicide attempts in non-Hawaiians. Conclusions: Native Hawaiian
   adolescents have higher rates of attempted suicide than non-Hawaiian
   adolescents. Strong Hawaiian cultural affiliation rather than ethnicity
   is a risk factor for attempted suicide.

AB Background. Adults in lower status occupations are at higher risk of
   premature cardiovascular disease, for which physical inactivity is a
   major risk factor. While lower rates of leisure-time physical activity
   have been found to be associated consistently with lower income and
   education levels, the association between occupational and home-based
   physical activity with membership of different occupational categories
   is not well understood.
   Methods. An urban-representative population data set derived from a
   sell-completion questionnaire was used to examine both self-reported
   leisure-time physical activity and a combined measure of
   occupational/home-based physical activity of adult less-skilled,
   skilled, and professional workers and homemakers (3795 males; 4140
   females). chi(2) analyses, ANOVA, and logistic regressions were used to
   examine the associations between occupational group membership and
   physical activity.
   Results. After adjustment for age, body mass index, education, country
   of birth, marital status, and smoking, less-skilled workers were less
   likely to report any form of leisure-time physical activity. However,
   occupational category was not a strong predictor of participation in
   combined vigorous occupational/home physical activity. Homemakers and
   those in lower status occupations were less likely to report
   participation in vigorous leisure-time physical activity sufficient for
   cardiorespiratory fitness. With the inclusion of time spent in combined
   vigorous occupational/home physical activity, there was no longer an
   association of activity with occupational status for males. However, for
   females the association remained.
   Conclusions. The assessment of occupational and household physical
   activity in addition to leisure-time activity may be important for
   understanding associations between occupational categories, physical
   activity, and increased levels of health risk and for the development of
   physical activity promotion strategies. (C) 2000 American Health

AB Most social scientists prefer to trace all religious phenomena to
   material causes and are quick to deny the possibility that religion is
   the real cause of anything. For example, many social historians deny
   that the Quakers founded the anti-slavery movement because of their
   religious concerns, claiming instead that, whether they knew it or not,
   the quakers really opposed slavery in order to further their economic
   interests in an emerging capitalist environment. Enough! In this essay I
   first reveal the absurdity of three major efforts to reduce religious
   effects to materialism. Next, I show that four major historical events
   that have been attributed to material conditions are better understood
   as rooted in religious. Then I illustrate that religious doctrines
   differ in their capacity to produce effects by comparing the responses
   of early Christians and pagans to several great plagues. This leads to a
   preliminary discussion of factors influencing the effectiveness of
   religious doctrines, concluding that the most important factor has to do
   with the image of Gods on which the doctrines rest. Consequently, the
   sociology of religion rests upon a sociology of Gods.

AB Research conducted in developing countries clearly demonstrates the
   positive effects of breastfeeding and widely spaced births on infant
   survival. The evidence is less clear as to whether these beneficial
   effects extend into early childhood, and under what conditions. In this
   paper we examine the effects of breastfeeding and birth spacing on
   neonatal, post-neonatal, and early childhood mortality in Ethiopia using
   data from the 1990 National Family and Fertility Survey. Our results
   provide clear evidence that the increased mortality risks associated
   with closely-spaced births continue beyond the first year of life into
   early childhood. Competition between siblings for food and maternal
   attention is the most probable explanation for this finding. We also
   find that breastfeeding beyond the second year of life is associated
   with higher mortality. Given that delayed weaning in Ethiopia is a
   common response to food shortages, we interpret this finding as further
   evidence of the negative consequences of resource deprivation for child
   survival.

AB This paper analyzes the age pattern of effective fecundability from
   populations with no evidence of deliberate fertility control using a new
   convolution model of fecundability. The analysis is based on a sample of
   Hutterite birth histories from the mid-20th century, and birth histories
   of French Canadians from the 17th and 18th centuries. The main findings
   are as follows: 1) the level of effective fecundability is higher among
   the French Canadians compared to the Hutterites; 2) effective
   fecundability peaks at age 20 for the Hutterites, and in the early to
   mid-20s for the French Canadians; 3) Hutterite effective fecundability
   declines almost linearly from age 20 to 45, and French Canadian
   effective fecundability declines slowly from its peak to the early 30s,
   and more rapidly at older ages; and 4) the duration of postpartum
   amenorrhea is longer for the French Canadians than for the Hutterites.
   Because of the shorter periods of postpartum amenorrhea the Hutterites
   have about the same average number of children as the French Canadians,
   even though the French Canadians have higher effective fecundability.

AB This paper explores the extent to which women's work for earnings,

   the 1996 Nepal Family Health Survey. The findings indicate that
   education has a significant positive influence on current use of
   contraception and a significant negative influence on children ever
   born. There was virtually no relationship between women working and
   current use of contraception. However, in full models, there was a
   significant positive relationship for women who earn cash for work on
   current use and a significant negative relationship for children ever
   born. Working alone does not increase contraceptive use or reduce the
   number of children ever born in Nepal, but earning cash for work does.
   The husband/couple variables also proved to be important determinants of
   current use of contraception and children ever born.

PD SPR-SUM 2000
PY 2000
AB In this paper, we take a new approach to the question of whether or not
   intentions regarding future fertility affect fertility-related behavior.
   Our approach has three principal features: 1) it takes sterilization as
   its outcome, rather than pregnancy or birth; 2) it is based on a
   conceptual model in which fertility-related behavior is seen as
   determined by a long-range planning process, modified by unanticipated
   fife course contingencies; and 3) it uses data on desired total family
   size. Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households, we
   find that achieving one's desired parity has a strong, persistent, and
   positive effect on the probability of sterilization, supporting our view
   of the long-term nature of fertility intentions. People do modify their
   behavior in the face of unanticipated contingencies, but those effects
   are unexpectedly small.

PD SPR-SUM 2000
PY 2000
AB This paper uses intergenerational data from the Panel Study of Income
   Dynamics (PSID) to address the black-white difference in propensities
   toward low birth weight (LBW). We determine that socioeconomic
   conditions account for some variation in low birth weight across race.
   Further, while race differences in the risk of low birth weight cannot
   be explained entirely, we find that the inheritance of parental birth
   weight status dramatically reduces the black-white gap in low birth
   weight. Intergenerational legacies of poor infant health explain the
   largest share of racial disparities in filial birth weight. We then try
   to assess whether this intergenerational transmission of low birth
   weight is indeed genetic by using grandparent-fixed effects models to
   factor out, to a great extent, family socioeconomic circumstances. We
   find that even within this framework, both father's and mother's birth
   weight status have an important impact on filial outcomes. However, the
   degree of inheritance is weaker for African Americans than for other
   races. Finally, we theorize that the importance of paternal birth weight
   status implies a genetic association that does not work through the
   uterine environment but rather through the fetus itself.

AB The values of stakeholders and other publics represent important
   information for an integrative approach to wildlife planning. However,
   because fundamental values held by the public tend to be similar
   integrating them into wildlife planning is problematic. This study
   describes how information about public values can benefit wildlife
   planning by the identification of specific value-based cognitions that
   relate more directly to wildlife than do fundamental values and differ
   among sectors of the population. Using information from a statewide
   telephone survey, we identified 4 distinct groups in Colorado based on
   their wildlife value orientations. These groups differed in their
   participation in wildlife-related activities, sociodemographics, and
   political involvement-ideology. Knowledge about wildlife value
   orientations can help managers 1) understand the diversity of value
   orientations that exist, 2) gauge support for or opposition to
   management policies, 3) estimate demand for wildlife-related activities,
   and 4) reach sectors of the population with information about wildlife
   policy and recreation opportunities. Ultimately, this information can
   help wildlife agencies identify, select, and evaluate policy
   alternatives designed to help them achieve their desired wildlife
   management goals.

AB Objectives: This study assessed the relationship between external risks,
   such as personal and neighborhood danger, and smoking by using a new
   theoretical framework based on competing mortality risk models. Methods:
   Regression analyses of self-reported data from residents of Central
   Harlem, New York, surveyed from 1992 through 1994 (n = 695, response
   rate=72%) were used to assess the relationship between smoking and 2
   measures of external health threats: levels of neighborhood danger and
   lifetime trauma. Results: Support for the framework was mixed. At the
   95% confidence level, exposure to lifetime trauma was positively related
   to current smoking status but was not related to the number of
   cigarettes smoked, conditional on being a smoker. Living in a "somewhat
   unsafe neighborhood" was also statistically significantly related to
   current smoking status. Conclusions: Although the framework implies that
   policies directed at improving the physical and social environment might
   improve health through their indirect effects on behaviors, little
   supporting evidence was found. Smoking rates may decrease if exposure to
   violence and neighborhood danger is reduced. This framework needs to be
   tested on larger and more information-rich data sets.

AB Background: Ecological studies reveal that alcohol-related outcomes tend
   to occur in high alcohol outlet density neighborhoods. The ecological
   design of these studies limits the interpretation of the findings in
   terms of the level of the effect. The effect of alcohol outlet density
   could be related to greater individual access to alcohol, an individual
   level effect, or to the grouping of drinkers by neighborhood, a
   structural effect at the neighborhood level.
   Methods: To differentiate between individual and neighborhood level
   possibilities, we conducted a multilevel study. Individual distance to
   the closest alcohol outlet was the individual level measure of the
   effect of alcohol outlet density, whereas the mean distance to the
   closest alcohol outlet for all individuals within a census tract was the
   neighborhood level measure for the effect of alcohol outlet density. We
   analyzed telephone surveys of 2604 telephone households within 24 census
   tracts stratified by poverty status and alcohol outlet density.
   Individual distance to alcohol outlets, age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
   level of education were entered as individual level covariates, and
   their corresponding aggregated means were entered as census tract level
   covariates (i.e., mean distance to outlets, mean age, percentage male,
   percentage Black. mean education).
   Results: Analysis of variance revealed that 16.2% of the variance in
   drinking norms and 11.5% of the variance in alcohol consumption were
   accounted for at the census tract level. In multivariate hierarchical
   analysis, individual distance to the closest alcohol outlet was
   unrelated with drinking norms and alcohol consumption, whereas mean
   distance to the closest alcohol outlet demonstrated a negative relation
   with drinking norms (beta(e) = -5.50 +/- 2.37) and with alcohol
   consumption (beta(e) = -0.477 +/- 0.195); that is, the higher the mean
   distance to the closest alcohol outlet, the lower the mean drinking
   norms score and mean level of alcohol consumption.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that the effect of alcohol outlet
   density on alcohol-related outcomes functions through an effect at the
   neighborhood level rather than at the individual level. Problem drinkers
   tend to be grouped in neighborhoods, an effect predicted by alcohol
   outlet density.

   Methods. We conducted a matched case-control study, stratified by sex,
   of 200 newly homeless men and women and 200 indigent men and women with
   no history of homelessness. Newly homeless case subjects were recruited
   from shelter assessment centers in New York City. Never-homeless control
   subjects. selected from public assistance centers, were single adults
   applying for home relief. Control subjects were matched with case
   subjects according to ethnicity age, and sex. Trained interviewers
   employed standardized research instruments to probe 3 domains of risk
   factors: symptom severity and substance use disorder, family support and
   functioning and prior use of services.
   Results. Significant interaction effects by sex were present for symptom
   severity, heroin use disorder, and prior service use. Greater numbers of
   the homeless of both sexes lacked a high school diploma and had less
   income from all sources, including from their families, than of the
   never homeless.
   Conclusions. Newly homeless men and women with no history of psychotic
   illness differed from their never-homeless counterparts in the 3 domains
   investigated but socioeconomic factors were also important.

   subjects, recent use of hormonal contraception was a predictor of
   retention. Menstrual changes and weight concerns were common reasons for
   removal. The Norplant 1-year continuation rate is lower than previously

   devastated by a hurricane to show how it is addressing the free-riding
   problem and protecting its public goods, thereby contributing to hazard
   mitigation. It examines hazard mitigation and the free-riding problem
   within the public goods framework. Free-riding is a term used in the
   public choice theory and common pool resource literature. It is a term
   used for describing the actions of rational individuals who freely
   exploit a collective or public good at the expense of others.
   Free-riding is a major problem faced by public goods. The problem very
   frequently occurs in the context of hazard mitigation and coastal

AB Human adaptability, as a field of inquiry within human biology, became
   defined during the research activities of the International Biological
   Program (IBP) (1964-1974). During this period, research was focused on
   ecological, physiological, and genetic studies of human populations
   within the theoretical frameworks of adaptation and evolution. Other
   defining characteristics of the IBP human adaptability research were
   standardization of methods, multidisciplinary projects, international
   cooperation, and a concern with human health issues. Some observers
   suggest that this research contributed to the ongoing transformation of
   physical anthropology and related fields from a largely descriptive to
   an analytical science. During the 25 years between the end of the IBP
   and the present, a number of research trends have continued: Several new
   multidisciplinary projects were initiated and completed; a subfield of
   demography within human biology has matured; nutrition, infant and child
   growth, and health studies have proliferated; and molecular generics and
   DNA analysis have superseded the earlier population genetics.
   International programs today are geared toward more practical and
   applied studies with less emphasis on basic science. Continuation of
   human adapt ability research into the 21st century is likely to make
   contributions in 3 broad areas: population, environment, and health.
   Productive research is likely to contribute to these 3 areas in the
   following categories: reproduction, psychosocial stress, life span
   approaches to health, effects of losses in biodiversity on health, a
   human biology of poverty, emerging infectious diseases, epidemiology of
   modernization, evolutionary medicine, and aging. The success of much of
   this research in its contribution to knowledge will come from the
   integrated perspectives of a biobehavioral framework of inquiry.

AB Human behavioral genetics has contributed greatly to our understanding
   of human behavioral development. Twin, family, and adoption studies have
   shown that genetic effects are ubiquitous and that both genes and
   environments contribute to individual differences in behavior. The
   unique ability of behavioral genetic methods to separate genetic from
   environmental effects has also led to important discoveries about how
   the environment works in development and to the elucidation of the
   complex ways environments and genes interact across the life span.
   Although quantitative methods have been the mainstay of the field of
   human behavioral genetics since Galton's time, the Human Genome Project
   and advances in molecular genetics are providing new tools and promise
   as we enter the 21st century. Thus the future of human behavioral
   genetics lies in the cross-disciplinary exchanges and collaborations
   that will increasingly occur in the years to come among quantitative and
   molecular scientists who work with both animal and human systems. This

   research may someday culminate in an understanding of the biological
   basis of behavior that spans from how the brain develops and functions
   to a grasp of how genes influence thought at the molecular level.

   numerous kin and friends, have been officially defined as handicapped,
   disabled, or mentally retarded. As a point of departure for examining
   family members' perspectives, this article briefly reviews the
   literature on disability and stigma. In contrast to current theories,
   the family in this study has constructed a life world ill which
   disability is not stigmatizing or problematic for their identities. This
   article examines, in depth, how family members and their broader social
   network construct the meaning of disability labels in nonstigmatizing
   ways and define themselves and each other in terms of their personal
   characteristics and family relationships. The conclusion of this article
   considers some factors that seem to account for the family's ability to
   avoid the stigma and stained identities associated with mental

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the social, cultural and religious factors
   underlying postpartum depression within a cultural cross-section of
   Jewish Jerusalem women.
   STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, repeated-measures study of 327 women. The
   Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) was administered
   immediately postpartum and 6-10 weeks later. Detailed sociodemographic
   information included perceptions of the pregnancy, community supports
   and religious affiliation. Odds ratios, 95% confidence interval and P
   values were calculated for all covariates. Multiple logistic regression
   was performed to estimate the degree of independent association between
   religiosity and postpartum depression.
   RESULTS: Postpartum depressive symptoms significantly associated with
   secular affiliation (odds ratio [OX] 2.9 [1.3-6.3] and tended toward an
   inverse association with orthodox affiliation (OX 0.6 [0.3-1.3]). Across
   secular, traditional, religious and orthodox groups, there was a
   decreasing trend in EPDS mean scores. Other predictors of depressive
   symptoms were psychiatric history, immigrant status and poor support
   With newborn care.
   CONCLUSION: Our study sample was particularly suitable for the
   assessment of cultural and religious elements of postpartum depression.
   We found religiosity, with its associated social and community
   structuring and well-defined social roles, to be significantly
   associated with self-reported postpartum depressive symptoms. These
   findings suggest that cultural factors, including role definitions,
   community support and rituals, may explain discrepancies found in the
   incidence of postpartum depression.

AB Background. Behavior is influenced by individual-level attributes as
   well as by the conditions under which people Live. Altering policies,
   practices, and the conditions of life can directly and indirectly
   influence individual behavior. This paper builds on existing ecological
   theories of health behavior by specifying structural mechanisms by which
   population-level factors effect change in individual health behaviors.
   Methods. This paper moves ecological theory from model building to a
   pragmatic characterization of structural interventions. We examined
   social and environmental factors beyond individual control and
   mechanisms as to how they influence behavior.
   Results. Four categories of structural factors are identified: (1)
   availability of protective or harmful consumer products, (2) physical
   structures (or physical characteristics of products), (3) social
   structures and policies, and (4) media and cultural messages. The first
   three can directly influence individuals through facilitating or
   constraining behavior. The fourth, media, operates by:changing
   individual-level attitudes, beliefs, and cognitions, as well as group
   norms.
   Conclusion. Interventions that target the four identified structural
   factors are a means to provide conditions that not only reduce high-risk
   behavior but also prevent the adoption of high-risk behaviors.
   Structural interventions are important and underutilized approaches for
   improving our nation's health. 2000 American Health Foundation and

   broad class of such measures, some of which have previously been
   proposed in other forms. This article focuses on two statistics, termed
   l(2) and l, which are [0 - 1] normed measures of concentration or
   dispersion, and illustrates their use for two purposes: measuring
   inequality and cultural consensus. The bias, variance, and use of these

AB 'The Clothes Have No Emperor' (a title borrowed from Paul Slansky's
   hilarious critique of the Reagan years in the USA) means to say that
   Bourdieu's criticism of American imperialism is an understandable slip
   of his brilliant visual sociology. He writes to those of a disposition
   to agree completely because they know the facts all the better. Bourdieu
   may well he the only person alive today who has so perfectly combined
   theoretical, empirical and political work. Why then has he allowed this
   critique to be published for all the world to see? Not. I think, because
   he is wrong, but because the entailments of his own visual sociology do
   not translate well from place to place. Bourdieu has taught us that the
   sociology of social space is the next necessary step for those who would
   become public intellectuals. The question is how to think and speak of
   the world as such. Bourdieu has given us the outlines of a beginning,
   but this little essay in question shows that there is more work yet to
   be done.

   Method: A search of the research literature was conducted.
   Results: Seventeen population-based studies were reported in the United

   incidence rates for immigrants whose position in society is
   disadvantaged, than majority-group native-born, with a range of relative
   incidence from 1.7 to 13.2. It is proposed that the developmental task
   for formulating the life plan challenges the young adult's executive
   function abilities, which may be weaker in individuals vulnerable to
   schizophrenia. Formulating the life plan may be made more difficult by
   the position in society of disadvantaged ethnic minorities, raising the
   risk for schizophrenia.

   developmental challenge of formulating the life plan, might provide
   insights into the etiology of schizophrenia, as well as suggest avenues

AB Short birth intervals are associated with increased mortality in

   and early childhood mortality for rural Mennonites from one congregation
   in two settings: Russia, 1825-1874, and Kansas, 1875-1924, in light of
   two causal mechanisms: maternal depletion and sibling competition. Vital
   events of families reconstructed from church records comprised a total
   of 930 and 1,484 births in Russia and Kansas, respectively, by 381
   mothers. Bivariate analyses indicate that mortality is higher in Russia
   relative to Kansas for births with the shortest previous intervals for
   all three age categories, and for neonates born before the shortest
   subsequent intervals. Cox regression analyses indicated that only a few
   factors played a statistically significant role. Mortality risk was
   increased in Russia by having mothers >35 years and shorter subsequent
   intervals for the neonates, shorter subsequent intervals for the
   postneonates, and having mothers >35 years, and shorter previous and
   subsequent intervals for early childhood. In Kansas, mortality risk was
   increased by shorter subsequent intervals and being a member of a
   multiple birth for neonates, shorter previous and subsequent intervals
   and being a member of a multiple birth for postneonates, and being a
   member of a multiple birth, when the preceding child dies, and a shorter
   subsequent interval for early childhood. The increased risk in Russia
   associated with being born to an older mother and the increased risk in
   the total sample for the older age categories with the shortest previous
   intervals provide moderate support for the maternal depletion
   hypothesis. That longer subsequent intervals increase survivorship in
   all settings for all age categories provides limited support for the
   sibling competition hypothesis.

   charts. Simulation was performed to obtain data with distribution
   characteristics similar to those of The Third National Health and
   Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES III) (1988-1991) data. NHANES III
   consists of a two-phase, 6-year, complex stratified multistage
   probability cluster, cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988 through
   1994 to represent the US noninstitutionalized population. Phase I of the
   survey consisted of 679 boys and 622 girls in age groups 3, 8, 13, and
   18 years. Weight and stature, the body mass index (BMI)
   (weight/stature(2); kg/m(2)) was calculated. The results show that 1)
   the precision of the percentile estimates is greater for stature than
   for weight and BMI, 2) percentiles during the pubertal period are less
   precise than those during the prepubertal and postpubertal periods for
   weight and BMI but there is little difference for stature, and 3)
   percentile estimates are more precise for girls than boys for weight and
   BMI, but not for stature. The present findings suggest that pooling of

   1) Taiwanese students who experienced a relatively stable, affluent
   growth environment from an early age, as judged from parental education
   and stability of residence type, will have a pattern of correlations for
   the timing and intensity of the growth spurt similar to those of
   European and American females; and 2) those students whose parents
   gained the wherewithal to move from single-story to multi-story
   dwellings while they were in primary school will have the most atypical
   patterns. The extent to which these and other sociodemographic factors
   influence pubertal spurt velocities and increments of adolescent growth
   were explored as well using multiple regression analyses. Results
   support the view that rapid socioeconomic change in Taiwan influenced
   the relationship between the timing and intensity of adolescent growth
   in stature. Children in the more stable environments in both urban areas
   had patterns of correlations typical of population samples from
   developed countries. The most atypical correlations in both areas were
   found among those who likely experienced the greatest improvement in
   socioeconomic status during primary school. These represent positive
   values previously unreported in the literature. Differences in amounts
   of growth, though in accord with these patterns, were quite small. (C)

AB Race has always been a significant sociological theme, from the founding
   of the held and the formulation of classical theoretical statements to
   the present. Since the nineteenth century, sociological perspectives on
   race have developed and changed, always reflecting shifts in large-scale
   political processes. In the classical period, colonialism and
   biologistic racism held sway. As the twentieth century dawned, sociology
   came to be dominated by US-based figures. DuBois and the Chicago School
   presented the first notable challenges to the field's racist
   assumptions. In the aftermath of World War II, with the destruction of
   European colonialism, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the
   surge in migration on a world scale, the sociology of race became a
   central topic. The field moved toward a more critical, more egalitarian
   awareness of race, focused particularly on the overcoming of prejudice
   and discrimination. Although the recognition of these problems increased
   and political reforms made some headway in combatting them, racial
   injustice and inequality were not surmounted. As the global and domestic
   politics of race entered a new period of crisis and uncertainty, so too
   has the field of sociology. To tackle the themes of race and racism once
   again in the new millennium, sociology must develop more effective
   racial theory. Racial formation approaches can offer a starting point
   here. The key tasks will be the formulation of a more adequate
   comparative historical sociology of race, the development of a deeper
   understanding of the micro-macro linkages that shape racial issues, and
   the recognition of the pervasiveness of racial politics in contemporary
   society. This is a challenging but also exciting agenda. The held must
   not shrink from addressing it.

AB The variant of new institutionalism that is our focus is a
   pan-disciplinary theory that asserts that actors pursue their interests
   by making choices within institutional constraints. We organize our
   review of the theory around its behavioral assumptions, the operation of
   institutional forms, and processes of institutional change. At each
   stage, we give particular attention to the potential contributions of
   sociology to the theory. The behavioral assumptions of the theory amount
   to bounded rationality and imply transaction costs, which, in the
   absence of institutions, may frustrate collective ends. The principle
   weakness of these behavioral assumptions is a failure to treat
   preferences as endogenous. We categorize the institutions that arise in
   response to transaction costs as to whether they are public or private
   in their source and centralized or decentralized in their making. In
   detailing the resulting categories of institutional forms, we identify
   key interdependencies across the public/private and
   centralized/decentralized dimensions. The new institutionalism is in
   particular need of better theory about private decentralized
   institutions, and theorists could turn to embeddedness theory and
   cognitive new-institutional theory as a source of help on this topic.
   The dominant view of institutional change is that it is evolutionary,
   driven by organizational competition, and framed by individual beliefs
   and shared understandings. Sociology can refine the change theory by
   adding better explanations of the behavior of organizations, and of the
   processes by which institutional alternatives come to be viewed as
   acceptable or unacceptable.

AB We report the initial findings of a research programme on the fertility
   and reproductive health of both men and women in rural Gambia. The
   reproductive experiences of men and women in the population studied were
   very different. During the period 1993-97, the total fertility rates
   were 12.0 for men and 6.8 for women. For men fertility began later,
   reached higher levels and continued into older ages than for women.
   Through serial and polygynous marriages, men were able to extend their
   reproduction beyond what would be possible with one woman. Of the
   married men interviewed, 40% were married polygynously. Men's fertility
   preferences indicated that they recognized their reproductive potentials
   to be greater than those of their individual wives. On average, married
   men desired 15.2 children for themselves and 7.3 for each wife. In this
   polygynous population the means available for attaining reproductive
   goals were different for the two sexes, depending on the separate lives
   and different interests of men and women.

SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
SI 2
BP 91
EP 100
PD 2000
PY 2000
AB Peoples and communities, especially indigenous communities, are forced
   to deal with an increasingly complex set of environmental, social,
   cultural, and economic problems related to pollution. It is important to
   use evaluation tools that reflect the values and perspectives of the
   affected peoples, and which can evaluate risks and impacts to the
   natural resource base upon which we all depend. Evaluation tools, such
   as risk assessment, are being applied to spatio-temporal systems and
   lifestyles for which they were not designed, so new integrating tools
   are needed to bridge the gap between narrow sets of endpoints and
   western perspectives, on the one hand, and a much broader set of
   endpoints and more holistic indigenous perspectives on the other hand.
   The perspectives and even the necessity to account for traditional
   Native American lifestyles have gone unnoticed in classical
   environmental planning and risk assessment methods. If tribal rights and
   resources are affected, one way to ensure that those tools reflect the
   appropriate values is to redesign the risk tools using traditional
   environmental management principles. For example, Native American
   communities are inseparable from their lands and resources, so
   evaluation of their risks from contamination must integrate human
   physiological and mental health, ecological health, socio-economic
   health, and cultural and spiritual health within a single framework.
   This does not mean simply adding a quality-of-life component and calling
   it cultural risk, or using an exposure scenario that reflects additional
   routes of exposures. Rather, it means beginning the assessment by
   understanding the entire eco-cultural system (people and biota
   interlocked in a co-adapted system of behaviors and ecologies that is
   sustainable over time but which is now severely strained even without
   the addition of contamination). This paper provides some suggestions for
   improving risk assessment through the use of dependency webs that are
   drawn to represent the entire eco-cultural system that is at risk, and
   therefore that identify more consequences of environmental
   contamination. Dependency webs help identify the resources, uses,
   functions, and services associated with a resource or area that is at
   risk from contamination. They also help to structure the analysis so
   that all the elements important to the affected community are included
   in the risk assessment and not deferred to the risk management phase or
   omitted altogether. Finally, the ethics of risk assessments (their use
   and misuse) will be improved as information becomes more complete and
   transparent.

AB Family research in sociology has concentrated on the national-level

   This effort is further stimulated by neglect in the sociology of
   national development literature, where the plausible impact of the
   family on economic development has been ignored. The modified
   world-system perspective that we present links the institution of the
   family to modernization and the developmental profile of nations. We use

AB This study uses data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS)
   of 1993 to examine factors determining the use of maternal-child health
   (MCH) services in rural Ghana. The MCH services under study are: (1) use
   of a doctor for prenatal care; (2) soliciting four or more antenatal
   check-ups; (3) place of delivery; (4) participation in family planning.
   Bivariate and multivariate techniques are employed in the analyses. The

   by level of education, religious background and region of residence, and
   partially by ethnicity and occupation. The implications of these results

AB Data from three separate studies conducted in Maputo, Mozambique, in
   1993 are used to analyse the relationship between the type of social
   environment in which women work and their fertility and contraceptive
   use. The analysis finds that women who work in more collectivized
   environments have fewer children and are more likely to use modern
   contraception than women who work in more individualized milieus and
   those who do not work outside the home. Most of these differences
   persist in multivariate tests. It is argued that collectivized work
   environments are most conducive to diffusion and legitimation of
   reproductive innovations. In contrast, individualized environments tend
   to isolate women and therefore may retard their acceptance of innovative

PD JAN-FEB 2000
PY 2000
AB Christopher Boehm proposes that morality began when a society of
   hunter-gatherers punished a member for violating its rules. He claims
   social control of this kind is universal, and that apes have related
   tendencies. Emile Durkheim had a similar conception of social control in
   the simplest and earliest societies. But both are wrong:
   Hunter-gatherers rarely, if ever, handle conflict in a law-like and
   penal fashion, and the society as a whole rarely if ever is the agent of
   social control. Individuals typically handle their own conflicts, and
   avoidance is more common than punishment. Pure sociology predicts and
   explains the handling of conflict with its location and direction in
   social space - its social structure. The nature of morality depends, for
   example, on the social distance and degree of inequality between the
   parties, whether humans or nonhumans. Morality varies from case to case.
   It is relative rather than universal. Boehm therefore describes the
   origin of something that has never existed. All that is universal are
   the principles of structural relativity.

   Asian-American students were less Likely to use alcohol and cigarettes,
   and had a more abstinence-promoting environment than European-American
   adolescents. This difference in Asian-American adolescents appeared to
   be the result of less adult and peer influence to use alcohol or
   cigarettes, less offers of alcohol, and an increased likelihood of
   having an intact family when compared to European-American adolescents.
   Additionally, Asian-American adolescents reported having fewer friends

AB Objective. To identify the health needs of adolescent males incarcerated
   in a juvenile justice facility and to compare their health profiles with
   those of male adolescents in the community.
   Methods. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted of incarcerated (N =
   202) and school (N = 379) samples of male youths. Questionnaires were
   self-administered and completed before admission health screens
   (incarcerated youth) or in classrooms (school sample). Health status was
   assessed by the Child Health and Illness Profile, Adolescent Edition,
   using scale and item means and by categorizing each youth's pattern of
   health into 1 of 13 mutually exclusive health profile types.
   Results. Compared with school counterparts, incarcerated male youths had
   significantly worse health status as demonstrated by poorer health and
   functioning scores in perceived well being, self-esteem, physical
   discomfort, acute, chronic, and psychosocial disorders, family
   involvement, physical activity, interpersonal problem-solving, risk
   behaviors, and academic performance. Three profile types-High Risks,
   High Risks/Low Resilience, and Worst Health-accounted for patterns of
   health for 69.8% of incarcerated youth versus 37.3% of an age-matched
   school sample. Just 6.4% of incarcerated males were in the
   Excellent/Good Health profile types, which contrasted with 34.2% of the
   age-matched school sample.
   Conclusions. The health profiles of incarcerated male youths were worse
   than those of male youths in school. Our results indicate that
   rehabilitation programs will need to address incarcerated youth's basic
   health needs as well as modifying their risk and antisocial behaviors.

AB In many areas across Siberia, the reindeer herding economy of the native
   people went into a deep recession during the post-Soviet transition of
   the 1990s. However, as a larger cross-section of data indicates, the
   reindeer stock decline is not a universal phenomenon. Nor is the
   present-day crisis in native Siberian herding economies an unprecedented
   event, as pastoralists did suffer tremendously in "traditional times",
   due to the devastating epizootics and other natural disasters, and even
   more so, during the Soviet-induced collectivization. While such a
   historical review by no means diminishes the scale of the present-day
   crisis in native herding economies, it helps to identify both the
   experience and traditional adaptations once used by the native Siberians
   during the previous times of hardship. Of those, the most efficient
   were: maintaining cultural and ecological diversity in local herding
   systems; the ability to shift quickly between nomadic and sedentary
   subsistence patterns; and preservation of the indigenous herding
   tradition and the "core" nomadic population as the invaluable source of
   cultural knowledge, technological expertise, and of domestic reindeer
   stock for ultimate recovery. The modern situation in Siberia, in fact,
   favours increased local diversity and helps to produce a steady stream
   of new "winners" as well as new "losers." This new experience has to be
   comprehensively documented, to produce both a reliable general overview
   and a detailed summary of the specific regional and local transitions.

AB Culture is widely thought to influence the form, content, and extent of
   symptoms experienced and expressed by the mentally ill. However, little
   is known about how specific cultural groups differ in their symptomatic
   presentation of mental illness. Using data derived from the Present
   State Exam, the current study compared 63 Angle-American and 53
   Mexican-American patients with schizophrenia on ten psychiatric
   symptoms. A series of logistic regressions offered several interesting
   findings. For instance, as hypothesized, Mexican-American patients were
   more likely to report physical symptoms than their Angle-American
   counterparts. Also in line with expectations, Anglo-American patients
   reported experiencing a greater frequency of several psychiatric
   symptoms such as persecutory delusions, nervous tension, and blunted
   affect. Results from this study suggest that the presentation of even a
   very biologically determined disorder such as schizophrenia can be
   shaped by sociocultural factors. Specific aspects of Angle-American and
   Latino cultures that may influence symptom patterns in patients
   suffering from schizophrenia are discussed.

AB Eventfulness as a strategy for creating a meaningful life is an
   important component of the attempts of people with schizophrenia to
   present a positive self-image. This study of patients with schizophrenia
   shows that the phenomenon of creating eventfulness through normalcy
   accounts is relevant cross-culturally, with common themes occurring in
   the speech of participants from Papua New Guinea and New Zealand, Both
   patient (n = 23) and nonpatient (n = 27) participants from these two
   countries were interviewed as part of a larger research project.
   Conversational speech of participants was analyzed for passages that
   could be defined as normalcy accounts. A total of 61 such accounts were
   obtained from the conversational samples, The three most common themes
   of normalcy accounts (educational achievement and goals, national pride,
   and travel) were characteristic of the self-presentation of nonpatient
   subjects as well as patients with schizophrenia. Normalcy themes varied
   slightly depending on nationality and patient or nonpatient status. The
   similarity of both normalcy account themes and presentation, however,
   was remarkably consistent across cultures.

AB This article examines the long-standing and provocative finding of a
   differential advantage in coarse and outcome for persons with
   schizophrenia living in "developing" countries, using results from the
   newly completed World Health Organization (WHO) collaborative project,
   the International Study of Schizophrenia (ISoS). The article addresses
   two questions: Has the differential survived the 13 years since it was
   last reported? If so, are the results demonstrably not attributable to
   artifactual confounding? The analysis focuses on the 809 subjects who
   make up the combined incidence cohort of ISoS. These include members of
   the original treated incidence cohorts of two earlier WHO studies (the
   Determinants of Outcome of Severe Mental Disorders and the Reduction of
   Disability Studies) as well as subjects drawn from two additional
   samples (Hong Kong and Madras/Chennai). We first review the consistency
   of the finding of a "developed versus developing" differential in course
   and outcome and then examine a variety of course and outcome measures
   for the ISoS incidence cohorts. Evidence of differences in illness
   trajectory in favor of the developing centers was consistently found.
   Six potential sources of bias are then examined: differences in
   followup, arbitrary grouping of centers, diagnostic ambiguities,
   selective outcome measures, gender, and age. None of these potential
   confounds explains away the differential in course and outcome. We
   conclude with suggestions for further research, with particular
   attention to the need for close documentation of everyday practices in
   the local moral,worlds that "culture" refers to.

AB Modernity glorifies hyperconsumerism and hyperindividualism, and gives
   rise to a consciousness of human separation from and superiority to
   nature. To counter these threats to our biological and sociological
   ecosystems, higher education in general, and sociology in particular,
   must adopt postmodern strategies to educate for survival. The
   metanarratives that served the modern age, such as "science" and
   "progress," prove inadequate for the postmodern age of ecological
   crisis. We urgently need a more life-centered vision. The ecological
   perspective replants our feet on the bedrock of biological and
   sociological connectedness. Although science has been central to
   modernity's destructiveness, ecology is a subversive science which can
   serve us well as both science and story; it is the central
   transformative image of a new postmodern metanarrative.

   that has not been studied in these textbooks is the topic of disability,
   in this research, 25 introductory sociology textbooks, published between
   1996 and 1998, are investigated to determine the portrayal of
   disability. Using content analysis, the authors examine these books for
   textual representation of disability and pictorial depiction of
   individuals with disabilities. Results indicate that introductory
   sociology textbooks provide a limited amount of information about
   disability. From the written material, two major themes are identified:
   disability as a defining social characteristic and disability as a basis
   for minority group membership. in addition, textbook photographs present
   a selective depiction of individuals with disabilities. Suggestions for
   providing a more comprehensive portrayal of individuals with
   disabilities are discussed.

AB Sociology students at Santa Clara University are expected to learn to do
   four things in developmental stages: recognize basic concepts to
   cultivate sociological perspective, apply sociological concepts,
   interpretive frameworks, and analytical tools to real world problems
   (fostering greater commitment to life-long learning about one's
   community and the world at large), offer explanations extending one's
   own thinking, sensibly gather data to test those explanations (providing
   the tools for a culture of inquiry and evidence), and envision how
   sociology can be used for organizational effectiveness and improvement
   of community outcomes (empowering our students for lives of constructive
   involvement). A variety of assessment strategies are proving vital.
   Broad stakeholder input was used when clarifying program objectives.
   Deliberations about how to change our program are being stimulated by
   performance problems in internships and on major papers. We have learned
   that developmental goals are not readily achieved without changes
   throughout the program's curriculum, and implementation has been
   incremental, initial changes have increased the confidence of graduating
   seniors, and job placement has improved.

AB This research focuses on developing a methodology for selecting and
   aggregating socioeconomic data that will be useful in assessing the
   impacts of highway bypasses on towns in Oklahoma. Understanding the
   economic impacts of building highway bypasses around small towns is an
   important component of making economically rational, as well as socially
   equitable, decisions. Small cities and towns that rely on two-lane
   highways as the main artery for commerce and business can be
   particularly devastated by a bypass because much of the through traffic
   will likely divert to the newer, presumably faster bypass route.
   Currently, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) employs
   several methods when studying the feasibility of constructing highway
   bypasses, but has no established methodology for assessing the economic
   impacts of bypasses. Thus, the ODOT makes bypass decisions based chiefly
   on traffic and congestion, safety, and environmental issues. The
   research presented here outlines developing a comprehensive modeling
   framework that will allow the ODOT to assess quantitatively the
   potential economic impacts bypasses may cause. The end goal is a
   user-friendly computer interface that will allow ODOT personnel to
   estimate impacts of bypass proposals throughout the state of Oklahoma.

AB Objectives. Patient-provider misunderstandings arising from disparate
   medical and cultural concepts can impede health care among immigrant
   populations. This study assessed the extent of disagreement and
   identified the salient problems of communication between Israeli doctors
   and Ethiopian immigrant patients.
   Methods. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 59 Ethiopian
   immigrants. Self-reports of health status and effectivenesss of
   treatment were compared with evaluations by the primary care physician
   and supplemented by qualitative data from descriptions of illness,
   observations of medical visits, informant interviews, and participant
   observations conducted by the anthropologist.
   Results. Health status and effectiveness of treatment were rated
   significantly higher by the doctor than by the patients. Low
   doctor-patient agreement occurred mainly for illnesses with
   stress-related or culture-specific associations. Qualitative data
   suggested that more long-term immigrants may alter their expectations of
   treatment but continue to experience symptoms that are culturally, bur
   not biomedically, meaningful.
   Conclusions. Misunderstandings between immigrant patients and their
   doctors emerge from the biomedical system's limitations in addressing
   stress-related illnesses and from culture-based discrepancies in
   concepts of illness and healing. Including trained translators in
   medical teams can reduce medical misunderstandings and increase patient
   satisfaction among immigrant populations.

AB I extend the theoretical domain of sociology into an area of social
   psychology that heretofore has been the exclusive domain of
   psychologists. Specifically, I develop a social structural perspective
   on the choice shifts make within groups. During interpersonal
   discussions of issues, choice shifts occur when there is a difference
   between group members' mean final opinion and their mean initial
   opinion. Explanations of choice shifts have emphasized group-level
   conditions (e.g., a norm, a decision rule, a pool of persuasive
   arguments, a distribution of initial opinions). I argue that choice
   shifts are a ubiquitous product of the inequalities of interpersonal
   influence that emerge during discussions of issues. Hence, I bring
   choice shifts squarely into the domain of a structural social psychology
   that attends to the composition of networks of interpersonal influence
   and into broader sociological perspectives concerned with the formation
   of status structures.

   primary user groups in Montego Bay Marine Park, Jamaica: fishers,
   hoteliers and watersports operators. The primary means of data
   collection were document analysis, interviews with individuals
   representative of user groups, focus groups and participant observation.
   The results regarding user's awareness, user groups' relations with the
   managing agency, relations among and within user groups, resource use
   patterns, and sociocultural values demonstrate the need to: increase
   public awareness of the benefits of the Park, increase user awareness of
   Park management activities, increase user involvement in Park
   management, and develop intersectoral coordination. These findings
   provide useful guidance for future Park management and, in a more
   general context, illustrate the importance of socioeconomic assessments

AB Our objective was to examine the cost of long-term residential (LTR) and
   outpatient drug-free (ODF) treatments for cocaine-dependent patients
   participating in the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Studies (DATOS),
   calculate the tangible cost of crime to society, and determine treatment
   benefits. Subjects were 502 cocaine-dependent patients selected from a
   national and naturalistic nonexperimental evaluation of community-based
   treatment. Financial data were available for programs from 10 US cities
   where the subjects received treatment between 1991 and 1993. Treatment
   costs were estimated from the 1992 National Drug Abuse Treatment Unit
   Survey (NDATUS), and tangible costs of crime were estimated from reports
   of illegal acts committed before, during, and after treatment.
   Sensitivity analyses examined results for three methods of estimating
   the costs of crime and cost-benefit ratios. Results showed that
   cocaine-dependent patients treated in both LTR and ODF programs had
   reductions in costs of crime from before to after treatment. LTR
   patients had the highest levels and costs of crime before treatment, had
   the greatest amount of crime cost reductions in the year after
   treatment, and yielded the greatest net benefits. Cost-benefit ratios
   for both treatment modalities provided evidence of significant returns
   on treatment investments for cocaine addiction. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB A central debate in the sociology of religion concerns whether religious
   pluralism enhances or diminishes religious involvement. Contrary to
   Finke and Stark, much previous research using U.S. counties, both
   contemporary and historical, finds a negative relationship. However
   Finke, Guest, and Stark (1996) argue that counties are too large to
   measure the effects of religious pluralism most relevant to their
   theories and suggest that if smaller areas such as cities are used, the
   relationship is positive. Using data from the 1991 Canadian Census Lee
   show that the relationship between pluralism and religious affiliation
   is strongly and consistently negative both for census divisions
   (counties) and census subdivisions (cities, towns, and townships). We
   argue that religious pluralism may reduce social reinforcement for
   religious involvement by reducing the number of close social ties
   individuals have with others who share a common religious identity.

AB This study examines the hypothesis that treatment is a cumulative
   process; that is, treatment success is best viewed in terms of the
   patient's entire treatment history, rather than the index treatment
   episode. Three-hundred and eight patients with a primary heroin
   addiction were studied for 2 years posttreatment. Using posttreatment
   arrests as the dependent variable, the effects of prior treatment were
   assessed Those with six or more prior treatment episodes and who had
   been in treatment for 12 or more months during the most recent episode
   averaged only 0.2 arrests in the 2 years posttreatment, while those with
   no prior treatment, but 12 or more months in the recent treatment
   averaged 0.88 arrests. Logistic analysis found that each prior treatment
   reduced the probability of a posttreatment arrest by 25%. Based on a
   linear regression, patients with six or more treatments prior treatments
   averaged half the number of posttreatment arrests as someone with no
   treatments before the index episode. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the current patterns of head
   trauma associated with child abuse. We reviewed the records of all
   patients admitted to our medical center between 1995 and 1997 with a
   primary diagnosis of head trauma, and analyzed the clinical
   presentation, mechanism of injury, socioeconomic status and outcome for
   these patients. Head trauma was deliberately inflicted in 38/405
   children (9%). There were 25 boys and 13 girls, with a median age of 5.5
   months. Two thirds of the families lived in the inner city. Of the 99
   children under the age of 2 years admitted for head trauma, the injury
   was inflicted in 32 (32%), Acute subdural hematoma was present in 22/32
   (69%) of children with inflicted trauma, but in only 5/68 (7%) with
   accidental trauma. Retinal hemorrhages were present in 17/32 (53%)
   abused children, but in no cases of accidental trauma (0/68).
   Deliberately inflicted injury is a frequent cause of serious head trauma
   in young children. Head injury is a major cause of morbidity and
   mortality in the abused child. Child abuse cases correlated strongly
   with low socioeconomic status. Nonaccidental trauma must be considered
   strongly in children under 2 years of age who present with acute
   subdural hematoma in the absence of a history of a motor vehicle
   accident. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Using the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expressions of Emotion (JACFEE)
   photo set, the relationship between recognition and intensity ratings of
   universal facial expressions of emotions in 123 Japanese undergraduate
   students was examined and compared with data reported by American
   raters. In Japanese raters, although the intensity was rated as high for
   some of the poses, their correctness scores were poor, suggesting a
   serious misjudgment of the intended emotions as defined in the JACFEE
   photo set. Only in Japanese raters were significant relationships
   between the intensity scores and the percentage correctness scores for
   sadness detected (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001), but no significant relationship
   was observed for other emotions. The robust correlation suggests the
   possibility that Japanese raters might be more responsive to certain
   emotional expressions when they are fully or intensely expressed. It is
   proposed that the facial emotional expression paradigm cannot be applied
   to the psychiatric setting without first refining for cultural
   differences.

AB This essay proposes that sociology can learn from social theory
   developed in the humanities. In the face of recent challenges to
   sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and
   economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and
   communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the
   constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key
   weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the
   inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three
   significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out
   alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social
   signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the
   basis of a dialogue between cultural studies and sociology.

AB Catholic Charismatics often talk about "God," "Jesus," "the Holy
   Spirit," or simply "the Lord" as an active partner in interaction. Most
   sociologists regard such statements as outside the epistemological
   purview of an empirical discipline; God is relegated to the inaccessible
   domain of the "specifically religious." In this paper I suggest that
   "the Holy Spirit" is a manifestation of a learnable pattern of social
   interaction that may generate a superindividual dialogic unity, what
   Durkheim called a conscience collective, or what has more recently been
   called shared or distributed cognition. The internalization of this
   intersubjective process then becomes the basis for the intrasubjective
   experience of dialogue with the divine.

AB Officials in Fort Collins, Colorado, have encountered public
   disagreement over prairie dog (Cynomys spp.) management in the city but
   have lacked objective information about conflict with prairie dogs, as
   well as the knowledge levels and attitudes of the public. Using a survey
   of Fort Collins residents (n=87) living near prairie dog colonies and a
   random sample (n=559) of the city's general population, we assessed
   conflict with prairie dogs, compared attitudes toward prairie dogs and
   management preferences between residents near colonies and the general
   population, and tested for association between knowledge levels and
   attitudes toward prairie dogs and management preferences. Seventy
   percent of the respondents living adjacent to prairie dogs reported
   having problems with them; respondents with natural grassland or pasture
   land on their property were most likely to report problems. Compared to
   the general population, respondents living near colonies were more
   likely to express negative attitudes toward prairie dogs (P<0.01), more
   likely to prefer poisoning prairie dogs over capturing and relocating
   (P<0.01), and more knowledgeable about prairie dogs (P<0.001). A
   management approach combining preservation and control was advocated by
   84% of respondents living near prairie dogs and 68% of the general
   population. Among the general population, respondents with greater
   knowledge about prairie dogs were more likely to agree (P<0.05) that the
   rodents keep hawks and eagles nearby and that destroying prairie dogs
   lowers the risk of disease for pets and the risk of injury to horses.
   Respondents with greater knowledge also were more like ly to agree with
   using poisons to remove prairie dogs from an area (P<0.001) and less
   likely to agree with using capture and relocation (P<0.001). However,
   knowledge was not associated (P>0.05) with attitudes toward prairie dogs
   or with acceptance of a management approach combining preservation and
   control.

   employment programs, and finally, individual psychotherapy. The topics
   have been chosen in descending order of available critical supportive
   studies. Recommendations for specific psychosocial interventions
   (including target populations) are discussed. Overall psychosocial
   treatments have been shown to reduce schizophrenic relapses but have not
   convincingly generalized to improving other facets of the illness.

   tested this proposition using a sample of public high school students (n

   substance-abusing adolescents reported engaging in significantly more

   Asian drug users in San Francisco, CA. A sample of 92 Asian drug users
   (35 Chinese, 31 Filipino, 26 Vietnamese) who were not currently enrolled
   in drug treatment programs were recruited through targeted sampling
   methods and interviewed using a questionnaire with openended questions.
   The study evaluated responses of the participants and used content
   analyses. This study clearly revealed that the patterns of drug use
   among Asian drug users are unique to their ethnicity, gender, immigrant
   status, and age groups. Also, Asian drug users share cultural constructs
   related to drug use such as fear of addiction and injecting drugs, and
   stigma attached to drug users in the community. Therefore, drug abuse
   prevention programs should address both common factors among Asian drug
   users, as well as unique factors in specific target groups (e.g., ethnic
   groups, Asian immigrants, Asian women, refugees, and adolescents). (C)

AB A questionnaire survey of 285 consecutively recruited adolescents who
   were adjudicated to juvenile correctional facilities in Virginia was
   conducted using the Inhalant Use Questionnaire (1). White youths (36.1%)
   and youths from other ethnic backgrounds (44.4%) are significantly more
   likely to report past inhalant use than black youths (1.4%). The median
   age reported for first-time use of inhalants is 13 years. Youths were
   divided between those who experimented with inhalants (27%) and those
   who were heavy users (27%). Huffing was preferred by 60% of youths. Of
   the youths, 52% reported using inhalants with friends present, whereas
   34% used inhalants when they were alone. Sites where youths reported
   inhalant use include at a friend's home (68%), at home (54%): On the
   street (40%), at parties (28%): on school grounds (26%), and at school
   (18%). There are no gender differences in age of onset of inhalant use,
   lifetime frequency of inhalant use, frequency of inhalant use in the
   past year, or preferred method of using inhalants. The five substances
   most frequently used as inhalants include gasoline (by 57.4%), Freon
   (40.45%), butane lighter fluid (38.3%), glue (29.8%), and nitrous oxide
   (23.4%). There were no gender differences for use of other products.

AB The few comparative emergency room (ER) studies reported have found
   alcohol's role in injury occurrence to vary and suggest that regional
   and cultural differences in drinking patterns may account, in part, for
   this variation. To further this research, a probability sample of 1708
   ER patients was interviewed regarding the role of alcohol In the event,
   usual drinking patterns, and alcohol-related problems and a urine sample
   was obtained to estimate blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The sample
   was from ERs in two Canadian provinces with distinctly different
   cultures: primarily English-speaking Alberta and French-speaking Quebec.
   While differences in demographic and drinking characteristics between
   injured and noninjured in both the Alberta and Quebec ERs were similar
   to those in other ER studies, the injured in the Alberta ER were more
   likely to be positive for estimated BAC; to have higher BAC levels; to
   report drinking prior to the event; and, among those reporting drinking,
   to have consumed a larger number of drinks and to report feeling drunk
   at the time of injury compared to those in Quebec. These differences may
   be associated with cultural differences in typical drinking patterns.
   with higher rates of abstinence reported in the Alberta ER, but also
   with higher rates of heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems, while
   those in the Quebec ER were more likely to report consuming smaller
   quantities with greater frequency (typical of wine-drinking cultures).
   Additional research is needed to explicate further alcohol's role in
   injury occurrence for planning effective prevention strategies that are
   both culturally relevant and specific.

   medication use and its relationship to severe psychiatric disorders
   among school-aged children in foster care.
   Methods. Home interviews with 302 foster parents and children aged 6 to
   12 years and 266 follow-up clinical evaluations were conducted.
   Results. Thirteen percent of the children had taken psychotropic
   medication in the previous year, and 52% of those whose clinical status
   merited a medication evaluation had not received medication in the
   previous year.
   Conclusions. As the efficacy of psychotropic medication treatment for
   severe child psychiatric disorders becomes more established research on
   the appropriateness of such care can begin.

AB Recent debates on comparative historical method have focused on three
   issues: (1) narrative and conjuncture, (2) the logic of comparison, and
   (3) the limits of theoretical generalization. The present article
   attempts to resolve some of the issues raised in these debates by
   developing a distinction between universal and historically conditional
   theory through a contrast between work by such leaders of the revived
   comparative historical tradition as Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, and
   Immanuel Wallerstein and selected works by second-generation comparative
   historical sociologists. The conditional theories of the second
   generation incorporate narrative and conjunctural temporality,
   theory-driven comparison, and historically conditional generalization
   that were not emphasized in the universalizing theories and comparisons
   of the first generation.

   487 people attending the Boise River Festival in Boise, Idaho, USA,
   about the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
   (INEEL), owned by the US Department of Energy (DOE). We were
   particularly interested in the perceptions of urban dwellers living at
   some distance from the facility, since attitudes and perceptions are
   usually examined for people living near such facilities. More than 50%
   of the people were most worried about contamination and about waste
   storage and transport, another 23% were concerned about human health and
   accidents and spills, and the rest listed other concerns such as jobs
   and the economy or education. When given a list of possible concerns,
   accidents and spills, storage of current nuclear materials, and storage
   of additional nuclear materials were rated the highest. Thus both
   open-ended and structured questions identified nuclear storage and
   accidents and spills as the most important concerns, even for people
   living far from a DOE site. The highest rated future land uses were:
   National Environmental Research Park, recreation (including hiking,
   camping, fishing and hunting), and returning the land to the
   Shoshone-Bannock tribes; the lowest rated future land uses were homes
   and increased nuclear waste storage. These relative rankings are similar
   to those obtained for other Idahoans living closer to the site and for
   people living near the Savannah River Site, another DOE facility in
   South Carolina. The concern expressed about accidents and spills and
   waste storage translated into a desire not to see additional waste
   brought to INEEL and a low rating for using INEEL for building homes.

AB Previous work has demonstrated that children's organization and
   activation of alcohol expectancies in memory vary as a function of
   alcohol use, even among children as young as in the 3rd grade. To
   advance the understanding of influences on the development of alcohol
   expectancies in children, 551 4th- and 5th-grade children were exposed
   to 5 beer commercials or 5 soft drink commercials. After viewing the
   advertisements, all children reported their Ist associate to an alcohol
   prompt and completed a memory model-based measure of children's alcohol
   expectancies. Multidimensional scaling was used to map expectancies into
   hypothetical memory network format, and preference mapping was used to
   derive possible paths of activation. Children who viewed beer
   commercials were more Likely to activate positive and arousing alcohol
   expectancies. In view of previous findings demonstrating chat this
   pattern of activation corresponded to higher drinking among 3rd, 6th,
   9th, and 12th graders, the present findings suggested that antecedents
   to drinking like exposure to advertising may promote heavier drinking
   among children by influencing the activation of expectancies in memory.

AB This paper reconsiders the political constraints and organizational
   dynamics which limit standard-setting by the Occupational Safety and
   Health Administration. Past research is dominated by class analytic
   perspectives which trace the failure of regulatory agencies to either
   direct "capture" by regulated industries or widespread concern about
   business confidence. This paper synthesizes the insights of critical
   legal studies and recent work in political sociology to further specify
   the social bases of corporate power in the regulatory arena. Critical
   legal scholars emphasize the way in which "class neutral" legal statutes
   create opportunities for capital at the expense of subordinate groups.
   Recent work in political sociology clarifies the complex organizational
   and institutional dynamics that shape the mobilization of strategic
   resources in the context of political opportunities. using a sample that
   covers 25 years, we examine the extent to which due process in standard
   setting favors capital at the expense of labour due to disparities in
   resource mobilization. Due process provides capital several
   opportunities to challenge regulatory initiatives. Capital, led by trade
   associations and Fortune 500 companies, has consistently mobilizes the
   resources necessary to exploit these opportunities. In contrast,
   organizational constraints have seriously limited the mobilization of
   labour and its potential allies, including state technocrates, to defend
   regulatory initiatives. We identify two far-reaching gains secured by
   capital given these disparities. On the one hand, the mobilization of a
   corporate countermovement in any one case may have precluded the
   effective defence of other regulatory initiatives, since the resources
   of labour and regulatory agencies are easily exhausted. On the other
   hand, the mobilization of capital has served to safeguard its right to
   due process and the opportunities this right affords. We conclude that
   due process in standard-setting in the context of resource disparities
   necessarily favors capital because it inevitably results in "opportunity
   costs," reflected in the hundred of regulatory initiatives that remain
   dormant indefinitely.

AB Recent work by political sociologists and social movement theorists
   extend our understanding of how religious institutions contribute to
   expanding democracy, but nearly all analyze religious institutions as
   institutions; few focus directly on what religion qua religion might
   contribute. This article strives to illuminate the impact of religious
   culture per se, extending recent work on religion and democratic life by
   a small group of social movement scholars trained also in the sociology
   of religion. In examining religion's democratic impact, an explicitly
   cultural analysis inspired by the new approach to political culture
   developed by historical sociologists and cultural analysts of democracy
   is used to show the power of this approach and to provide a fuller
   theoretical account of how cultural dynamics shape political outcomes.
   The article examines religious institutions as generators of religious
   culture, presents a theoretical model of how religious cultural elements
   are incorporated into social movements and so shape their internal
   political cultures, and discusses how this in turn shapes their impact
   in the public realm. This model is then applied to a key site of
   democratic struggle: four efforts to promote social justice among
   low-income urban residents of the United States, including the most
   widespread such effort-faith-based community organizing.

   the social and cultural patternings of public and personal memory, but
   neglect the ways in which those processes are constituted in part by

AB It is important to understand the perceptions of user groups regarding
   both the health of our estuaries and environmental problems requiring
   management. Recreational fishers were interviewed to determine the
   perceptions of one of the traditional user groups of Barnegat Bay (New
   Jersey), and elected officials were interviewed to determine if the
   people charged with making decisions about environmental issues in the
   bay held similar perceptions. Although relative ratings were similar,
   there were significant differences in perceptions of the severity of
   environmental problems, and for the most part, public officials thought
   the problems were more severe than did the fishers. Personal watercraft
   (often called Jet Skis) were rated as the most severe problem, followed
   by chemical pollution, junk, overfishing, street runoff, and boat oil.
   Small boats, sailboats, wind surfers, and foraging birds were not
   considered environmental problems by either elected officials or
   fishermen. The disconnect between the perceptions of the recreational
   fishers and those of the locally elected public officials suggests that
   officials may be hearing from some of the more vocal people about
   problems, rather than from the typical fishers. Both groups felt there
   were decreases in some of the resources in the bay; over 50% felt the
   number of fish and crabs had declined, the size of fish and crabs had
   declined, and the number of turtles had declined. Among recreational
   fishers, there were almost no differences in perceptions of the severity
   of environmental problems or in changes in the bay. The problems that
   were rated the most severe were personal watercraft and overfishing by
   commercial fishers. Recreational fishers ranked sailboats, wind surfers,
   and fishing by birds as posing no problem for the bay. Most fishers felt
   there had been recent major changes in Barnegat Bay, with there now
   being fewer and smaller fish, fewer and smaller crabs, and fewer
   turtles. The results suggest that the, views of a wide range of coastal
   users should be considered when making environmental health decisions.

   following HIV notification: longer duration of relationship; economic
   constraints, extended family members' opinions, especially parents; the
   existence of children from the marriage; and fear of stigmatization by

AB In this essay, the emergence of the "New Synthesis" of economics and
   sociology is explored and analyzed in the context of the classical
   writings in economic sociology ("Old Synthesis").:The aim is not to
   provide an exhaustive survey, but rather a selective assessment that
   introduces readers to the most important questions, answers and
   contributions of this emerging and important specialized literature. The
   essay seeks to i) translate faithfully the internal logic of this active
   specialty field into a language and problematic that can be appreciated
   by non-specialists, ii) identify central assumptions and themes in the
   New Synthesis writings that seem particularly promising for the
   appreciation of contemporary economic happenings, and iii) indicate
   opportunities for the development of further theoretical richness by
   incorporating Old Synthesis approaches.

AB As economic sociologists have been arguing for some time, markets are
   not to be abstractly opposed to other social relations but rather to be
   understood as embedded in them, and indeed subject to the same kinds of
   analysis as other social relations. However, many accounts of
   embeddedness explain it in structural terms and still operate with an
   impoverished notion of culture. On the other hand, relatively few
   cultural sociologists have considered cultural dimensions of economic
   action. I first argue that there is a rich agenda for cultural
   investigation which has yet to be fully exploited in economic sociology,
   and fascinating work on economic embeddedness which could be enriched
   with more culturally oriented analysis and research. I go on to
   distinguish three issues on this agenda which are more often collapsed,
   arguing that the meaning of markets should be investigated in terms of
   the cultural construction of objects of market exchange, the cultural
   construction of parties to market exchange, and the cultural
   construction of norms of exchange. Distinguishing these three dimensions
   of market culture is productive because it links apparently disparate
   types of investigation and allows more precisely specified questions
   about their relations. Finally, I suggest that norms of market exchange
   are drawn from a richer symbolic repertoire than is usually imagined:
   reciprocity and redistribution, as well as market norms, are likely to
   be important as norms of mundane marker action.

AB Objective: This article highlights the mental health consequences of a

   Method: The author reviews the literature on the neuropsychiatric
   effects of selected chemical and biological weapon agents, on the
   psychological sequelae of mass disasters, and on approaches to crisis
   intervention. Results: Disturbances of behavior, affect, and cognition
   can result directly from the pharmacological actions of some chemical
   and biological weapon agents. In addition, an incident involving these
   agents can have considerable psychological effects on individuals and
   the community. In either case, some disorders are acute and others are
   prolonged or delayed in onset. Effective therapeutic intervention
   involves a broad range of clinical, social, and administrative actions.
   Conclusions: Psychiatrists have an important role in the management of a
   chemical or biological terrorist incident and, along with their other
   medical colleagues, should train and prepare for it.

AB Objective: The Challenger space shuttle explosion in January 1986
   offered an opportunity to determine what, if any, symptoms of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bereavement normal latency-age
   children and adolescents would develop after a distant, horrifying
   event. Method: With a structured interview, the authors assessed the
   symptoms of 153 randomly selected children from Concord, N.H., and
   Porterville, Calif. Responses were statistically compared between East
   Coast children, who saw the event on television and who generally cared
   more about the teacher aboard Challenger, and West Coast children, who
   heard about it first; between latency-age children and adolescents; and
   between children seen 5-7 weeks later and those same children seen 14
   months later. Results: More than 60% of the subjects feared at least one
   stimulus related to Challenger within the first 5-7 weeks of the
   explosion. The East Coast and latency-age groups appeared significantly
   more symptomatic than did the West Coast and adolescent groups. Over the
   14-month study period, most symptoms dramatically faded. However,
   adolescents' diminished expectations for the future in general
   increased, and latency-age children's changed approach to space careers
   held relatively steady. Three East Coast latency-age children met the
   DSM-III-R symptom requirements for PTSD in 1986; no children met these
   in 1987. Conclusions: Children's symptomatic patterns after Challenger
   relate to the patterns for PTSD listed in diagnostic manuals and to
   three symptoms not in the DSM-IV list. To the authors, distant traumas
   appear to be one of a newly defined spectrum of trauma-related
   conditions that include relatively evanescent symptoms and a few
   longer-lasting ones. These symptoms may affect large numbers of normal
   children.

AB Objectives. The welfare reform law of 1996 marked a historical moment in
   US policy toward the poor by ending the entitlement to cash assistance,
   by requiring work, and by establishing time limits. This article
   examines the potential impact on the health of women and children, the
   primary recipients of welfare benefits.
   Methods. The authors outline the reproductive health outcomes most
   likely to be sensitive to welfare policies. identify indicators that
   might be used to assess these outcomes, review empirical evidence, and
   suggest specific methods and data sources.
   Results. State welfare requirements could improve health outcomes or
   deter families from Medicaid and food stamps, as well as income support,
   thus worsening health outcomes. National and state data may prove useful
   in detecting these effects; however, new data sources may be required
   for specific health-related questions.
   Conclusions. Assessing the effects of welfare policies on reproductive
   and infant health is possible, although challenging. Reauthorization of
   the legislation is required in 2002; it is essential that the
   consequences for health be included in the next round of public debate.

AB Objectives. Relative to non-Latino Whites, Latinos have a worse
   socioeconomic profile but a lower mortality rate. a finding that
   presents an epidemiologic paradox. This study tested the salmon bias
   hypothesis that Latinos engage in return migration to their country of
   origin and are thereby rendered "statistically immortal" and the
   alternative hypothesis that selection of healthier migrants to the
   United States accounts for the paradox.
   Methods. National Longitudinal Mortality Study data were used to examine
   mortality rates of the following groups for whom the salmon hypothesis
   is not feasible: Cubans, who face barriers against return migration;
   Puerto Ricans, whose deaths in Puerto Rico are recorded in US national
   statistics; and US-born individuals, who are not subject to either
   salmon or healthy migrant effects.
   Results. The sample included 301 718 non-Latino Whites and 17 375 Latino
   Whites 25 years or older. Cubans and Puerto Ricans had lower mortality
   than non-Latino Whites. Moreover, US-born Latinos had lower mortality
   than US-born non-Latino Whites.
   Conclusions. Neither the salmon nor the healthy migrant hypothesis
   explains the pattern of findings. Other factors must be operating to
   produce the lower mortality.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the relation of
   early adolescent marijuana use to late adolescent problem behaviors,
   drug-related attitudes, drug problems, and sibling and peer problem
   behavior.
   Methods. African American (n = 627) and Puerto Rican (n = 555) youths
   completed questionnaires in their classrooms initially and were
   individually interviewed 5 years later. Logistic regression analysis
   estimated increases in the risk of behaviors or attitudes in late
   adolescence associated with Inert frequent marijuana use in early
   adolescence,
   Results. Early adolescent marijuana use increased the risk in late
   adolescence of not graduating from high school: delinquency; having
   multiple sexual partners, not always using condoms: perceiving drugs as
   not harmful; having problems with cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana; and
   having more friends who exhibit deviant behavior. These relations were
   maintained with controls for age, sex, ethnicity, and, when available,
   earlier psychosocial measures.
   Conclusions. Early adolescent marijuana use is related to later
   adolescent problems that limit the acquisition of sl;ills necessary for
   employment and heighten the risks of contracting HN and abusing legal
   and illegal substances. Hence, assessments of and treatments for
   adolescent marijuana use need to be incorporated in clinical practice.

AB A decade ago, the "new sociology of masculinity" (NSM) emerged as an
   exciting new paradigm for understanding gender emphasizing the study of
   "hegemonic power relations" among men and women. However subsequent
   research has not fully redeemed the promise of the NSM, failing to
   seriously engage the theoretical implications of studying hegemony. This
   article addresses the lacunae by presenting a theoretically informed
   analysis of life history interviews with Chinese American men. Its chief
   empirical question is how Chinese American men "achieve" masculinity in
   the face of negative stereotypes. This is accomplished, it is found,
   through four possible gender strategies: compensation, deflection,
   denial, or repudiation. The author then fashions a theoretical account
   of these strategies to show how they can reproduce the social order by
   striking a hegemonic bargain, which occurs when a Chinese American man's
   gender strategy involves consciously trading on-or unconsciously faking
   advantage of-the "privileges" of his race, gender; class generation,
   and/or sexuality for the purposes of elevating his masculinity.

AB It has been suggested that altering the pace of reproduction would
   improve the health of women and children. For formulating intervention
   policies, it is important to know whether on its own such a strategy is
   likely to lead to risk reduction. This paper analyses mortality risk in
   sibships to explore the relationship between family formation factors
   and other household characteristics that identify women whose families
   are at higher risk. The analysis allows for the fact that reproductive
   behaviour may be modified by the family's prior experience of child
   death, using simultaneous equations methods to purge the model of the
   'feedback' effects of death on the endogenous variable, childbearing
   pace. The strong relationship between reproductive pace and average risk
   in a family appears to be due to the association of both with other
   differences between households. Other aspects of family formation
   patterns are good indicators of which families are likely to experience
   excess risks to their children. These factors are associated with
   maternal education, but measure characteristics of the family or mother
   that educational attainment does not fully capture. They indicate that
   high-risk mothers are likely to have less control over many aspects of
   their lives. The pace of family building does not lead to excess average
   family risk, but may result, at least in part, from the concentration of
   risk in families with other characteristic patterns of family formation
   and few resources. The paper argues for a broader conception of
   household influences on child health and the health-related behaviour of
   parents.

AB Children with Joubert syndrome have physical and intellectual
   disabilities. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of
   Joubert syndrome on parental burden, coping, and family functioning.
   Forty-nine primary caregivers were surveyed. Forty-three primary
   caregivers were mothers and six were fathers; their mean age was 34
   years. The following measures were used: Beck Depression Inventory,
   Child Development Inventory, Caregiver Strain Index, Family Assessment
   Device, and Ways of Coping Checklist-Revised. The data show that
   caregiver burden is not related to the severity of the child's illness,
   but that caregivers report significant burden. Higher burden was
   associated with the use of palliative coping methods, and family
   functioning was problematic. The results of this study suggest that for
   parents of children with Joubert syndrome,degree of parental burden
   depends more on the parents' coping skills and the level of family
   functioning rather than on the degree of the child's impairment. These
   findings highlight the importance of assessing caregiver burden, as well
   as decreased family functioning or coping abilities, since these
   problems often can be managed with psychologic intervention.

AB This article represents a preliminary effort to describe drug abuse in
   Tudu, one of a number of neighborhoods in Accra that serve as drug
   centers. The problems of such neighborhoods reflect the drug problems
   that currently beset the rest of Ghana and Accra in particular. There is
   almost no fundamental current research on this issue. The few works
   cited comprise virtually the entire body of existing literature on this
   subject, and they fall far short of providing a comprehensive account of
   the changes that drugs have made in the social structure of the greater
   Accra region. This article is based on research done in the drug parlors
   and alleyways where the Tudu drug trade is conducted, and is a
   preliminary effort to redress the current lack of information by
   documenting the changing patterns of drug use in greater Accra. The
   findings reveal that a shift is underway from traditional marijuana
   abuse to abuse of crack cocaine and heroin. The article highlights the
   social relations that characterize this more dangerous drug setting and
   enhances the understanding of the psychiatric comorbidity of drug abuse,
   health, and behavior. These conclusions are derived from a multifaceted
   approach to data collection, taken to enhance the validity of research
   findings.

AB Objectives: To determine the symptoms and behaviors in children which
   are considered psychopathological by Vietnamese parents, to identify
   professionals and agencies in the community whom Vietnamese parents
   would consult if their child had a mental illness, and to determine
   Vietnamese parents' awareness of existing community mental health
   services, Method: Structured interviews were conducted with a randomized
   community sample of 283 Vietnamese parents in Perth, Australia. Parents
   were asked to identify the symptoms and behaviors they considered
   psychopathological in children, where they would turn for help with a
   mentally ill child, their knowledge of community mental health services
   for children, and their understanding of the causes of child psychiatric
   disorders. Results: Vietnamese parents identified psychotic symptoms,
   disorientation, and suicidal thoughts and behavior as
   psychopathological. They preferentially endorsed Western-style treatment
   approaches but had little awareness of existing community mental health
   services for children. A biological/chemical imbalance, traumatic
   experiences, and a metaphysical/spiritual imbalance were identified as
   the most likely causes of child mental illness. Conclusions: Despite a
   different cultural tradition, Vietnamese parents appear open to services
   provided by Western-trained mental health professionals. Their very
   limited awareness of child and adolescent mental health services in the
   community, however, may severely limit their utilization of such
   services.

AB Background: While treatment of symptomatic sexually transmitted diseases
   (STDs) has been shown to reduce the incidence of HIV infection, there
   are few published reports describing the delivery of high quality STD
   care in Africa.
   Goal: To test the feasibility of providing comprehensive, affordable STD
   services through the existing primary care infrastructure.
   Design: STD treatment services using a syndromic approach were
   established in two semi-urban hospital outpatient departments (OPD) in
   Central African Republic (CAR). A dedicated paramedical provider took a
   clinical history, performed an examination, explained the diagnosis and
   the importance of referring partners, dispensed drugs, and offered
   partner referral vouchers. A fee-for-service system was used to resupply
   drugs initially purchased with project funds.
   Results: Of 9,552 visits by index patients and partners over a 28-month
   period starting in October 1993, 60% were made by women; of these women,
   90% were symptomatic, 77% had "vaginal discharge," 70% "lower abdominal
   pain," and 7% "genital ulcer." Among men, 64% were symptomatic, 38% had
   "urethral discharge," and 14% "genital ulcer." Half of all symptomatic
   patients presented within I week of the onset of symptoms; 44% of men
   compared to 18% of women had sought care elsewhere before the clinic
   visit. The average cost per STD treated with recommended drugs was
   $3.90. Etiologic data from subpopulations in both sites suggest that a
   high proportion of patients was infected with an STD.
   Conclusions: Comprehensive yet affordable care for STDs in persons (and
   their partners) who recognize symptoms is feasible and should be widely
   implemented in primary care systems to prevent the spread and
   complications of STDs and HIV in Africa.

AB This study explores the value of traditional ethnographic methods in
   sociology for the study of human-animal and animal-animal interactions
   and culture. It argues that some measure of human-animal
   intersubjectivity is possible and that the method of participant
   observation is best suited to achieve this. Applying ethnographic
   methods to human-cat and cat-cat relationships in a no-kill cat shelter,
   the study presents initial findings; it concludes that the social
   structure of the shelter is the product of interaction both between,
   humans and cats and cats and cats and that the observed structure
   represents, to a large degree, choices made by the cats. The study also
   concludes that, within the cat community of the shelter a distinctive
   cat culture has emerged, which represents the cats' adaptation to the
   particular conditions of shelter life. Specifically, the shelter allows
   for the emergence of higher order needs and goals that stress affection,
   friendship, and social cohesion among the cats rather than
   territoriality and conflict. The study further argues that traditional
   animal researchers have mistaken the relative equality of cat colonies
   for a lack of social structure, as opposed to a different structure from
   that found in sharply ranked nonhuman animal communities.

AB The basic premise of this article is that the revival and increasing
   acceptance of the concept of cultural pluralism (and its contemporary
   variant, multiculturalism) in popular and academic discourses today
   should be investigated as a problem in the sociology of knowledge. In
   this context, this article discusses briefly how cultural pluralism is
   used in popular and academic discourses today. Then, it identifies the
   normative structure of and the domain assumptions underpinning, the
   concept The article constructs an argument that the concept lacks
   conceptual precision and analytical rigor; that its ontological claims
   for race and ethnicity cannot be justified; and that it is
   epistemologically incoherent, as shown by its internal contradictions.
   The article concludes that the ideological implications of the concept
   should be investigated and that discourses on cultural pluralism,
   generally, would benefit by resurrecting Milton Gordon's concept of the
   eth-class.

AB This article discusses the difficulties inherent in teaching a sociology
   course through use of feature-length film. Despite these difficulties, I
   argue that contemporary Hollywood movies are useful tools to illustrate
   some of our discipline's central concepts and to serve as an exercise in
   the application of the sociological imagination. Films, however, come
   prepackaged with a particular worldview or theoretical perspective.
   Thus, they require the sociologist to consider the theory-laden nature
   of movies as part of the analysis of social life that they depict. in
   order to do this, I analyze three groups of movies through the use of
   sociological concepts such as Griswold's "cultural diamond" and
   Jameson's ideology/utiopa distinction.

AB This paper grounds the practice of service learning in a sociological
   understanding so that we may More fruitfully tie this pedagogy to our
   field. A base for such grounding can be found in the work of C. Wright
   Mills, who built on the work of John Dewey, We argue that incorporating
   sociologically informed service learning into the curriculum is
   necessary for completing the progressive educational and social reforms
   sought by both, thus enabling us to fulfill Mills' "promise" for our
   discipline (Mills 1959). On the other hand, a sociologically uninformed
   service-learning experience may hinder, rather than help, the movement
   toward a just society because students may objectify community residents
   and blame them for their problems. Thus, we present potential problems
   associated with service-learning and argue for the concept of addressing
   key sociological insights prior to immersing students into a program of
   service-learning.

   Changes made to infuse the course with multicultural content are
   outlined in particular, this paper discusses the ways in which key
   concepts in social psychology can be applied using a cross-cultural
   autobiography, and it examines the utility of using such a text. A
   survey evaluation of this approach reveals that students generally
   accept a multicultural approach to social psychology and feel that it
   aids in their understanding of key concepts. in addition, a comparison
   of exam means and performance on selected rest items indicate no
   negative consequences of implementing such an approach. This paper also
   discusses the advantages and disadvantages of such a transformation and

AB We examined adolescent risk and protective constructs associated with
   adult polydrug use among four ethnic groups. Both mean and relational
   differences among the constructs were examined by ethnic group. Teenage
   polydrug use was a significant predictor of adult polydrug use for
   Caucasians, African-Americans, and Latinos. Although this relationship
   was not evident for Asians, teenage alcohol use increased adult
   cigarette use, and early religiosity increased adult alcohol use. Early
   parental support/bonding predicted less adult Polydrug Use for
   Caucasians. For Latinos, general social conformity and low liberalism
   decreased cigarette use as an adult. In general, the implications of the
   results are that prevention strategies should emphasize the reduction of
   teenage drug use to decrease adult polydrug use among Caucasians,
   Latinos, and African-Americans. Future research should examine other
   possible risk and protective conditions related to adult polydrug use
   among diverse populations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   rise to the various forms of IUGR. This study tests that hypothesis that
   the rate of maternal weight gain during early/mid and late pregnancy are
   differentially related to body size and proportions at birth in a
   nutritionally stressed population in rural Malawi. The data consist of
   prospectively collected measurements of maternal weight and infant size
   at birth on 272 mother-infant pairs. The results reveal that early/mid
   and late weight gain are both related to birth weight and length, but
   not to the ponderal index. Late weight gain is particularly predictive
   of infant size among thin women (BMI less than or equal to 18.5) and is
   several times stronger than early/mid weight gain. These findings do not
   support the timing hypothesis as previously stated in the literature,
   but do add to the suggestions arising from a disparate literature that
   growth acceleration in length may precede acceleration in
   weight-for-length during a period of nutritional replection in phases of
   the life cycle characterized by rapid growth. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   hysterectomy may affect intrapopulation and cross-population comparisons
   of median ages at natural menopause. Data were drawn from a community
   sample in upstate New York. It is demonstrated that hysterectomy rates
   are not random with respect to variables that are also related to age at
   natural menopause. For example, women reporting high levels of education
   reported lower rates of hysterectomy and earlier mean ages at menopause.
   In addition, median ages at menopause and rates of hysterectomy were
   examined by correlation and regression analysis across a selection of
   industrialized countries. Avenues for further study are suggested. (C)

AB The unprecedented inclusion of culture-bound syndromes in DSM-IV
   provides the opportunity for highlighting the need to study such
   syndromes and the occasion for developing a research agenda to study
   them. The growing ethnic and cultural diversity of the U.S, population
   presents a challenge to the mental health field to develop truly
   cross-cultural approaches to mental health research and services. In
   this article, the authors provide a critique of previous analyses of the
   relationship between culture-bound syndromes and psychiatric diagnoses.
   They highlight the problems in previous classificatory exercises, which
   tend to focus on subsuming the culture-bound syndromes into psychiatric
   categories and fail to fully investigate these syndromes on their own
   terms. A detailed research program based on four key questions is
   presented both to understand culture-bound syndromes within their
   cultural context and to analyze the relationship between these syndromes
   and psychiatric disorders. Results of over a decade of research on
   ataques de nervios, a Latino-Caribbean cultural syndrome, are used to
   illustrate this research program. The four questions focus on the nature
   of the phenomenon, the social-cultural location of sufferers, the
   relationship of culture-bound syndromes to psychiatric disorders, and
   the social and psychiatric history of the syndrome in the life course of
   the sufferer.

AB Objectives. The authors used nationwide sun ev data to characterize
   current public conceptions related to recognition of mental illness and
   perceived causes, dangerousness. and desired social distance.
   Methods. Data were derived from a vignette experiment included in the
   1996 General Social Sun ey. Respondents(n = 1444) were randomly assigned
   to 1 of 5 vignette conditions. Four vignettes described psychiatric
   disorders meeting diagnostic criteria, and the fifth depicted a
   "troubled person'' with subclinical problems and worries.
   Results. Results indicate that the majority of the public identifies
   schizophrenia (88%) and major depression (69%) as mental illnesses and
   that most report multicausal explanations combining stressful
   circumstances with biologic and genetic factors. Results also show,
   however, that smaller proportions associate alcohol (49%) or drug (44%)
   abuse with mental illness and that symptoms of mental illness remain
   strongly connected with public fears about potential violence and with a
   desire for limited social interaction.
   Conclusions. While there is reason for optimism in the public's
   recognition of mental illness and causal attributions. a strong
   stereotype of dangerousness and desire for social distance persist.
   These latter conceptions are likely to negatively affect people with
   mental illness.

AB Objectives. This study assessed the extent to which the use of
   point-prevalence samples biases conclusions drawn about homeless people.
   Methods. Three data sets and published research were used to examine the
   degree to which conditions leading to point-prevalence bias (turnover in
   the homeless population, variability in the persistence of homelessness,
   and associations between personal characteristics and persistence)
   characterize the homeless population.
   Results were compared from point-prevalence studies concerning
   persistence of homelessness and characteristics of homeless people with
   those from a study of formerly homeless people. Results. Conditions
   leading to point-prevalence bias strongly characterize the homeless
   population. Moreover, profiles of homeless people differed dramatically
   between point-prevalence studies and the study of formerly homeless
   people. II? the former, average duration of homelessness was longer and
   samples included higher proportions of men, minorities. non-high school
   graduates, and people with histories of psychiatric hospitalization,
   incarceration, and detoxification,
   Conclusions, Reliance on point-prevalence samples, when such samples are
   generalized beyond the currently homeless population, leads to
   overestimations of the persistence of homelessness, the demographic
   distinctiveness of the homeless population, and the prevalence of
   personal disabilities and deviant lifestyles among homeless people.

   treatment competence of people with mental health problems, potential
   for harm to self or others, and the use of legal means to force
   treatment.
   Methods The 1996 General Social Survey provided interview data with a
   nationally representative sample (n = 1444). Respondents were given a
   vignette based on diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, major
   depression, alcohol dependence. or drug dependence, or a "control" case.
   Results. The specific nature bf the problem was the most important
   factor shaping public reaction. Respondents viewed those with
   "troubles," alcohol dependence, or depression as able to make treatment
   decisions. Most reported that persons with alcohol or drug problems or
   schizophrenia cannot manage money and are likely to be violent toward
   others. Respondents indicated a willingness to coerce individuals into
   treatment. Respondent and other case characteristics rarely affected
   opinions.
   Conclusions, Americans report greater concern with individuals who have
   drug or alcohol problems than with persons who have other mental health
   problems. Evaluations of dangerousness and coercion indicate a
   continuing need for public education.

AB Objectives. This study developed prevalence estimates of
   gambling-related disorders in the United States and Canada, identified
   differences in prevalence among population segments, and identified
   changes in prevalence over the past 20 years.
   Methods. A meta-analytic strategy was employed to synthesize estimates
   from 119 prevalence studies. This method produced more reliable
   prevalence rates than were available from any single study.
   Results. Prevalence estimates among samples of adolescents were
   significantly higher than estimates among samples of adults for both
   clinical (level 3) and subclinical (level 2) measures of disordered
   gambling within both lifetime and past-year time frames (e.g., 3.9% vs
   1.6% for lifetime estimates of level 3 gambling). Among adults,
   prevalence estimates of disordered gambling have increased significantly
   during the past 20 years.
   Conclusions. Membership in youth, treatment, or prison population
   segments is significantly associated with experiencing gambling-related
   disorders. Understanding subclinical gamblers provides a meaningful
   opportunity to lower the public health burden associated with gambling
   disorders. Further research is necessary to determine whether the
   prevalence of disordered gambling will continue to increase among the
   general adult population and how prevalence among adolescents will
   change as this cahort ages.

   health of grandparents raising grandchildren with that of noncaregiving
   grandparents.
   Methods. A secondary analysis of data from the 1992 to 1994 National
   Survey of Families and Households was conducted. Bivariate and logistic
   analyses compared 173 custodial and 3304 noncustodial grandparents in
   terms of functional health limitations, self-rated health, and
   satisfaction with health.
   Results. Custodial grandparents were significantly more likely to have
   limitations in 4 of the 5 activities of daily living (ADLs) examined,
   with more than half reporting some limitation in 1 of the 5 ADLs, A
   logistic regression analysis indicated that caregiving grandparents had
   50% higher odds of having atl ADL limitation. Caregivers are
   significantly more likely to report lower satisfaction with health, and
   a statistical trend indicated that the caregivers had lower self-rated
   health.
   Conclusions. further research is needed to determine whether the
   differences observed reflect artifacts or actual differences in
   functional abilities and other health measures. The need for policies
   that support rather than penalize grandparents raising grandchildren is

AB Dietary and socio-economic data were collected from over 5,600 Chinese
   adults aged 20 to 45 in 1989, 1991, and 1993. Adults were categorized by
   income and other socio-economic variables, and dietary changes between
   1989 and the subsequent two periods were studied. The quantities and
   proportions of animal foods and edible oils consumed increased
   dramatically, while daily consumption of grains and potatoes decreased
   by about 41 to 77 g. This decrease was greatest among coarse grains
   (corn, millet, and sorghum). The largest contributors to increased fat
   intake were edible oils, high-fat red meat, and lard and butter. Those
   eating more grain consumed less fat. Among high-income persons in 1993,
   58% had a higher fat intake than recommended (> 30% of calories from
   fat), 31% had a high intake of saturated fat (> 10% of calories from
   saturated fat), and 40% had a cholesterol intake exceeding 300 mg/day.
   The corresponding figures were 27%, 15%, and 21% among low-income
   persons. This study raises important concerns about some long-term
   adverse consequences of economic change in China.

   communities' strategies for coping with food deficits in S.E. Kajiado
   District, Kenya, through a comparison of coping strategies reported in
   surveys conducted in 1977 and 1996. It provides empirical evidence of
   the dynamic responses that one rural society prone to recurrent
   drought-related food insecurity has made to the complex interactions
   between exogenous and local political, economic, social and demographic,
   and environmental processes. It demonstrates that although driving
   forces emanating from national and international scales create the broad
   context for developmental change, local processes mediate these. As
   these alter, so no the options available for coping with food
   insecurity. The availability of these options differs according to a
   person's age, gender, and socio-economic status. Such dynamism and
   differentiation is inherent in rural development and should inform
   development planners and those seeking to include monitoring of coping
   strategies as a component of famine early-warning systems.

AB Religious nationalism represents an institutional project to transform
   the ontology of the social, to redefine the substance of collective
   representation, the principle of domination and the criteria for
   membership. Religious nationalism transforms the territorial
   nation-state into a vehicle in and by which to extend the materiality of
   its culturally specific categories, codes, values and narratives. It
   thereby challenges social theories, like that of Bourdieu, that
   deculturalize power, as well as those, like Alexander, that culturalize
   it in an institutionally restrictive manner. Religious nationalism is
   not a retreat to the premodern, but an effort to bound and energize the
   elemental modem moments, that of the self and the national-state.
   Religious nationalism represents the return to text, to the fixity of
   signs, the renarrativization of the nation in a cosmic context. It
   returns us to bodies and souls, a zone to be defended against things on
   the one side and beasts on the other. It offers a way to secure morality
   against an increasingly post-humanist world. Its discourse of difference
   seeks to bound the nation. Religious nationalism restores the binaries
   of inside and outside, us and them, good and evil, man and woman and
   centers them in sacred space.

AB This investigation discusses social power as an identifiable and
   measurable aspect of the supervisory process in speech-language
   pathology (SLP). This study examined the use of French and Raven's
   (1959) types of social power by 61 clinical supervisors with their 69
   beginning and 69 advanced graduate supervisees from 14 university
   programs. Both supervisors' and supervisees' perceptions of supervisors'
   use of expert, referent, coercive, legitimate, and reward power were
   obtained with modified versions of the Rahim Leader Power Inventory
   (RLPI) (Rahim, 1988). The supervisors' perceptions of their use of the
   five types of social power with beginning supervisees were not
   significantly different from the beginning supervisees' perceptions. By
   contrast, the study yielded discrepant perceptions of supervisors' use
   of social power with advanced supervisees. Further, supervisors reported
   differential use of power with supervisees with different amounts of
   clinical experience. Yet, the perceptions of beginning and advanced
   supervisees did not differ relative to supervisors' use of any of the
   five types of social power. These findings can sensitize clinical
   supervisors to the sources of social power inherent in their practice.

AB Objective: Inner-city black and Hispanic adolescents might be at great
   risk for alcohol use. Yet the etiology of drinking among these
   adolescents receives little attention. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the impact of social influences and problem behavior on alcohol
   use among Hispanic and black adolescents. The impact of these factors
   was also tested separately for girls and boys to determine the
   differences in etiology of alcohol use depending on gender. Method: A
   large sample of black and Hispanic seventh-grade students (N = 4,847,
   52% female) self-reported alcohol use, demographic characteristics
   (gender, family structure, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status),
   social influences to drink (peer norms, adult norms, their friends' use,
   their mother's use, their father's use, their siblings' use, and
   perceived availability of alcohol), and problem behaviors (cigarette
   smoking, marijuana use, getting into trouble). Teams of three to five
   data collectors administered the questionnaire following standardized
   protocol. These data were collected in class during a regular 40-minute
   period. Results: Logistic regressions indicated that social influences
   to drink from friends, peers, and family and problem behaviors including
   cigarette smoking and marijuana use were related to alcohol use across
   and within gender. Getting into trouble predicted drinking for boys but
   not girls. Conclusions: Based on these findings, adolescent alcohol
   prevention programs need to include an awareness of the many social
   influences to drink, modify incorrectly perceived peer norms for
   drinking, involve family members in the prevention program and address
   an array of problem behaviors within one prevention intervention.

PY 1999
AB Objective: Many young adults engage in heavy or problem drinking, but it
   is unclear who will continue problem drinking into adulthood. This study
   followed a general population sample in order to study patterns of
   problem drinking over time, to identify differences among drinking
   groups, to test a model differentiating youth-limited from
   developmentally-persistent problem drinkers, and to examine adult
   outcomes. Method: Data were from the Health and Human Development
   Project; subjects (N = 1,073) were in three age cohorts (age 18-25; age
   21-28; age 24-31). Based on use and consequences data from two
   assessment intervals, cluster analyses were performed. Results: Cluster
   analyses yielded four drinking groups: youth-limited problem drinkers,
   stable moderate drinkers, stable low drinkers and
   developmentally-persistent problem drinkers. Rates of youth-limited
   problem drinking peaked in the middle cohort and rates of
   developmentally-persistent problem drinking decreased in the oldest
   cohort. Discriminant analysis revealed that developmentally-persistent
   problem drinkers in each age cohort are more likely to be male, to show
   high disinhibition, and to experience a high level of problem behaviors.
   Youth-limited problem drinkers were similar to
   developmentally-persistent problem drinkers on many young adult
   characteristics and adult outcomes. Developmentally-persistent problem
   drinkers in each age cohort continued to show higher levels of problem
   behaviors in adulthood than youth-limited problem drinkers. Conclusions:
   Most young adults show continuity of drinking patterns. Although
   developmentally-persistent problem drinkers did not differ from
   youth-limited problem drinkers in adopting adult roles, their continued
   experience of many problem behaviors suggests that they fail to adopt
   the role of greater conventionality in adulthood.

TI Drinking-driving and riding with drunk drivers among young adults: An

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 60
IS 5
BP 615
EP 621
PD SEP 1999
PY 1999
AB Objective: This research attempts to test the hypothesis that a
   reciprocal relationship exists between drinking-driving (DD) and riding
   with drunk drivers (RWDD) among youth. Method: Analyses were performed
   on data from the 1996 New York State Youth Alcohol Survey. The sample is
   composed of 16- to 24-year-olds who used alcohol and drove automobiles
   (N = 993). LISREL software was employed to examine the hypothesized
   simultaneous system between drinking-driving and riding with drunk
   drivers. Alcohol use, driving patterns and perception of negative
   consequences of drinking-driving behavior were included as independent
   variables. Results: The reciprocity between drinking-driving and riding
   with drunk drivers is composed of a relatively strong positive effect of
   DD on RWDD and a minimal effect of RWDD on DD. Alcohol use has a
   consistent effect on both drinking-driving and riding with drunk
   drivers. Frequency of weekend driving tends to increase the likelihood
   of drinking-driving, but not riding with drunk drivers. Youths'
   perceived likelihood of being arrested if caught drinking-driving
   appears to have a moderate negative association with drinking-driving
   and riding with drunk drivers for underage youths. Conclusions: The
   simultaneous system between drinking-driving and riding with drunk
   drivers tends to be dominated by the effect of the former on the latter.
   Involvement in drinking-driving among youths is likely to increase the
   chance of riding with drunk drivers, whereas involvement in RWDD may not
   necessarily increase the chance of DD. Possible explanations for this
   finding are discussed. Future research may focus on measurement errors
   of drinking-driving and riding with drunk drivers to further examine the
   relationship between these behaviors.

AB Objective: To investigate the prospective influence of individual
   adolescents' sensation seeking tendency and the sensation seeking
   tendency of named peers on the use of alcohol and marijuana, controlling
   for a variety of interpersonal and attitudinal risk and protective
   factors. Method: Data were collected from a cohort of adolescents (N =
   428; 60% female) at three points in time, starting in the eighth grade.
   Respondents provided information about sensation seeking, the positivity
   of family relations, attitudes toward alcohol and drug use, perceptions
   of their friends' use of alcohol and marijuana, perceptions of influence
   by their friends to use alcohol and marijuana, and their own use of
   alcohol and marijuana. In addition, they named up to three peers, whose
   sensation seeking and use data were integrated with respondents' data to
   allow for tests of hypotheses about peer clustering and substance use.
   Results: Structural equation modeling analyses revealed direct effects
   of peers' sensation seeking on adolescents' own use of both marijuana
   and alcohol 2 years later. An unexpected finding was that the
   individual's own sensation seeking had indirect (not direct) effects on
   drug use 2 years later. Conclusions: These findings indicate the
   potential importance of sensation seeking as a characteristic on which
   adolescent peers cluster. Furthermore, the findings indicate that,
   beyond the influence of a variety of other risk factors, peer sensation
   seeking contributes to adolescents' substance use.

BP 632
EP 642
PD SEP 1999
PY 1999
AB Objective: The relationship between mothers' alcohol or other drug (AOD)
   problems and their punitiveness toward their children is examined in
   this study. Method: Women (N = 170) were recruited from five different
   sources, including clinical interventions and the community. Women's
   punitiveness toward their children was assessed by three different
   maternal self-report measures: Conflict Tactics Scale, parental
   Punitiveness Scale and Child Abuse Potential Inventory. Women's
   histories of AOD problems, violent victimization and hostility were
   assessed using Standardized assessment tools. Results: Women were
   categorized by their AOD problems as follows: current problem (22.4%),
   past only problem (44.7%) or no problems (32.9%): Results indicate that
   mothers with current or past AOD problems are more punitive toward their
   children, controlling for potentially confounding demographic factors.
   Mothers' histories of partner violence and parental violence also
   predicted higher levels of mother-to-child punitiveness. However,
   histories of childhood sexual abuse predicted lower levels of mothers'
   punitiveness. Hostility served as a predictor of mothers' punitiveness
   and moderated some of the relationships between their AOD problems and
   their punitiveness. Conclusions: Findings suggest that women with AOD
   problems are more likely to be punitive toward their children, but other
   factors may also contribute to this risk. Treatment and prevention
   interventions need to be developed to decrease the risk of violent
   victimization among children whose mothers have alcohol and other drug
   problems.

EP 652
PD SEP 1999
PY 1999
AB Objective: The objective of the present study is to analyze time series
   data on alcohol consumption and divorce rates and assess the
   directionality of this relationship using alternative aggregate measures
   of alcohol consumption rates. Method: Granger's causality test and
   Box-Jenkins time series analysis are used to examine aggregate data on
   divorce rates and two indicators of alcohol consumption: a per capita
   consumption measure based on sales and shipments, and an
   expenditure-based measure for U.S. data from 1934 to 1987. Results: A
   consumption increase of 1 liter of alcohol per capita brings about an
   increase in the divorce rate of about 20%. This finding contrasts with
   results, using expenditures as the aggregate alcohol measure, that show
   that an increase of 1/1,000 in the divorce rate leads to a 10% increase
   in alcohol expenditures. (These latter findings confirm earlier
   published results.) Conclusions: The results from the present study
   provide support both for the effects of heavy drinking on divorce rates
   and the effects of divorce rates on expenditure's for alcoholic
   beverages. While both aggregate measures of alcohol consumption are
   highly correlated, they may tap different aspects of consumption. The
   relationship between marital instability and alcohol consumption is far
   from a simple one, and more complete conceptual models need to be
   developed. Aggregate-level findings indicate that it is reasonable to
   assume that a bidirectional influence exists between divorce rates and
   alcohol consumption.

AB Objective: To obtain estimates of the relationship between alcoholism
   and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in twin pairs discordant for
   alcohol dependence. Method: In 1995, 1,258 male-male twin pair members
   of the Vietnam Era Twin Registry (total Registry N = 7,375 pairs) were
   administered a modified Medical Outcomes Study 36 Item Short Form
   (SF-36) and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) to obtain measures
   of HRQL and a DSM-III-R criteria lifetime diagnosis of alcohol
   dependence. Mean within pair differences on eight separate SF-36
   subscales were calculated for 436 remitted (no alcohol symptoms in the
   past 5 years) alcohol-dependent discordant twin pairs and for 194 recent
   (at least one alcohol symptom in the past 5 years) alcohol-dependent
   discordant pairs before and after adjustment for covariates. Covariates
   included lifetime physical illness, lifetime psychiatric disorders,
   lifetime drug dependence, lifetime nicotine dependence, current marital
   status, current income and severity. Results: In the unadjusted analysis
   remitted alcoholic twins compared to their nonalcoholic co-twins
   reported significantly lower mean scores for six of eight SF-36
   subscales. Recent alcoholic twins, compared to their nonalcoholic
   co-twins, reported significantly lower mean scores for all of the SF-36
   subscales. However, after simultaneous adjustment for all covariates, no
   SF-36 subscale mean, except "vitality" among recent alcoholic twins, was
   significantly different between alcoholic twins and their nonalcoholic
   co-twins. Conclusions: Differences in HRQL between alcoholic and
   nonalcoholic co-twins is due to covariation from physical and
   psychiatric problems, drug and nicotine dependence, marital status,
   income and severity.

AB Objective: To determine whether the states of the Deep South are
   characterized by contradictory drinking norms: high abstinence paired
   with high consumption among drinkers. Method: Comparison of survey
   results of drinking patterns (N = 65,216) in four states of the Deep
   South (Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi) to those in leading
   states in the East (New York), Midwest (Illinois), Rocky Mountains
   (Colorado) and West (California) for the years 1990-93. Respondents were
   selected by random-digit dialing and interviewed by telephone as part of
   a larger study conducted by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System (BRFSS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
   Results: A higher proportion of persons drank alcohol in 1993 than in
   any of the previous 3 years. Persons with higher education, with higher
   income, of younger age, male, white and not living in the Deep South
   were more likely to drink. Among drinkers, the likelihood of episodic
   heavy drinking decreased with higher education, income and age. In
   addition, women, blacks and married respondents were less likely to
   report heavy drinking. Region of residence is not significantly
   associated with episodic heavy drinking. Conclusions: The Deep South has
   a significantly higher proportion of abstainers from alcohol use than
   other regions. Among drinkers, Southerners are not more likely to engage
   in occasions of heavy drinking. The results are discussed in relation to
   Southern culture and drinking norms.

PY 1999
AB Objective: Alcohol use typologies have previously focused on chronic
   alcohol abusers and alcohol-dependent populations. This empirical
   typology was created to profile lifestyle patterns associated with
   nonclinical patterns of alcohol use. Method: This study used two surveys
   sent to a commercial mailback panel, sampled to construct a study
   population demographically representative of the general U.S. population
   (N = 2,910). A K-means cluster analysis of alcohol use predictor
   variables and alcohol use generated the typology. Results: The results
   suggest five distinct psychobehavioral clusters, referred to by the
   modal patterns of alcohol use for each cluster: nondrinkers, light
   drinkers, moderate drinkers, episodic drinkers and regular heavy
   drinkers. These clusters were found to have predictive validity using
   related health behaviors, psychosocial variables, personality
   self-descriptors, and media use as criteria. In particular, moderate
   drinkers had double the income of any other cluster and showed
   consistently healthy exercise, cigarette use, and diet patterns as well
   as a relatively high ranking of health as a personal value. Episodic
   drinkers had the highest levels of sensation-seeking and drug use and
   were not health oriented in values and behaviors, although their total
   weekly consumption was only marginally greater than the moderate
   drinkers. Conclusions: The profile of the moderate drinker cluster is
   consistent with concerns about lifestyle confounds in the relationship
   between moderate alcohol consumption and cardiovascular health. The
   episodic drinker profile is consistent with relatively high risk
   behaviors; this cluster may be a good target for harm-reduction
   education and intervention efforts.

TI Drinking to cope with negative affect and DSM-IV alcohol use disorders:
   A test of three alternative explanations
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL

EP 704
PD SEP 1999

AB Objective: previous studies of drinking motives have demonstrated
   greater levels of drinking to cope with negative affect among problem
   drinkers relative to nonproblem drinkers. These findings suggest that
   the use of alcohol to cope with negative affect may place individuals at
   greater risk for the development of alcohol problems. However, several
   alternative explanations exist, each with different intervention
   implications. This study evaluated three alternative explanations or
   models: risk-factor, generalizing, and epiphenomena. A cross-sectional
   design was used to compare levels of self-reported drinking to cope with
   negative affect between individuals who had current DSM-IV alcohol use
   disorders-and those who did not. Method: Participants consisted of a
   sample of community residents (N = 777, 55% men). All participants
   completed an in-person structured psychiatric interview and a
   self-report questionnaire assessing alcohol use, drinking motives.
   depressive affect, and negative alcohol consequences. Results: Linear
   regression models yielded significant differences in mean drinking to
   cope with negative affect scores between participants with a DSM-IV
   alcohol dependence diagnosis and participants with Ilo diagnosis. These
   differences remained after controlling for depressive affect and
   frequency of negative alcohol consequences in three of the four adjusted
   comparisons. No significant differences in adjusted mean drinking to
   cope with negative affect scores were demonstrated between subjects with
   a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis and those with no diagnosis.
   Conclusions: The DSM-IV alcohol dependence and no-diagnosis comparisons
   were most consistent with the predictions of a risk-factor model. These
   results provide further evidence that drinking to cope with negative
   affect may haven etiological role in development of alcohol dependence.

AB The economic experiences and economic anxiety of rural and urban
   residents of the Czech and Slovak Republics during the postcommunist
   reforms are compared and related to their support for the reforms. The
   analysis is based on five national surveys, 1992-1996, collected by the
   Sociology Institute of the now Czech Academy of Sciences. Net of
   controls, both Czech and Slovak rural respondents report more economic
   strain and unemployment, a difference that persists over the surveys.
   These experiences account for rural residents' greater economic anxiety,
   their fear of economic development and unemployment, which also persists
   over the surveys. These experiences and anxiety explain, in turn, their
   lower level of support for the reforms, and endorsement of a return to
   socialism and strong-hand government. Rural and urban respondents of the
   two countries have experienced the world differently since 1990, and
   this is expressed in their economic anxiety and political preferences.

   network ties within the discipline, relatively weak subdivisions within
   the discipline, and a lower density of ties linking us to outside
   institutions. I use structural and social psychological theory to talk
   about the interactional dynamics that weaken this optimal disciplinary
   structure. The hope is that these theoretical insights will help us deal

AB Recent work in the sociology of professions highlights the central
   importance of abstract discourse in professionalization processes.
   Drawing on the work of Kenneth Burke, I argue that broadening the focus
   of analysis from "abstract discourse" to "narratives of expertise" will
   provide the ability to (1) more clearly analyze the social conditions
   that are conducive to the efficacy of abstraction as a basis for a claim
   of expertise and (2) theorize and empirically examine the formation and
   maintenance of a collective professional identity. To assist in the
   reformulation of professionalization studies around narratives of
   expertise, I develop a modified extension of Burke's five key terms of
   dramatism (act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose). Burke's pentadic
   scheme enables researchers to show how narratives of expertise ground
   jurisdictional claims and the constitution of professional identity in
   one of the elements of pentad. I illustrate the empirical power of the
   pentadic scheme through an examination of claims of psychotherapeutic
   expertise, particularly claims of marital and familial expertise.

   relationship both to the Religion of Reason of the Enlightenment and
   developments in European religious historiography during the nineteenth
   century. The underlying conflict to be resolved with respect to
   "secularization" is whether the term can be used in a relatively

AB Clustered binary responses, such as disease status in twins, frequently
   arise in perinatal health and other epidemiologic applications. The
   scientific objective involves modelling both the marginal mean
   responses, such as the probability of disease, and the within-cluster
   association of the multivariate responses. In this regard, bivariate
   logistic regression is a useful procedure with advantages that include
   (i) a single maximization of the joint probability distribution of the
   bivariate binary responses, and (ii) modelling the odds ratio describing
   the pairwise association between the two binary responses in relation to
   several covariates. In addition, since the form of the joint
   distribution of the bivariate binary responses is assumed known,
   parameters for the regression model can be estimated by the method of
   maximum likelihood. Hence, statistical inferences may be based on
   likelihood ratio tests and profile likelihood confidence intervals. We
   apply bivariate logistic regression to a perinatal database comprising
   924 twin foetuses resulting from 462 pregnancies to model obstetric and
   clinical risk factors for the association of small for gestational age
   births in twin gestations. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Context Many studies have documented race and gender differences in
   health care received by patients. However, few studies have related
   differences in the quality of interpersonal care to patient and
   physician race and gender.
   Objective To describe how the race/ethnicity and gender of patients and
   physicians are associated with physicians' participatory decision-making
   (PDM) styles.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Telephone survey conducted between
   November 1996 and June 1998 of 1816 adults aged 18 to 65 years (mean
   age, 41 years) who had recently attended 1 of 32 primary care practices
   associated with a large mixed-model managed care organization in an
   urban setting. Sixty-six percent of patients surveyed were female, 43%
   were white, and 45% were African American. The physician sample (n = 64)
   was 63% male, with 56% white, and 25% African American.
   Main Outcome Measure Patients' ratings of their physicians' PDM style on
   a 100-point scale.
   Results African American patients rated their visits as significantly
   less participatory than whites in models adjusting for patient age,
   gender, education, marital status, health status, and length of the
   patient-physician relationship (mean [SE] PDM score, 58.0 [1.2] vs 60.6
   [3.3]; P=.03). Ratings of minority and white physicians did not differ
   with respect to PDM style (adjusted mean [SE] PDM score for African
   Americans, 59.2 [1.7] vs whiles, 61.7 [3.1]; P =.13). Patients in
   race-concordant relationships with their physicians rated their visits
   as significantly more participatory than patients in race-discordant
   relationships (difference [SEI, 2.6 [1.1]; P=.02), Patients of female
   physicians had more participatory visits (adjusted mean [SE] PDM score
   for female, 62.4 [1.3] vs male, 59.5 [3.1]; P=.03), but gender
   concordance between physicians and patients was not significantly
   related to PDM score (unadjusted mean [SEI PDM score, 76.0 [1.0] for
   concordant vs 74.5 [0.9] for discordant; P =.12). Patient satisfaction
   was highly associated with PDM score within all race/ethnicity groups.
   Conclusions Our data suggest that African American patients rate their
   visits with physicians as less participatory than whites. However,
   patients seeing physicians of their own race rate their physicians'
   decision-making styles as more participatory. Improving crosscultural
   communication between primary care physicians and patients and providing
   patients with access to a diverse group of physicians may lead to more
   patient involvement in care, higher levels of patient satisfaction, and
   better health outcomes.

AB Background: Social engagement, which is defined as the maintenance of
   many social connections and a high level of participation in social
   activities, has been thought to prevent cognitive decline in elderly
   persons. However, few longitudinal studies of this relation have been
   done.
   Objective: To determine the relation between social disengagement and
   incident cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly persons.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: New Haven, Connecticut.
   Participants: 2812 noninstitutionalized elderly persons (65 years of age
   or older) who were interviewed in their homes in 1982, 1985, 1988, and
   1994.
   Measurements: A global social disengagement scale was constructed from
   the following indicators: presence of a spouse, monthly visual contact
   with three or more relatives or friends, yearly nonvisual contact with
   10 or more relatives or friends, attendance at religious services, group
   membership, and regular social activities. Cognitive function was
   assessed with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire. Response
   to the questionnaire was scored as high, medium, or low. Cognitive
   decline was defined as a transition to a lower category.
   Results: Compared with persons who had five or six social ties, those
   who had no social ties were at increased risk for incident cognitive
   decline after adjustment for age, initial cognitive performance, sex,
   ethnicity, education, income, housing type, physical disability,
   cardiovascular profile, sensory impairment, symptoms of depression,
   smoking, alcohol use, and level of physical activity. The 3-year odds
   ratio was 2.24 (95% CI, 1.40 to 3.58; P < 0.001), the 6-year odds ratio
   was 1.91 (CI, 1.14 to 3.18; P = 0.01), and the 12-year odds ratio was
   2.37 (CI, 1.07 to 4.88; P = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Social disengagement is a risk factor for cognitive
   impairment among elderly persons.

AB Suicide by burning and other forms of self-injurious behaviors which
   involve burning are sometimes considered to have religious overtones.
   The ritual death of widows upon their husband's funeral pyre is closely
   associated with Hindu beliefs. Buddhists have used self-immolation as a
   form of protest. The Judaeo-Christian traditions have imagery of fire as
   cleansing and purifying; there is also secular imagery associating fin
   with images of condemnation and evil. Previous studies have described
   religiosity as a common theme among survivors. The present study
   describes the ways in which persons who inflicted self-injurious
   behaviors through burning, including attempted suicide, imagine the
   Divinity and use religious language to give meaning to their experience.

AB This article reviews and critiques the existing empirical literature
   examining interpersonal violence in lesbian and gay relationships.
   Studies assessing psychological, physical, and nonconsenting sexual
   forms of violence in intimate, same-sex relationships are reviewed, and
   their findings are integrated with what is known about partner abuse in
   heterosexual relationships. Nineteen studies are described and
   categorized according to the specific questions being addressed. This
   body of literature suggests that prevalence rates of same-sec partner
   abuse are high and its correlates show many similarities to those
   identified in incidents of heterosexual partner abuse. This article
   addresses the need for substantially increased efforts in this field of
   study in terms of well-controlled and theory-driven research design. In
   terms of other implications of this body of body of literature, the high
   prevalence rate of partner abuse among lesbian and gay populations needs
   to be recognized by providers of both physical and mental health
   services who potentially treat victims, so that they can more accurately
   identify appropriate interventions. More research is warranted, not only
   in the general area of lesbian and gay partner abuse, but in examining
   various treatment modalities and their effectiveness in helping
   perpetrators to end the cycle of violence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

   Drawing from the alcohol and anxiety literature, the relationship
   between social anxiety and heavy drinking in college students is
   examined. Findings indicate a clear relationship, between social anxiety
   and drinking that may be moderated by alcohol expectancies and
   self-efficacy beliefs specific to socially anxious situations. A social
   cognitive model is proposed to guide future research and intervention
   efforts. A better understanding of college students' reasons for

AB The three major theoretical perspectives on the maintenance and
   persistence of depression in the psychological literature are reviewed.
   Cognitive theorists, such as Teasdale and Nolen-Hoeksema, focus on how a
   reciprocal relationship between depressed mood and the individual's
   processing of; and response to, their symptoms maintains and prolongs
   the duration of depressive episodes. interpersonal theorists, such as
   Lewinsohn and Coyne, hypothpsize that the depressed person's
   interpersonal behavior elicits negative reactions from the social
   environment, leading to a downward spiral of persistent depression.
   Finally, recent studies have indicated that individuals who experienced
   childhood adversity are more susceptible to a chronic course of
   depression. Although these three perspectives vary somewhat in the
   degree of support they have accumulated each exhibits some promise for
   helping to elucidate the maintenance and persistence of depression.
   However, much of the available empirical literature suffers from a
   number of critical limitations, including the lack of clinical samples,
   longitudinal studies, and adequate attention to confounding variables,
   such as the severity and duration of depression at baseline and comorbid
   psychopathology. We conclude by suggesting a number of ways in which
   cognitive and interpersonal factors and early adversity may interact to
   maintain and prolong depressive episodes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in relations among
   psychological trauma, dissociative phenomena, and various forms of
   trauma-related distress that has spawned a prolific amount of research.
   To date, a relatively comprehensive review of this recent research is
   lacking. Thus, this paper provides such a review to help summarize and
   synthesize recent findings, illuminate study limitations, and offer
   suggestions for future research. In general, findings have revealed
   fairly strong and consistent relations among the constructs of trauma,
   dissociation, and trauma-related distress (e.g., posttraumatic stress
   disorder, borderline personality disorder, bulimia); individuals who
   have experienced a traumatic event are more likely to dissociate than
   individuals who have not, and individuals who experience more
   dissociative phenomena are more likely to also experience higher levels
   of trauma-related distress. It is theorized here that dissociative
   phenomena and subsequent trauma-related distress may relate to fears
   about death and fears about loss or lack of control above and beyond the
   occurrence of the traumatic event itself Such fears about death and
   loss/lack of control may also help differentiate traumatized individuals
   who psychologically suffer to varying degrees. Possible functions of
   dissociation in response to trauma and in relation to forms of
   trauma-related distress are considered and discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier

AB Ironically, as many Western scholars have turned to constructivist
   theories to explain new ethnic movements and forms of identity politics,
   the subjects of their studies have begun to embrace a form of
   essentialism to justify their political legitimacy. This article
   presents a critical rethinking of constructivist and essentialist
   approaches to identity formation and maintenance. Drawing upon Maya
   ethnotheoretical models of identity, I introduce the analytic concept of
   cultural logic-generative principles realized through cognitive schemas
   that promote intersubjective continuity and are conditioned by the
   unique contingencies of life histories and structural positions in
   political-economic systems. I show how the concept of metaphysical
   balance in Maya cosmology illuminates the working of a uniquely Maya
   cultural logic, and I find in Maya cognitive models of the heart and

AB After 100 years of measurement, reasons for interindividual and

   intraindividual variation. Variability in kidney function? extracellular
   sodium and potassium (Na:K) balance, and factors affecting water,
   sodium, and potassium resorption obviously affect blood pressure.
   Alterations in these and additional factors predict development of
   hypertension. In recent decades the molecular revolution has increased
   scrutiny of genetic factors contributing to interindividual and
   populational differences in blood pressure and hypertension. Most
   investigations across populations and environments have focused on
   components of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system. DNA
   polymorphisms within this system clearly are associated with blood
   pressure and hypertension; however, these associations tend to vary
   across race and ethnicity, ecological settings, and sex. There is clear
   evidence that polymorphisms at the renin, angiotensinogen, and
   angiotensin-converting enzyme loci influence both blood pressure and
   hypertension. In addition, evidence suggests gene-gene and
   gene-environment interactions along with sex-specific actions of these
   loci on blood pressure.

AB The relationship of body mass and body fat distribution to blood
   pressure has been recognized for many years. This relationship has
   formed the basis for much additional research, including the impact of
   growth and developmental factors on blood pressure levels. Blood
   pressure in children is related to somatic growth and is tied to
   increases in height, skeletal maturation, and sexual maturation. Sexual
   and ethnic differences in blood pressure levels are already apparent
   during childhood and may also be related to the process of growth and
   sexual maturity. Body size exerts a profound influence on a variety of
   physiological functions, including blood pressure and the onset of
   sexual maturity. In general, studies have reported a strong linear
   relationship between height and blood pressure and between body mass and
   blood pressure such that tracking correlations from childhood to
   adulthood for both blood pressure and body mass index are significant
   for most sex and ethnic groups. Studies evaluating the effects of
   hormone replacement therapy on postmenopausal women have thus far
   generated results suggesting that the age-related rise of blood pressure
   is not due directly to hormonal changes associated with menopause. The
   interrelated effects of growth, maturation, body weight, and body fat
   are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Environmental
   influences may modify relationships established much earlier, perhaps as
   early as prenatally, during infancy, or during early childhood.
   Directions for future research and implications resulting from the
   complex relationship between body weight and blood pressure are
   discussed.

AB Studies in traditional, nonindustrialized countries have shown that

   incremental age-related increases in blood pressure throughout adulthood
   are common in industrialized countries. This observation has influenced
   a statement by the 1997 Sixth Report of the Joint National Committee on
   Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
   that a major future challenge is to "prevent the rise of blood pressure
   with age." The methods of preventing age-related blood pressure
   increases are not specified in the report. Anthropological surveys of
   populations with little or no change in blood pressure with age are
   difficult to replicate and verify, leaving future researchers the task
   of developing prevention strategies primarily based on studies of
   populations in which blood pressure increases with age. Here, I review
   blood pressure surveys used from 1954 to 1998 that have been used in the
   literature as examples of blood pressure and age research. This review
   reveals some of the difficulties in clearly defining the exact
   relationship between blood pressure and age and some of the problems in
   the development of methods to prevent age-related blood pressure

   Local exposure of the extremities to severe cold occasions significant

PY 1999
AB The relationship between modernization and blood pressure has been
   formally examined in anthropology for some 3 decades. A prominent
   hypothesis to account for the increase in blood pressure in more
   modernized (or economically developed) communities is the stressful
   nature of cultural and social change, Research has progressed from
   hypothesizing that culture change is stressful to trying to
   operationalize theoretical models of what it is about culture change
   that is stressful and in turn relating those more precise variables to
   blood pressure variability within and between communities. Here, I
   selectively review the literature on modernization and blood pressure,
   especially the research literature that explicitly uses models of the
   stress process to guide that research. The most interesting results have
   been obtained when the use of the stress model has been informed by
   careful ethnographic work. This has enabled researchers to adapt models
   of the stress process to be culturally appropriate in local populations.
   In addition, incorporating an explicit model of culture, especially one
   that is sensitive to intracultural diversity, has led to new hypotheses
   regarding the modification of the effects of stressors by social and
   cultural context. I conclude with a discussion of recent innovations in
   ethnographic methods, specifically the cultural consensus model, and the
   use of those methods in operationalizing relevant variables in
   culturally appropriate and sensitive ways, The utility of combining
   these methods in the study of modernization and blood pressure is
   illustrated by recent research in Brazil.

PD AUG 1999
PY 1999
AB Blood pressure regulation is a complex, dynamic process influenced by
   psychosocial, behavioral, and cultural factors. Integrative theories of
   cross-population differences in the prevalence of hypertension and
   response to treatment include physiological, social, and genetic
   perspectives. Ethnic differences in salt sensitivity, calcium regulation
   of sodium flux, vascular reactivity to psychosocial stress, and drug
   metabolism are integral components of observed cross-cultural variations
   in hypertension. In general, pharmacological treatment of hypertension
   in blacks is most consistently achieved through diuretics and
   calcium-channel blockers; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and
   beta-blockers are more efficacious in whites. These stereotypical
   patterns are consistent with the higher prevalence of salt sensitivity,
   stress-induced vasoconstriction and slower natriuresis, and
   cr-adrenergic receptor mediated vascular reactivity observed in blacks
   compared with whites, Some antihypertensive agents produce adverse
   glucose metabolic side effects, thus contraindicating their use in
   individuals with high sympathetic tone, insulin resistance, or obesity.
   Cross-population differences in adopted guidelines for treating
   hypertension exist but are not likely a factor in observed ethnic
   differences in rate of treatment or control. Attitudes toward
   nontraditional treatment options (e.g., herbal medicine), political and
   individual responsibilities in health care, and adaptations to
   acculturation and urbanization stress differ between and within
   societies and thus play a role in observed cross-cultural differences in
   hypertension as well. The value of regular exercise in controlling
   hypertension is widely recognized, and reductions in blood pressure
   reactivity to behavioral stress following acute exercise have been
   documented; however, empirical studies of ethnic differences in
   exercise-related blood pressure control are lacking. Overall, increased
   awareness of the multifactorial nature of hypertension by both the
   physician and the patient will facilitate treatment of this disease on
   an individual basis.

AB Studies of migrants and comparisons of rural versus urban communities
   are potentially informative study designs because they al low
   examination of genetically similar population subgroups exposed to
   diverse environmental conditions. These designs have been underused in
   Africa, where recent urbanization has created many situations in which
   nearby communities of common ethnicity and culture live under different
   social and economic circumstances. The International Study of
   Hypertension in Blacks (ICSHIB) conducted several overlapping surveys in
   Nigeria starting in 1993. These surveys were based primarily in the
   rural village of Idere and the urban community of Idikan, both inhabited
   by people defined ethnically as Oyo Yoruba and sharing a common language
   and culture. Survey teams collected standardized blood pressure and
   anthropometric measurements, and some study participants provided 24-hr
   urine samples and questionnaire data on psychosocial stress and social
   integration. Rural and urban groups differed substantially in blood
   pressure and related characteristics. Age-adjusted prevalence of
   hypertension (blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for
   participants aged 25 years and older was 7-8% in Idere and 24-27% in
   Idikan, The distributions of overweight, sodium/potassium ratio,
   perceived stress, and social integration scores all contributed to lower
   hypertension risk in Idere. The effects and interactions of these
   identified risk factors remain poorly understood, even among people who
   share a common genetic background, similar diet, and many other
   lifestyle features. Nonetheless, the rural-urban distinction is
   sufficiently salient to engender a nearly threefold difference in
   hypertension prevalence. This disparity in disease prevalence
   demonstrates the sensitivity of human beings to the environmental
   determinants of disease and provides a sobering example of the
   difficulty in identifying subtle genetic effects, which can be easily
   overwhelmed by small differences in environmental exposures.

   populations, the discovery of polymorphic blood proteins that appear to
   be linked to hypertension susceptibility, and the slavery hypothesis of
   natural selection favoring a salt-conserving physiology in ancestral

   cultural-exert strong influences on blood pressure levels and
   hypertension etiology in the Caribbean. Salt intake and other dietary
   behaviors, degree of community awareness of the disease, and
   differential treatment modalities are related to hypertension
   epidemiology in indigenous and migrant Caribbean populations. The
   traditional use of medicinal plants, historically successful in part
   because of the beneficial bioactivity of many antihypertensive

AB The difference between a population's numbers of births and deaths,
   usually an excess of births, is natural increase or reproductive change.
   In Pennsylvania, a growing number of counties has reported natural
   decrease in the 1980s and 1990s. The contributors to the large and
   growing aged population in the Commonwealth could be inmigration of
   retirees or a residual elderly cohort whose relative size is the product
   of out-migration over many decades of younger adults seeking employment
   elsewhere. Such out-migration removes not only those who actually leave
   but compounds it through the loss of their future offspring. After
   reviewing recent components of population change and identifying the
   counties reporting natural decrease, the causes and consequences of
   deaths exceeding births are discussed. Where coal was mined, the
   residual aged group contributes to a high death rate, made relatively
   larger by the often low collective fertility of the modest numbers of
   younger adults who remained. By contrast, the counties with areas on the
   fast-growing sections of the Poconos have large aged groups because of
   increasing in-migration of retirees, often second-home owners at the
   time of retirement. Among other findings, in-migration occurred in
   several anthracite counties, those marked by deaths in excess of births.
   The recent in-migration represents a major turnaround for these counties
   where losses were the rule for over half a century. Furthermore, there
   seems to be age-selective in-migration by retirees, some of whom may be
   return migrants.

   Methods. This study analyzed 5 years of data from the National Health
   Interview Survey (1990-1994) on current smoking and regional variation
   among 16,738 African Americans.
   Results. Respondents in the West had the lowest unadjusted smoking
   prevalence rates and Midwest residents had the highest. Current smoking
   was lower among African Americans living in noncentral cities than in
   central cities even after adjusting for several sociodemographic
   covariates. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that
   black women in the South were significantly less likely to be smokers
   compared with any other gender/region group.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest the significance of gender and
   regional factors such as the social history of migration, social stress
   and racism, exposure to tobacco advertisement, variations in cultural
   influences, community structures, and coping strategies in understanding
   African American smoking behavior. (C) 1999 American Health Foundation

AB Rational choice theory and cultural sociology have often seemed to be
   radically at odds with one another. As the two traditions become more
   sophisticated, however, points of convergence are beginning to appear.
   It now seems possible to create a partial synthesis. Although rational
   choice theory has had very little to say about culture, we can conceive
   of symbolic process and structure through the framework of purposive
   action. Borrowing core concepts from James Coleman's Foundations of
   Social Theory, we can think of actors' interpretation and intention of
   meaning as the exercise of control over symbolic resources. Actors have
   means- and ends-interests in symbolism. From the intersection of this
   interested control emerge cultural structures that are real conditions
   of interaction. Identifying these cultural structures and tracing the
   process of their emergence is one way to conceive the project of
   cultural sociology. In addition to conceptual clarity such a synthesis
   provides the orienting principle of a social optimum.

   sociology can be conducive to establishing a unifying paradigm and
   method to be given 'paradigmatic privilege' within sociology. The
   outcome of such an extension of the economic approach has been
   'sociological rational choice theory' or 'rational action theory for
   sociology'. Within sociology, such a rational choice model is regarded
   as a major theoretical or/and methodological innovation and thus a 'new'
   promise for sociology's unification. Overall, the paper suggests that
   these 'ecumenistic' claims of rational choice theorists cannot be taken
   at face value since they are predicated upon dubious views of the
   relations between economy and society and between economics and
   sociology, including inadequate interpretations of neoclassical
   economics.

AB To examine the association between lead exposure and both individual and
   geographic area indicators of socioeconomic position, the authors
   measured tibia lead concentration, a biomarker of cumulative lead
   exposure, using K x-ray fluorescence in a cross-sectional survey of 538
   white males aged 50-92 years who were healthy when enrolled in the
   Normative Aging Study (Boston, Massachusetts) in the 1960s. Data on
   individual risk factors, education, occupation, and income were
   collected by questionnaire. Using subjects' residential addresses at the
   time of the tibia lead measurements, the authors obtained geographic
   area-specific measures of education, social class, and poverty by
   linking records to 1990 US Census block group data. In multivariate
   linear regression analysis controlling for age and cumulative smoking,
   tibia lead concentrations were 10.39 mu g/g (95% confidence interval
   (CI) 7.80-12.97) higher in men who did not graduate from high school
   than in men with greater than or equal to 4 years of college. Among the
   former men (non-high school graduates), living in an undereducated area
   was associated with a 9.28 mu g/g (95% CI 1.59-16.97) increase in tibia
   lead level compared with living in a non-undereducated area; among the
   latter men (college graduates), no difference existed by residential
   area education (beta = 0.72, 95% CI -5.35 to 6.78). The authors conclude
   that the influence of individual socioeconomic position on cumulative
   lead exposure is modified by geographic area conditions.

AB The emergence of language was a defining moment in the evolution of
   modern humans. It was an innovation that changed radically the character
   of human society. Here, we provide an approach to language evolution
   based on evolutionary game theory. We explore the ways in which
   protolanguages can evolve in a nonlinguistic society and how specific
   signals can become associated with specific objects. We assume that
   early in the evolution of language, errors in signaling and perception
   would be common. We model the probability of misunderstanding a signal
   and show that this limits the number of objects that can be described by
   a proto language. This "error limit" is not overcome by employing more
   sounds but by combining a small set of more easily distinguishable
   sounds into words. The process of "word formation" enables a language to
   encode an essentially unlimited number of objects. Next, we analyze how
   words can be combined into sentences and specify the conditions for the
   evolution of very simple grammatical rules. We argue that grammar
   originated as a simplified rule system that evolved by natural selection
   to reduce mistakes in communication. Our theory provides a systematic
   approach for thinking about the origin and evolution of human language.

AB Background: Major life transitions (e.g., graduation from high school)
   are times when many changes occur in a person's social and physical
   environment. Men and women likely experience aspects of these changes
   differently. As a result, health-related behaviors likely change at
   these times with possible differences in these changes by gender.
   Methods: Gender differences in the performance of chronic disease
   risk-related behaviors (fruit, juice, and vegetable intake; physical
   activity; tobacco and alcohol use; and sexual practices) through the
   transition out of high school (HS) were assessed in a secondary analysis
   of a nationally representative sample from the 1992 National Health
   Interview Survey-Youth Risk Behavior Survey. The sun ey was completed by
   5881 young people aged 14 to 21 years. Regression discontinuity analysis
   with piecewise regression was performed.
   Results: Statistically significant gender by transition effects were
   obtained for exercise/physical activity (decreases at the transition
   point for males), snuff use (decrease for females in HS), binge drinking
   and number of days drinking alcohol (increases for males at the
   transition point), and use of alcohol or drugs before sexual intercourse
   (decrease for females post IIS). Fruit intake decreased for males and
   females and daily and heavy cigarette smoking increased during the HS
   years. Effect sizes were small but promising, given that the data set
   was not designed to test this hypothesis.
   Conclusion: These data offer evidence of differences by gender in
   chronic disease risk behaviors through the HS transition. Longitudinal
   studies are needed to assess the true nature of these differences, the
   tracking of these risk behaviors and their personal, social, and
   environmental determinants, including gender-specific determinants, that
   may explain these changes and inform future intervention development.

AB Purpose: Most research on preventive health behaviors has focused on
   individual rather than groups of behaviors. This study examined
   interrelationships among multiple preventive health behaviors in
   different age and gender groups.
   Methods: From 1990 to 1992, Maryland residents were surveyed by
   telephone through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The
   study sample of 4455 was divided into 8 groups based on age (18-24,
   25-39, 40-54, and 55+) and gender. Correlation and oblique rotated
   factor analyses were used to examine patterns of 8 to II preventive
   health behaviors in each age-gender group.
   Results: Medical checkup and cholesterol test formed one behavioral
   duster in the four male age groups. Breast and cervical cancer screening
   (mammogram, clinical breast examination [CBE], and Pap Smear) did not
   form one cluster until age 55 or older; Pap smear, CBE formed one
   cluster for women of all ages. Risk-taking behaviors were only prominent
   in the youngest age group: Seatbelt non-use, smoking, and drinking
   formed one cluster in younger males, and drinking and driving after
   drinking clustered in younger females.
   Conclusion: Screening and risk-taking behaviors form distinct groups,
   and behavioral patterns differ by age and gender. Public health programs
   should consider multi-behavioral approaches, and be sensitive to the
   gender and age of the target population.

AB We review progress made in ascertaining a twin sample by computerized
   record matching. A tar get sample of 1856 female like-sex twin pairs
   born 1975-1983, and believed to be both still living, was identified
   from state birth records. In 30 months, during 1995-1997, contact with
   86% of families was established, although the success rate was lower for
   minority (principally African-American) families (74%). An estimated 15%
   of school-aged twin pairs were discordant either for school grade level
   or for school attendance and would have been missed in any school-based
   ascertainment scheme. Equal proportions of majority and minority
   families were living in state at the time they were traced (85.6 versus
   85.3%). Using a conservative adjustment for the reduced probability of
   finding out-of-state ("mobile") families, we project that 80% of
   families were still living in the state where the twins were born.
   Mobile families on average had better-educated parents, had higher
   incomes, and were more likely to remain two-parent families but did not
   differ in rates of parental psychopathology (alcoholism or depression).
   Hard-to-find families-those in which time to completion of a
   first-contact interview was greater than the 90th percentile-were more
   likely to be African-American, to have an alcoholic biologic father, to
   be living out of state, and to be larger and poorer. Adjusting for
   undersampling of out-of-state residents had little impact on conclusions
   about genetic and environmental contributions to offspring risk of
   behavioral problems, as assessed by parental ratings of the twins'
   oppositional symptoms and school grades.

AB Objective: Motivational models of alcohol consumption suggest a positive
   relationship between reasons for drinking and the amount of alcohol
   consumed. The present study examined race, gender, and age as moderators
   of the relationship between social and coping motives and alcohol misuse
   in black and white adolescents. Method: A representative population
   sample (N = 699) of male and female (54%) adolescents between the ages
   of 13 and 16 was recruited using a random-digit-dial telephone
   procedure. Six face-to-face interviews with subjects and their families
   were carried out at approximately yearly intervals. Information gathered
   assessed alcohol use, social and coping motives for drinking, and
   psychological distress. Results: Multiple analyses, including both
   cross-sectional and longitudinal logistic regression analyses and
   survival analysis were used to examine the relationship of drinking
   motives to adolescent alcohol misuse. Contrary to our predictions,
   social motive was a somewhat better predictor of alcohol misuse than was
   coping motive, particularly during mid- to late adolescence. However,
   there was some limited evidence of a significant relationship between
   coping motives and alcohol misuse in the mid-adolescent age group. Some
   support was found for racial differences such that social motives are
   better predictors of alcohol misuse among whites than among blacks and
   coping motives are better predictors among blacks. Few gender
   differences were found in the relationship of drinking motives and
   alcohol misuse. Conclusions: These findings suggest a stronger tendency
   for social and coping motives to influence alcohol misuse during mid to
   late than in early adolescence. Research examining the development of
   motives and the mechanisms by which they influence drinking behavior is
   needed.

   consisted of the Structured Clinical Inventory for DSM-III-R-Patient
   edition (SCID-II), Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and the Millon
   Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II (MCMI-II). Clinically significant
   scores on the MCMI-II antisocial and borderline personality scales were
   noted in this study. This study Sound women with histories of delinquent
   and/or criminal behavior before drug use were more likely to have used
   more types of drugs and have used multiple drugs together. These women
   also tended to have had a history of being abused, either emotionally,
   physically, or sexually. This group was also less successful on all
   outcome measures during 6-month follow-up. Moreover, the lifetime
   incidence of emotional, physical, and sexual abuse reported for this
   group at the baseline assessment was high-57.1% emotional abuse, 48.9%
   physical abuse, and 39.7% sexual abuse. These results are consistent
   with the research literature that indicates abuse plays a central role
   in the development and chronic effect of personality disorders and, in
   particular, posttraumatic stress disorder. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

AB Objective. The rate and determinants of tobacco prevention and cessation
   counseling to youth were examined for orthodontists participating in a
   controlled trial to decrease the incidence of tobacco use among
   adolescents.
   Methods. A cross-sectional interview design in private practice offices
   throughout Southern California was used. The survey was completed with
   126 (82%) orthodontists. Clinicians randomly assigned to the
   experimental group (N = 77) received a 1.5 h workshop, anti-tobacco
   materials, reimbursement for provision of anti-tobacco prescriptions,
   and quarterly checkup visits. Control group clinicians (N = 77) did not
   receive training, materials, or visits.
   Results. Experimental group clinicians talked to more adolescent
   nonsmokers about never beginning tobacco use than did control group
   clinicians (P < 0.05). Experimental group clinicians talked to more
   adolescent tobacco users than did control group clinicians; however, the
   difference was not statistically significant. Content and determinants
   of counseling were affected by participation in the intervention.
   Conclusions. Though training and support increased prevention and
   cessation counseling, absolute rates remained less than optimal. Social
   learning factors were associated with prevention and cessation
   counseling. (C) 1999 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

AB As rational choice theory has moved from economics into political
   science and sociology, it has been dramatically transformed. The
   intellectual diffusion of agency theory illustrates this process. Agency
   theory is a general model of social relations involving the delegation
   of authority, and generally resulting in problems of control, which has
   been applied to a broad range of substantive contexts. This paper
   analyzes applications of agency theory to state policy implementation in
   economics, political science, and sociology. After documenting
   variations in the theory across disciplinary contexts, the strengths and
   weaknesses of these different varieties of agency theory are assessed.
   Sociological versions of agency theory incorporating both broader
   microfoundations and richer models of social structure, are in many
   respects the most promising. This type of agency theory illustrates the
   potential of art emerging sociological version of rational choice
   theory.

AB Moldin et al. (1) have identified a cluster of Minnesota Multiphasic
   Personality Inventory (MMPI) scales that discriminate adolescents at
   risk for schizophrenia from those not at. risk. The present study
   examines how well Moldin's scales predict schizophrenic decompensation
   in a sample of 207 Danish adolescents at high genetic risk for
   schizophrenia. Subjects were assessed using a modified, 304-item MMPI in
   1962 (mean age = 15.1 years) and diagnosed in 10-year and 25-year
   follow-ups. Premorbidly, schizophrenic subjects (n=31) scored higher
   than subjects with no mental illness on the frequency (F) and
   psychoticism (PSY) scales. When paranoid and nonparanoid
   preschizophrenics were separated, three scales (F, Pz (paranoid
   schizophrenia) and PSY) significantly discriminated paranoid
   preschizophrenics. Discriminant function analyses confirmed these
   results. It is concluded that the MMPI may be useful for identifying
   schizophrenia premorbidly.

AB Although numerous studies of people living with HIV have focused on
   positive social support, researchers have directed surprisingly little
   attention to the nature and effects of negative social interactions in
   this population. Based on data from a diverse sample of people with HIV
   (N = 271), we conducted a factor analysis to develop the HIV version of
   the Unsupportive Social Interactions Inventory (USII). Four types of
   unsupportive or upsetting responses that an HIV-positive person might
   receive from others were identified: insensitivity, disconnecting,
   forced optimism and blaming. In analyses with a sub-sample of 96 people
   with HIV, unsupportive social interactions were only moderately
   correlated with social support, suggesting that these constructs are
   relatively independent. Using hierarchical regression analysis, we found
   that unsupportive social interactions predicted a significant amount of
   the variance in depression, beyond the variance accounted for by
   physical functioning and positive social support. Partial correlations
   indicated that the relationship between unsupportive social interactions
   and depression was not an artifact of trait negative affectivity.
   Favourable evidence of the USII's reliability and validity suggests that
   the instrument provides a useful tool for assessing unsupportive social
   interactions experienced by people with HIV; Practical implications of
   the findings and directions for future research are discussed.

   Comparisons with reference growth curves derived from American samples
   suggest that pastoral Datoga children grow poorly in this region. Body
   compositional changes with age differed markedly from the reference
   population. There were negligible fat gains through childhood, even
   among females. Comparison with data on other East African pastoralists
   showed that population growth performance is intermediate between that
   of nomadic and settled pastoralists. Little catch-up growth occurs
   during childhood, and adolescence appears to be delayed among males. The
   results contribute to the growing database on health indicators for
   African pastoralists and suggest a need for further research to
   investigate mechanisms for growth stunting in these populations. (C)

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to ascertain the degree of
   underutilization of services for mental health problems among urban and
   rural Mexican American adults. Method: A probability sample (N=3,012)
   was used to represent the Mexican American population of Fresno County,
   California, and face-to-face interviews were conducted with the use of
   the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Bivariate and
   multivariate analyses were used to analyze the data on diagnosis and
   service utilization. Results: Among the respondents with
   DSM-lll-R-defined disorders, only about one-fourth had used a single
   service or a combination of services in the past 12 months, and Mexican
   immigrants had a utilization rate which was only two-fifths of that of
   Mexican Americans born in the United States. Overall use of mental
   health care providers by persons with diagnosed mental disorders was
   8.8%, use of providers in the general medical sector was 18.4%, use of
   other professionals was 12.7%, and use of informal providers was only
   3.1%. According to logistic regression analyses, factors associated with
   utilization of mental health services included female sex, higher
   educational attainment, unemployment, and comorbidity. Conclusions:
   Immigrants are unlikely to use mental health services, even when they
   have a recent disorder, but may use general practitioners, which raises
   questions about the appropriateness, accessibility, and
   cost-effectiveness of mental health care for this population. Several
   competing hypotheses about the reasons for low utilization of services
   need to be examined in future research.

AB Objectives. This study sought, first, to explain and reconcile the
   provocation and inhibition theories of the effect of rising unemployment
   on the incidence of antisocial behavior. Second, it tested the
   hypothesis, implied by the provocation and inhibition theories, that the
   relationship between unemployment and foster home placements forms an
   inverted "U."
   Methods. The hypothesis was tested with data from California for 137
   months beginning in February 1984;
   Results. Findings showed that the hypothesis was supported.
   Conclusions. Rising joblessness increases the incidence of foster home
   placements among families that lose jobs or income. Levels of
   joblessness that threaten workers who remain employed, however, inhibit
   antisocial behavior and reduce the incidence of foster home placements.
   This means that accounting for the social costs of unemployment is more
   complicated than assumed under the provocation theory.

AB Southeast Asian women have higher invasive cervical cancer incidence

   Cambodian residents of Seattle were surveyed in person during late 1997
   and early 1998, The PRECEDE model was used to guide the development of
   items that assessed predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors
   associated with cervical cancer screening participation. The estimated
   overall survey response was 72%, Four hundred thirteen women completed
   our questionnaire. Approximately one-quarter (24%) of the respondents
   had never had a Pap test, and over one-half (53%) had not been screened
   recently. The following variables were positively associated with a
   history of at least one Pap smear: younger age, greater number of years
   since immigration, belief about Pap testing for postmenopausal women,
   prenatal care in the United States, and physician recommendation. Women
   who believed in karma were less likely to have ever been screened for
   cervical cancer than those who did not. Six variables independently
   predicted recent screening: age; beliefs about regular checkups,
   cervical cancer screening for sexually inactive women, and the
   prolongation of life; having a female doctor; and a previous physician
   recommendation for Pap testing. The study findings indicate that
   culturally specific approaches might be effective in modifying the
   cervical cancer screening behavior of immigrant women, Programs
   targeting Cambodian-Americans are likely to be more effective if they
   are multifaceted and simultaneously address predisposing, reinforcing,
   and enabling factors.

AB Drawing upon a nationally representative survey sample of African

   suspected causal association between dropping out of school and the
   occurrence of injecting drug use (IDU), which remains a major cause of
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission in this population. The
   data are from public use files of the National Household Surveys on Drug
   Abuse (NHSDA) conducted between 1991 and 1995. From within the NHSDA's
   nationally representative sample of adult household residents, a total
   of 389 AA adults with a history of IDU were matched on neighborhood of
   residence with 2253 AA adults with no history of IDU. The conditional
   form of multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the relative
   risk of having injected a drug for school dropouts relative to a
   reference category of AA who received the high school diploma but did
   not go to college. AAs who dropped out of high school were an estimated
   two times more likely to have injected drugs. With statistical
   adjustment for age, sex, and Hispanic background, the estimated
   association was 1.9 (95% confidence interval (C.I.)= 1.3-2.6, P <
   0.001). Contrary to our advance hypothesis, earning the graduate
   equivalency certificate (GED) did not seem to affect the magnitude of
   excess risk for having started IDU (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.3, 95%
   C.I. = 1.4-3.8, P < 0.001). Hence, school dropout prevention might
   reduce the risk of IDU per se, in addition to the many other general
   benefits of educational attainment. The issue of GED-associated reduced
   risk of IDU remains open for future study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

AB Purpose: To identify family interactions associated with psychosocial
   outcome of epilepsy surgery, to design interventions to improve patient
   outcome.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, case series study of relations among
   observed family behavior and psychosocial outcome of 43 patients after
   temporal lobectomy. Videotaped family behavior during family discussion
   tasks was rated for predominant family affect, affective range, and
   support of patient autonomy. Multiple regression analyses tested the
   relation of observed family characteristics to outcomes, controlling for
   seizure control and other psychological and disease characteristics.
   Results: Predominant family affect predicted patients' social adjustment
   independent of postoperative seizure status and other disease
   characteristics. The relation between predominant affect and social
   adjustment was stronger among patients with persisting complex partial
   seizures (CPSs; r = -0.91), versus patients with auras (r = -0.38) and
   seizure-free patients (r = -0.28; multiple R = 0.71; p < 0.05). Families
   with a positive affective climate supported patients' autonomy.
   Conclusions: Two potential targets were identified for family
   intervention to improve postsurgical social adjustment: (a) family
   interactions that support a predominantly positive affective climate,
   and (b) family interactions that support patient autonomy. These
   findings are consistent with findings in normal and other clinical
   populations. They identify specific interactions that give rise to
   positive versus negative affective climate and support versus
   undermining of autonomy. These results lay the groundwork for
   intervention studies targeting these specific family interactions. Such
   intervention studies would clarify the direction of effect of the
   observed relationships and would test the efficacy of family
   intervention for improving psychosocial outcomes for patients with
   epilepsy.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry, small deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry,
   is negatively correlated with health and positively correlated with
   sexual selection in human adults, but the accumulation, persistence, and
   fitness implications of asymmetries during childhood are largely
   unknown. Here, we introduce the Jamaican Symmetry Project, a long-term
   study of fluctuating asymmetry and its physical and behavioral
   correlates in rural Jamaican children. The project is based on an
   initial sample of 285 children (156 boys and 129 girls), aged 5 to 11
   years. We describe the design of the project and the methodology of
   measuring 10 paired morphometric traits. All traits except hand width
   showed fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetries of the legs tended
   to be related and were less than half as great as fluctuating
   asymmetries of the arms and ears. Therefore the legs may show high
   developmental stability resulting from selection for mechanical
   efficiency. A fluctuating asymmetry composite score revealed that boys
   have significantly lower fluctuating asymmetry than girls and that this
   effect resides mainly in the elbows. There were significant positive
   relationships between composite fluctuating asymmetry and age, height,
   and weight, but multiple regression analyses showed that age was
   negatively related to fluctuating asymmetry, whereas body size was
   positively correlated. These findings are compared with results from
   recent English studies.

AB Background There is little information about the impact of household
   structure and composition on elderly mortality in developing countries.
   This study examines the impact of relationship to head of household, and
   the presence of co-resident spouses and sons on elderly mortality in
   rural Bangladesh with a particular focus on age and gender differences.
   Methods A total of 9365 individuals aged greater than or equal to 60 at
   baseline (5128 males and 4237 females) in the Matlab Surveillance area
   in rural Bangladesh were followed for a period of 8 years (1974-1982)
   with all predictors (the presence of a spouse, one or more co-resident
   adult sons, relationship to head of household, household economic
   status, age and disability status) being measured at the beginning of
   follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were used in the analysis.
   Results Being the head of household had a significant impact on reducing
   elderly mortality for both men and women. The presence of a spouse
   reduced mortality for all elderly men but had a significant beneficial
   impact only on women whose husbands were heads of households. Finally
   the presence of one or more coresident adult sons reduced mortality for
   elderly women but not for elderly men. For all three of the above
   predictors there was a decline in effect with the age of the elderly.
   Conclusions Relationship to head of household and the presence of
   spouses and sons have powerful impacts on reducing mortality for elderly
   men and women in rural Bangladesh with the effects varying significantly
   by gender and age. Furthermore, individual rather than joint access to
   material resources is an important determinant of elderly mortality.

AB Study objective-To describe variation in levels and causes of excess
   mortality and temporal mortality change among young and middle aged
   adults in a regionally diverse set of poor local populations in the USA.
   Design-Using standard demographic techniques, death certificate and
   census data were analysed to make sex specific population level
   estimates of 1980 and 1990 death rates for residents of selected areas
   of concentrated poverty. For comparison, data for whites and blacks
   nationwide were analysed.
   Setting-African American communities in Harlem, Central City Detroit,
   Chicago's south side, the Louisiana Delta, the Black Belt region of
   Alabama, and Eastern North Carolina. Non-Hispanic white communities in
   Cleveland, Detroit, Appalachian Kentucky, South Central Louisiana,
   Northeastern Alabama, and Western North Carolina.
   Participants-All black residents or all white residents of each specific
   community and in the nation, 1979-1981 and 1989-1991.
   Main results-Substantial variability exists in levels, trends, and
   causes of excess mortality in poor populations across localities.
   African American residents of urban/northern communities suffer
   extremely high and growing rates of excess mortality. Rural residents
   exhibit an important mortality advantage that widens over the decade.
   Homicide deaths contribute little to the rise in excess mortality, nor
   do AIDS deaths contribute outside of specific localities. Deaths
   attributable to circulatory disease are the leading cause of excess
   mortality in most locations.
   Conclusions-Important differences exist among persistently impoverished
   populations in the degree to which their poverty translates into excess
   mortality. Social epidemiological inquiry and health promotion
   initiatives should be attentive to local conditions. The severely
   disadvantageous mortality profiles experienced by urban African
   Americans relative to the rural poor and to national averages call for
   understanding.

AB Objectives-While the unemployment rate of African-American people is
   more than twice that of the white population, the research on the impact
   of unemployment on the health of this population is scarce. This study
   analysed the impact of unemployment on depression and well being among
   African-American people, and the factors associated with well being.
   Methods-Logistic and multiple regression models were used to analyse
   panel data collected in the National Survey of Families and Households
   1987-1992. African-American (1369) and white (6660) respondents were
   analysed separately. Outcome variables included an index of depression
   and self reported health status.
   Main findings-Differences between employment and unemployment groups
   were less significant for African-Americans than for the white
   population in predicting depression and well being. Health enhancing
   factors such as education and wealth were significantly associated with
   better health and lower depression indices among the white population
   but not consistently so among African-Americans. Satisfaction with
   personal relationships was the-strongest predictor of well being for
   both groups.
   Conclusion-Research should focus on the special needs and circumstances
   of African-Americans, because protective factors may not have the same
   impact in different groups of the population.

AB 1999 marks the 50(th) anniversary of the publication of The American
   Soldier, a book in four volumes that has been called one of the most
   influential social science studies during this century and the beginning
   of empirical studies in military sociology. And yet, its actual
   empirical findings, about social relations between officers and enlisted
   personnel, Blacks and Whites, combat veterans and raw recruits, and many
   other topics, seem to be neglected in contemporary social science.
   We seek to celebrate its 50th anniversary by calling attention to more
   than twenty of its most influential, varied and provocative findings in
   hopes of encouraging more social scientists, in the U.S. and abroad, to
   build upon its monumental achievements.

AB The main purpose of this article is to place the disciplinary
   relationships between political sociology and political economy in a
   proper framework. Such an endeavor is prompted by some recent
   conflations between these two disciplines. The main of these conflations
   is the attempt to transform political sociology into the new political
   economy in the sense of the economic or rational choice approach to
   politics. In consequence, sociologists seem to be in a danger of losing
   political sociology to economists embarking on such attempts. The
   article reconsiders these attempts, by identifying and examining the
   theoretical-methodological differences between political sociology and
   the new political economy. These differences are illustrated by a
   comparative application of their approaches to specific political
   processes, such as U.S. presidential elections. Since there exists a
   certain gap in recognizing and investigating such differences in the
   current literature, the key contribution of this article is to help fill
   in this void.

AB E. Franklin Frazier is known almost exclusively for his scholarly
   contributions after the publication of his seminal book, The Negro
   Family in the United States. Less is known about Frazier's professional
   life and scholarly contributions during the period when he was Director
   of the Atlanta School of Social Work between 1922 and 1927. Frazier was
   part of that generation of black scholars who benefited from the fluid
   interfacing of sociology and social work characteristic of the early
   part of the 20th century. While director of the Atlanta School, Frazier
   made significant contributions to the knowledge base of social work and
   was one of the first to provide a "black perspective" to social work's
   knowledge base. To unearth and illuminate the early scholarly legacy of
   Frazier, this paper identifies and discusses some major themes of
   Frazier's writings while director of the Atlanta School of Social Work
   and examines their implications for contemporary social work issues. An
   underlying assumption of this paper is that Frazier's scholarly
   contributions during his tenure as director of the Atlanta School should
   be conceived as a reflection of the intimate nexus between black
   sociology and black social work that existed during the 1920s.

   examined Ohio adult's knowledge of ecological principles as the basis of

   knowledge of ecological principles. As a group, Ohio adults appear to
   understand four principles of ecology: biogeography, the earth as a
   biosphere, ecological energetics, and carrying capacity. Some additional
   attention should be paid to teaching Ohio adults about three principles
   of ecology: ecosystem succession, biotic interactions, and the
   importance of diversity. Most importantly, Ohio adults must learn more
   about the principle of materials cycling. Ohio adults showed poor
   understanding of the nitrogen, phosphorus, and hydrologic cycle and

   Pediatrics (AAP) Community Access to Child Health (CATCH), to 1)
   identify, retrospectively, the actual chronology of activities
   undertaken through CATCH, and 2) review its antecedents within the AAP,
   and its predecessor program-Healthy Children.
   Methods. Key informant telephone interviews with 14 national leaders in
   CATCH were conducted. Relevant program and administrative files and
   other documents were reviewed. AAP staff assisted the authors in
   preparing a detailed chronology of Healthy Children and CATCH activities
   and events from spring 1988 through summer 1996.
   Results and Conclusions. A decade of change in the AAP, under the
   acronym CATCH began in the late 1980s. The formation of the AAP's
   Partnership for Children and the Access to Care for Children Initiative,
   combined with the decision by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to
   transfer the funding of Healthy Children to the AAP, underpinned the
   changes. The Foundation's decision provided the resources and stimulus
   for the expansion and increased recognition of Community Pediatrics at
   the national AAP office, culminating in the establishment of the
   Department of Community Pediatrics in mid-1994. A national program of
   pediatrician-led, community-based programs and supportive services was
   launched, other resources were attracted, and a philosophical shift in
   defining the role of the pediatrician was put forward. A responsibility
   toward all children within the community was included in the role of the
   pediatrician, as well as caring for the individual child within a
   community context.

AB This study tests racial threat and political explanations for yearly

   do not account for changes in imprisonment rates, yet both threat
   conditions explain subsequent shifts in total spending on jails and
   prisons. Increases in the political strength of the the Republican
   Party, past breakdowns in the family, and growth in the tax base lead to
   greater spending on correct-ions as well, but neither unemployment nor
   economic inequality are associated with these outlays. In comparison to
   findings about the determinants of imprisonment rates, the results of
   this study show that spending on punishment is far more responsive to

AB Objective. The surge of scholarly interest in postmodernist thought has
   become one of the most noted intellectual events of the late twentieth
   century. In this article we attempt to explain this intellectual
   efflorescence in terms of changes in the social structure of higher
   education. Methods. The introductory section of the article outlines the
   most salient features of a postmodernist perspective. The next section
   reviews existing macrosociological explanations for the rise of
   postmodernism. A complementary line of analysis, focusing on patterns of
   social change within universities, provides a more proximate explanation
   for the growing popularity of postmodernism. Results and Conclusions.
   The changes in universities can be described as involutionary. In
   responding to growing numbers of claims on their resources, university
   administrators and faculty have complicated the internal structure of
   their institutions without altering its overall structure or goals.
   Under these conditions of macrosociological stasis and microsociological
   change, several important tenets of postmodernism-the rejection of
   metanarratives and the emphasis on micropolitics-mirror the pattern of
   institutional change which in turn makes postmodernist ideas seem
   especially compelling.

   with more female graduate students, and departments in urban public,
   largely commuter schools do worse on the NRC ratings. Departments with a
   few well-cited scholars receive lower scores than departments with
   comparatively equal citation counts across faculty, but departments from
   the three most prestigious Ivy League institutions receive stronger
   quality ratings after scholarly accomplishments have been held constant.

   Topics that merit further exploration include the social construction of
   risk and risk objects, risk analysis as a type of scientific enterprise,
   the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on
   risk, safety and risk as dynamic properties of social systems, and the
   social forces that create and allocate risk. In particular, sociologists
   need to place more emphasis on exploring the roles played by
   organizations and the state in hazard production and on formulating a
   political economy of risk. To a significantly greater degree than other
   disciplines concerned with risk, sociology emphasizes the contextual
   factors that structure vulnerability to hazards and the linkages that
   exist between vulnerability and social power.

   evaluate their methodological/theoretical practices in sociology. We
   find a broad range of uses of life histories in the areas of substantive
   focus, analysis, relationship of oral history and the subject,
   relationship of oral/life history to other materials, purpose of the re
   search, and relationship of oral/life history to other phenomena. We
   conclude that life history methods have not had the transformative
   effect on sociology that they have had in other disciplines. By and
   large, the actual production of life histories continues to be
   ahistorical, to be characterized by abstract empiricism, to extinguish
   subjects, and to ignore the link between biography and history.

EP 455
PD SUM 1999
PY 1999
AB I reviewed historical and contemporary policies regarding
   off-reservation hunting by Native Americans. The central issue is the
   modern implications of language in federal Indian treaties that affirms
   off-reservation hunting rights. This issue was afforded new significance
   in 1995 when a Tenth Federal Circuit Court of Appeals decision upheld a
   1989 conviction of a Crow Indian cited for hunting outside of the state
   recreational hunting season in Wyoming. I discuss the history of court
   interpretation of off-reservation treaty hunting rights from the late
   nineteenth century to the present and consider political, biological,
   and social constraints on the definition of a coherent policy governing
   off-reservation hunting rights by Native Americans. Court opinions on
   of-reservation hunting have been divergent, and there is an apparent
   dichotomy in the opinions of the Ninth and Tenth Federal Circuits. The
   United States Supreme Court has done little to clarify the issue.
   Although legal opinion tends to trump other considerations, the courts
   do not appear likely to define a national policy governing
   off-reservation hunting rights soon. It seems likely that 2 divergent
   policies coexist. Without a clear definition of an off-reservation
   hunting policy by the courts, I suggest that states and tribes should
   negotiate working agreements within the framework of biological,
   political, and social constraints. This would provide resource managers
   considerable discretion to craft situation-specific approaches that are
   programmatic in nature and avoid the morass of legal uncertainties
   inherent in defining vague treaty phrases, thus minimizing political
   risks to the states and tribes. The challenges to be overcome to
   effectively implement such an approach also are discussed.

AB Recent reports suggest the importance of associations between
   residential area characteristics and health status, but most research
   uses only census data to measure these characteristics. The current
   research examined the effect of overall neighborhood social environment
   on Ii-year risk of death. On the basis of data, the authors developed a
   three-component neighborhood social environment scale: 1) commercial
   stores; 2) population socioeconomic status; and 3) environment/housing.
   Data from the 1983 wave of the Alameda County Study (n = 1,129) and
   deaths over 11 years were analyzed with two-level logistic regression
   models. Age- and sex-adjusted risk of death was higher for residents in
   low social environment neighborhoods (odds ratio = 1,58, 95% confidence
   interval 1.15-2.18). Mortality risks were significantly higher in
   neighborhoods with a low social environment, even after account was
   taken of individual income level, education, race/ethnicity, perceived
   health status, smoking status, body mass index, and alcohol consumption.
   When each component of the neighborhood social environment
   characteristics score was examined separately. each was found to be
   associated with higher risk for mortality, independent of individual
   risk factors. These findings demonstrate the role of area
   characteristics as a health risk factor and point to the need for more
   focused attention to the meaning and measurement of neighborhood
   quality.

AB Collection of sensitive data with the use of video-enhanced,
   computer-assisted, self-administered interviews (V-CASI) has the
   potential to reduce interview bias and improve the validity of the
   study. The purpose of this study was to compare responses to sensitive
   questions elicited by V-CASI and by face-to-face interview (FTFI)
   methods. Women attending a New Orleans, Louisiana, public family
   planning or sexually transmitted disease clinic from July 1995 to July
   1996, diagnosed with a Chlamydia trachomatis infection responded to
   eight close-ended behavioral questions (four socially undesirable, two
   socially desirable, and two neutral behaviors) using both FTFI and
   V-CASI techniques in a randomized crossover design. Of the 280 women
   included, the mean age was 23 years, 95 percent were African American,
   and 71 percent felt comfortable using computers. While kappa scores
   indicated good-to-excellent agreement between interview techniques,
   women tended to admit to socially undesirable behaviors more often on
   V-CASI compared with FTFI. Thirty percent of the women gave a discrepant
   response between V-CASI and FTFI toward social desirability. Women who
   reported a socially undesirable behavior in V-CASI (i.e., more than two
   sex partners and infrequent condom usage) were more likely to have a
   discrepant response. Utilization of the same logistic regression model
   to predict condom use yielded different results when data from V-CASI
   were used compared with data from FTFI. The V-CASI technique can reduce
   social desirability bias and improve validity in research requiring
   information on sensitive sexual behaviors.

AB Neurocognitive deficits have been associated with the social functioning
   impairments of patients with schizophrenia. More information is needed
   about how cognitive status and other variables predict social
   functioning over defined periods of time. In this study, 72 relatively
   stable outpatients with schizophrenia were compared between baseline and
   a 2-year follow-up on measures of social functioning. Patients were also
   assessed with a battery of neurocognitive tests and the Positive and
   Negative Syndrome Scale. Results were compared by univariate and
   multivariate analyses. A total of four out of seven subscales of the
   Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and the total SFS score did not show a
   significant change over the 2-year period. On the three SFS subscales
   that did show a significant change, residual change scores were
   correlated with better neurocognitive performance at baseline, younger
   age, and shorter illness duration. For the Multnomah Community Ability
   Scale, 48.9% of the total score at follow-up was predicted by initial
   negative symptoms and scores on the Aphasia Screenings Test. These
   results document the independent contribution of demographic variables,
   negative symptoms, and neurocognitive deficits to the social functioning
   impairments of individuals with schizophrenia. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

AB The research reported in this paper examines the relationship between
   household socioeconomic measures, child growth, and nutritional status
   in a community in eastern Kentucky with a high rate of poverty. It is
   based on the premise that child growth and nutritional status reflect
   the social circumstances in which they occur. 21.6% of the children
   exhibited low height (<15th percentile of National Center for Health
   Statistics [NCHS] reference values), with 13% of the girls exhibiting
   stunting (<5th percentile). Thirty-three percent of the children
   exhibited overweight, and 13% exhibited obesity (>85th percentile and
   >95th percentile of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
   [NHANES] reference values, respectively); 21.4% of boys were obese,
   compared to 8.7% of girls. Analysis of variance indicated that child
   stature is best explained by the father's education level interacting
   with employment status, and by the mother's employment status
   interacting with household poverty level. Weight is best explained by
   the mother's employment status. However, the relationships among
   socioeconomic measures and growth outcomes differed by gender of the
   child. These issues are discussed in light of the anthropology
   literature and the situation in Bridges County, Kentucky where the
   research took place. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Objectives. This study examined client and program characteristics that
   predict posttreatment cocaine abstinence among cocaine abusers with
   different treatment histories.
   Methods. Cocaine abusers (n = 507) treated in 18 residential programs
   were interviewed at intake and 1-year follow-up as part of the
   nationwide Drug Abuse Treatment Outcome Study (DATOS) Program directors
   provided the program-level data in a mail survey. We applied the
   hierarchical linear modeling approach for the analysis.
   Results. No prior treatment and longer retention in DATOS programs were
   positive predictors of posttreatment abstinence. The interactive effect
   of these 2 variables was also significantly positive. Programs that
   offered legal services and included recovering staff increased their
   clients' likelihood of cocaine abstinence. Crack use at both the client
   and program level predicted negative impact. None of the program
   variables assessed differentially affected the outcomes of first-timers
   and repeaters.
   Conclusions. Although treatment repeaters were relatively difficult to
   treat, their likelihood of achieving abstinence was similar to that of
   first-timers if they were retained in treatment for a sufficient time.
   First-timers and repeaters responded similarly to the treatment program
   characteristics examined. The treatment and policy implications of these
   findings are discussed.

AB Objectives. The US armed forces adopted "zero tolerance" policies
   concerning illicit drug use in 1980 and later developed policies to
   discourage tobacco and alcohol abuse. This article examines drug use
   among young active-duty recruits both before and after enlistment
   compared with non-military age-mates, and documents historical shifts in
   such drug use across 2 decades.
   Methods. Analyses employed longitudinal panel data from 20 nationally
   representative samples of high school seniors (cohorts of 1976-1995),
   each surveyed just before graduation and again within 2 years. Separate
   analyses for men (n = 12 082) and women (n = 15 345) contrasted those
   who entered military service college, and civilian employment.
   Results. Illicit drug use declined more among young military recruits
   than among their civilian counterparts. Analyses of male recruits at
   multiple time periods showed (1) declines in the prevalence of marijuana
   use and cocaine use after the initiation of routine military drug
   testing and (2) lower proportions of smokers of half a pack or more of
   cigarettes per day who entered service after the initiation of tobacco
   bans during basic training.
   Conclusions. Recent military drug policies appear to deter illicit drug
   use among enlistees and discourage some smokers from enlisting.

AB Objectives. This study identified high school seniors at low, moderate,
   and high risk for cigarette use to examine changes in the prevalence of
   daily smoking within risk groups from 1976 to 1995.
   Methods. Data were taken from the Monitoring the Future Project's
   national surveys of high school seniors. Risk classification was based
   on grade-point average, truancy, nights out per week, and religious
   commitment. Logistic regression models were used to estimate trends for
   all seniors and separately for White (n = 244 221), African American (n
   = 41 005), and Hispanic (n = 18 457) male and female subgroups.
   Results. Risk group distribution (low = 45%, moderate = 30%, high = 25%)
   changed little over time. Between 1976 and 1990, greater absolute
   declines in smoking occurred among high-risk students (17 percentage
   points) than among low-risk students (6 percentage points). Particularly
   large declines occurred among high-risk African Americans and Hispanics.
   Smoking increased in all risk groups in the 1990s.
   Conclusions. Among high school seniors, a large part of the overall
   change in smoking occurred among high-risk youth. Policies and programs
   to reduce smoking among youth must have broad appeal, especially to
   those at the higher end of the risk spectrum.

AB PURPOSE: To examine differences in current smoking status and the number
   of cigarettes consumed daily between foreign and native-born African
   Americans, and the impact of demographic and socioeconomic status (SES)
   factors on smoking behavior.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from combining the 1990-1994 National Health
   interview Surveys and consisted of 16,138 US. born and foreign-born
   African Americans between 18 and 64 years of age. The statistical
   analysis included cross-tabulations and weighted multiple logistic
   regression (MLR) using the Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences
   (SPSS) and the Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) computer programs.
   RESULTS: Adjusted MLR analysis revealed that native-born African
   Americans were more likely (odds, ratio (OR) = 2.7, p < 0.001) to be
   current smokers than foreign-born blacks. Within the native-born group,
   smoking prevalence decreased with increasing education and income, bur
   these associations were not found for foreign-born blacks. Women in both
   groups were less likely than men to be current smokers. Statistically
   significant differences were not found between the two groups in the
   number of cigarettes smoked per day.
   CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of nativity and smoking behavior further
   demonstrates the social diversity among African Americans and suggests
   the differential impact of social and cultural factors on smoking
   behavior within racially classified social groups. In areas where there
   are substantial numbers of foreign-born blacks, researchers should
   consider differentiating smoking status by nativity. Though differences
   in smoking prevalence were apparent for native and foreign-born American
   Americans, prevention and cessation programs are needed for both groups.

AB Objectives: To identify general and differentiating risk and protective
   factors from domains of culture and ecology, peer, family, and
   personality, related to adolescent delinquency and marijuana use, and to
   study the protective role of the parent-child mutual attachment in
   offsetting cultural and ecological risk factors, leading to less
   delinquency and marijuana use.
   Design: Cross-sectional analyses of interview data collected in
   Colombia.
   Participants: A total of 2837 Colombian adolescents, 12 to 17 years of
   age.
   Setting: Adolescents were interviewed in their homos.
   Main Measures: Independent variables included measures from 4 domains:
   culture and ecology, peer, family, and personality. The dependent
   variables were delinquency and marijuana use.
   Results: Several risk factors, such as tolerance of deviance and
   sensation seeking, were similarly related to both delinquency and
   marijuana use, suggesting that a common cause underlies the propensity
   to engage in different deviant behaviors. Some risk factors were more
   involved:ed in delinquency and other risk factors were more highly
   related to the adolescent's marijuana use. Finally, when violence is
   endemic and illegal drugs are readily available, a close parent-child
   bond was capable of mitigating: these risk factors, leading to less
   marijuana use and delinquency.
   Conclusions: The findings have implications for public health policy
   related to interventions in countries in which violence and drug use are
   prevalent. The results point to interventional procedures aimed at
   adolescents vulnerable to marijuana use and delinquency as well as
   efforts aimed at specific vulnerabilities in these areas. For example,
   reducing the risk factors and enhancing the protective factors for
   marijuana use and delinquency may result in less adolescent marijuana
   use and delinquency.

AB Objective: To examine whether sexual orientation is an independent risk
   factor for reported suicide attempts.
   Design: Data were from the Massachusetts 1995 Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which included a
   question on sexual orientation. Ten drug use, 5 sexual behavior, and 5
   violence victimization variables chosen a priori were assessed as
   possible mediating variables. Hierarchical logistic regression models
   determined independent predictors of suicide attempts.
   Setting: Public high schools in Massachusetts.
   Participants: Representative, population-based sample of high school
   students. Three thousand three hundred sixty-five (81%) of 4167
   responded to both the suicide attempt and sexual orientation questions.
   Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported suicide attempt in the past year.
   Results: One hundred twenty-nine students (3.8%) self-identified as gay,
   lesbian, bisexual, or not sure of their sexual orientation (GLBN).
   Gender, age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and all 20 health-risk
   behaviors were associated with suicide attempt (P<.001). Gay, lesbian,
   bisexual, or not sure youth were 3.41 times more likely to report a
   suicide attempt. Based on hierarchical logistic regression, female
   gender (odds ratio [OR],4.43; 95%; confidence interval [CI], 3.30-5.93),
   GLBN orientation (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.39-3.37), Hispanic ethnicity (OR,
   2.21; 95% CI, 1.44-3.99), higher levels of violence/victimization (OR,
   2.06; 95% CI, 1.80-2.36), and more drug use (OR, 1.31; 95% CI,
   1.22-1.41) were independent predictors of suicide attempt (P<.001).
   Gender-specific analyses for predicting suicide attempts revealed that
   among males the OR for GLBN orientation increased (OR, 3.74; 95%;, CI,
   1.92-7.28), while among females GLBN orientation was not a significant
   predictor of suicide.
   Conclusions: Gay, lesbian, bisexual, or not sure youth report a
   significantly increased frequency of suicide attempts, Sexual
   orientation has an independent association with suicide attempts for
   males, while for females the association of sexual orientation with
   suicidality may be mediated by drug use and violence/victimization
   behaviors.

   attending a festival at Fort Hall, near the Idaho National Engineering

   sample lived on the Fort Hall Reservation, and half were American
   Indians from elsewhere in the western United States. An additional 44
   White people attending the festival were also interviewed. The
   hypothesis that there are differences in hunting, fishing, and
   recreational rates as a function of tribal affiliation, educational
   level, gender, and age was examined. Information on hunting and fishing
   rates are central for understanding potential exposure scenarios for
   American Indians if the Department of Energy's INEEL lands are ever
   opened to pubic access, and the data are important because of the
   existence of tribal treaties that govern the legal and cultural rights
   of the Shoshone-Bannock regarding INEEL lands. Variations in hunting,
   fishing, and photography rates were explained by tribal affiliation
   (except fishing), gender, age, and schooling, Hunting rates were
   significantly higher for Indians (both those living on Fort Hall and
   others) than Whites. Men engaged in significantly higher rates of
   outdoor activities than women (except for photography). Potential and
   current hunting and fishing on and adjacent to INEEL was more similar
   among the local Whites and Fort Hall Indians than between these two
   groups and other American Indians. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

   Twenty-five Asian-American and 26 Caucasian weight-concerned women were

   Bonding Instrument, and three subscales of the Eating Disorder
   Inventory. Asian-American subjects also filled out the Suinn-Lew Asian
   Self-identity Acculturation Scale questionnaire. Results: Contrary to
   hypotheses, weight-concerned Asian-American women reported more
   dissatisfaction with body shape than did Caucasian women. Moreover, in
   the Asian-American group, acculturation was not associated with level of
   eating disturbance. In both groups, perceptions of low maternal caring
   were associated with higher levels of eating problems. In regression
   analyses, maternal care emerged as a better predictor of eating
   disturbance than did ethnicity. Discussion: Results suggest that qualify
   of parent-child relations, particularly the mother-daughter
   relationship, may be important in the etiology of eating problems,

AB Predictions that anxious and nonanxious depression would differ in

   emotional words, were evaluated using dichotic listening tasks. A total
   of 149 patients having a major depressive disorder (51 with and 98
   without an anxiety disorder) and 57 healthy controls were tested on
   fused-word and complex tone tasks. The anxious and nonanxious depression
   groups showed a consistent difference in PA across tasks; that is, the
   anxious group had a larger left-ear advantage for tones and a smaller
   right-ear advantage for words when compared with the nonanxious group.
   There was no group difference in sensitivity for perceiving emotional
   words. Patients having an anxious depression appear to have a greater
   propensity to activate right than left-hemisphere regions during
   auditory tasks, whereas those having a nonanxious depression have the
   opposite hemispheric asymmetry.

   attending to the role of families' positive affect (warmth) and negative
   affect (criticism). Coders listened to interviews of 40 family members
   taken from C. E. Vaughn, K. S. Synder, S. Jones, W. B. Freeman, and I.
   R. Falloon (1984) and rated their attributions of controllability for
   the symptoms and behaviors of their relatives with schizophrenia. For
   family members not designated as emotionally overinvolved, perceptions
   that their ill relatives' symptoms and behaviors were under the
   patients' control were related to family members' warmth and criticism
   and to patients' clinical outcomes. Of the affective reactions, only
   criticism predicted outcome. In addition, patients' use of street drugs
   was related to attributions, criticism, and outcome. Together these
   findings suggest that families' attributions and criticism are important
   in understanding the relationship between family factors and course of

AB The recruitment of African Americans into cancer prevention and control

   Scientific findings, whether biomedical or behaviorial, may not be
   appropriate and applicable to ethnic minority populations unless they
   are adequately represented as study participants. Moreover, the need to
   involve greater numbers of ethnic minorities is quite urgent due to the
   poor morbidity and mortality outcomes associated With ethnic minority
   group membership. Such is the case with breast cancer survivorship. The
   purpose of the study was to test a personalized recruitment strategy on
   response rate in African-American women. The response rate of 45%
   (n=117) African Americans and 64% (n=161) white subjects indicated only
   limited success in the recruitment of the African-American breast cancer
   survivors. The recruitment result suggests that culturally relevant
   recruitment strategies (eg, inclusion of African-American investigators,
   culturally consistent letter of recruitment) may be insufficient in
   adequately increasing research participation. Therefore, Further studies
   on investigating Factors that influence research participation (eg, type
   of incentives, and schedule of payment as well as type of stationery and
   stamps used) are needed.

AB We surveyed anglers on four Minnesotta lakes who fish for bluegill
   Lepomis macrochirus to determine (1) if they would support regulation
   changes designed to increase bluegill size structure, (2) if their
   behavior would allow increases in bluegill size structure to be
   sustainable, and (3) what they viewed as the causes and remedies for
   declining bluegill fisheries. The majority of anglers surveyed would not
   support regulation changes on bluegill fisheries. However, most said
   they would increase the number of fishing trips they took if increased
   bluegill size structure could be reestablished. We estimated that a
   modest increase of two trips annually would result in a 16-34% increase
   in the rate of exploitation on the four lakes. On certain lakes this
   could jeopardize the sustainability of a quality fishery. The majority
   of anglers believed that stunting was the cause of the decline in
   bluegill populations and that removal by managers and anglers was the
   most important management tool available.

AB Objective. The purposes of this article are to inform pediatricians and
   other health professionals of key contextual risk factors that elevate
   black and Hispanic Americans' likelihood to use substances and to
   discuss selected protective mechanisms that may shield members of these
   populations against substance use. Method. The article selectively
   reviews the literature on the epidemiology, etiology, and consequences
   of alcohol and other drug use among white, black, and Hispanic adults
   and youth. Results. The extant research suggests that historical and
   contemporary racialized practices and ideologies influence racial/ethnic
   differences in substance use outcomes, both directly and indirectly,
   through their influence on the communities in which people of different
   racial/ethnic groups are placed, through their influence on the
   structure and process of people's interpersonal relationships, and
   through the impact that they have on individuals' psychology and
   behavior. Conclusions. Althoughthe emphasis of pediatricians' and many
   other helping professionals' work focuses on individuals and
   individual-level behaviors, these behaviors can only be properly
   examined, diagnosed, and treated when they are understood in light of
   the community and societal contexts in which they occur.

   logs indicated that approximately 58% of supported employees had
   experienced one or more incidents of interpersonal difficulty during

   Reproductive histories of 184 post-reproductive women from the 11
   settlements were utilized to compute the Crow's indices of selection.
   The results were interpreted in the light of economic and educational
   backgrounds of the couples, and the historical process of Christian
   missionary influence. The indices in general are found to be lowest
   among those observed in some 100 Indian populations so far studied.
   There is slight but a clear trend of decreasing mortality index with
   urbanization, although fertility index, as often been observed among the
   populations of developing countries, did not show any clear trend,
   increasing or decreasing. The reduced differences in the indices between
   the transitional categories and the overall low values of the indices
   could be interpreted as due to the long and uniform Christian missionary

AB Background: In a prior study, we reported that monetary incentives were
   effective in increasing return for tuberculosis (TB) skin test reading.
   The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of monetary versus
   nonmonetary incentives and a theory-based educational intervention on
   return for TB skin test reading in a sample of newly recruited active
   injection and crack cocaine users, and to determine the prevalence of TB
   infection in this sample.
   Methods: Active injection drug and/or crack cocaine users (n = 1,078),
   recruited using street outreach techniques, were skin tested for TB.
   They were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 experimental treatment conditions:
   $10 cash, grocery store coupons, bus tokens/fast-food coupons,
   motivational education, or usual encouragement to return, Nonmonetary
   incentives had a $10 value, and all incentives were provided at return
   for skin test leading.
   Results: Ninety-five percent of those who received $10 returned for.
   skin test reading compared to 86% of those who received grocery store
   coupons and 83% of those who received either bus tokens or fast-food
   coupons. In contrast, only 47% of those who received the educational
   session and only 49% of those who received usual encouragement returned
   for skin test reading. The prevalence of a positive tuberculin test was
   21%, and was similar for crack cocaine and injection drug users.
   Conclusions: Nonmonetary and monetary incentives dramatically increased
   the return rate for TB skin test reading among drug users who are at
   high risk of TB infection. Nonmonetary incentives were somewhat less
   effective than monetary incentives. (C) 1999 American Journal of

   components: (1) review of the SAQ responses by a public health nurse;
   (2) structured patient interview with the research nurse; and (3)
   medical record abstraction postpartum. Results: Compared to extensive
   interview and medical record data, the SAQ is sensitive (76.6%) and

AB In 1996, public outcry over shortened hospital stays for new mothers and
   their infants led to the passage of a federal law banning "drive-through
   deliveries." This recent round of brief postpartum stays is not
   unprecedented. During World War II, a baby boom overwhelmed maternity
   facilities in American hospitals. Hospital births became more popular
   and accessible as the Emergency Maternal and Infant Care program
   subsidized obstetric care for servicemen's wives. Although protocols
   before the war had called for prolonged bed rest in the puerperium,
   medical theory was quickly revised as crowded hospitals were forced to
   discharge mothers after 24 hours. To compensate for short inpatient
   stays, community-based services such as visiting nursing care, postnatal
   homes, and prenatal classes evolved to support new mothers. Fueled by
   rhetoric that identified maternal-child health as a critical factor in
   military morale, postpartum care during the war years remained
   comprehensive despite short hospital stays. The wartime experience
   offers a model of alternatives to legislation for ensuring adequate care
   of postpartum women.

AB The enduring effects of an individual's birth order have been subject to
   a long and lively debate in sociology and other disciplines. Recently,
   in response to Sulloway's (1996) Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family
   Dynamics, and Creative Lives, interest has increased in the possible
   effects of birth order on social attitudes. Using quantitative,
   historical data, Sulloway found that birth order is a better predictor
   of social attitudes than is gender, class, or race. His novel,
   evolutionary theory asserts the universal influence of birth order
   across eras and cultures. We use contemporary data to test Sulloway's
   contention that firstborn adults are more conservative, supportive of
   authority, and "tough-minded" than laterborns. Examining 24 measures of
   social attitudes from the General Social Survey (GSS), we find no
   support for these claims, either in terms of significant effects or even
   the direction of nonsignificant coefficients. An expanded inquiry using
   all (202) relevant attitudinal items on the GSS yields similar results.
   In our analysis, variables discounted by Sulloway-gender, race, social
   class, and family size-are all linked to social attitudes more strongly
   than is birth order: Our findings suggest that birth-order theories may
   be better conceptualized in terms of modest effects in limited domains
   and in specific societies.

   Mid-range (n = 24), or Extreme (n = 19) type using the Family
   Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II (FACES II). Three two-way
   discriminant analyses were performed using eight variables to
   discriminate between the family types. Results indicated that the
   affective and cognitive functioning of the family members with the brain
   injuries, family adaptation, and primary caregiver age were the
   strongest factors that differentiated the three family types. These
   findings suggest that Balanced, Mid-range, and Extreme families are
   distinct subgroups within the brain injury family population. The

AB Although the majority of adopted children are well-adjusted, adopted
   children evidence proportionately more behavior problems when compared
   to nonadopted children in both clinic and nonclinic populations. An
   extensive literature examining behavioral, diagnostic, and demographic
   characteristics of adopted children has provided several plausible
   explanations for the high rate of behavior problems among adopted
   children. In this review, the existing literature is organized into five
   explanatory models: (a) genetic or "biosocial" factors, (b) pathogenesis
   of the adoption process, (c) long-term effects of impaired preadoption
   childrearing, (d) referral bias in adoptive parents, and (e) impaired
   adoptive parent-adoptee relations. We conclude that evidence for each
   model is mixed at best. Especially noteworthy is the mixed results for
   genetic or biosocial studies and the relative absence of studies focused
   on identifying factors associated with disruptions in the adoptive
   parent-adoptee relationship. We propose that a psychosocial model to
   explain the high rate of behavior problems among adopted children is
   highly plausible and further suggest that it may be time for a new
   awareness and appreciation for the normative aspects of adoption. An
   overview of parenting and family characteristics associated with risk
   factors for antisocial behavior is provided as a guide for future
   research. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Developmental studies suggest that marital quality improves in old age
   (e.g, Guilford & Bengtson, 1979). However, many of the studies are
   replete with sampling biases that probably led to an overinflated
   positive report of marital satisfaction in older adults. Our review
   evaluated contemporary studies that have investigated interpersonal and
   psychological factors associated with dissatisfaction in long-term
   marriages. Recent investigations indicate that older marriages benefit
   from lower levels of conflict and greater sources of mutual pleasure
   following child-rearing cessation. Studies of social support in
   long-term marriages suggest that perceptions of spousal support are more
   strongly related to marital satisfaction and general well-being for
   older women than for men. A few investigations have found a significant
   relationship between depression and marital discord in older adult
   samples, and the causal flow between these two variables appears to be
   unidirectional in that depression has a detrimental impact on late-life
   marital quality. Indeed, depression has been found to mediate the link
   between many age-related stressors (e.g., ill health, retirement) and
   declines in marital adjustment. However, our preliminary analysis of
   marital adjustment within a depressed, older adult, outpatient sample of
   married individuals did not confirm statistically that marital discord
   is associated with depressive symptomatology. This, in part, was
   attributed to the very narrow range of older adults sampled (i.e.,
   clinic patients suffering from depression). However, the majority of
   depressives characterized their marriages as discordant. The
   implications for these findings are discussed and future directions are
   offered. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Background Infant mortality rates vary substantially among
   municipalities in the State of Ceara, from 14 to 193 per 1000 live
   births. Identification of the determinants of these differences can be
   of particular importance to infant health policy and programmes in
   Brazil where local governments play a pivotal role in providing primary
   health care. Methods Ecological study across 140 municipalities in the
   State of Ceara, Brazil. Results To determine the interrelationships
   between potential predictors of infant mortality, we classified 11
   variables into proximate determinants (adequate weight gain and
   exclusively breastfeeding), health services variables (prenatal care
   up-to-date, participation in growth monitoring, immunization up-to-date,
   and decentralization of health services), and socioeconomic factors
   (female literacy rate, household income, adequate water supply, adequate
   sanitation, and per capita gross municipality product), and included the
   variables in each group simultaneously in linear regression models. In
   these analyses, only one of the proximate determinants (exclusively
   breastfeeding (inversely), R2 = 9.3) and one of the health services
   variables (prenatal care up-to-date (inversely), R2 = 22.8) remained
   significantly associated with infant mortality. In contrast, female
   literacy rate (inversely), household income (directly) and per capita
   GMP (inversely) were independently associated with the infant mortality
   rate (for the model including the three variables R2 = 25.2). Finally,
   we considered simultaneously the variables from each group, and selected
   a model that explained 41% of the variation in infant mortality rates
   between municipalities. The paradoxical direct association between
   household income and infant mortality was present only in models
   including female illiteracy rate, and suggests that among these
   municipalities, increases in income unaccompanied by improvements in
   female education may not substantially reduce infant mortality. The lack
   of independent associations between inadequate sanitation and infant
   mortality rates may be due to the uniformly poor level of this indicator
   across municipalities and provides no evidence against its critical role
   in child survival. Conclusions These results suggest that promotion of
   exclusive breastfeeding and increased prenatal care utilization, as well
   as investments in female education would have substantial positive
   effects in further reducing infant mortality rates in the State of
   Ceara.

AB There are a number of reasons for anticipating that contact by women in
   developing country settings with modern maternal-child health (MCH)
   services will lead to increased use of family planning services. Indeed,
   the expectation of such a relationship underlies the integrated service
   delivery strategy that has been adopted on a more or less global basis.
   However, the available empirical evidence in support of this proposition
   is inconclusive. This study re-examines this issue in Morocco, Household
   survey data and data on the supply environment for health and family
   planning services gathered in 1992 are analysed in the study. A
   full-information maximum likelihood estimator is used to control for the
   possible endogeneity of health care and contraceptive choices. The
   findings indicate a substantial and apparently causal relationship
   between the intensity of MCH service use and subsequent contraceptive
   use. Policy simulations indicate that sizeable increases in
   contraceptive prevalence might be realized by increasing the coverage
   and intensity of use of MCH services.

AB Beliefs about child illness were investigated using semi-structured
   interviews with mothers and providers in four rural Guatemalan
   communities. The two most common forms of child illness in Guatemala -
   diarrhoea and respiratory disease - were focused upon. These illnesses
   are particularly difficult to prevent and treat, especially with the
   rudimentary health services available in rural areas of developing
   countries. Comparisons with other ethnographic studies in Guatemala
   suggest that some traditional models of illness causation identified in
   these earlier investigations are relatively unimportant in the
   communities studied here. This finding, in conjunction with frequent
   responses related to hygiene and water, suggests that traditional
   explanations may be co-existing with biomedical views of illness
   causation to a greater degree today than in the past.

   That is, the only structure seen between the two levels is in the
   influence of men of the same surname resident in the same house. An
   analysis of relationship by residence on the same street yields a value
   of Ri somewhat higher than that for the ward as a whole, however,
   suggesting that even within a ward there may be a tendency for the house
   of relatives occasionally to lie close together.

AB This investigation examined caregiver and child perceptions of the
   division of responsibility for asthma management tasks in families. The
   study sample included 789 children with asthma, aged 6 to 9 years, who
   lived in the inner city. These children and their primary caregivers
   completed the Asthma Responsibility Interview. The correlation between
   the caregiver's and child's ratings of the child's responsibility was
   low (.19), with children rating themselves as more responsible than
   their caregivers rated them. Caregiver and child ratings of the child's
   responsibility increased with the child's age; however, caregivers'
   ratings of their own responsibility remained constant over the age range
   studied. Kappa statistics ranged from -.03 to .12, with up to 16% of
   children reporting less responsibility for self-care than was indicated
   by the caregiver. More than one third of families reported four or more
   asthma caregivers. The discrepancy between the caregiver's and child's
   perceptions and the involvement of multiple caregivers raise the
   possibility of unintentional nonadherence.

AB Objectives: To examine the moderating effects of gender, grade level,
   and ethnicity on the associations between violence exposure and
   adolescents' internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavior and to
   explore whether such relationships persist over time. Method: A survey
   of adolescents' exposure to violence, internalizing symptoms, and
   externalizing behavior was administered to 2 cross-sectional samples of
   6th, 8th, and 10th graders (N = 2,748 in 1994 and 2,600 in 1996) in an
   urban school system. Approximately 1,100 adolescents participated in
   both surveys and served as the longitudinal sample. Results: Structural
   equation models indicated that violence exposure was closely associated
   with both externalizing behavior (r = 0.74-0.79) and internalizing
   symptoms (r = 0.36-0.38). The strength of association was similar across
   gender and ethnic groups. However, violence exposure was more closely
   related with internalizing symptoms for younger adolescents than their
   older counterparts. The longitudinal analysis suggested that exposure to
   violence reported at time 1 was related to adolescents' internalizing
   symptoms and externalizing behavior 2 years later. Conclusions: These
   results document high levels of violence exposure for urban youths and
   indicate links to a range of psychiatric symptoms and indicators of poor
   adjustment. Such findings carry implications for direct clinical work
   with young people, as well as for program development and public policy.

AB Objectives: To compare moral development and psychopathological
   interference with conscience functioning (PI) among adolescents exposed
   to different degrees of earthquake-related trauma and to investigate the
   relationship of moral development and PI to exposure to trauma, severity
   of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, postearthquake
   adversities, and extent of loss of nuclear family members. Method:
   Adolescents (N = 193) from 2 cities at different distances from the
   epicenter were evaluated. The Stilwell Structured Conscience Interview
   was used to assess moral development and PI. Structured self-report
   instruments were used to obtain ratings of severity of
   earthquake-related trauma, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and
   postearthquake adversities. Results: Adolescents in the city near the
   epicenter manifested advanced moral development as compared with their
   counterparts in the less affected city. Concomitantly, they endorsed
   responses indicating PI. Levels of PI were significantly correlated with
   severity of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: in the aftermath of a
   catastrophic natural disaster, children assume greater responsibilities
   and confront a multitude of morally challenging interpersonal situations
   which may result in an advancement of their moral development. Yet, at
   the same time, PTSD symptoms and negative schematizations of self and
   others may give rise to disturbances in conscience functioning. The
   findings suggest that therapeutic consideration should be given to
   assisting children in integrating the horror of their traumatic
   experiences and the harshness of posttrauma adversities into an adaptive
   schema of good and evil in themselves and the world.

   through 10 were assessed for their risk of eating disorder. Method: The
   Eating Attitudes Test (EAT40), a self-administered questionnaire, was
   given anonymously to 1,302 male and female adolescents. Results: The
   results showed that 19.8% of females and 3.7% of males scored above 29,
   indicating high risk for development of an eating disorder. There was
   also a trend toward increased prevalence of risk in areas that are more
   rural. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the risk for eating
   disorders may be greater in rural areas than has previously been
   believed. This has implications for understanding the etiology of these
   diseases as well as demonstrating the need for more research in these

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe alcohol use and its sociodemographic correlates
   among persons aged 65 years and older in a US probability sample.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a national probability sample-based
   cohort study.
   SETTING: Multiple sites throughout the United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3448 persons aged 65 and older who participated
   in the first wave of the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study
   (1982-84).
   MEASUREMENTS: We describe the alcohol use behaviors and demographic
   characteristics of 3448 persons aged 65 and older. Least squares
   regression models were used to assess associations between older
   persons' sociodemographic characteristics and alcohol use.:
   RESULTS: Sixty percent of the sample reported having 12 or more drinks
   of alcohol in at least 1 year of their lives. Seventy-nine percent of
   these older drinkers were currently drinking. Twenty-five percent of all
   drinkers drank daily (31% men, 19% women). Using gender-specific
   definitions (men >2 drinks/day; women >1 drink/day), 16% of men drinking
   alcohol and 15% of women drinking alcohol were heavy drinkers. Younger
   age, male gender, and higher income were associated with greater alcohol
   use.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most older persons who ever drank alcohol in their
   lifetimes were currently drinking. In addition, a substantial number of
   older persons were drinking currently at levels that may place them at
   risk of adverse health consequences.

AB Background The most recent major U.S. trials that evaluated
   community-level programs to influence risk factors and health behaviors
   identified secular trends in the risk factors and health behaviors among
   the factors that might have limited community-level effects. The
   research reported in this paper uses data from one of the trials to
   examine the secular trend explanation directly.
   Methods. Data from the 22-community Community Intervention Trial for
   Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) were analyzed to test a hypothesis based on
   secular trend reasoning: program effects for smoking prevalence Fs ere
   larger for treatment communities matched to control communities with
   small declines in smoking than in treatment communities matched to
   control communities with larger declines in smoking.
   Results. Consistent with the secular trend explanation, program effects
   were larger when control communities had relatively small declines in
   smoking prevalence.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that secular trends masked
   community-level program effects in COMMIT. (C) 1999 American Health

   instructors and students responded in focus groups to multimedia
   technologies with consistent themes, including enhancement of cognitive

   However, students also expressed distancing from the instructor. Surveys
   of the same student groups and a journal kept by the course professor
   reflected similar themes. Student achievement outcomes (pre- and
   posttest scores) showed no differences across two classroom applications
   of multimedia presentations: static and dynamic. Sociology instructors
   should consider adopting more complex computer multimedia in light of
   balancing interests: (1) resource scarcity in education and (2) few
   direct demonstrable effects of media on objective measures of student
   test outcomes in this and other research. However, our participants
   consistently cite considerable enhancement of students' cognitive skills
   and motivations (especially note taking and student interest levels),
   and our instructors endorse the positive effects of multimedia
   development on the process of reworking and rethinking their course
   curricula and materials.

   promotes active learning as students apply sociological ideas to explain
   empirical reality. Using heavy metal music as an example, I present a
   two-part model for integrating a cultural analysis of this music and its
   subculture into the introductory course. Students first conduct a
   sociologically grounded cultural analysis of heavy metal music. Then
   they expand this analysis during the rest of the course by applying new
   concepts, theories, and research to explain this cultural object
   sociologically The article's final section discusses the application of
   this model in a range of class contexts and provides student responses

AB Young adults (defined here as those 18-29 years of age) in the United

   effort to develop prevention strategies that respond specifically to
   their circumstances and needs. This paper briefly, reviews relevant
   research, analyzes prevention policy priorities, presents the barriers
   to implementation and outlines strategies for overcoming them. Its main
   conclusions are: (I) Strategies to reduce alcohol availability and
   increase alcohol prices will significantly reduce alcohol problems among
   young adults. (2) A high priority should be given to harm reduction
   strategies and strategies that target the physical environments where
   young adults are likely to congregate. (3) The alcohol industries and
   the industries' allies will vigorously oppose these policy reforms, and
   their resistance constitutes a formidable barrier to implementation. (4)
   Resistance from other conmmunity institutions, which may benefit from
   the status quo, is an additional barrier that must be addressed. (5)
   There is a tendency to compromise with the alcohol industries and others
   and substitute individual-based prevention strategies for public policy
   reforms. Individual-based strategies complement public policy reforms
   but should not replace them. (6) Overcoming barriers will require
   community organizing, coalition building, media advocacy and policy
   advocacy and an expanded research effort. The field needs to develop new
   messages and themes in both media and policy advocacy that address the
   specific concerns and interests of young adults, thereby encouraging
   their active leadership in prevention policy development.

AB Although women who abuse drugs and alcohol come from varied
   socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, many share a variety of
   psychosocial and psychiatric risk factors that may limit their
   capacities to be nurturing parents. in particular, substance-abusing
   women often have family histories of factors of substance abuse,
   childhood histories of sexual victimization, current involvement in
   violent partner relationships, and varied types of mental health
   problems. Such risk factors, which limit mothers' abilities to respond
   sensitively to their infants, may impact on the development of their
   children even more strongly than the teratological effects of drug
   exposure in utero. Pregnancy and the perinatal period, when mothers
   begin to establish critical early relationships with their infants, may
   be a particularly important time for mental health and parenting
   interventions with substance-abusing women.

   attitudes toward drinking and to assess the associations of norms and
   attitudes with current drinking and frequent heavy drinking patterns
   among whites, blacks, and hispanics between 1984 and 1995. Data were
   obtained from two nationwide probability samples of US households.
   Results indicated that there were no broad trends in situational norms
   and attitudes toward drinking between 1984 and 1995 among whites,
   blacks, and hispanics in the US. The variations in norms and attitudes
   detected between 1984 and 1995 were ethnic and gender-specific. For all
   of the groups studied, situational norms and attitudes were highly
   predictive of both current drinking and frequent heavy drinking
   patterns. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A clear understanding of human population growth, consumption patterns,
   and their effects on the environment, particularly amongst our future
   leaders, is essential for proper allocation of conservation efforts. We
   report on the results of a written questionnaire assessing the knowledge
   and attitudes of undergraduate university students majoring in a range
   of disciplines in the United States of America (USA) and in Costa Rice
   (CR) regarding population- and environment-related issues. Our results
   indicated limited knowledge about human population growth and the
   environment, with USA students and male students more often responding
   correctly to factual questions on demography and global environmental
   change than CR students, who nonetheless were generally more pessimistic
   about environmental quality and the carrying capacity of the planet. USA
   students, however, more often recognized the link between human
   population size and environmental quality. Education on population and
   environmental issues will be improved if: (1) linkages between
   population size, consumption, and environmental quality are taught; (2)
   the effects of individual actions on environmental quality are
   emphasized; and (3) environmental education is tailored to local issues.

   locations in the United States. The vast majority of these migrants are
   middle class and originally from large urban areas, which differs from
   the typical rural-origin migrants previously studied by transnational
   scholars. The analysis is based on theoretical developments from
   transnational studies and insights advanced by economic sociology. Our
   findings suggest that transnational relations and activities do not
   follow a linear path and are not necessarily and inevitably a
   progressive process. The reach, scope and effects of transnational
   activities are contingent on the interaction of multiple contextual
   (state of origin-migrants relations; state of origin relations with
   country of destination; context of reception of immigrants abroad) and
   group factors (size, class composition, mode of settlement).

AB In the past decade, racial/ethnic discrepancy in health status has drawn
   increased attention from academicians, policy makers and planners,
   service providers, and community advocates. While the field has
   witnessed a growth in research projects and intervention programs, the
   gap in health status among racial/ethnic groups persists, which suggests
   that future research should incorporate a focus on one neglected area,
   ie, the health implications of discrimination. Using the National Survey
   of Functional Health (N= 1,659), a nationally representative sample of
   English-speaking persons 18 years of age and older living in
   non-institutional arrangements within the United States, we analyzed how
   self-perceived unfairness (discrimination due to racial identity or to
   low socioeconomic status (SES)) was linked to self-assessed health
   status. The study found that racial and class discrimination were rather
   pervasive in the United States. Experiences of discrimination tended to
   have a strong negative association with health and accounted for some
   racial/ethnic differences in health status. The study also revealed a
   complex relationship between experiences of discrimination and social
   class, suggesting that future research should focus on specifying the
   social distribution of discrimination and assessing its subsequent
   association with health.

   consisted of 573 Latinas, aged 46 to 92 years. Participants were
   recruited from 17 publicly subsidized housing projects in Los Angeles,
   Calif. Health practices information was obtained through an interview.
   Results: Regression analyses showed an interaction between age and
   acculturation: the effects of acculturation on health practices were
   stronger among Latinas aged 64 years and under than among their 65 to 74
   year-old counterparts. Level of acculturation did not affect the
   likelihood of engaging in healthy practices for elderly women (aged 75
   and over). Conclusions: The data indicate that acculturation negatively
   affects the health practices of middle-aged Latinas, who are at a
   particularly critical age during which chronic diseases emerge.
   Intervention programs are needed to encourage adoption of healthy
   practices, particularly exercise and weight control, at an earlier stage

   non-institutionalized Mexican Americans. Design: A cross-sectional
   cohort study design was used. Setting: The sampling frame included the
   Southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico
   and Texas) where subjects were interviewed in their homes. Participants:
   A probability sample consisted of 3,050 Mexican Americans aged 65 or
   older. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was self-report of
   being diagnosed by a physician as having a stroke that required
   hospitalization. Results: Those who ever had a stroke (N=159) were less
   likely to be able to perform activities of daily living than persons who
   never had a stroke (N=2,869). Rates of disability and prevalence of
   stroke appear to be higher in elderly Mexican Americans than in the
   general elderly population. Greater education and language acculturation
   were risk factors for having a stroke.Conclusions: The finding that
   Mexican Americans who are less acculturated are more healthy suggests
   that acculturation may increase morbidity and, potentially, mortality
   from stroke.

   quality; and (2) examine sociocultural influences on such perceptions.
   We expected friends' perceptions to form two distinct types of
   perceptions: (i) objectively perceived and, thus, shared interpersonal
   perceptions; and (ii) subjectively interpreted and, thus, nonshared
   intrapersonal perceptions. Mean and covariances structures analyses
   revealed that: (a) our distinction was well supported and generalisable
   across both contexts; and (b) East Berlin children reported more
   perceived friendship conflict, fewer mutual visits and sleep-overs, and
   less fun in their play activities than did their West Berlin age-mates,
   These differences are consistent with known characteristics of these two
   distinct sociocultural contexts.

AB A study was conducted in South Korea that compared the social competence
   of sixth graders who had no siblings to those who did. Korea was
   selected as the site of this study because most urban mothers are
   homemakers there. The three factors of social competence considered in
   this study were: popularity, sociability, and brattiness. These three
   were measured in terms of the combined ratings of mothers and teachers.
   Maternal attentiveness and overprotectiveness was measured in terms of
   the mothers rating their own behaviour. Only children were found to
   score similarly to others on popularity and sociability, but scored
   worse than others on the brattiness scale. Maternal attentiveness was
   found to be correlated significantly with all three social competence
   scores, indicating that mothers who evaluated themselves as more
   attentive to their children had children who were evaluated as being
   more popular, sociable, and less bratty. However, mothers of only
   children were not found to score differently than other mothers on
   attentiveness or overprotectiveness. The findings about only children
   were interpreted in terms of Korean perspectives on play.

AB Context Tobacco and alcohol use among youth are major public health
   problems, but the extent to which children are routinely exposed to
   tobacco and alcohol products in children's films is unknown.
   Objective To identify the prevalence and characteristics associated with
   tobacco and alcohol use portrayed in C-rated, animated feature films.
   Design All C-rated, animated feature films released between 1937 and
   1997 by 5 major production companies (Walt Disney Co, MGM/United
   Artists, Warner Brothers Studios, Universal Studios, and 20th Century
   Fox) that were available on videotape were reviewed for episodes of
   tobacco and alcohol use.
   Main Outcome Measures Presence of tobacco and alcohol use in each film,
   type of tobacco or alcohol used, duration of use, type of character
   using substance (bad, neutral, or good), and any associated effects.
   Results Of 50 films reviewed, 34 (68%) displayed at least 1 episode of
   tobacco or alcohol use. Twenty-eight (56%) portrayed 1 or more
   incidences of tobacco use, including all 7 films released in 1996 and
   1997. Twenty-five films (50%) included alcohol use. Smoking was
   portrayed on screen by 76 characters for more than 45 minutes in
   duration; alcohol use was portrayed by 63 characters for 27 minutes.
   Good characters use tobacco and alcohol as frequently as bad characters.
   Cigars and wine are shown in these films more often than other tobacco
   or alcohol substances.
   Conclusions More than two thirds of animated children's films feature
   tobacco or alcohol use in story plots without dear verbal messages of
   any negative long-term health effects associated with use of either
   substance.

   under two experimental conditions. During one condition students
   acknowledged their hearing losses, spoke about adjustment, concerns,
   etc., while during the other condition they did not acknowledge their
   hearing loss. Results indicated that subjects preferred speakers when
   they discussed their hearing loss. Speakers who acknowledged their
   hearing loss also received more favorable ratings on personality,

   portrayed in a variety of frequency/topography combinations including
   low frequency/mild topography, low frequency/severe topography, high
   frequency/mild topography, and high frequency/severe topography.
   Participants were randomly assigned to one of four habit conditions
   (motor tie, vocal tie, Tourette's disorder, and trichotillomania) and
   were asked to rate the social acceptability of the frequency/topography
   combinations exhibited by each actor. Results showed that across the
   various habit conditions, the man with the habit was seen as less
   socially acceptable than the woman with the habit. In addition,
   low-frequency habit behaviors were more acceptable than high-frequency
   behaviors, and behaviors with mild topographies were more acceptable
   than those with severe topography habits. Motor ties were seen as more
   acceptable than vocal ties, Tourette's disorder, or trichotillomania.
   Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

   disorder (PD) explicitly linked to a person's physical appearance. This
   study examined the HPD-attractiveness link in a mixed-sex sample of
   college students. Consistent with expectations, HPD women were rated
   higher in attractiveness than women with other PDs or no PD. However, a
   parallel HPD-attractiveness link was not found in men. Subsequent
   analyses indicated that, relative to less attractive HPD women, more
   attractive HPD women (a) had a more varied and supportive social
   network, (b) exhibited more negative behaviors in important
   relationships, and (c) showed greater use of immature defenses, and less
   reliance on image-distorting, self-sacrificing, and mature defenses.
   Similar attractiveness-defense relationships were found in HPD men, but
   parallel results did not emerge for men in the other two domains.
   Implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions for future
   studies are offered.

AB Objective: This study examined early school-based academic and social
   variables with concurrent family conflict in predicting adolescent
   alcohol and other drug use. Method: 365 children were assessed initially
   in grades 2-4 on academic-related and social behavior variables using
   teacher ratings and rankings, peer nominations and ratings and direct
   observation of playground and classroom behavior. They were reassessed
   in grades 9-10, using interviews and questionnaires to determine the
   initiation and sequence of their use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and
   other hard drugs. Results: In three sets of analyses, independently for
   males and females, lifetime abstainers were compared with adolescents
   who had used (1) only alcohol; (2) alcohol and tobacco; (3) alcohol,
   tobacco and marijuana; and (4) all three plus other hard drugs. The drug
   classifications represent a normative-deviant continuum of adolescent
   drug use. Constructs were developed for early academic and social
   predictors as well as concurrent family conflict. The results showed
   more wide-ranging academic and social difficulties during elementary
   school for children falling at the more deviant end of the drug use
   continuum. For girls, the concurrent home environment appeared to
   moderate the effect of early academic and social variables. Conclusions:
   Substance use established by ages 14-15 can be predicted by academic and
   social behavior displayed at ages 7-9. This suggests that prevention
   efforts for alcohol and other drugs may be more effective if directed at
   earlier antecedent behaviors rather than those that are concurrent with
   substance use.

AB Objective: Research indicates a marriage effect with respect to drinking
   and drinking problems. This effect is characterized by less consumption
   and fewer problems among married men and women as compared with either
   single or divorced individuals. Method: This article reviews evidence
   regarding processes that might account for the marriage effect. Results:
   The literature suggests that the marriage effect reflects three
   processes: (1) reduced alcohol consumption triggered by the transition
   to marriage, (2) the deleterious effect of heavy drinking on marital
   quality and marital stability and (3) increased consumption in response
   to the transition to divorce. Conclusions: Given the nature of these
   transitions, it is argued that transitions to marriage and divorce
   should be viewed as unique opportunities for adult prevention
   activities, but that more pre-prevention research focused on changes
   over these transitions is needed to help target prevention efforts.

   (and somewhat more father-reported externalizing problems at age 5), as
   well as more negative mothering and less positive fathering during the

   became insignificant once observed parenting was controlled, thereby
   providing evidence of the mediational effects of parenting. More time in

   adjustment on a composite lab-based measure of affective-cognitive
   functioning at age 5 (e.g., attributional bias, social problem solving,

AB Objective: The longitudinal association between blood pressure (BP)

   investigated in 83 Samoan adolescents from American and (Western) Samoa
   as part of a multidisciplinary study of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   risk in modern Samoans. Methods: Participants ranged in age from 11 to
   14 years at baseline, in 1992 to 1993, and 14 to 18 years at follow-up
   in 1996. Video game BP reactivity was defined as the residual score of
   the regression of the maximum BP during the video game on the minimum
   resting BP before the video game. The predictive effect of baseline
   video game BP reactivity on follow-up resting BP was tested using
   regression models with baseline resting BP, baseline body mass index
   (BMI), and age as covariates. Results: Systolic BP reactivity to the
   video game at baseline was significantly, p = .04, and independently
   associated with resting systolic BP 3 to 4 years later. Samoan
   adolescents who had higher systolic BP reactivity scores at baseline had
   significantly higher resting systolic BP at follow-up after adjustment
   for the significant effects of baseline resting systolic BP, age, and
   BMT. There were no interactions between sex and reactivity or between
   residence, American Samoa or (Western) Samoa, and reactivity in the
   models, indicating that the effects of systolic BP reactivity in early
   adolescence on later adolescent resting systolic BP were similar in the
   entire study sample, Conclusions: Video game cardiovascular reactivity
   seems to assess aspects of psychophysiological arousal and prospective
   CVD risk in Samoan adolescents of both sexes residing in both Samoas,
   and may be useful for understanding the role of psychosocial stress and

AB This study examines trends in proximate determinants of fertility in
   Zimbabwe and Kenya. Findings from the four Demographic and Health
   Surveys conducted in these countries show that the dramatic fall in
   fertility in these countries is consistent with the underlying trends in
   the most important proximate determinants of fertility. In Zimbabwe,
   contraceptive use far exceeds other proximate determinants in
   influencing fertility levels and trends. The results show that the
   fertility inhibiting effects of contraception are more important than
   the effects of postpartum infecundability, marriage patterns, or
   sterility. The results also show that contraceptive use has its greatest
   suppressing effects in the middle and younger age groups. However, in
   Kenya, the dominant fertility inhibiting effect is postpartum
   infecundability, with contraception coming in second.

AB Suicide data from Sweden (1911-1993) and New Zealand (1975-1995) were
   used to test a hypothesis derived as an extension of the Seasonal
   Affective Disorder concept. Contrary to the hypothesis, but similar to
   what Durkheim had reported regarding Central Europe in the nineteenth
   century, suicides peaked in late spring (May in Sweden, November in New
   Zealand). Durkheim's hypothesis that there would be more monthly
   variation in suicides in rural areas was strongly supported. Our
   hypothesis is that people abandon life when it is least difficult
   because of a disjuncture between experience and expectation.

AB The notion of the constraint (or degree of organization) of belief
   systems is a potentially fruitful one in both political science and
   sociology. Existing attempts to measure constraint, however, have had
   severe drawbacks, both conceptual and methodological. This paper argues
   that this constraint is better conceived of as the absence of dispersion
   in a table of cross-classified beliefs and demonstrates that measures
   based on this conception are better at discerning the presence of
   constraint where it is quite likely to exist, namely, in small,
   ideologically focused groups. The approach to constraint outlined here
   has a number of other advantages: it is equally appropriate to interval,
   ordinal, or nominal data; it does not require external criteria of what
   responses should be associated with others; it is not
   variance-dependent; it does not assume that constraint is equivalent to
   either reduced dimensionality or pairwise association; and it is equally
   appropriate for mass and nonmass belief systems. It is also simple to
   conduct tests of significance difference across populations. Finally,
   this paper outlines the proper way to standardize such measures, which
   applies to other uses of the entropy measure, such as the quantification
   of income inequality. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB As the scare of the '80s demonstrated, sociology finds itself in the
   dubious position of being vulnerable within the university while being
   vitally dependent upon the university for its existence. In response,
   sociology has accommodated market-driven changes in the university by
   expanding entrepreneurial forms of research and has struggled to
   legitimate itself professionally. These quests, however, have removed
   sociology further from the reaches of the broader public, diminishing
   its long-standing tradition of addressing public issues. Re-establishing
   the vitality of the discipline will require sociology to reclaim its
   public. To do so, changes will have to be made within the profession
   that encourage the role of public intellectuals, while efforts will have
   to be made to expand public spaces where public discourse and social
   action can occur.

   how these dissenters against illegal or unethical behavior were able to
   sustain their demand for accountable behavior by government and

   whistleblowers and one hundred and forty activists, union officials,
   business executives and journalists, focuses on the significance of
   social capital in generating protest; the whistleblowers' and activists'
   strong cultural commitment to the efficacy of action; their
   determination to accumulate the evidence and expertise; their ability to
   secure strategically placed allies; and their mechanisms for overcoming
   fear and intimidation. The authors conclude by indicating the
   significance of sociology in analyzing, legitimizing, and publicizing
   the contributions of courageous individuals to the creation and
   maintenance of a democratic society.

AB This article begins with an autobiographical reflection about what
   sociology has meant to me as an Iranian intellectual. Sociology has
   enabled me to think critically about my country's politics and culture,
   appreciating its strengths without overlooking its unjust and injurious
   aspects. That experience shapes my answer to the question "Saving
   Sociology?" If there is anything in sociology that I would like to
   save-in both senses "to keep" and "to rescue"-it is sociology as a
   critical, reflective discipline, a discipline that not only studies
   society but also contributes to its change. As the contemporary world
   moves toward a "global" society, we are increasingly facing the dilemmas
   of multiculturalism. Sociologists often investigate other societies or
   (like myself) look back at their own from a spatial and cultural
   distance. This situation has created a dilemma for many scholars: Should
   we criticize problems stemming from "indigenous" beliefs and practices
   of other societies? Cultural relativism argues that different cultures
   provide indigenous answers to their social problems that should be
   judged in their own context. While this approach correctly encourages us
   to avoid ethnocentrism, it has led to inaction towards the suffering of
   oppressed groups. Reflecting on the relativist approach to sexual
   dominance, I question some cultural relativist assumptions. Discussing
   how "indigenous" responses to male domination in many cases disguise and
   protect that domination, I will challenge the "localist" approach of
   relativism and argue for a universalist approach.

AB What is the value-added character of sociology? In an era of change and
   unease in higher education, can a case be made for sociology in terms of
   intellectual and scholarly substance rather than in terms of
   bureaucratic and political considerations? As a scholarly and
   instructional activity, what is the value of sociology beyond what other
   disciplines have to offer? I address these questions affirmatively in
   this paper by identifying and elaborating four distinctive foci of the
   sociological eye that together frame the window onto the world that
   sociology provides. These distinctive features are a focus on the
   relational connections among the constituent elements of the objects of
   sociological analysis; a focus on the socially contextual embeddedness
   of those objects of analysis; a focus on vexing social conditions and
   processes construed as social problems; and an ironic perspective, that
   is, a penchant for discerning and illuminating the incongruous,
   unexpected, discrepant aspects of social life. I argue that these foci
   are more pronounced in sociology than in other social sciences and that
   together they congeal into a window onto the social world that is unique
   among the social sciences and humanities, thus accounting for the
   value-added character of sociology.

   that attempters are significantly more likely than ideators and
   nonsuicidal youth to have experienced physical or sexual abuse by an
   adult caretaker to have experienced sexual victimization while on their
   own, and to have a friend who attempted suicide. Multivariate analyses
   reveal five variables that best distinguish among the three groups:
   self-esteem, depression, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and having a
   friend who attempted suicide. Further analysis suggests that the
   accumulation of these risk factors greatly increases the chance that
   these youth will engage in suicidal behavior.

EP 44
PD March, 1999
PY 1999
AB Objective: The current study was designed to elucidate familial and
   social influences on adolescent alcohol consumption by testing three
   hypotheses derived from the prototype/willingness model of adolescent
   risk behavior: (1) parents' prototypes of adolescent drinkers affect
   adolescent consumption through their impact on adolescents' prototypes,
   (2) strong parent-child relationships are associated with acceptance of
   parental influence regarding drinking and thus with less adolescent
   drinking and (3) association with peers who drink dilutes parental
   influence over adolescents' alcohol consumption. Method: Two hundred
   sixty-six rural adolescents, ages 15 through 17 at Time 1, and their
   parents and siblings completed questionnaires about drinking behavior
   and drinking-related cognitions at 1-year intervals for 3 years.
   Results: Structural equation models provided evidence of transmission of
   prototypes of adolescent drinkers from parents to adolescents and
   evidence that these prototypes mediate adolescent alcohol consumption.
   They also provide evidence that although parents' prototypes and
   parent-adolescent relationships are important in shaping the
   adolescents' drinking, association with peers who drink significantly
   attenuates this influence. Conclusions: These data suggest that parents
   can influence their children's drinking, but that this influence has
   more of an impact if the adolescent is not involved in a
   drinking-conducive peer environment. The current analyses also suggest
   that the process of becoming an adolescent drinker involves an active
   rejection of parents' influence rather than a passive movement away from
   parents' attitudes and beliefs-a process that is accelerated by
   association with peers who drink.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the contributions of

   Method: Observational and self-report data on these variables were
   gathered from mothers, fathers and target children during home visits to
   a purposive random sample of 171 intact white families with a 10- to
   12-year-old child, 85 with girls and 86 with boys. Results: Liberality
   in children's norms was associated with active, sensation-seeking
   temperament, liberality in parents' norms and poor parent-child
   relationship quality. Positive parent-child, particularly father-child,
   relationships were associated with less liberal child norms even when
   parents' norms were liberal and children's temperaments were active and
   sensation oriented. Conclusions: Positive parent-child relationships
   have a conventionalizing effect on children's alcohol use norms that
   moderates the effects of temperament and parental norms. The development
   of alcohol use norms is best described by transactional models.

   American families. Studies of family risk and resiliency should
   distinguish between threats to the family's ability to function as a
   whole, and threats to the well-being of individual members. Additional

AB Objective: The purpose of this overview is to highlight the ways that
   cultural and familial factors may buffer children and adolescents from
   initiating alcohol use. Method: This article uses the findings from
   studies of black and Hispanic adolescent and adult alcohol use to
   identify potentially important cultural and familial variables that
   buffer these groups from early alcohol use and misuse, abuse or
   dependence. Results: We begin with the notion that negative beliefs
   regarding alcohol and its effects protect young children from early
   alcohol involvement. We then consider how, for blacks and Hispanics,
   family structure, parent-child interaction patterns and value
   orientations function to maintain these negative belief schemas, thereby
   protecting children and adolescents from involvement with alcohol.
   Conclusions: We conclude by emphasizing the importance of studying
   "nonmainstream" groups who are more likely to abstain from alcohol use.
   In doing this, research can more easily identify those family practices
   that produce the negative beliefs about alcohol consumption and thereby
   prevent early experimentation and adolescent alcohol abuse.

AB Aims. Children whose parents abuse drugs are exposed to numerous factors
   that increase the likelihood of future drug abuse. Despite this
   heightened risk, few experimental tests of prevention programs with this
   population have been reported. This article examines whether intensive
   family-focused interventions with methadone treated parents can reduce
   parents' drug use and prevent children's initiation of drug use. Design.
   Parents were assigned randomly into intervention and control conditions
   and assessed at baseline, post-test, and 6 and 12 months following the
   intervention. Children were assessed at baseline, and 6- and 12-month
   follow-up points. Setting. Two methadone clinics in Seattle, Washington.
   Participants. One hundred and forty-four methadone-treated parents, and
   their children (n = 178) ranging in age from 3 to 14 years old.
   Intervention. The experimental intervention supplemented methadone
   treatment with 33 sessions of family training combined with 9 months of
   home-based case management. Families in the control condition received
   no supplemental services. Measurement. Parent measures included: relapse
   and problem-solving skills, self-report measures of family management
   practices, deviant peer networks, domestic conflict and drug use. Child
   measures included self-report measures of rules, family attachment,
   parental involvement, school attachment and misbehavior, negative peers,
   substance use and delinquency. Findings. One year after the family
   skills training, results indicate significant positive changes among
   parents, especially in the areas of parent skills, parent drug use,
   deviant peers and family management. Few changes were noted in
   children's behavior or attitudes. Conclusions. Programs such as this may
   be an important adjunct to treatment programs, helping to strengthen
   family bonding and to reduce parents' drug use.

   responded to an extensive 2.5-hour interview questionnaire focusing on
   current and past activities, including criminal activities prior to age
   12. The findings revealed that early deviance, assessed by self-report
   measures of both severity and variety, is related to current adolescent
   drug and alcohol use, association with deviant peers, a negative view of
   home atmosphere, and psychological symptomatology. These results are
   contrasted with the retrospective reports of adolescent behavior
   obtained from adult male narcotic addicts in a prior study of
   vulnerability to addiction. The comparability of study results is
   discussed in the context of developmental risk factors, prevention and

AB Objectives. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a community youth
   service (CYS) program in reducing sexual risk behaviors among African
   American and Latino urban young adolescents.
   Methods. A total of 1061 students at 2 urban middle schools were
   surveyed at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Students at one school were
   randomly assigned by classroom to receive either the Reach for Health
   CYS program or the Reach for Health classroom curriculum only. Students
   at the other school served as controls.
   Results. At follow-up, CYS participants reported significantly less
   recent sexual activity (P<.05) and scored lower on a sexual activity
   index than those in the control condition (P<.03). The greatest effect
   was among eighth graders, who received the most intensive service
   program (P<.03). The benefit of the curriculum-only intervention
   appeared greatest among students in special education classes.
   Conclusions. Well-organized CYS that couples community involvement with
   classroom health instruction can have a positive impact on the sexual
   behaviors of young adolescents at risk for HN; sexually transmitted
   diseases, and unintended pregnancy. This study also suggests the
   importance of including students in special education classes in health
   education programs.

AB Objectives. This study investigated whether acculturation was associated
   with the receipt of clinical breast examinations and mammograms among
   Colombian, Ecuadorian, Dominican, and Puerto Rican women aged 18 to 74
   years in New York City in 1992. Methods. A bilingual, targeted,
   random-digit-dialed telephone survey was conducted among 908 Hispanic
   women from a population-based quota sample. Outcome measures included
   ever and recent use of clinical breast examinations and mammograms.
   Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the effect
   of acculturation on screening use. Results. When demographic,
   socioeconomic, and health system characteristics and cancer attitudes
   and beliefs were controlled for, women who were more acculturated had
   significantly higher odds of ever and recently receiving a clinical
   breast examination (P ltoreq .01) and of ever (P ltoreq .01) and
   recently (P ltoreq .05) receiving a mammogram than did less acculturated
   women. For all screening measures, there was a linear increase in the
   adjusted probability of being screened as a function of acculturation.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood and health system interventions to increase
   screening among Hispanic women should target the less acculturated.

   Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a representative
   sample of 488 women 15 to 49 years of age.
   Results. The lifetime prevalence of spousal violence was 52% among
   ever-married women (n = 360). Spousal violence was significantly
   positively associated with poverty, parity, urban residence, and history
   of violence in the husband's family. No significant associations were
   found between spousal violence and women's age, education, marital
   dependency, or occupation.
   Conclusions. Wife abuse constitutes a major public heat problem in
   Nicaragua, requiring urgent measures for prevention and treatment for
   victims.

AB Background Previous evidence from the Alameda County Study indicated
   that residential area has an independent effect on risk for mortality,
   adjusting for a variety of important individual characteristics. The
   current research examined the effect of poverty area residence on risk
   for developing depressive symptoms and decline in perceived health
   status in a sample of 1737.
   Methods Data were from a longitudinal population-based cohort. Multiple
   logistic regression analyses were used.
   Results Age- and sex-adjusted risk for incident high levels of
   depressive symptoms in 1974 was higher for poverty area residents (odds
   ratio [OR] 2.14; confidence interval [CI] : 1.49-3.06). Those reporting
   excellent/good health in 1965 were at higher risk for having fair/poor
   health in 1974 if they lived in a poverty area (age- and sex-adjusted OR
   3.30; CI: 2.32-4.71). Independent of individual income, education,
   smoking status, body mass index, and alcohol consumption, poverty area
   residence remained associated with change in outcome variables.
   Conclusions These results further support the hypothesis that
   characteristics of place affect health conditions and health status.

AB Medical and behavioral research depicts the influence of testosterone on

   latter potentially detrimental ones. We investigate the relationship
   between testosterone and health risk behavior indicators of disease, and
   overall health in a sample of 4393 men who were interviewed and
   medically examined. Analysis revealed that having a high level of
   testosterone, compared to a low level, increased the odds of health risk
   behavior With respect to disease, high testosterone increased the odds
   of some health problems but decreased the chances of others. At very
   high levels testosterone loses many of its beneficial effects. Overall,
   men with high testosterone would be healthier if they did not engage in

AB This paper looks at the independent contributions of the setting and the
   intensity of after-school self-care to the cigarette smoking behaviors
   of 2352 ninth graders. We controlled for a variety of correlates of
   adolescent cigarette smoking that have not been accounted for in
   existing research. Results indicated that the intensity of the self-care
   experience was significantly associated with adolescent smoking behavior
   irrespective of the typical setting of the adolescents' after-school
   activities. Our findings also indicated that a nonpermissive parenting
   style, family rule-setting about cigarettes, and especially, in absentia
   parental monitoring may reduce the likelihood of cigarette smoking among
   latchkey and nonlatchkey adolescents alike. However latchkey youth were
   not any more sensitive to these aspects of parenting than other
   adolescents. This is consistent with the notion that targeting these
   aspects of the horne lives of all adolescents has the potential to
   reduce smoking behaviors among latchkey as well as nonlatchkey children.

AB We tested whether the presence of a stranger reduces cardiovascular
   responses during stressful tasks if the evaluation potential of the
   stranger is minimized and whether cardiovascular responses are affected
   by the quality of support in a friendship. Undergraduate women performed
   stressful tasks in one of three conditions: Alone, with a same-sex
   Stranger or with a same-sex best Friend. The stranger and friend could
   not hear participants' responses. Alone women had the greatest increases
   in SEP and HR while women in the Stranger and Friend conditions did not
   differ in their responses. In the Friend condition, HR responses were
   smallest in women who were highly satisfied with the support that they
   generally received from their friend. We conclude that the presence of a
   nonevaluative friend or stranger can reduce cardiovascular responses and
   that the quality of supportive ties modulates the impact of those ties
   on responses to stress.

AB Objective: To investigate the relationship between community-level
   socioeconomic factors and the incidence of gang-related homicide in the
   city of Los Angeles,
   Methods: An ecological group-level analysis was conducted to correlate
   the 5-year incidence rates (from 1988 through 1992) of gang-related
   homicide with community-level socioeconomic statistics for the 18
   geographically distinct Los Angeles Police Department divisions, Eight
   socioeconomic factors were examined: (1) log mean per capita income, (2)
   proportion employed, (3) proportion high school graduates, (4)
   proportion single-parent families, (5) proportion male, (6) proportion
   younger than 20 years of age, (7) proportion African American, and (8)
   proportion Hispanic. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated
   for the interrelationships among the study variables and gang-related
   homicide. Adjusted regression estimates were calculated from a multiple
   linear regression model,
   Results: The overall 5-year gang-related homicide rate for the city was
   48.8 per 100,000, with a range of 5.2 to 173.5 per 100,000 among the
   different Los Angeles Police Department divisions. Pearson correlation
   coefficients revealed that the strongest negative correlations with
   gang-related homicide were log mean per capita income and proportion
   employed, and the strongest positive correlations were proportion
   single-parent families and proportion younger than 20 years of age. With
   mutual adjustment of all variables, only log mean per capita income and
   proportion employed sere significantly associated with gang-related
   homicide.
   Conclusion: At the community level, gang-related homicide in Los Angeles
   is most closely associated with lower income and unemployment, These
   relationships may provide important insights into the causes of gang
   formation and gang violence.

AB Based on a case study of Florida's Family Transition Program (FTP), the
   first time-limited welfare program implemented in the United states, we
   argue that extra-legal "rules" and popular definitions of success can
   constrain bureaucratic action and shape policy outcomes. On paper, the
   FTP permitted considerable discretion in the administration of
   post-time-limit benefits and included a job guarantee far compliant
   participants; yet, as the program was implemented both the job guarantee
   and the benefit extensions were virtually eliminated through
   administrative procedures. In contrast to what we would expect from
   current theories of bureaucracy, the unwillingness of administrators to
   make else of their formal capacity could not be accounted for by the
   actions of interest groups or street-level bureaucrats, nor could it be
   explained solely by a lack of resources. Using a combination of insights
   from historical institutionalism ir: political sociology and
   neo-institutionalism in organisational analysis and bringing a new
   emphasis on the power of the media to define programmatic success, we
   argue that the legitimacy of the FTP would have been threatened if
   administrators made use of some of the policy options permitted by law.
   We conclude by offering three hypotheses on the relationship between
   media attention and bureaucratic action.

AB Although Harvey Sacks' 'Max Weber's Ancient Judaism' is an early student
   paper, it raises issues of theory, method and disciplinary mandate which
   have continuing relevance. I frame the article in two ways. First, I
   sketch the academic and intellectual context in which the paper was
   written, in particular the institutional setting in Berkeley of the
   early 1960s, and the activities and preoccupations animating the work of
   the group of students which was the most proximate context for Sacks'
   writing at this time, including the efforts to come to terms with
   Garfinkel's early work. Second, I relate this article to two others
   written by Sacks in roughly the same period, and sketch a thematic
   continuity and development running through them - a theme whose endpoint
   is the centrality of what must surely be called 'culture' to the calling
   of Sociology.

   Methods A question was included in a survey conducted in 1991 that
   explored sexual behaviors and attitudes among a random stratified sample
   of 599 students representative of the undergraduate population of a
   state university in the Midwest.
   Participants The participants originated from 29 states, including all 4

   Main Outcome Measure Percentage of respondents who believed the
   interaction described constituted having "had sex."
   Results individual attitudes varied regarding behaviors defined as
   having "had sex": 59% (95% confidence interval, 54%-63%) of respondents
   indicated that oral-genital contact did not constitute having "had sex"
   with a partner, Nineteen percent responded similarly regarding
   penile-anal intercourse.
   Conclusions The findings support the view that Americans hold widely
   divergent opinions about what behaviors do and do not constitute having
   "had sex.".

AB BACKGROUND. Increasingly, the quality of life (QOL) of women diagnosed
   with breast carcinoma is being studied. However, there is little
   information regarding long term survivors among ethnic minority women.
   The purpose of this study was to describe the QOL of long term breast
   carcinoma survivors (BCS) and to examine the role of ethnicity in
   influencing their well-being.
   METHODS. The authors conducted a mailed survey to examine QOL, health
   perceptions, and life stress among long term BCS. Subjects diagnosed
   between 1989 and 1990 were identified among respondents to a prior study
   who were originally recruited from the California Tumor Registry. This
   survey instrument included standard measures of QOL (e.g., the RAND
   SF-36 Health Perceptions Scale, the Cancer Rehabilitation and Evaluation
   Survey-Short Form [CARES-SF], and the Ladder of Life) and new items.
   RESULTS. Two hundred and seventy-eight women participated; 117 were
   African-American, and 161 were white. The initial univariate evaluation
   of the CARES-SE and the RAND SF-36 Health Perceptions Scale suggested
   potential ethnicity-related differences in QOL. To control for various
   medical and demographic characteristics and to examine the potential
   relation between ethnicity and QOL, multiple regression analyses were
   conducted. The final model accounted for 45% (R-square = 0.450) of the
   variance in QOL with general health perception, life stress, income,
   partnership status, and comorbid conditions included in the model.
   CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study suggest that, overall, BCS report
   favorable health-related QOL. Differences in QOL outcomes are
   attributable to socioeconomic and life-burden factors and not to
   ethnicity. (C) 1999 American Cancer Society.

   Setting A single rural municipality in northern El Salvador,
   Participants A representative sample of 761 children younger than 5
   years, living in 27 villages.
   Main Outcome Measure Prevalence of stunting (low height for age) in
   children younger than 5 years.
   Results Prevalence of stunting was 32.4%. Stunting was significantly
   more prevalent among children whose families cultivated less land (odds
   ratio [OR] for stunting per additional hectare of redistributed land
   cultivated, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.93). Less than
   half of newly transferred land was being cultivated by its owners. Most
   of the children (84.7%) lived in families cultivating 2 hectares or less
   of redistributed land. Stunting was also more prevalent among children
   whose households lacked piped water (adjusted OR, 2.72; 95% CI,
   1.87-3.96) vs those who had had piped water since before the cease-fire.
   Conclusions Malnutrition, particularly stunting, persisted at high
   levels and was strongly associated with delay in full cultivation of
   redistributed land and in provision of water.

   assessing the frequency and severity of family aggression (aggression
   between parents, parental aggression directed toward participants), as
   well as the frequency and severity of participants' aggression across a
   number of relationship types (dating, friends, strangers, people in
   bars, co-workers, bosses, police officers). The results of the present
   study indicate that a substantial proportion of college-aged males
   report a history of aggressive behavior, both in dating/spousal
   relationship and other-relationship types. Analyses revealed that
   observing parental aggression and receiving aggression from parents was
   related to aggression in dating relationships. However, only received
   aggression from parents was related to more general aggressiveness in
   other non-dating/spousal relationship types. The pattern of findings
   also suggest that it is important to assess the aggressive behavior of
   both parents to get a better understanding of the link between family
   aggression and later expressed agression. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This study documents the activities of 635 porters transporting goods
   along three traditional trade routes of eastern Nepal. Nearly 95% of the
   porters were male. They ranged in age from 10-65 years, and most of them
   had begun to perform long-distance portage at 12-15 years of age. Mean
   body mass and height of adult males in the combined sample (n = 438) was
   49.7 +/- 5.0 kg and 155.5 +/- 6.5 cm, respectively. Adult males age
   20-49 years carried loads of 73 +/- 15 kg, equivalent to 146% +/- 30% of
   body mass. Body size of adult males was not a strong predictor of load
   weight. The correlation between body mass and load was r = 0.24 (P <
   0.0001), and between height and load was r = 0.16 (P < 0.001). Another
   significant determinant of load weight was whether the load was carried
   for profit or for domestic use. The most reasonable explanation for the
   ability of Nepali porters to carry such large loads in spite of their
   small body size is the ability to pace themselves by making frequent
   rest stops. Heart rate monitoring of 26 adult male commercial porters
   demonstrated how porters regulate heart rate and energy expenditure by
   resting the load every two to three minutes on the T-headed walking
   stick (tokma) and by setting the load periodically on load-resting
   platforms (chautaras) for longer recovery periods. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss,

AB Populations of African descent in North and South America have higher
   mean blood pressures and higher rates of hypertension than populations
   of European descent or populations in A ti ica. Within populations of
   African descent, darker skinned persons have higher blood pressures than
   lighter skinned persons. Whether examined within or between populations,
   there is an interaction between skin color and socioeconomic status
   (SES) in relation to blood pressure, with persons with dark skin color
   and low SES having the highest blood pressures. This interaction was
   examined in Brazil using a measure of a cultural dimension of SES called
   "cultural consonance in lifestyle." This measure was derived using
   cultural consensus analysis linked with social survey data. It was found
   that darker skinned Brazilians with lower cultural consonance in
   lifestyle had adjusted systolic blood pressures 16.2 mm Hg higher than
   darker skinned Brazilians with higher cultural consonance (P < .01); the
   corresponding difference in adjusted diastolic blood pressure was 9.7 mm
   Hg (P < .04). The differences for lighter skinned Brazilians were 6.4 mm
   Hg (P < .02) and 1.0 mm Hg (not significant), respectively. These
   results could be due either to an interaction of genetic predisposition
   and SES, or the result of a socially and culturally-mediated process.
   Given that cultural consonance in lifestyle measures the ability of the
   person to live up to cultural norms, and given the existence of racial
   stratification in Brazil, it is argued that a social and cultural
   mediation of the relationship is more plausible. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss,

AB Project HeartBeat! is a four year mixed-longitudinal study of the
   development of cardiovascular risk factors in White and African American
   children who at baseline comprised three age cohorts 8, 11, and 14
   years. This paper focuses on the anthropometric variables which were
   chosen to reflect body fat and fat-free mass. Selected anthropometric
   dimensions are compared with those of samples from the combined National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys I and II to explore the
   similarities of the samples in terms of central tendencies and
   variances. The measurements were then explored in terms of their ability
   to estimate the two compartment model of body composition: fat-free mass
   (FFM) and body fat (BF) from bioelectrical impedance (BIA). Project
   HeartBeat! children are slightly larger than NHANES children and have
   variances that are generally comparable to the national surveys. Over
   seven percent (7.7%) of children were overweight (BMI) and 25% had 'mild
   obesity' by %BF. Three different factor analytic methods (incomplete
   principal components, alpha and maximum likelihood) produced two latent
   variables from 17 anthropometric dimensions which together accounted for
   76-83% of the variation: (1) A body mass factor (F1) which was weighted
   highly on six circumferences, weight and six skinfolds, and (2) a linear
   growth factor (F2) which was strongly associated with height, arm
   length, and sitting height. Triceps, subscapular and midaxillary
   skinfolds were consistently highly loaded on the body mass factor and
   their sum was highly correlated to %BF and fat mass (0.90-0.99). This
   suggests that this sum could be used to estimate fatness in children in
   studies where the BIA or other body composition techniques are
   unavailable. FFM and %BF were predicted from the anthropometric factors.
   Both factors contributed to the estimate of FFM (R-2 = 0.81-0.93),
   although F2 contributed proportionately more. The 'body mass' factor
   (F1) was the main predictor of %BF (R-2 = 0.86-0.93), though at some
   ages the linear factor (F2) was significantly and negatively related to
   %BF. This set of anthropometric dimensions, taken for the purpose of
   estimating body composition and summarized as two latent vectors by
   factor analysis, strongly reflects body fat and FFM in children and
   adolescents. (C) 1999 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB Objectives. This study analyzed trends in health insurance coverage in
   the United Stares from 1989 through 1996.
   Methods. Data from annual cross-sectional surveys by the US Census
   Bureau were analyzed.
   Results. Between 1989 and 1996, the number of uninsured persons
   increased by 8.3 million (90% confidence interval [CI] = 7.7, 8.9
   million). In 1996, 41.7 million (90% CI = 40.9, 42.5 million) lacked
   insurance. From 1989 to 1993, the proportion with Medicaid increased by
   3.6 percentage points (90% CI = 3.1, 4.0), while the proportion with
   private insurance declined by 4.2 percentage points (90% CI = 3.7, 4.7).
   From 1993 to 1996 private coverage rates stabilized but did not reverse
   earlier declines. Consequently, the number uninsured continued to
   increase.
   The greatest increase in the population of insured was among young
   adults aged 18 to 39 years; rates among children also rose steeply after
   1992. While Blacks had the largest percentage increase, Hispanics
   accounted for 36.4% (90% CI = 32.3%, 40.5%) of the increase in the
   number uninsured. From 1989 to 1993, the majority of the increase was
   among poor families. Since then, middle-income families have incurred
   the largest increase, Northcentral and northeastern states had the
   largest increases in percent uninsured.
   Conclusions. Despite economic prosperity, the numbers and rates of the
   uninsured continued to rise. Principally affected were children and
   young adults, poor and middle income families, blacks, and Hispanics.

   Methods. A probability sample of 164 noninstitutionalized older African
   Americans was assessed. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were
   regressed on education and reading ability measures.
   Results. Reading ability and educational attainment were significant,
   independent predictors of MMSE performance. Within any level of
   education, subjects whose grade-equivalent reading ability exceeded
   reported level of education scored significantly higher on the MMSE.
   Conclusions. Reading ability may be useful in interpreting the results

AB This essay engages the daunting task of encapsulating and reflecting on
   the 25 year history of the Annual Review of Sociology. After giving a
   short account of my own involvement in ARS, I give a brief rendition of
   what sociology as a field has been during the past quarter century-that
   is, what was "out there" to be reflected in the pages of ARS. I lay out
   some statistics on trends in the size, countries, and universities
   represented, coauthorship patterns, and gender ratios in ARS. These
   statistics are very informative but contain few surprises. Next I trace
   and analyze an issue that has commmanded the attention of editors of ARS
   throughout its history-unity or diversity of sociology as a discipline.
   Finally I conclude that the ARS does indeed reflect the field in ways
   that can be documented, but that this process of reflection is subject
   to many imprecisions generated by the editorial process itself.

AB The motivating engines of intellectual life are not true ideas but
   interesting ones. This article investigates the aphorism, the purest
   form of an interesting idea that draws the mind onward. It begins by
   examining the linguistic style of aphorisms, their reconceptions of
   experience from deceptive surfaces to more fundamental truths, their
   psychological and social effects on the vanity and status of their
   creators and conveyers, and the decline of their conceptual charisma
   into cliche until a surprising modification restarts the aphorism-cliche
   cycle. The investigation of aphorisms broadens to their intellectual and
   cultural contexts by examining their expansion into articles and
   collection into books, the different aspects of a topic revealed by
   aphoristic perspectives and scientific sequences, and the similarities
   (and differences) between aphoristic and postmodern ways of knowing.
   This article ends with a series of aphorisms on the cognitive substance
   of alluring knowledge, which distinguish some of the components of

AB Systems involving many interacting variables are at the heart of the
   natural and social sciences. Causal language is pervasive in the
   analysis of such systems, especially when insight into their behavior is
   translated into policy decisions. This is exemplified by economics, but
   to an increasing extent also by biology, due to the advent of
   sophisticated tools to identify the genetic basis of many diseases. It
   is argued here that a regularity notion of causality can only be
   meaningfully defined for systems with linear interactions among their
   variables. For the vastly more important class of nonlinear systems, no
   such notion is likely to exist. This thesis is developed with examples
   of dynamical systems taken mostly from mathematical biology. It is
   discussed with particular reference to the problem of causal inference
   in complex genetic systems, systems for which often only statistical
   characterizations exist.

AB Primary brain tumors are increasing in incidence in the United States
   and are devastating to patients and families. Because brain tumors and
   their treatment primarily affect the brain, psychiatric and psychosocial
   impact is rather unique. As opposed to systemic effects of other rumors
   and treatment, brain tumors have a direct effect on brain functioning
   and therefore affect cognition, mood and personality. In fact, patients
   undergo dynamic changes in mood and cognition, showing specific
   impairments in functioning. These impairments get translated into
   disabilities when a patient's daily functioning is impaired and may
   become a handicap when viewed in the context of quality of life (QOL).
   This article describes observed neuropsychiatric syndromes, including
   the apathy syndrome, and neurocognitive effects of brain tumors and
   their treatment. The neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive issues are
   discussed in the context of QOL and psychosocial and cognitive

EP 100
PD JAN-MAR 1999
PY 1999
AB This research examines barebacking, or unprotected sex. Specifically, we
   analyze one form of barebacking, known as bug chasing, in which
   HIV-negative gay men seek to become infected with the deadly virus that
   causes AIDS. As a form of sexual deviance, this practice relies on
   social structures generated through recent technological advances in the
   computer industry that simplify access to like-minded individuals. The
   research reports the reasons offered by participants for their continued
   involvement in such a high-risk activity and examines these explanations
   within the context of the larger cultural divisions over the meanings of
   sexual behavior for the formation and maintenance of personal
   identities.
   The sociology of sexual deviance traditionally includes prostitution,
   homosexuality, and pornography (Clinard and Meier 1998; Forsyth and
   Fournet 1987; Little 1983, 1995). Stripping, transvestism, and voyeurism
   are sometimes included as sexual deviance (Forsyth 1992,1996; Forsyth
   and Deshotels 1997, 1998; Fournet, Forsyth, and Schranm 1988). Other
   forms of sexual deviance, such as sadomasochism and sexual asphyxia
   (Lowery and Wetli 1982), have been virtually ignored. Consequently,
   several unusual forms of sexual practice remain sociologically "unknown"
   and are typically excluded from the literature.
   This research examines one recent manifestation of sociologically
   unknown sexual deviance: the phenomenon of barebacking, especially in
   the form known popularly as "bug chasing" (Bergling 1997; Gendin 1997;
   Peyser 1997; Signorile 1997a). Barebacking is the slang term used to
   describe sex that occurs without the protection provided by a condom and
   is usually a term reserved for reference to anal intercourse between gay
   men. Bug chasing is the term used to refer to the act of barebacking
   when the participants include both HIV-positive and HIV-negative gay
   men, and the latter knowingly seek infection by the former. With the
   recent explosion onto the scene of the World Wide Web (WWW), a forum now
   exists for providing links between like-minded individuals in pursuit of
   this goal. The following quote is taken from a recent posting on the
   WWW: "We're looking for pot-dudes who want to spread HIV around and
   neg-boyz in search of sero-conversion"(McCoy 1997:2). In an age when sex
   education is focused to a large extent on blocking the transmission of
   the deadly HIV virus, such deviant behavior may seem incomprehensible.
   The purpose of this research is to describe this form of sociological
   deviance, with hopes of suggesting explanations for the complex
   motivations that lie behind it.

AB A central thesis of this paper is that understanding the nature of child
   maltreatment is so complex that no one disciplinary specialty is likely
   to be sufficient for the task. Although life history theory is the
   guiding principle for our analysis, we argue that an evolutionary
   explanation adds precision by incorporating empirical findings
   originating from the fields of anthropology; clinical, developmental,
   and social psychology; and sociology. Although evolutionary accounts of
   child maltreatment have been largely limited to the role of the
   coefficient of relatedness, the prospective reproductive value of a
   child, and the residual reproductive potential of parents, a case is
   made for expanding this basic application. An explanatory model is
   presented that describes how ecological conditions as well as parental
   and child traits interact to influence the degree of parental
   investment. As shown in the model, these various "marker variables"
   alter parental perceptions of the benefits and costs associated with
   child care and promote low-investment parenting, which leads to
   disrupted family management practices and to a downward-spiraling,
   self-perpetuating system of coercive family interaction, increased
   parental rejection of the child, and even lower parental investment.
   Child maltreatment is the ultimate outcome of this downward trajectory
   of family relations.

AB In light of new welfare reforms, it is essential that public welfare

   Client alcohol and/or drug use/abuse is one barrier that may inhibit

   (rapid assessment instruments) and the Miller Substance Abuse Subtly

   system clients. Results indicated that the two rapid assessment measures
   strongly correlated with the advanced, commonly used SASSI measure. It
   is suggested that public welfare workers should institute these rapid
   assessment instruments at intake to screen clients for alcohol and drug
   use/abuse. When indicated, the client could then be referred to the
   appropriate agency for further. assessment and treatment, to better
   prepare them for employment as mandated by new welfare reforms. The
   rapid assessment instruments were found to be shorter than the SASSI,
   easily administered, and able to detect alcohol and/or drug use/abuse

AB Based on the first ethnography of urban political clientelism ever
   carried out in Argentina, this paper focuses on the public performances
   of female political broken belonging to the Peronist Party. Drawing on
   the analytical tools provided by cultural sociology and the anthropology
   of performance, the paper explores the way in which brokers, through
   their presentation of the self: attempt to foster impressions in their
   audiences and construct a particular sociodicy of their social place.
   When appearing in public, brokers (as other politicians) have a plethora
   of motives for trying to control the image the audience receives of the
   situation. The article examines some of the common techniques of
   impression-management utilized by the brokers in front of their audience
   (mostly poor people), each time they grant a favor, every time they hand
   out a food package or a needed medicine.

AB In an attempt to develop new approaches for the prevention and proper
   disposal of household hazardous wastes, a behavioral research project
   was conducted in Broome County, New York. Questionnaires were mailed to
   595 households randomly selected in three communities. The questions
   addressed several issues including the characteristics of wastes
   generated by residents, their awareness of the hazardousness of these
   products, and their current and preferred disposal practices. Twenty-six
   percent of the targeted households completed the surveys. In analyzing
   the data, a logistic regression model was developed to investigate the
   extent to which residents were willing to take part in a series of
   source reduction and collection events. The research findings provide
   the basis for developing alternative approaches to ensure the safe
   storage and proper disposal of these products.

AB Objective: To describe the developmental course of marijuana use among a
   group of American Indian adolescents, aged 14 through 20 years. Method:
   A group of 1,766 American Indian adolescents from 3 culture groups
   provided repeated measures of 30-day marijuana use twice a year across a
   3-year period. Linking 5 age cohorts, hierarchical linear modeling was
   used to model a curvilinear trajectory of marijuana use. Gender and
   community differences were examined as well. Results: Support was found
   for a "maturational" model of marijuana use across time: Use increased
   in middle adolescence, peaked in later adolescence, and began to
   decrease in early adulthood. Both gender and community differences in
   trajectories were significant as well. Conclusions: Marijuana use among
   American Indian adolescents follows a clear developmental trajectory.
   Growth curve analysis can provide an additional tool for studying the
   effects of interventions that may not be apparent in a traditional
   evaluation design.

   affected fishing communities across the northern Atlantic. Substantial
   declines hit their historically important resources, most notably the
   Atlantic cod. Such declines were often accompanied by increases in
   other, previously less exploited, species. Interactions between fishing
   pressure and environmental variation have driven ecological change.
   Ecological changes in turn reshaped the fisheries, contributing to
   altered demographic profiles of fisheries-dependent communities. Many
   places lost population, especially through out-migration of young
   adults. Broad social forces also contributed to these trends, but the
   timing and geographical details of population changes often correspond
   to specific fisheries/ecological events.

AB This study addressed a relatively neglected topic in schizophrenia:
   identifying methods to reduce stigma directed toward individuals with
   this disorder. The study investigated whether presentation of
   information describing the association between violent behavior and
   schizophrenia could affect subjects' impressions of the dangerousness of
   both a target person with schizophrenia and individuals with mental
   illness in general. Subjects with and without previous contact with
   individuals with a mental illness were administered one of four
   "information sheets" with varying information about schizophrenia and
   its association with violent behavior. Subjects then read a brief
   vignette of a male or female target individual with schizophrenia.
   Results showed that subjects who reported previous contact with
   individuals with a mental illness rated the male target individual and
   individuals with mental illness in general as less dangerous than did
   subjects without previous contact. Subjects who received information
   summarizing the prevalence rates of violent behavior among individuals
   with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders (e.g., substance
   abuse) rated individuals with a mental illness as less dangerous than
   did subjects who did not receive this information. Implications of the
   findings for public education are discussed.

   pre-education knowledge about and contact with severe mental illness,
   Eighty-three participants who were enrolled in either a course on severe
   mental illness or general psychology completed the Opinions about Mental
   Illness Questionnaire before beginning the course and at completion.
   Research participants also completed a pre- and posttest of knowledge
   about mental illness and a pretest on their contact with people who have
   severe mental illness, The education program had positive effects on
   some attitudes about mental illness. Interestingly, the effects of
   education group interacted with pre-education knowledge and contact and
   varied depending on attitude. Participants with more pre-education
   knowledge and contact were less likely to endorse benevolence attitudes
   after completing the education program. Participants with more intimate
   contact showed less improvement in attitudes about social
   restrictiveness. Implications of these augmentation and ceiling effects

AB The extent to which mental health consumers encounter stigma in their

   quality of life. This article summarizes the results of a nationwide
   survey of 1,301 mental health consumers concerning their experience of
   stigma and discrimination. Survey results and followup interviews with
   100 respondents revealed experience of stigma from a variety of sources,
   including communities, families, churches, coworkers, and mental health
   caregivers. The majority of respondents tended to try to conceal their
   disorders and worried a great deal that others would find out about
   their psychiatric status and treat them unfavorably. They reported
   discouragement, hurt, anger, and lowered self-esteem as results of their
   experiences, and they urged public education as a means for reducing
   stigma. Some reported that involvement in advocacy and speaking out when
   stigma and discrimination were encountered helped them to cope with
   stigma. Limitations to generalization of results include the
   self-selection, relatively high functioning of participants, and
   respondent connections to a specific advocacy organization-the National
   Alliance for the Mentally Ill.

AB We investigated the relation between the label of "schizophrenia" and
   causal attributions of violence. Undergraduates read 1 of 10 scenarios
   in which two variables were manipulated: a psychiatric label and
   environmental stress. The scenario described an employee who acted
   violently toward his boss. Subjects made causal attributions for the
   employee's behavior by completing an adapted version of the Causal
   Dimension Scale LT. Subjects also completed a questionnaire designed to
   explore several issues concerning the effects of the schizophrenia label
   on perceptions of behavior. Contrary to the primary hypothesis, the
   schizophrenia label did not lead subjects to make significantly more
   personality causal attributions for violent behavior. With increasing
   environmental stress, subjects did make significantly fewer personality
   attributions, A follow-up study using practicing clinicians as subjects
   yielded similar findings. The results of these studies are discussed in
   light of perceived stereotypes of persons with schizophrenia and

   (b) sexual history, (c) perceived HIV susceptibility, and (d) current
   sexual behavior, condom use, and alcohol and marijuana use of
   heterosexual, low-income African American and Hispanic youth categorized
   as relatively monogamous (n = 577), serial monogamous (n = 171), or
   nonmonogamous (n = 278),
   Study Design: Data were drawn from personal interviews with a
   probability sample of low-income youth, age 15 to 24 years, conducted in
   Detroit in 1991,
   Results: Many group differences were found. For example, relatively
   monogamous youth were most likely to be female and Hispanic and to have
   engaged in unprotected intercourse. Serial monogamous youth were younger
   and most likely to have used condoms at last intercourse. Nonmonogamous
   youth initiated intercourse earlier and were most likely to have
   experienced oral and anal intercourse and to have used alcohol and
   marijuana.
   Conclusion: Risk reduction programs may need to be tailored differently
   to accommodate the needs of these three distinct subgroups of youth.

AB The theoretical purview and contemporary political relevance of
   agro-food studies are restricted by their unexamined methodological
   foundations in modernist ontology. The nature-society dualism at the

   disciplines in the orthodox social sciences, outside the broad
   intellectual project that is advancing the greening of social theory,
   and militates against effective engagement with the bio-politics of
   environmental organizations and Green movements. The disabling
   consequences of the erasure of nature in agro-food studies are explored
   by analyzing several recent theoretical perspectives: the consumption
   'turn' in the work of Fine, Marsden and their respective colleagues, and
   Wageningen actor-oriented rural sociology. The merits of actor-network
   theory in resolving these ontological limitations are then considered
   using brief case-studies of food scares, agri-biotechnologies, and the
   recent proposals to regulate organic agriculture in the United States.

   modified theory provides a richer understanding of the complexity of
   relationships in death and dying than the previous literature which
   focuses on knowledge and the management of knowledge in social
   interactions in the context of dying. It is suggested that awareness
   based on knowledge and the cognitive processing of information not only
   obscures the emotional content of terminal illness, but also moves to
   the background the emotional work performed by dying patients and their
   families. The modified version of awareness theory recognises that
   emotion and cognition are intertwined and pays close attention to
   emotions within the social context.

AB This article offers a proposal for combining the sport sociological and
   sport psychological imaginations. In order to effect this rapprochement,
   some serious adjustments to the ways in which many applied sport
   psychologists and spore sociologists think about and conduct research
   are required. Thus, the initial part of this article expresses some
   critiques, albeit brief, of current tendencies within both sport
   sociology and sport psychology. We deemed these critiques necessary to
   advance a neo-Millsian position on the articulation of social structure
   and personality. This neo-Millsian position draws on the
   ego-psychoanalytical tradition to offer suggestions for how we might
   reconceive the problems of indispensability/expendability in the
   Prolympic structures of sport and for how we might, using a
   life-histories (biographical) methodology, engage in useful or practical
   research, especially on the problematics of how individuals
   handle/mishandle early, pre-career, and mid-career failure, and, in the
   long-run, inevitable failure at the end of their careers. Where, then,
   is the common ground between sport sociology and sport psychology? We
   argue that it is the analysis of ego-practices and ego-defenses as
   learned, consciously or unconsciously, over our biographical lives as
   they intersect with, and are contoured by, social history and social
   structure.

   how the crisis leads to the cohesion essential to recovery and
   rebuilding. This paper provides an analysis of a fire and its aftermath
   and shows how central emotions are to understanding the social
   psychology of the event. Most important here is the fact that when
   identifying themselves as fire victims, those affected by the disaster
   assumed that they experienced the same profound emotions at the same
   time. This emotional simultaneity led fire victims to emphasize their
   bonds to one another and heighten their boundaries with nonvictims. In
   turn, this led to their providing social support, comparative

   The research analyzes reviewers' comments regarding a recently published

   review affects sociology texts in at least five ways: (1) degree of

AB The extent to which mental health consumers encounter stigma in their
   daily lives is a matter of substantial importance for their recovery and
   quality of life. This article summarizes the results of a nationwide
   survey of 1,301 mental health consumers concerning their experience of
   stigma and discrimination. Survey results and followup interviews with
   100 respondents revealed experience of stigma from a variety of sources,
   including communities, families, churches, coworkers, and mental health
   caregivers. The majority of respondents tended to try to conceal their
   disorders and worried a great deal that others would find out about
   their psychiatric status and treat them unfavorably. They reported
   discouragement, hurt, anger, and lowered self-esteem as results of their
   experiences, and they urged public education as a means for reducing
   stigma. Some reported that involvement in advocacy and speaking out when
   stigma and discrimination were encountered helped them to cope with
   stigma. Limitations to generalization of results include the
   self-selection, relatively high functioning of participants, and
   respondent connections to a specific advocacy organization-the National
   Alliance for the Mentally Ill.

AB Alternative medicine has a major presence and persuasive attraction in
   the industrialized western world. The extent to which these practices
   have clinical efficacy according to biomedical criteria is a matter of
   ongoing research and debate. It may be that independent of any such
   efficacy, the attraction of alternative medicine is related to the power
   of its underlying shared beliefs and cultural assumptions. The
   fundamental premises are an advocacy of nature, vitalism, "science," and
   spirituality. These themes offer patients a participatory experience of
   empowerment, authenticity, and enlarged self-identity when illness
   threatens their sense of intactness and connection to the world. A
   discussion of these themes may enable conventionally trained clinicians
   to better understand their patients' attraction to and acceptance of
   alternative medical therapies.

AB Aims. To examine the effects of gender and acculturation on illicit drug
   use among the Mexican-origin population in California. Design. The 3012
   subjects between 18 and 59 years of age were selected under a
   stratified, multi-stage cluster sampling method. Setting. Fresno County
   in California is primarily agricultural, with only one metropolitan
   area. Over 30% of the total population of 764 800, are Hispanics, of
   Mexican origin. Measurements. A modified version of the World Health
   Organization's Composite International Diagnostic instrument (WHO-CIDI)
   was used to ascertain drug use. Respondents were considered drug users
   if they had ever used marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin or
   inhalants. Acculturation was measured with a Likert scale, assessing
   English vs. Spanish language preference. Other covariates of interest
   were nativity and place of residence. Findings. Men had higher rates of
   use than women for every drug (men = 46.3%, women = 23.2%). Urban rates
   were higher than rural rates, for both women (urban = 32.8% vs, rural =
   16.6%) and men (urban = 57.0% vs, rural = 36.8%). In logistic regression
   models, men were more likely than women to have ever used illicit drugs
   or inhalants (adjusted OR = 4.8), cocaine (adjusted OR = 5.3) or
   marijuana (OR = 4.3). However, the combined effect of United States
   nativity and acculturation, on drug use, was greater among women
   (adjusted OR = 29.3) than among men (adjusted OR = 7.4). The effect of
   acculturation was stronger among urban, than among town or rural
   residents. Conclusions. Acculturation and United States nativity are
   risk factors for illicit drug use among Mexican origin men and women.
   However, women have increased vulnerability compared with men. Findings
   reinforce the need for culturally based public health interventions.

AB We examine the extent to which empirically observed age-related
   differences in rates of drinking and driving can be explained by
   concurrent differences in drinking patterns. Building on previous
   research showing significant age differences in drinking patterns
   between men and women and among three ethnic groups, Whites, Blacks, and
   Hispanics, our study considers whether there are unique gender and
   ethnic group differences in patterns of drinking and driving. Data were
   from 4395 respondents 12 to 80 years old in a general population survey
   of 20 urban areas in the United States. During the month preceding the
   interview, 1130 (25.7%) of all respondents had driven after having one
   or more drinks. Drinking pattern measures included drinking frequency,
   average drinking quantity, and the variance in the number of drinks
   consumed per occasion. To assess the relationships of drinking patterns
   to drinking and driving across age groups, two sets of analyses were
   conducted, one set in which age differences in drinking patterns were
   statistically controlled and one set in which they were not. Although
   the statistical control for drinking patterns reduced age differences
   between gender and ethnic groups, it did not eliminate them. The
   reduction demonstrated that part of observed group differences in
   driving after drinking over age among gender and ethnic groups is due to
   age-related differences in drinking patterns. However, despite
   controlling drinking patterns young respondents remained more likely to
   drink and drive. A supplementary analysis of self-reported incidents of
   driving while intoxicated (i.e., driving after having five or more
   drinks) further indicated that, controlling for drinking patterns, young
   respondents are most at risk.

AB Background: Although minority populations suffer a disproportionately
   higher burden of tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality, the
   church appears to be a promising avenue through which to pursue
   tobacco-cessation interventions in these communities. This report
   describes church-related correlates of tobacco use among the Lumbee
   Indians in North Carolina, a population with a high prevalence of
   tobacco use, strong ties to tobacco-related agriculture, and high levels
   of church participation. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey of
   400 adult Lumbee Indians was carried out in Pembroke, a town in Robeson
   County, NC. The questionnaire elicited information on tobacco use,
   demographic and social support information, knowledge and practices
   related to tobacco agriculture and traditional Native American tobacco
   use and church participation. Results: Sixty-three percent of
   participants were church members and 82% said the church is "very
   important" to the Lumbee community. In bivariate analysis, church
   attendance over the past year correlated with age, education, gender,
   number of close friends and relatives, marital status and current
   smoking status. Church attendance was not related to current smokeless
   tobacco use or participation in tobacco-related agriculture. Current
   smokers who had not attended church in the past year smoked
   significantly more cigarettes per day than current smokers attending
   church more often. In logistic regression, participants attending church
   weekly or more often were 73% less likely to be current smokers
   (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.27, 95% confidence interval
   (CI)=0.11-0.68). Among eversmokers, participants having attended church
   infrequently in the past year were 79% less likely to have quit
   (AOR=0.21, 95% CI=0.07-0.65). Having participated in tobacco agriculture
   as a child predicted current Christian views on tobacco use. Discussion:
   Tobacco use, common among Lumbee adults, correlates with a variety of
   demographic and social support variables. In addition, these data are
   the first to uncover a dose-response relationship between church
   attendance and number of cigarettes smoked per day by current smokers,
   and the relationship between childhood participation in tobacco
   agriculture and Christian views on tobacco use. Our results should be
   useful in designing a church-based tobacco-cessation intervention among
   Lumbee Indians.

   non-Hispanic white (NHW) women, aged 35-74 years, with (n=47) and
   without (n=85) a breast cancer history, and to add to the limited data
   presently available on the performance of FFQs among different ethnic
   groups. Validity was measured at one month and six months from baseline
   against  four-day food records, and reproducibility was tested by
   comparing FFQs. Unadjusted validity con-elation coefficients were
   highest at one month, ranging from 0.38 (polyunsaturated and
   monounsaturated fat) to 0.57 (calcium); energy-adjusted con-elation
   coefficients were highest at six months, ranging from 0.15
   (polyunsaturated fat) to 0.68 (calcium). Energy-adjusted con-elation
   coefficients were statistically significant by ethnicity for vitamins A
   and C, protein, carotene and calcium, and by  case status for saturated
   fat, folate, fiber, and vitamins A and E. Reproducibility con-elation
   coefficients (unadjusted) ranged from 0.40 (polyunsaturated fat) to 0.71
   (carbohydrate, retinol); energy-adjusted correlation coefficients ranged
   from 0.42 (vitamin E) to 0.78 (fiber), and differed significantly by
   ethnicity for saturated fat and retinol, and by case status for
   carbohydrate. Overall, our FFQ has comparable characteristics to other
   FFQs and is suitable for use with New Mexico's H and  NHW women.

   violations of human rights and the definition provided by the 1993 UN

   starting point and its implications analyzed, emphasizing gender roles
   and stereotypes. Violence against women is related to violence in
   general, to the so-called culture of violence. Factors influencing a
   culture of violence are discussed, as well as the differences between
   public and private violence, emphasizing the need to understand their
   interaction to be effective in preventing violence against women. It is
   concluded that all violence stems from unbalanced exercise of power,
   creating injustice and lack of real democratic interaction. When left
   unchallenged such situations become part of the culture of individuals
   and societies, reinforcing the use of violence to solve conflicts.
   Hence, preventing violence against women requires cultural, social,
   economic, and political changes that are only possible by mobilizing

   and a group of HIV-infected women in LAC were analyzed to highlight the
   sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of African-American
   women. This group of African-American women with HIV or AIDS in LAC were
   unemployed (88%), single mothers (64%), living on public assistance
   (86%) with annual household incomes <$10,000 U.S. (76%). A history of
   crack use predominated (50%). Compared with women of other races with
   HIV and AIDS, African-American women reported more sexual partners;
   reported more infections with sexually transmitted diseases; sought
   treatment for their HIV infection later; were more likely to trade sex;
   and were almost five times more likely to have ever used crack cocaine.
   HIV prevention for African-American women in LAC should focus on
   improving self-esteem and negotiation skills within the context of the
   crack cocaine culture and the disadvantaged social and economic
   situation described.

AB Why do people engage in economically minor resource production

   and their households and enterprises examines the diversity of
   motivations and concerns in contemporary maple syrup production.
   Farmers, former farmers, and non-farmers all produce maple syrup. The
   concept of embeddedness provides a framework for understanding how
   producers understand their involvement with maple syrup, by highlighting
   the social and cultural context of economic action. An embeddedness
   perspective emphasizes how other work activities, household relations,
   the surrounding community, and the resource environment shape the
   possibilities for and understandings of minor resource production
   activities. Maple syrup generally only supplemented the household income
   of the 76 producers interviewed. Producers articulated a cultural
   economy of syrup production centered on its contribution to overall
   livelihood, cultural identity, and lifestyle. Reasons included managing
   risks, making seasonal use of land and labor resources, developing a
   retirement income, demonstrating a rural, agrarian identity, and
   strengthening family and community ties. Implications for policy include
   the place of minor resource production activities in securing rural
   livelihoods and providing cultural anchors in rural regions experiencing
   demographic and economic change.

   effects of leaded gasoline we can better understand the persistence of
   children's lead exposure as a basic socioenvironmental inequity.

AB This paper situates women in the public space of US agriculture by
   chronicling the development of the Women Food and Agriculture Network
   (WFAN). WFAN has grown from concern about systemic problems in
   agriculture; the dissonance between agricultural policy and women's
   knowledge and experiences; a desire to give voice to women on issues of
   food, agriculture, community and natural systems; and the belief in
   women's capacity to engage in a strategic and embodied agricultural
   politics. WFAN's emergence reflects the often inhospitable terrain and
   organizational challenges for women in agriculture. The author, as
   participant observer, constructs a partial, second-order interpretation
   of WFAN as a potential social movement organization (SMO). She evokes
   the notion of direct theory, suggesting that WFAN theorizes about social
   change through practice, that member-theorists and member-activists
   contribute to social knowledge. WFAN's formative structures, processes
   and practices are shown to parallel those of SMOs, associations of
   persons challenging dominant social constructions of what is realistic,
   reasonable, and ethical.

AB This essay examines the response of U.S. sociologists to the growing
   call for a global sociology that can address bath transnational social
   phenomena and international scholarly exchanges. We argue that existing
   research conceptions and agendas-rooted as they are in the comparative
   method, nationalist practices and units, and models of European-U.S
   development-are ill-suited for grasping transnational phenomena and
   building a worldwide community of sociologists. This argument is
   advanced by examining leading U.S. scholars' on state formation and
   development, and then by proposing new orientations for future research.

AB This is the second of two reports on a study of the durations related to
   marriage. Divorce and death of one's spouse, the main causes of
   dissolution of marriage, are two of the most important events in a
   person's life. In the United States in 1994, 30.7 million, or 16.2%, of
   the adult population were either divorced or widowed. Among the widowed,
   the female to male ratio was 5 to 11 In this paper duration of
   separation due to divorce and duration of widowhood are the main
   variables under study. Algebraic formulas are derived and computer
   programs are written for estimating these durations for husbands and
   wives, and for living couples of any age. Relations with the duration of
   marriage, the expectation of life, and the family life cycle are also
   presented. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among
   sociodemographic variables, alcohol outlet density, and rate of domestic
   violence in New Jersey. Data were obtained for the 223 largest
   municipalities in the state and were examined using factor analysis and
   bivariate and multivariate analyses. Three sociodemographic factors were
   extracted through factor analysis. These explained 58% of the variance
   among municipalities in rates of domestic violence. One factor-termed
   social disadvantage-explained the greatest amount of unique variance
   (42%). Alcohol outlet density added nothing to the sociodemographic
   model and did not interact with any of the three sociodemographic
   factors. The findings show that, in the state of New Jersey, higher
   levels of alcohol outlet density are not geographically associated with
   higher rates of domestic violence. These findings may be due to
   limitations in the data sets employed in the study, limitations of the
   macrolevel analysis employed, and/or the complex nature of the
   relationship between alcohol use and domestic violence.

AB Alcohol and drug knowledge of inner-city mothers was evaluated following
   an educational mailing, and the relationship between knowledge and
   alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy was tested. Eighty-four
   postpartum African-American mothers with known alcohol and drug use
   during pregnancy received a U.S. Department of Education publication,
   Growing Up Drug Free: A Parent's Guide to Prevention. Results of a
   phone-administered quiz from this booklet were compiled, and alcohol and
   drug use subgroups were compared. The average score was 50%. Half of the
   women did not know that alcohol is the most commonly used drug in the
   United States. Few identified alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana as the
   three drugs most commonly used by children. Lack of teenage substance
   use experience was perceived to increase the risk of chemical
   dependency. Drinkers and drug users were fourfold more Likely to answer
   at least six questions correctly (p = .03 each, logistic regression).
   Parental knowledge of substance use, particularly of alcohol, remains
   inadequate. We suggest that appropriate parental education tools are
   still needed for optimal primary prevention of substance use by
   inner-city children.

AB This study compared food insecurity, nutritional status (as measured
   through anthropometry and dietary intake), and food preparation patterns
   of low-income Puerto Rican female out-of-treatment drug users with that
   of low-income Puerto Rican women who reported no drug use. A convenience
   sample of 41 drug users was compared with 41 age-matched non-drug-users
   from inner-city Hartford, Connecticut. A culturally appropriate food
   frequency questionnaire was administered and anthropometric measurements
   were taken. The findings suggest a high degree of poverty among all
   study participants, but in particular among drug users. Drug users were
   more likely than the controls to be food insecure (P < 0.05) and to he
   exposed to increasingly severe food sufficiency problems. The daily
   frequency of consumption of vegetables was lower (P := 0.03) for drug
   users than non-drug-users. Conversely, the frequency of consumption for
   sweets/desserts was significantly higher for drug users than the
   controls (P= 0.0001). Drug users, who were classified as food insecure
   were less likely to consume vegetables (P = 0.004) and fish (P = 0.03)
   than were controls who were food insecure. When comparing drug users
   with controls, the former group reported consuming fewer meals during a
   usual week than the latter group (P < 0.0001). Drug users were more
   likely to fry foods (P = 0.02) while the controls were more likely to
   bake (P = 0.005), boil (P = 0.02), and steam (P = 0.002) foods. All
   anthropometric measurements, except for height, were significantly lower
   for drug users. The results show that drug users generally maintain
   poorer nutritional status than non-drug-users. Nutrition interventions
   as part of drug treatment are needed. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Background: Most studies of alternative/complementary medicine use in
   children have focused on children with chronic illness and have not
   addressed the more common form of complementary medicine: popular
   home-based interventions and therapies for common low-morbidity sickness
   episodes. Also, there has often been a distinction between alternative/
   complementary medical practices used by the general population and those
   used by members of ethnic minority groups and commonly referred to as
   folk  medicine or ethnomedicine. Objective: To describe the home-based
   therapies and practices that parents from diverse ethnocultural
   backgrounds use to treat the common cold in their children. Method:
   Interviews with mothers of children coming for care at a number of
   clinics and physicians' offices. Included were mothers from European
   American, African American, Puerto Rican, and West Indian-Caribbean
   heritages. Results: Mean number of home-based remedies for the common
   cold did not differ among  ethnic groups (controlling for maternal age,
   maternal education, number of children, and health insurance status).
   There were differences among groups regarding the frequency of use of
   specific remedies. Conclusions: Home-based remedies for colds in
   childhood are commonly used. Many of the treatments are complementary to
   biomedical treatment (ie, antipyretics, over-the-counter cold remedies,
   fluids). Very few are potentially hazardous if taken in moderation.
   Mothers from ethnic minorities use  similar amounts of home-based
   interventions when compared with mothers from the majority culture.

PD Nov., 1998
PY 1998
AB Background: Latinos will soon be the largest minority group in the
   United States, but too little is known about major access barriers to
   health care for this group and whether these barriers result in adverse
   consequences. Objective: To identify important access barriers to health
   care for Latino children, as cited by parents. Design: Cross-sectional
   survey of parents of all 203 children coming to the pediatric Latino
   clinic at an innercity hospital. Questions focused on barriers to health
   care experienced prior to receiving care at the Latino clinic. Results:
   Parental ethnicity included Dominican (36%), Puerto Rican (34%), Central
   American (13%), and South American (11%). Only 42% of parents were
   American citizens, whereas 36% had green cards, and 13% had no
   documentation. Eight percent of parents and 65% of the children were
   born in the United States. Parents rated their ability to speak English
   as follows: very well/well, 27%; not very well, 46%; and not at all,
   26%. The median annual household income was dollar sign11 000; 40% of
   parents never graduated from high school, and 49% headed single-parent
   households. Forty-three percent of the children were uninsured. A sick
   child was routinely brought to hospital clinics by 56% of parents, to
   the emergency department by 21%, and to neighborhood health centers by
   21%. When asked to name the single greatest barrier to health care for
   their children, parents cited language problems (26%), long waiting time
   at the physician's office (15%), no medical insurance (13%), and
   difficulty paying medical bills (7%). When parents were asked if a
   particular barrier had ever caused them not to bring their children in,
   transportation was cited by 21%; not being able to afford health care,
   18%; excessive waiting time in the clinic, 17%; no health insurance,
   16%; and lack of cultural understanding by staff, 11%. Some parents who
   spoke little or no English reported that medical staff not speaking
   Spanish had led to adverse health consequences for their children,
   including poor medical care (8%), misdiagnosis (6%), and prescription of
   inappropriate medications (5%). Multivariate analyses of selected health
   outcomes using 7 independent variables showed that low family income was
   significantly associated with greater odds of a child's having
   suboptimal health status (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% confidence interval,
   1.04-2.2) and an increased number of physician visits in the past year
   (P<.04), but reduced odds (odds ratio, 0.6; 95% confidence interval,
   0.4-0.9) of the child's being brought to the emergency department for a
   routine sick visit. Children whose parents had resided in the United
   States for fewer than 8 years were at reduced odds (odds ratio, 0.5; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.2-0.9) for having spent a day or more in bed for
   illness in the past year. Conclusions: Parents identified language
   problems, cultural differences, poverty, lack of health insurance,
   transportation difficulties, and long waiting times as the major access
   barriers to health care for Latino children. Language problems can
   result in adverse health consequences for some children, including poor
   medical care, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate medication and
   hospitalization. Low family income is an important independent risk
   factor among Latino children for suboptimal health and high utilization
   of health services.

AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the notion of internalization
   which mainly stemmed from Vygotsky's work and to provide a critique of
   this concept as being favorably biased toward specific sociocultural
   practices common in industrial societies. These practices involve global
   networks of alienated and decontextualized activities overemphasizing
   the value of people's independent solo activity and de-emphasizing the
   social nature of solo activities. The internalization model of cultural
   development, emphasizing transformation of social functions into
   individual skills, leads to a chain of mutually related dualisms between
   oppositional abstractions such as the social and the individual, the
   external and the internal, and the environment and the organism.
   Attempts to bridge these dualistic gaps seem problematic because these
   dual abstractions mutually constitute each other and are, thus,
   inseparable from the beginning. An alternative model, the participation
   model of cultural development (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Rogoff, 1990),
   which has recently emerged in different areas of the social sciences,
   seems helpful in overcoming such dualism inherent in the internalization
   model. The participation model considers individual cultural development
   as a validated process of transformation of individual participation in
   sociocultural activity. Transformation of participation involves
   assuming changed responsibility for the activity, redefining membership
   in a community of practice, and changing the sociocultural practice
   itself. In this paper, I argue that the participation model may be a
   more helpful conceptual tool for analyzing development in diverse
   sociocultural practices where participants' solo activities are not
   necessarily privileged and emphasized. Unlike the internalization model,
   the participation model seems to be able to address development equally
   well in both decontextualized and situated sociocultural practices. It
   also generates exploration of new questions.

AB Vietnamese are one of the fastest growing ethnic minority groups in the
   United States. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence
   and correlates of high depression scores among Vietnamese men in three
   locales. Computer assisted telephone interviews were conducted with
   adult Vietnamese men in San Francisco/Alameda Counties, Santa Clara
   County, and the city of Houston. Telephone numbers of households with
   Vietnamese surnames were chosen randomly from area telephone books.
   Depression was assessed using a previously validated Vietnamese language
   depression screening instrument with 86% sensitivity and 96% specificity
   for major depression. Between 8.2% and 9.8% of the men scored above the
   cut-off. Logistic regression analysis revealed that men who were the
   least proficient in English, poorer, unemployed or disabled, veterans,
   and those living in Houston were more likely to have a high depression
   score. Based on the characteristics of the screening instrument, rates
   of clinical depression among Vietnamese men may be modestly higher than
   rates for men in the general population. However, high-risk subgroups
   identified by our analyses may suffer from substantially higher rates of
   clinical depression. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to show
   that community context or locale is an independent predictor of high
   depressive symptoms in this population. These findings have important
   implications for prevention and intervention approaches to depression
   among Vietnamese men.

AB Objective. Multiple group latent curve analysis was used to assess the
   impact of changes in marital status on alcohol use trajectories in young
   adults and to test if these effects varied across ethnicity and gender.
   Method: Four years of data were obtained from a sample of young adults
   (N = 4,052; 54% male) drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth. Alcohol use and marital status were assessed once per year and
   covariates included age, gender, education and ethnicity. Results:
   Latent curve models indicated that there was an overall nonlinear
   negative alcohol use trajectory across the four time points and that
   becoming married was reliably associated with an added down-turn to this
   trajectory. Multiple group models indicated that there was an
   interaction between ethnicity and marital status in the prediction of
   alcohol growth trajectories, but there was no interaction with gender.
   Conclusions: Becoming married for the first time exerted a unique effect
   on the overall developmental trajectory of alcohol use over time. This
   effect held for both ethnic groups but was reliably stronger for white
   compared to black respondents. This interaction may be attributable to
   lower levels of alcohol use reported by black respondents, or may be
   related to individual differences in reactivity to social influences by
   blacks relative to whites.

AB Objective: This study measured the impact of unemployment and
   underemployment on alcohol misuse. Method: A panel of respondents from
   the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth was studied in 1984-85 and
   1988-89. In each pair of years, the effect of employment change (e.g.,
   becoming underemployed) on alcohol misuse was assessed controlling for
   misuse in the first year. Alcohol misuse was operationalized in two
   ways: elevated symptoms and heavy drinking. Three samples were analyzed:
   a core sample of 2,441 who were available in both pairs of years
   (approximately 65% male) and two extended samples that included everyone
   available in one pair of years but not the other (n = 4,183 in 1984-85
   and n = 3,926 in 1988-89). Results: The 1984-85 analyses revealed a
   significant association of adverse change in employment with both
   elevated alcohol symptoms and heavy drinking (the latter moderated by
   prior heavy drinking). The 1988-89 analyses found no relationship
   between adverse change in employment and heavy drinking in the core
   sample and no main effect of adverse change in employment on symptoms,
   but they did reveal interactions involving prior symptoms (core sample)
   and marital status (extended sample). Conclusions: Several explanations
   for these decreasing effects over time were considered including changes
   in measurement reliability, statistical power, economic environment and
   respondents' maturity. These results confirm previous findings that job
   loss can increase the risk of alcohol misuse, provide new evidence that
   two types of underemployment (involuntary part-time and poverty-level
   wage) can also increase this risk and suggest that these effects vary
   over time.

AB We describe characteristics of Texas fishing tournaments for black bass
   Micropterus spp. based on voluntary reports for 2,418 tournaments held
   during 1993-1997. Most tournaments (99%) were 1-2 d in duration. An
   average of 35.1 anglers participated in each tournament, and most
   tournaments (84%) involved 20 or fewer boats. Ninety-seven percent of
   tournaments required live release of fish after weigh-in. Tournaments
   had a variety of formats and rules. The most common format (87.8% of
   tournaments) awarded prizes based on total weight, 26.9% awarded prizes
   based on team results, and 26.0% awarded prizes for big fish. Ten
   percent of events were paper tournaments, in which fish are captured,
   measured, and released immediately. In 23% of tournaments, the
   competition was held with self-imposed bag and minimum length limits
   that were more restrictive than those promulgated by the state.
   Comparison of our results with those from an earlier study suggests a
   compensatory relationship between tournament angler behavior, in the
   form of self-imposed bag and size restrictions, and regulations imposed
   by management agencies. Tournament anglers adopt more stringent
   self-imposed restrictions when management regulations are liberal but
   place fewer restrictions on themselves as more restrictive regulations
   are enacted. Tournament characteristics, including the number of
   participants, species sought, format, and rules of conduct, have
   important implications for biological, social, and administrative
   problems that often are associated with tournament fishing.

   completed a self-administered computer survey in 1996. Risk behaviors,
   attitudes, and readiness to stop smoking were analyzed for 225 patients
   at the STD clinic and 248 patients at the teen clinic.
   Results. Compared with adolescents in the teen clinic, adolescents in
   the STD clinic were more likely to have smoked frequently (OR 1.7, 95%
   CI 1.1, 3.0), used any illegal drug (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3, 5.5), recently
   binged on alcohol (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0, 2.8), and had more than 10
   lifetime sexual partners (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0, 3.4). Weapon carrying,
   readiness to stop smoking, and attitudes toward smoking did not differ
   between sites.
   Conclusions. Cigarette smoking and other health risk. behaviors are more
   prevalent among adolescents in an STD clinic than among adolescents in a
   community health center. STD clinics are potential sites for cigarette,
   alcohol, and drug use interventions among "hard to reach" adolescents.

AB This paper outlines two pathways through which social support can
   influence the prevention or progression of cardiovascular disease:
   health behaviors and neuroendocrine mechanisms. Its primary focus is on
   neuroendocrine pathways, reviewing data which suggest that lack of
   social support is etiologically related to coronary artery lesion
   development through two mechanisms: sympathetic-adrenomedullary
   influences on platelet function, heart rate and blood pressure in the
   initial endothelial injury; and pituitary-adrenal cortical factors
   involved in smooth muscle cell proliferation during progression of the
   lesion after injury has taken place. It hypothesizes that the buffering
   effect of social support on the cardiovascular system is mediated
   primarily through mechanisms associated with the release of oxytocin.

AB This paper reconsiders James S. Coleman's concept of social capital. The
   concept has gained wide use and acceptance in,sociology since its first
   publication, but, Coleman's own writings on the subject remain to date
   its most extensive analytic treatment. We make two contributions to
   social capital theory. First, we recast social capital theory to focus
   on benefits rather than forms. We identify three benefits that forms of
   social capital may confer: information, influence and control, and
   social solidarity. In the context of a focus on benefits, we consider
   how a specific form of social capital may vary in the degree to which
   its benefits generalize to different kinds of goals, and how forms that
   are valuable for some purposes may be a liability for other purposes.
   Second, we emphasize social capital's origin in aspects of social
   structure that actors may appropriate to use in their interests. We
   suggest how changes in the social structure of which social capital is
   an aspect may affect the emergence and persistence of forms of social
   capital and may condition the value of given forms.

AB This article discusses causal analysis as a paradigm for explanation in
   sociology. It begins with a detailed analysis of causality statements in
   Durkheim's Le suicide. It then discusses the history of causality
   assumptions in sociological writing since the 1930s, with brief remarks
   about the related discipline of econometrics. The author locates the
   origins of causal argument in a generation of brilliant and brash young
   sociologists with a model and a mission and then briefly considers the
   history of causality concepts in modem philosophy. The article closes
   with reflections on the problems created for sociology by the
   presumption that causal accounting is the epitome of explanation within
   the discipline. It is argued that sociology should spend more effort on
   (and should better reward) descriptive work.

AB Typically, using data from a nonexperimental study, quantitative
   sociologists model one or more outcomes as a function of independent
   variables, interpreting the resulting parameter estimates as effects.
   This article compares the usual approach to causal inference in
   sociology with an alternative approach that builds explicitly on a
   counterfactual account of causation. The comparison is relevant because
   sociologists typically interpret (incorrectly) parameter estimates
   obtained using the first approach as supporting causal statements that
   are counterfactual. To make matters concrete, the author reconsiders an
   attainment model of Featherman and Hauser, who are interested in
   comparing the effects of family background on achievement, by sex and
   time. This analysis suggests the coefficients in the regressions of
   respondent's education and occupational status on background should not
   be interpreted as effects. However because a child's sex is determined
   without regard for his or her subsequent achievements, sex may be viewed
   as randomly assigned, justifying treating sex as the cause and the
   background variables as covariates. Unfortunately, the way in,which the
   data were collected preclude such a treatment.

AB The article shows the affinity of Simmel's formal sociology with
   Husserl's notion of eidetic science. This thesis is demonstrated by the
   corroboration of Simmel's revision of neo-kantian epistemology for
   sociology with Husserl's phenomenology, and the parallel discussion of
   Simmel and Husserl concerning cognitive levels and exact and
   morphological eide. Simmel's analysis of dyads is explored as an
   exemplar of his eidetic insights. An important consequence of this
   demonstration is the vindication establishing the scientific legitimacy
   of Simmel's methodology regarding the sociology of the forms of
   association. Woven throughout is discussion concerning the doctrine of
   the complementarity of eidetic and empirical science. Simmel's
   methodology is shown to have been ahead of its time through conjoining
   these two modes of scientific investigation.

AB Weed science, like most sciences, has distanced itself from social and
   ethical discourse in theory and practice. This symposium illustrates my
   point. The 38th meeting of our society is the first time there has been
   a formal discussion of die ethical aspects of our work. Weed science, we
   often believe, is value free, as science ought to be. But neither basic
   nor applied weed science is value free; they are value laden. Operative
   values include meeting basic human needs through improved Food
   production, promoting the common good through abundant food, improving
   people's lives through efficient production of safe food, achieving
   agricultural sustainability, and increasing efficient food and fiber
   production and farmer profit. Truth pursued via the scientific method is
   valued and respected, as is belief in the goodness of scientific and
   technological progress. Most of these values rest on an ethical
   foundation known as utilitarianism. Most weed scientists and their
   colleagues in agricultural sciences are utilitarian in that they believe
   their work should be useful to humans and should promote the greatest
   good for the greatest number of people. What weed scientists believe and
   stand for and the validity of the ethical foundation of their
   utilitarian convictions ought to be central subjects of the weed
   scientist's research and teaching. Ethical reflection does not
   necessarily imply criticism or a need for reform, but it does demand
   intellectual clarity and an ability to affirm who we are, what we do,
   and what we value. Weed scientists should engage in an exchange about
   the ideas that are the end result of their experiences and discuss the
   experiences that give shape, substance, and depth to those ideas. In the
   absence of internal ethical reflection and value clarification, external
   distortions-including public criticism-will define the moral universe
   weed scientists must work in. Without embarrassment, weed scientists
   have to learn to ask about the ethical foundation of their science.

AB In a time of economic depression and racism more overt than anything we
   now experience, the unions of the Congress of Industrial Organirations
   (CIO) during the 1930s and 1940s forged a lasting interracial solidarity
   within the industrial working class. The authors tell the stories of how
   three Cia organizing drives achieved interracial solidarity. In 1933,
   the United Mine Workers (UMW) adopted the "UMW formula" for placing
   Black workers in positions as union officers and organizers. Adopted
   from more radical unions, the formula institutionalized racial
   inclusion, which proved to be a major tactical innovation in realizing
   class solidarity across racial lines. Faced with similar conditions, the
   Steel Workers Organizing Committee in 1937 and the United Auto Workers
   in 1940 adopted variants of the UMW formula to overcome racial barriers
   to organizing The authors analyze narratives of these three drives using
   the following two qualitative methods: event-structure analysis (ESA) a
   diachronic method and qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) a
   synchronic method Both approaches reveal the importance of three main
   factors: tactical innovations, political context, and labor market
   conditions. The first two factors are explained by political process
   theory, and the third is predicted by split labor market theory Among
   these findings, ESA highlights path dependence of tactical innovations
   and QCA emphasizes structural conditions in the labor marker.

AB Objective: This study compared the mental health and cognitive
   development of 9- to 12-year-old Eritrean war orphans living in two
   orphanages that differed qualitatively in patterns of staff interaction
   and styles of child care management, Method: The directors and several
   child care workers at each institution were asked to complete staff
   organization and child management questionnaires. The psychological
   state of 40 orphans at each institution was evaluated by comparing their
   behavioral symptoms and performance on cognitive measures. Results:
   Orphans who lived in a setting where the entire staff participated in
   decisions affecting the children, and where the children were encouraged
   to become self-reliant through personal interactions with staff members,
   showed significantly fewer behavioral symptoms of emotional distress
   than orphans who lived in a setting where the director made decisions,
   daily routines were determined by explicit rules and schedules, and
   interactions between staff members and the children were impersonal.
   Conclusions: When orphanages are the only means of survival for war
   orphans, a group setting where the staff shares in the responsibilities
   of child management, is sensitive to the individuality of the children,
   and establishes stable personal ties with the children serves the
   emotional needs and psychological development of the orphans more
   effectively than a group setting that attempts to create a secure
   environment through an authoritative style of management with explicit
   rules and well-defined schedules.
