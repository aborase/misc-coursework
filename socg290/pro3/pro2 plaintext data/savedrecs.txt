AB Ever since Berger and Luckmann published their treatment of the
   sociology of knowledge in 1966, older versions of the subfield have
   languished, been forgotten, or misrepresented, as if The Social
   Construction of Reality (SCR) eliminated the need to study its
   predecessors in Wissenssoziologie. By considering Berger's subsequent
   statements about the book, along with remarks recently made by Luckmann,
   and then returning to the text itself, this article shows that some of
   the main suppositions on which SCR rests are foreign to the sociology of
   knowledge in its original forms, and that a number of these premises do
   not seem as plausible in today's social world as they may have in the
   early 1960s when their authors formulated them. The unintended scholarly
   results of SCR's surprising publishing success are evaluated.

AB In this paper, I bring Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of
   Reality into conversation with the relatively new subfield of the
   sociology of the senses to argue that greater attentiveness to sensory
   perception can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of the social
   construction of reality. When read with this sensitization, one finds
   implicit references to the senses throughout their discussion, but
   nowhere is sensory perception explicitly theorized as a part of the
   social construction process. Drawing specifically on their analysis of
   primary socialization, face-to-face interaction, language and relevance
   structures, and the fundamental dialectic of externalization,
   objectivation, and internalization, I demonstrate that processes of
   perceptual construction - specifically sensory attention and
   disattention - are key mechanism of social construction underlying many
   of Berger and Luckmann's arguments. A more explicit focus on sensory
   perception not only clarifies and strengthens many of their
   observations, but also constitutes a renewal of their important call to
   examine the processes of social construction.

AB The sociology of knowledge that followed The Social Construction of
   Reality shifted from the study of rarified ideas to practical activity,
   focusing on the stabilization of a sense of shared reality. The opposite
   side of this shift in emphasis has received much less attention -
   activities that place reality into a state of play and, in so doing,
   call attention to its ephemerality. I discuss three empirical areas
   where the practical use of other realities is central to the sociology
   of knowledge. First, I document cases in which skilled practitioners,
   such as airline pilots, safety engineers, and athletes, use simulation
   to prepare for events that are understood as highly uncertain and risky.
   Next, I describe how other realities are mobilized epistemologically,
   such as through experimentation in technoscience and experimentalism in
   unrealized or unbuilt' art and architecture. Finally, I consider
   autotelic and transcendent social experiences through fantasy and
   technological mediations like augmented realities.

   Emancipation and Liberty for All. After a brief examination of the

   political agency. I argue that this emphasis is necessary, given the
   political and scholarly aims of the book. At the same time, I suggest
   that the agency depicted in Seizing Freedom was simultaneously
   constrained by the cultural, political, and social forces discussed in
   Roediger's earlier companion volume, The Wages of Whiteness. I end the
   essay with a short discussion of the labour leader William Sylvis that
   attempts to synthesize insights from Seizing Freedom and The Wages of

   labour to systematically ignore and repress the activity of black

AB A social generation framework attends to how emergent historical
   patterns of social organization shape young adult contemporaries, noting
   shared strategies to constructing subjectivity within a common
   political, social, and economic milieu. However, the perspective has
   given scant attention to how young people engage in reflexive life
   management outside of well-documented Western contexts. Additionally,
   the framework needs further consideration of how youth lives are shaped
   by the social relations of globalization. To address these omissions,
   this article examines how educated, urban Russian young adults engage in
   reflexive life management. In drawing on a social generations rather
   than transitions approach, youth meaning-making is analyzed through
   grounded analysis rather than reliance on previously conceived
   categories. The study of youth reflexive life management can be reframed
   as a question: what does making a life mean to educated urban
   post-adolescents in Russia?' We explore how respondents interpret
   difference and inequality through transnational comparisons, center
   globality in the biographical project, and encounter citizenship
   constraints. We focus on three meaning-making projects: idealized
   globality, assuming nonlinear paths, and vigilant evaluative work.

AB In this paper, we consider three hypotheses to account for the evolution
   of the extraordinary capacity for large-scale cooperation and altruistic
   social preferences within human societies. One hypothesis is that human
   cooperation is built on the same evolutionary foundations as cooperation
   in other animal societies, and that fundamental elements of the social
   preferences that shape our species' cooperative behaviour are also
   shared with other closely related primates. Another hypothesis is that
   selective pressures favouring cooperative breeding have shaped the
   capacity for cooperation and the development of social preferences, and
   produced a common set of behavioural dispositions and social preferences
   in cooperatively breeding primates and humans. The third hypothesis is
   that humans have evolved derived capacities for collaboration,
   group-level cooperation and altruistic social preferences that are
   linked to our capacity for culture. We draw on naturalistic data to
   assess differences in the form, scope and scale of cooperation between
   humans and other primates, experimental data to evaluate the nature of
   social preferences across primate species, and comparative analyses to
   evaluate the evolutionary origins of cooperative breeding and related
   forms of behaviour.

AB Unlike recent tendencies to specify the variety of postsocialist
   trajectories, this article attempts to characterize the common features
   of postsocialist capitalism, as it has developed since the 1990s in
   Eastern Europe. Using conceptual tools of economic sociology, the
   postsocialist socio-economic organization is analyzed as embedded
   economy, the institutionalization of capitalism as a moral project, and
   the pervasiveness of informality from the networks and culture
   perspectives. Economic development is viewed as dependent,
   simultaneously, on the system's structural, political and cultural
   features. For postsocialist capitalism, these features include lack of
   state autonomy due to close coupling of political and economic roles;
   the embrace of greed and self-interest as legitimate motives for action;
   and persistence and bolstering of informality as modus operandi.
   Stipulations about developmental consequences are provided in the
   conclusion.

AB This research aimed to estimate the effect of perceived social factors
   in the community stress and problems on the residents' psychopathology
   such as depression and suicidal behaviors.
   Subjects of this study were the informants (N = 1618) in a psychological
   autopsy (PA) study with a case control design. We interviewed two
   informants (a family member and a close friend) for 392 suicides and 416
   living controls, which came from 16 rural counties randomly selected
   from three provinces of China.
   Community stress and problems were measured by the WHO SUPRE-MISS scale.
   Depression was measured by CES-D scale, and suicidal behavior was
   assessed by NCS-R scale.
   Multivariable liner and logistic regression models and the Structural
   Equation Modeling (SEM) were applied to probe the correlation of the
   depression and the suicidal behaviors with some major demographic
   variables as covariates.
   It was found that community stress and problems were directly associated
   with rural Chinese residents' depression (Path coefficient = 0.127, P <
   0.001). There was no direct correlation between community stress and
   problem and suicidal behaviors, but community stress and problem can
   affect suicidal behaviors indirectly through depression. The path
   coefficient between depression and suicidal behaviors was 0.975. The
   current study predicts a new research viewpoint, that is, the depression
   is the intermediate between community stress and problem and suicidal
   behaviors. It might be an effective route to prevent depression directly
   and suicidal behaviors indirectly by reducing the community stress and
   problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ecological systems often operate on time scales significantly longer or
   shorter than the time scales typical of human decision making, which
   causes substantial difficulty for conservation and management in
   socioecological systems. For example, invasive species may move faster
   than humans can diagnose problems and initiate solutions, and climate
   systems may exhibit long-term inertia and short-term fluctuations that
   obscure learning about the efficacy of management efforts in many
   ecological systems. We adopted a management-decision framework that
   distinguishes decision makers within public institutions from individual
   actors within the social system, calls attention to the ways
   socioecological systems respond to decision makers' actions, and notes
   institutional learning that accrues from observing these responses. We
   used this framework, along with insights from bedeviling conservation
   problems, to create a typology that identifies problematic time-scale
   mismatches occurring between individual decision makers in public
   institutions and between individual actors in the social or ecological
   system. We also considered solutions that involve modifying human
   perception and behavior at the individual level as a means of resolving
   these problematic mismatches. The potential solutions are derived from
   the behavioral economics and psychology literature on temporal
   challenges in decision making, such as the human tendency to discount
   future outcomes at irrationally high rates. These solutions range from
   framing environmental decisions to enhance the salience of long-term
   consequences, to using structured decision processes that make time
   scales of actions and consequences more explicit, to structural
   solutions aimed at altering the consequences of short-sighted behavior
   to make it less appealing. Additional application of these tools and
   long-term evaluation measures that assess not just behavioral changes
   but also associated changes in ecological systems are needed.

   developing (TD) peers during the construction of fictional narratives
   within a group intervention context. We found participants with ASC
   contributed fewer narrative-related turns at talk than TD participants.
   The groups organized the activity as a means to subvert moral and social
   norms, and youth with ASC participated in negotiating new norms with
   varying degrees of success. Further, participants with ASC often
   prioritized making explicit links between narrative events over creative
   interpretations of narrative, which illustrated differing orientations
   to the narrative project. Our findings add an interactional dimension to
   existing research focusing on the psychological aspects of narrative
   production in individuals with ASC.

AB BackgroundLabour market disengagement among youths has lasting negative
   economic and social consequences, yet is poorly understood. We compared
   four types of work-related self-perceptions, as well as vulnerability to
   mental health and substance abuse problems, among youths not in
   education, employment or training (NEET) and among their peers.
   MethodsParticipants were from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk)
   longitudinal study, a nationally representative UK cohort of 2,232 twins
   born in 1994-1995. We measured commitment to work, job-search effort,
   professional/technical skills, soft' skills (e.g. teamwork,
   decision-making, communication), optimism about getting ahead, and
   mental health and substance use disorders at age 18. We also examined
   childhood mental health.
   ResultsAt age 18, 11.6% of participants were NEET. NEET participants
   reported themselves as committed to work and searching for jobs with
   greater diligence than their non-NEET peers. However, they reported
   fewer soft' skills (B=-0.98, p<.001) and felt less optimistic about
   their likelihood of getting ahead in life (B=-2.41, p<.001). NEET youths
   also had higher rates of concurrent mental health and substance abuse
   problems, but these did not explain the relationship with work-related
   self-perceptions. Nearly 60% of NEET (vs. 35% of non-NEET) youths had
   already experienced 1 mental health problem in childhood/adolescence.
   Associations of NEET status with concurrent mental health problems were
   independent of pre-existing mental health vulnerability.
   ConclusionsOur findings indicate that while NEET is clearly an economic
   and mental health issue, it does not appear to be a motivation issue.
   Alongside skills, work-related self-perceptions and mental health
   problems may be targets for intervention and service provision among
   this high-risk population.

AB In 2013, around 1336 desalination plants in the United States (US)
   provided purified water mainly to municipalities, the industry sector
   and for power generation. In 2013 alone, similar to 200 million m(3) of
   water were desalinated; the amount that could satisfy annual municipal
   water consumption of more than 1.5 million people in the US.
   Desalination has proven to be a reliable water supply source in many
   countries around the world, with the total global desalination capacity
   of similar to 60 million m(3)/day in 2013. Desalination has been used to
   mitigate water scarcity and lessen the pressure on water resources.
   Currently, data and information about desalination are still limited,
   while extensive socio-economic analyses are missing. This paper presents
   an econometric model to fill this gap. It evaluates the impact of
   selected socio-economic variables on desalination development in the US
   in the time span 1970-2013. The results show that the GDP and population
   growth have significantly impacted the desalination sector over the
   analyzed time period. The insights into the economics of desalination
   provided with this paper can be used to further evaluate
   cost-effectiveness of desalination both in the US and in other countries

AB Objective To determine if household income is associated with
   hospitalization costs for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal
   cord injury (SCI).
   Study design Retrospective cohort study of inpatient, nonrehabilitation
   hospitalizations at 43 freestanding children's hospitals for patients
   <19 years old with unintentional severe TBI and SCI from 2009-2012.
   Standardized cost of care for hospitalizations was modeled using
   mixed-effects methods, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, primary
   payer, presence of chronic medical condition, mechanism of injury,
   injury severity, distance from residence to hospital, and trauma center
   level. Main exposure was zip code level median annual household income.
   Results There were 1061 patients that met inclusion criteria, 833 with
   TBI only, 227 with SCI only, and 1 with TBI and SCI. Compared with those
   with the lowest-income zip codes, patients from the highest-income zip
   codes were more likely to be older, white (76.7% vs 50.4%), have private
   insurance (68.9% vs 27.9%), and live closer to the hospital (median
   distance 26.7 miles vs 81.2 miles). In adjusted models, there was no
   significant association between zip code level household income and
   hospitalization costs.
   Conclusions Children hospitalized with unintentional, severe TBI and SCI
   showed no difference in standardized hospital costs relative to a
   patient's home zip code level median annual household income. The
   association between household income and hospitalization costs may vary
   by primary diagnosis.

   focused on the techno-economic and environmental and ecological issues
   of the desalination technologies and emphasized the feasibility of
   desalination industry as an alternative to meet the water demands in
   many water scarce regions. Despite these efforts, many perceptions about
   desalination processes hinder their applications for potential water
   supplies. This article has two specific aims: 1) provide an overview of
   the desalination trends around the world and discuss the sustainability
   components of desalination processes in comparison with other water
   supply alternatives; and 2) discuss case studies for desalination, and
   drivers and factors that influence sustainable desalination and other
   alternative water sources for desalination to increase our current
   understanding on the sensitive and futuristic issues of water supply and
   resource management options for drought facing regions. Although some of
   the facts and recent developments discussed here show that desalination
   can be affordable and potentially sustainable, contributions that
   meaningfully address socio-economic and ecological and environmental
   issues of desalination processes are urgently required in this critical
   era of severe water stress for the present context and the future

AB The concept of relationality has recently found widespread favour in
   British sociology, particularly in the emergent sub-field of the
   sociology of personal life, which is characterized by its attachment to
   the concept. However, this relational turn' is under-theorized and pays
   little attention to the substantial history of relational thinking
   across the human sciences. This article argues that the notion of
   relationality in the sociology of personal life might be strengthened by
   an exploration of the conceptualization of the relational person and
   relational processes offered by three bodies of literature: the
   process-oriented thinking of American pragmatism, specifically of Mead
   and Emirbayer; the figurational sociology of Elias; and psychoanalysis,
   particularly the object relations tradition, contemporary relational
   psychoanalysis, and Ettinger's notion of transubjectivity. The article
   attends particularly to the processes involved in the individuality,
   agentic reflexivity and affective dimensions of the relational person.

AB This article addresses the question of whether and how internal wars can
   lead to state building. I offer a new conceptual framework for
   understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity,
   as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly
   consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like
   external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they
   enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the
   state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration.
   Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites
   perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests
   with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due
   to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive
   effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this
   framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and
   Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive
   effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.

AB The media is filled with tales of careers and lives derailed by
   extramarital affairs often depicting such affairs in
   organizational/occupational terms: affairs begin in and/or upend
   organizational life and certain occupations are rife with cheaters. Yet,
   organizational science has been relatively silent on the topic. A review
   of literature from psychology, sociology, and economics provides an
   opening for the organizational researcher through the concepts of
   structural and cultural opportunity. Employing insights from
   organizational research on occupations and ethics, it is the intention
   of this article to develop models of structural and cultural (ethical)
   climate antecedents of extramarital affair opportunity.

AB Background: The stress generation hypothesis posits that individuals
   with psychopathology engage in maladaptive behaviors that create stress.
   Although extensively researched in the depression literature, few
   studies have investigated whether the stress generation hypothesis
   applies to eating disorders. This study examined whether bulimic
   symptoms and dietary restraint predict future life hassles and low
   social support among undergraduate students.
   Methods: Three hundred seventy-four undergraduate students participated
   in this two-part prospective study through a secure online system. They
   completed questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, bulimic
   symptoms, dietary restraint, life hassles, and social support.
   Results: Regression analyses revealed that baseline bulimic symptoms
   predicted greater life hassles but not lower social support one month
   later, after statistically controlling for baseline measures. Baseline
   dietary restraint did not predict future life hassles or social support.
   Limitations: Limitations include use of self-report measures, suboptimal
   response rates at the follow-up assessment, and use of a non-clinical
   sample with primarily White participants.
   Conclusions: These results provide preliminary support for the stress
   generation hypothesis in relation to bulimic symptoms. Individuals with
   bulimic symptoms may generate stressors similar to those experiencing
   depressive symptoms. Our findings suggest that emphasizing stress
   management in the treatment of individuals with bulimic symptoms could
   potentially improve treatment outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier By. All rights

AB Objective The aim of this study was to construct and test measures of
   psychosocial mediators that could be used in intervention studies
   seeking to promote safer sex behavior among young black men who have sex
   with men (YBMSM).
   Methods A total of 400 YBMSM, ages 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a
   clinic for sexually transmitted infection in the southern United States.
   All men had engaged in penile-anal sex with a man as a top in the past 6
   months. The men completed an audio-computer-assisted self-interview and
   provided specimens used for nucleic acid amplification testing to detect
   Chlamydia and gonorrhea. Four measures were constructed and tested for
   criterion validity (Safer Sex Communication, Condom Turn-Offs, Condom
   Pleasure Scale, and a single item assessing frequency of condom use
   discussions before sexual arousal).
   Results With the exception of Safer Sex Communication, all of the
   measures showed criterion validity for both unprotected anal insertive
   and unprotected anal receptive sex. With the exception of the Condom
   Turn-Offs, the 3 other measures were supported by criterion validity for
   oral sex. Both the Condom Turn-Offs and Condom Pleasure Scale were
   significantly related to whether or not the men reported multiple
   partners as a top, but only the Condom Pleasure Scale was associated
   with reports of multiple partners as a bottom. Only the Condom Turn-Offs
   Scale was positively associated with having been diagnosed with either
   Chlamydia or gonorrhea.
   Conclusion Findings provide 3 brief scales and a single item that can be
   used in intervention studies targeting YBMSM. Perceptions about condoms
   being a turnoff and about condoms enhancing pleasure showed strong
   association with sexual risk behaviors.

AB Research suggests that sexual health communication is associated with
   safer sex practices. In this study, we examined the relationship between
   church attendance and sexual health topics discussed with both friends
   and sexual partners among a sample of urban Black women. Participants
   were 434 HIV-negative Black women who were at high risk for contracting
   HIV through heterosexual sex. They were recruited from Baltimore,
   Maryland using a network-based sampling approach. Data were collected
   through face-to-face interviews and Audio-Computer-Assisted
   Self-Interviews. Fifty-four percent of the participants attended church
   once a month or more (regular attendees). Multivariate logistic
   regression analyses revealed that regular church attendance among
   high-risk HIV-negative Black women was a significant predictor of the
   number of sexual health topics discussed with both friends (AOR = 1.85,
   p = .003) and sexual partners (AOR = 1.68, p = .014). Future efforts to
   reduce HIV incidence among high-risk Black women may benefit from
   partnerships with churches that equip faith leaders and congregants with
   the tools to discuss sexual health topics with both their sexual
   partners and friends.

   the United States (n = 218), Spain (n = 240), Costa Rica (n = 172), and
   Peru (n = 105). On average, and across the four national groups, the
   messages young adults received from their parents about broad domains of
   sexual behaviors (masturbation, non-intercourse types of heterosexual
   sexual activity, premarital sex, same-sex activity, and cohabiting) were
   unequivocally restrictive. By contrast, across the four groups, young
   adults on average held rather permissive sexual values and their values
   differed significantly from those of their parents. Moreover, the nature
   of perceived parental sexual values (restrictive vs. permissive) was not
   associated significantly with young adults' sexual values, age of sexual
   debut, or number of sexual partners. Comparatively, Spanish young adults
   held the most permissive sexual values, whereas US young adults held the
   most restrictive sexual values. Religiosity was the strongest predictor
   of young adults' sexual values, followed by perceived parental sexual
   values and influence. In conclusion, it appears that despite having
   perceived restrictive parental messages about sex, these young adults
   currently hold permissive sexual attitudes, thus calling into question
   the influence parents actually have on their adult children's sexual
   values.

AB Purpose: We assessed the association of temporal, socioeconomic and
   environmental factors with bladder cancer mortality in the United
   States. Our hypothesis was that bladder cancer mortality is associated
   with distinct environmental and socioeconomic factors with effects
   varying by region, race and gender.
   Materials and Methods: NCI (National Cancer Institute) age adjusted,
   county level bladder cancer mortality data from 1950 to 2007 were
   analyzed to identify clusters of increased bladder cancer death using
   the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Socioeconomic, clinical and environmental
   data were assessed using geographically weighted spatial regression
   analysis adjusting for spatial autocorrelation. County level
   socioeconomic, clinical and environmental data were obtained from
   national databases, including the United States Census, CDC (Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention), NCHS (National Center for Health
   Statistics) and County Health Rankings.
   Results: Bladder cancer mortality hot spots and risk factors for bladder
   cancer death differed significantly by gender, race and geographic
   region. From 1996 to 2007 smoking, unemployment, physically unhealthy
   days, air pollution ozone days, percent of houses with well water,
   employment in the mining industry and urban residences were associated
   with increased rates of bladder cancer mortality (p < 0.05). Model fit
   was significantly improved in hot spots compared to all American
   counties (R-2 = 0.20 vs 0.05).
   Conclusions: Environmental and socioeconomic factors affect bladder
   cancer mortality and effects appear to vary by gender and race.
   Additionally there were temporal trends of bladder cancer hot spots
   which, when persistent, should be the focus of individual level studies
   of occupational and environmental factors.

AB Purpose: The proportion of women in urology has increased from less than
   0.5% in 1981 to 10% today. Furthermore, 33% of students matching in
   urology are now female. In this analysis we characterize the female
   workforce in urology compared to that of men with regard to income,
   workload and job satisfaction.
   Materials and Methods: We collaborated with the American Urological
   Association to survey its domestic membership of practicing urologists
   regarding socioeconomic, workforce and quality of life issues. A total
   of 6,511 survey invitations were sent via e-mail. The survey consisted
   of 26 questions and took approximately 13 minutes to complete. Linear
   regression models were used to evaluate bivariable and multivariable
   associations with job satisfaction and compensation.
   Results: A total of 848 responses (660 or 90% male, 73 or 10% female)
   were collected for a total response rate of 13%. On bivariable analysis
   female urologists were younger (p < 0.0001), more likely to be
   fellowship trained (p = 0.002), worked in academics (p = 0.008), were
   less likely to be self-employed and worked fewer hours (p = 0.03)
   compared to male urologists. On multivariable analysis female gender was
   a significant predictor of lower compensation (p = 0.001) when
   controlling for work hours, call frequency, age, practice setting and
   type, fellowship training and advance practice provider employment.
   Adjusted salaries among female urologists were $76,321 less than those
   of men. Gender was not a predictor of job satisfaction.
   Conclusions: Female urologists are significantly less compensated
   compared to male urologists after adjusting for several factors likely
   contributing to compensation. There is no difference in job satisfaction
   between male and female urologists.

AB This study contributes to understanding of social preferences, norms,
   and behaviors in residential landscapes that affect planning, design,
   and management of trees, which store carbon and contribute to mitigating
   climate change. We investigated southeast Michigan homeowner preferences
   for different styles of front yards and backyards that were more or less
   wooded, learning what landscape characteristics they preferred and how
   their preferences related to their own yard management behavior. We
   surveyed homeowners, who selected their most preferred front yard and
   backyard from a series of images and indicated what characteristics were
   important to their preferences. We developed a homeowner typology based
   on their stated preferences for more and less wooded front yards and
   backyards, distinguished each type by landscape characteristics that
   were most important to homeowners, and tested whether homeowners of each
   preference type managed their actual yards consistent with type. Our
   results show that homeowners are heterogeneous in their preferences,
   identifying different characteristics as important according to type,
   but that only mowing of their actual yard is consistent with type. We
   also found that both important characteristics and actual uses of
   homeowners' yards varied between front yards and backyards. Both
   homeowner types and front yard/backyard differences suggest
   opportunities for planning and maintaining larger urban woodlands on
   residential lots. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Research indicates that older siblings uniquely influence their younger
   brothers' and sisters' substance use behaviors during adolescence;
   however, the underlying mechanisms of socialization are rarely examined.
   The present study investigated whether social and/or cognitive pathways
   mediated the association between adolescent siblings' alcohol use and
   whether these pathways were moderated by the gender composition of the
   sibling dyad. Participants included one parent and two adolescent
   siblings (M age = 14.52 and 17.17 years) from 326 families. Data were
   collected via telephone interviews. Path analysis demonstrated that the
   association between older and younger siblings' alcohol use was mediated
   via social and cognitive pathways. Specifically, older siblings'
   drinking was positively related to the frequency of siblings' co-use as
   well as more positive expectations about alcohol, which in turn were
   positively associated with younger siblings' alcohol use. Identifying
   the ways in which siblings influence each other's substance use and
   health is critical because they are emerging and effective targets of
   intervention and prevention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To identify subgroups of college students with distinct
   profiles of traditional and alternative types of tobacco, alcohol, and
   other substance use and to examine how demographic characteristics and
   academic and social activities are associated with subgroup membership.
   Methods: We used latent class analysis to characterize subgroups of
   individuals in their fourth-year of college based on their patterns of
   seven substance use behaviors: extreme heavy episodic drinking (HED),
   cigarette use, cigar/cigarillo/little cigar use, smokeless tobacco use,
   hookah use, marijuana use, and non-medical prescription drug use.
   Demographic characteristics and academic and social activities were then
   incorporated as predictors of these latent classes.
   Results: We identified five classes defined by unique behavior patterns:
   (1) Non/Low Users, (2) Non-Hookah Tobacco Users, (3) Extreme HED &
   Marijuana Users, (4) Hookah and Marijuana Users, and (5) Poly-Substance
   Users. Being male, older, and involved in sports were associated with
   greater odds of being in the Poly-Substance User class compared to the
   Low/No User class, and participating in an honors society and reporting
   more positive peer relationships were associated with being in the
   Hookah and Marijuana User class compared to the Low/No User class.
   Conclusion: Our findings of unique characteristics in the subgroups
   identified suggest that college substance users are a heterogeneous
   population requiring different targeted interventions. Of particular
   concern are subgroups with high rates of alternative tobacco products,
   as perceived risks of use may be inaccurate and this is not currently a
   focus of college substance use prevention interventions. (C) 2015

AB Building resilience into today's complex infrastructures is critical to
   the daily functioning of society and its ability to withstand and
   recover from natural disasters, epidemics, and cyber-threats. This study
   proposes quantitative measures that capture and implement the definition
   of engineering resilience advanced by the National Academy of Sciences.
   The approach is applicable across physical, information, and social
   domains. It evaluates the critical functionality, defined as a
   performance function of time set by the stakeholders. Critical
   functionality is a source of valuable information, such as the
   integrated system resilience over a time interval, and its robustness.
   The paper demonstrates the formulation on two classes of models: 1)
   multi-level directed acyclic graphs, and 2) interdependent coupled
   networks. For both models synthetic case studies are used to explore
   trends. For the first class, the approach is also applied to the Linux
   operating system. Results indicate that desired resilience and
   robustness levels are achievable by trading off different design
   parameters, such as redundancy, node recovery time, and backup supply
   available. The nonlinear relationship between network parameters and
   resilience levels confirms the utility of the proposed approach, which
   is of benefit to analysts and designers of complex systems and networks.

AB A hallmark of human social cognition is the tendency for both adults and
   children to favour members of their own groups. Critically, this
   in-group bias exerts a strong influence on cooperative decision-making:
   people (i) tend to share more with members of their in-group and (ii)
   differentially enforce fairness norms depending on the group membership
   of their interaction partners. But why do people show these group biases
   in cooperation? One possibility is that the enforcement of cooperative
   norm violations is an evolved mechanism supporting within-group
   cooperation (Norms-Focused Hypothesis). Alternatively, group bias in
   cooperation could be a by-product of more general affective preferences
   for in-group members (Mere Preferences Hypothesis). Here, we appraise
   evidence from studies of both adults and children with the goal of
   understanding whether one of these two accounts is better supported by
   existing data. While the pattern of evidence is complex, much of it is
   broadly consistent with the Mere Preferences Hypothesis and little is
   uniquely supportive of the Norms-Focused Hypothesis. We highlight
   possible reasons for this complexity and suggest ways that future work
   can continue to help us understand the important relationship between
   group bias and cooperation.

AB Empathy reflects the natural ability to perceive and be sensitive to the
   emotional states of others, coupled with a motivation to care for their
   well-being. It has evolved in the context of parental care for
   offspring, as well as within kinship bonds, to help facilitate group
   living. In this paper, we integrate the perspectives of evolution,
   animal behaviour, developmental psychology, and social and clinical
   neuroscience to elucidate our understanding of the proximate mechanisms
   underlying empathy. We focus, in particular, on processing of signals of
   distress and need, and their relation to prosocial behaviour. The
   ability to empathize, both in animals and humans, mediates prosocial
   behaviour when sensitivity to others' distress is paired with a drive
   towards their welfare. Disruption or atypical development of the neural
   circuits that process distress cues and integrate them with decision
   value leads to callous disregard for others, as is the case in
   psychopathy. The realization that basic forms of empathy exist in
   non-human animals is crucial for gaining new insights into the
   underlying neurobiological and genetic mechanisms of empathy, enabling
   translation towards therapeutic and pharmacological interventions.

AB In this paper, we define a new problem related to social media, namely,
   the data-driven engineering of social dynamics. More precisely, given a
   set of observations from the past, we aim at finding the best short-term
   intervention that can lead to predefined long-term outcomes. Toward this
   end, we propose a general formulation that covers two useful engineering
   tasks as special cases, namely, pattern matching and profit
   maximization. By incorporating a deep learning model, we derive a
   solution using convex relaxation and quadratic-programming
   transformation. Moreover, we propose a data-driven evaluation method in
   place of the expensive field experiments. Using a Twitter dataset, we
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our dynamics engineering approach for
   both pattern matching and profit maximization, and study the
   multifaceted interplay among several important factors of dynamics
   engineering, such as solution validity, pattern-matching accuracy, and
   intervention cost. Finally, the method we propose is general enough to
   work with multi-dimensional time series, so it can potentially be used
   in many other applications.

AB BACKGROUNDAlthough screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) is a widely
   accepted concept nationally and screening rates are increasing, there
   are differences in screening rates between states and within states.
   METHODSIn an effort to increase screening rates and ensure equal access
   with respect to race/ethnicity, the New York City Department of Health
   and Mental Hygiene formed a coalition of stakeholders in 2003, with its
   primary focus on colonoscopy, to develop and implement strategies across
   the city to achieve this goal.
   RESULTSFrom a screening colonoscopy rate of only 42% in 2003, these
   concerted efforts contributed to achieving a screening rate of 62% by
   2007 and a screening rate of almost 70% in 2014 with the elimination of
   racial and ethnic disparities.
   CONCLUSIONSThis article provides details of how this program was
   successfully conceived, implemented, and sustained in the large urban
   population of New York City. The authors hope that by sharing the many
   elements involved and the lessons learned, they may help other
   communities to adapt these experiences to their own environments so that
   CRC screening rates can be maximized. Cancer 2016;122:269-277. (c) 2015

   A strong partnership between the New York City Department of Health and
   Mental Hygiene and an actively engaged community and academic coalition
   has successfully raised colorectal screening colonoscopy rates from 42%
   to 69% and eliminated ethnic disparities.

AB BACKGROUNDSocial and family factors can influence the health outcomes
   and quality of life of informal caregivers. Little is known about the
   distribution and correlates of such factors for caregivers of cancer
   patients. This study sought to fill this gap with data from the Cancer
   Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance consortium.
   METHODSLung and colorectal cancer patients nominated an informal
   caregiver to participate in a caregiving survey. Caregivers reported
   their sociodemographic and caregiving characteristics, social stress,
   relationship quality with the patient, and family functioning.
   Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations were used to assess the
   distribution of caregivers' social factors. Multivariable linear
   regressions assessed the independent correlates of each social factor.
   RESULTSMost caregivers reported low to moderate levels of social stress
   and good relationship quality and family functioning. In multivariable
   analyses, older age was associated with less social stress and better
   family functioning but worse relationship quality, with effect sizes
   (Cohen's d) up to 0.40 (P<.05). Caring for a female patient was
   associated with less social stress and better relationship quality but
   worse family functioning (effect sizes0.16, P<.05). Few caregiving
   characteristics were associated with social stress, whereas several were
   significant independent correlates of relationship quality. Finally,
   social factors were important independent correlates of one another.
   CONCLUSIONSThe results indicate the importance of personal and
   caregiving-related characteristics and the broader family context to
   social factors. Future work is needed to better understand these
   pathways and assess whether interventions targeting social factors can
   improve health or quality-of-life outcomes for informal cancer
   caregivers. Cancer 2016;122:278-286. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.
   The distribution and correlates of social and family factors among
   informal caregivers are assessed in a large, multisite study of lung and
   colorectal cancer survivors; the importance of personal and
   caregiving-related characteristics and the broader family context is
   highlighted. The findings suggest avenues for future research that may
   aid in the refinement of interventions to improve cancer patient and
   caregiver well-being.

AB Network resilience to perturbation is fundamental to functionality in
   systems ranging from synthetic communication networks to evolved social
   organization [1]. While theoretical work offers insight into causes of
   network robustness, examination of natural networks can identify evolved
   mechanisms of resilience and how they are related to the selective
   pressures driving structure. Female African elephants (Loxodonta
   africana) exhibit complex social networks with node heterogeneity in
   which older individuals serve as connectivity hubs [2, 3]. Recent ivory
   poaching targeting older elephants in a well-studied population has
   mirrored the targeted removal of highly connected nodes in the
   theoretical literature that leads to structural collapse [4, 5]. Here we
   tested the response of this natural network to selective knockouts. We
   find that the hierarchical network topology characteristic of elephant
   societies was highly conserved across the 16-year study despite similar
   to 70% turnover in individual composition of the population. At a
   population level, the oldest available individuals persisted to fill
   socially central positions in the network. For analyses using known
   mother-daughter pairs, social positions of daughters during the
   disrupted period were predicted by those of their mothers in years
   prior, were unrelated to individual histories of family mortality, and
   were actively built. As such, daughters replicated the social network
   roles of their mothers, driving the observed network resilience. Our
   study provides a rare bridge between network theory and an evolved
   system, demonstrating social redundancy to be the mechanism by which
   resilience to perturbation occurred in this socially advanced species.

AB Study question
   What has been the effect on purchases of beverages from stores in Mexico
   one year after implementation of the excise tax on sugar sweetened
   beverages?
   METHODS
   In this observational study the authors used data on the purchase of
   beverages in Mexico from January 2012 to December 2014 from an
   unbalanced panel of 6253 households providing 205 112 observations in 53
   cities with more than 50 000 inhabitants. To test whether the post-tax
   trend in purchases was significantly different from the pretax trend,
   the authors used a difference in difference fixed effects model, which
   adjusts for both macroeconomic variables that can affect the purchase of
   beverages over time, and pre-existing trends. The variables used in the
   analysis included demographic information on household composition (age
   and sex of household members) and socioeconomic status (low, middle, and
   high). The authors compared the predicted volumes (mL/capita/day) of
   taxed and untaxed beverages purchased in 2014-the observed post-tax
   period-with the estimated volumes that would have been purchased if the
   tax had not been implemented (counterfactual) based on pretax trends.
   STUDY ANSWER AND LIMITATIONS
   Relative to the counterfactual in 2014, purchases of taxed beverages
   decreased by an average of 6% (-12 mL/capita/day), and decreased at an
   increasing rate up to a 12% decline by December 2014. All three
   socioeconomic groups reduced purchases of taxed beverages, but
   reductions were higher among the households of low socioeconomic status,
   averaging a 9% decline during 2014, and up to a 17% decrease by December
   2014 compared with pretax trends. Purchases of untaxed beverages were 4%
   (36 mL/capita/day) higher than the counterfactual, mainly driven by an
   increase in purchases of bottled plain water.
   WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
   The tax on sugar sweetened beverages was associated with reductions in
   purchases of taxed beverages and increases in purchases of untaxed
   beverages. Continued monitoring is needed to understand purchases longer
   term, potential substitutions, and health implications.

AB Background: Lifelong exposure to stressors promotes physiological
   dysregulation and produces an allostatic load (AL). In European-derived
   samples, AL associates significantly with sex, age and health.Aim: To
   assess associations of AL with age, sex, socio-demographic differences
   and self-reports of diet and ability to complete activities of daily
   living in older Japanese residing in rural Nagasaki Prefecture.Subjects
   and methods: In 2011, 96 older residents of Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan,
   were assessed for components of AL. They also self-reported their age,
   principal life-long occupational activity, educational attainments,
   marital status, dietary choices and abilities to complete daily living
   activities.Results: Average age was 67.9 years (range=55-89; SD=8.65).
   Among these 48 men and 48 women, AL was not related significantly to
   age, although women showed lower AL than men. AL did not differ
   significantly between respondents by occupation, marital status,
   education or abilities to complete daily activities. Women who reported
   eating more green/yellow vegetables or consuming more meat had lower AL
   than their counterparts. Men who reported drinking more alcohol spirits
   had higher AL.Conclusions: Among older Japanese residing outside a major
   urban area, AL varies significantly by sex, but not age, while being
   associated with dietary choices. Although lack of association with life
   ways was not expected, AL apparently assesses physiological
   dysregulation cross-culturally.

AB Objectives: We conduct a revaluation of the Thornhill and Fincher
   research project on parasites using finely-resolved geographic data on
   parasite prevalence, individual-level sociocultural data, and multilevel
   Bayesian modeling. In contrast to the evolutionary psychological
   mechanisms linking parasites to human behavior and cultural
   characteristics proposed by Thornhill and Fincher, we offer an
   alternative hypothesis that structural racism and differential access to
   sanitation systems drive both variation in parasite prevalence and
   differential behaviors and cultural characteristics.
   Methods: We adopt a Bayesian framework to estimate parasite prevalence
   rates in 51 districts in eight Latin American countries using the
   disease status of 170,220 individuals tested for infection with the
   intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides (Hurlimann et al., [2011]:
   PLoS Negl Trop Dis 5: e1404). We then use district-level estimates of
   parasite prevalence and individual-level social data from 5,558
   individuals in the same 51 districts (Latinobarometro, 2008) to assess
   claims of causal associations between parasite prevalence and
   sociocultural characteristics.
   Results: We find, contrary to Thornhill and Fincher, that parasite
   prevalence is positively associated with preferences for democracy,
   negatively associated with preferences for collectivism, and not
   associated with violent crime rates or gender inequality. A positive
   association between parasite prevalence and religiosity, as in Fincher
   and Thornhill (2012: Behav Brain Sci 35: 61-79), and a negative
   association between parasite prevalence and achieved education, as
   predicted by Eppig et al. (2010: Proc R S B: Biol Sci 277: 3801-3808),
   become negative and unreliable when reasonable controls are included in
   the model. We find support for all predictions derived from our
   hypothesis linking structural racism to both parasite prevalence and
   cultural outcomes.
   Conclusions: We conclude that best practices in biocultural modeling
   require examining more than one hypothesis, retaining individual-level
   data and its associated variance whenever possible, and adopting
   multilevel techniques suited to the structuring of the data. (C) 2015

AB Objective To measure ecological relationships between neighborhood
   pollution burden, poverty, race/ethnicity, and pediatric preventable
   disease hospitalization rates.
   Study design Preventable disease hospitalization rates were obtained
   from the 2012 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and
   Development database, for 8 Central Valley counties. US Census Data was
   used to incorporate zip code level factors including racial diversity
   and poverty rates. The pollution burden score was calculated by the
   California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment using 11
   indicators. Poisson-based negative binomial regression was used for
   final analysis. Stratification of sample by age, race/ethnicity, and
   insurance coverage was also incorporated.
   Results Children experiencing potentially preventable hospitalizations
   are disproportionately low income and under the age of 4 years. With
   every unit increase in pollution burden, preventable disease
   hospitalizations rates increase between 21% and 32%, depending on racial
   and age subgroups. Although living in a poor neighborhood was not
   associated with potentially avoidable hospitalizations, children
   enrolled in Medi-Cal who live in neighborhoods with lower pollution
   burden and lower levels of poverty, face 32% lower risk for ambulatory
   care sensitive condition hospitalization. Children living in primary
   care shortage areas are at increased risk of preventable
   hospitalizations. Preventable disease hospitalizations increase for all
   subgroups, except white/non-Hispanic children, as neighborhoods became
   more racially diverse.
   Conclusions Understanding the geographic distribution of disease and
   impact of individual and community level factors is essential to
   expanding access to care and preventive resources to improve the health
   of children in California's most polluted and underserved region.

AB How do people maintain deeply held moral identities in a seemingly

   make acting on moral motivations difficult by building supportive

   In this article, however, the author argues that actors can achieve a
   moral "sense of one's place" through a habitus that leverages the
   material dimensions of place itself. In particular, he shows how one
   community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral
   identities centered on living "naturally" seem like "second nature,"
   even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by
   reconfiguring their physical world. The author shows how nonhuman
   objects serve as proofs of moral labor, markers of moral boundaries, and
   reminders of moral values, playing both a facilitating and constraining
   role in moral life.

AB Worry, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms are dimensions that have
   each been linked to heterogeneous problems in interpersonal functioning.
   However, the relationships between these symptoms and interpersonal
   difficulties remain unclear given that most studies have examined
   diagnostic categories, not accounted for symptoms' shared variability
   due to general distress, and investigated only interpersonal problems
   (neglecting interpersonal traits, interpersonal goals, social behavior
   in daily life, and reports of significant others). To address these
   issues, students (Study 1; N = 282) endorsed symptoms and interpersonal
   circumplex measures of traits and problems, as well as event-contingent
   social behaviors during one week of naturalistic daily interactions (N =
   184; 7,036 records). Additionally, depressed and anxious patients (N =
   47) reported symptoms and interpersonal goals in a dyadic relationship,
   and significant others rated patients' interpersonal goals and impact
   (Study 2). We derived hypotheses about prototypical interpersonal
   features from theories about the functions of particular symptoms and
   social behaviors. As expected, worry was uniquely associated with
   prototypically affiliative tendencies across all self-report measures in
   both samples, but predicted impacting significant others in
   unaffiliative ways. As also hypothesized, social anxiety was uniquely
   and prototypically associated with low dominance across measures, and
   general distress was associated with cold-submissive tendencies.
   Findings for depressive symptoms provided less consistent evidence for
   unique prototypical interpersonal features. Overall, results suggest the
   importance of multimethod assessment and accounting for general distress
   in interpersonal models of worry, social anxiety, and depressive
   symptoms.

AB From cells to societies, several general principles arise again and
   again that facilitate cooperation and suppress conflict. In this study,
   I describe three general principles of cooperation and how they operate
   across systems including human sharing, cooperation in animal and insect
   societies and the massively large-scale cooperation that occurs in our
   multicellular bodies. The first principle is that of Walk Away: that
   cooperation is enhanced when individuals can leave uncooperative
   partners. The second principle is that resource sharing is often based
   on the need of the recipient (i.e., need-based transfers) rather than on
   strict account-keeping. And the last principle is that effective scaling
   up of cooperation requires increasingly sophisticated and costly cheater
   suppression mechanisms. By comparing how these principles operate across
   systems, we can better understand the constraints on cooperation. This
   can facilitate the discovery of novel ways to enhance cooperation and
   suppress cheating in its many forms, from social exploitation to cancer.

AB The quest for a cure for HIV remains a timely and key challenge for the
   HIV research community. Despite significant scientific advances, current
   HIV therapy regimens do not completely eliminate the negative impact of
   HIV on the immune system; and the economic impact of treating all people
   infected with HIV globally, for the duration of their lifetimes,
   presents significant challenges. This article discusses, from a
   multidisciplinary approach, critical social, behavioral, ethical, and
   economic issues permeating the HIV-cure research agenda. As part of a
   search for an HIV cure, both the perspective of patients/participants
   and clinical researchers should be taken into account. In addition,
   continued efforts should be made to involve and educate the broader
   community.

TI On the Effectiveness of Social Norms Intervention in College Drinking:
   The Roles of Identity Verification and Peer Influence

AB Background: The application of social norms theory in the study of
   college drinking centers on the ideas that incorrect perceptions of
   drinking norms encourage problematic drinking behavior and that
   correcting misperceptions can mitigate problems. The design and
   execution of social norms interventions can be improved with a deeper
   understanding of causal mechanisms connecting misperception to drinking
   behavior.
   Methods: We develop an agent-based computational simulation that uses
   identity control theory and peer influence (PI) to model interactions
   that affect drinking. Using data from the College Alcohol Survey and
   Social Norms Marketing Research Project, we inform model parameters for
   agent drinking identities and perceptions. We simulate social norms
   campaigns that reach progressively larger fractions of the student
   population, and we consider the strength of the campaign in terms of
   changing student perception and resulting behavior.
   Results: We observe a general reduction in heavy episodic drinking (HED)
   as students are affected by the intervention. As campaigns reached
   larger fractions of students, the reduction rate diminishes, in some
   cases actually making a slight reverse. The way in which students "take
   the message to heart" can have a significant impact as well: The
   psychological factors involved in identity control and PI have both
   positive and negative effects on HED rates. With whom agents associate
   at drinking events also impacts drinking behavior and intervention
   effectiveness.
   Conclusions: Simulations suggest that reducing misperception can reduce
   HED. When agents adhere strongly to identity verification and when
   misperceptions affect identity appraisals, social norms campaigns can
   bring about large reductions. PI, self-monitoring, and socializing with
   like-drinking peers appear to moderate the effect.

AB Background: Social support for recovery from alcohol use disorders
   (AUDs) is associated with improvements in self-reported impulsive
   behavior in individuals treated for AUDs. We build on these findings
   using a behavioral task-based measure of response inhibition, a
   well-defined component of impulsivity, to examine the association of
   disinhibition with alcohol-specific social network characteristics
   during early recovery.
   Methods: Women (n = 28) were recruited from treatment for AUD within 3
   to 4 weeks of their last drink and were assessed at baseline and again 3
   months later. Outcome measures were level of disinhibition at baseline
   and change in disinhibition from baseline to follow-up, measured using a
   computer-based continuous performance test. The primary independent
   variables were level of drinking in the social network at baseline and
   change in network drinking from baseline to follow-up.
   Results: The sample [50% black, age M (SD) = 42.3 (9.5)] reported high
   rates of physical and sexual abuse before age 13 (43%), psychiatric
   disorder (71%), drug use disorder (78%), and previous treatment (71%).
   More drinking in participants' social networks was associated with
   greater disinhibition at baseline (beta = 12.5, 95% CI = 6.3, 18.7). A
   reduction in network drinking from baseline to follow-up was associated
   with reduced disinhibition (beta = -6.0, 95% CI = -11.3, -0.78)
   independent of IQ, recent alcohol consumption, and self-reported
   negative urgency.
   Conclusions: This study extends previous findings of an association
   between social networks and self-reported impulsivity to a
   neurobehavioral phenotype, response inhibition, suggesting that
   abstinence-supporting social networks may play a role in cognitive
   change during early recovery from AUDs.

AB Objectives: This study examines adult stature and its association with
   risk of mortality in two skeletal collections from industrializing
   London, taking sex and socioeconomic status into account as potential
   sources of heterogeneity in frailty.
   Methods: Mean femur and tibia lengths and the distributions of short
   femora and tibiae were examined in adult skeletons from the cemeteries
   at Lower Saint Bride's (low status) and Chelsea Old Church (high
   status). Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine if
   stature was associated with risk of mortality and how that relationship
   varied with sex and socioeconomic status.
   Results: High-status females had significantly longer femora, but not
   tibiae, on average, than low-status females. There were no status-based
   differences in mean element lengths among males. There were sex and
   status based differences in the distribution of short femora and tibiae,
   and there was a significant negative association between tibia length
   and risk of mortality in high-status females.
   Discussion: The results may be explained by differences in subadult
   mortality, potentially due to variation in infant feeding practices.
   Low-status infants were more likely to live in pathogenic environments
   and less likely to be breastfed, leading to both stature and
   immunological deficits, thus minimizing the association between adult
   stature and mortality, as the shortest individuals did not survive into
   adulthood. The ways in which migration and repeated epidemics of plague
   may have shaped stature variation during industrialization are also
   discussed, highlighting the importance of context in understanding the
   association between stature and mortality. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

   analyzing the socioeconomic impact of such plantations. We focus our
   study on Chile, a country that has experienced extraordinary growth of
   industrial tree plantations. Our analysis draws on a unique dataset with
   longitudinal observations collected in 180 municipal territories during
   2001-2011. Employing panel data regression techniques, we find that
   growth in plantation area is associated with higher than average rates
   of poverty during this period.

AB IMPORTANCE Community functioning is a core component of the functional
   deficits in schizophrenia, yet little systematic research on the origins
   of these functional deficits has been performed.
   OBJECTIVES To examine 3 key domains of community functioning-social
   activity, independent behavior, and functioning in school or work-before
   first hospitalization for schizophrenia and to determine whether these
   domains are familial.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based, prospective
   study that included a sibling-control comparison, data from the Israeli
   National Draft Board Registry were linked with data from the Israeli
   Psychiatric Hospitalization Case Registry. The merged file included data
   for all male adolescents who visited the draft board and were followed
   up for as much as 25.4 years from draft board assessment (through the
   end of 2010). The 3 functional domains for cases, their unaffected
   siblings, and controls were compared by time between assessment and time
   to hospitalization. Analyses were conducted from March 13, 2014, to
   October 19, 2014.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The trajectories and familiality of 3 key
   components of community functioning-social activity, independent
   behavior, and functioning in school or work-in the years preceding
   hospitalization for schizophrenia.
   RESULTS Participants included 723 316 Israeli male adolescents who
   underwent a mandatory behavioral assessment to determine eligibility for
   military service. Linkage identified 3929 individuals hospitalized for
   schizophrenia. Data for 338 550 sibling pairs, 1659 hospitalized with
   schizophrenia, were similarly ascertained. Among those with
   schizophrenia, impairments in social activity (effect size [d], 0.55)
   and functioning in school or work (d = 0.37) were recognizable up to 15
   years before hospitalization. Independent behavior seemed preserved
   until the few years before first admission. For social activity,
   differences between cases and controls were progressively greater for
   patients admitted closer to time of testing (F = 115.33, P < .001).
   Unaffected siblings had small impairments compared with controls in
   social activity (F = 28.25, P < .001) and functioning in school or work
   scales (F = 14.77, P < .001). Group familial (sibling) correlations were
   relatively high for social activity (r = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.39-0.41) and
   functioning in school or work (r = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.49-0.51) but nil for
   independent behavior (r = 0; 95% CI, -0.01 to -0.01). Impairments in
   siblings had no progressive increase and were unrelated to their
   affected sibling's time of illness onset (time trend: social activity: F
   = 5.463, P = .02; independent behavior: F = 0.908, P = .34; and
   functioning in school or work: F = 1.386, P = .24).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Various components of impaired community
   functioning in schizophrenia followed different developmental
   trajectories. Our results indicate that impairments in social activity
   and functioning in school or work are familial.

AB While social skills are commonly assessed in autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD), little is known about individuals' and families' beliefs
   regarding importance of these skills. Seventy-four parents and their
   children with ASD rated social skills importance and severity, as well
   as ASD-specific deficit severity. Parents and youth rated social skills
   as important overall; however, parents reported assertion and
   self-control to be more important than their children did. Severity and
   importance did not correlate overall. However, parent-report of
   responsibility deficits and importance were positively correlated, while
   youth-report of assertiveness deficits and importance were negatively
   correlated. Finally, ASD-specific social deficits were positively
   correlated with parent reported importance, but negatively correlated
   with child reported importance. Social skills importance ratings merit
   consideration in ASD assessment.

   between religious involvement and TL in 251 stressed female family
   caregivers recruited into a 2-site study. Religious involvement,
   perceived stress, caregiver burden, depressive symptoms, and social
   support were measured and correlated with TL in whole blood leukocytes.
   Results indicated a U-shaped relationship between religiosity and TL.
   Those scoring in the lowest 10% on religiosity tended to have the
   longest telomeres (5743 bp +/- 367 vs. 5595 +/- 383, p = 0.069).
   However, among the 90% of caregivers who were at least somewhat
   religious, religiosity was significantly and positively related to TL
   after controlling for covariates (B = 1.74, SE = 0.82, p = 0.034).
   Whereas nonreligious caregivers have relatively long telomeres, we found
   a positive relationship between religiosity and TL among those who are
   at least somewhat religious.

AB Much empirical work documents the downsides of suppressing emotions.
   Emerging research points to the need for a more sophisticated and
   culturally informed approach to understanding the consequences of
   emotion regulation. To that end, we employed behavioral, self-report,
   and psychophysiological measures to examine the consequences of two
   types of emotion regulation (suppression and amplification) in a sample
   of 28 Asian Americans and 31 European Americans. Participants were shown
   a neutral film and then a series of disgust-eliciting films during which
   they were asked to regulate their response by suppressing or amplifying
   their emotional behavior (counterbalanced). Despite self-reporting equal
   levels of disgust, European Americans showed greater skin conductance
   reactivity than Asian Americans in both regulation conditions, but not
   in response to a neutral film. These findings extend work on divergence
   in the consequences of emotion regulation across different cultural
   groups, which could help identify optimal emotion regulation strategies
   for health and well-being.

AB Previous work shows that when an image of a face is presented
   immediately prior to each trial of a speeded cognitive task
   (face-priming), the error-related negativity (ERN) is upregulated for
   Asians, but it is downregulated for Caucasians. These findings are
   consistent with the hypothesis that images of generalized other vary
   cross-culturally such that they evoke anxiety for Asians, whereas they
   serve as safety cues for Caucasians. Here, we tested whether the
   cross-cultural variation in the face-priming effect would be observed in
   a gambling paradigm. Caucasian Americans, Asian Americans, and Asian
   sojourners were exposed to a brief flash of a schematic face during a
   gamble. For Asian Americans, face-priming resulted in significant
   increases of both negative-going deflection of ERP upon negative
   feedback (feedback-related negativity [FRN]) and positive-going
   deflection of ERP upon positive feedback (feedback-related positivity
   [FRP]). For Caucasian Americans, face-priming showed a significant
   reversal, decreasing both FRN and FRP. The cultural difference in the
   face-priming effect in FRN and FRP was partially mediated by
   interdependent self-construal. Curiously, Asian sojourners showed a
   pattern similar to the one for Caucasian Americans. Our findings suggest
   that culture shapes neural pathways in both systematic and highly
   dynamic fashion.

   differences in sensitivity to social resources, the present study tested
   if ethnicity/race moderated the link between perceived support and CRP
   in a diverse community sample of 300 participants from the North Texas
   Heart Study. Consistent with prior research, there was no overall link
   between social support and CRP levels. However, the association between
   social support and high sensitivity (hs)-CRP levels was moderated by
   ethnicity/race as perceived support predicted lower hs-CRP levels
   primarily in African Americans. These results suggest the importance of
   considering how ethnicity/race may inform models on the complex

AB Objectives Evidence supports an inverse association of childhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) with systemic inflammation in adulthood.
   However, it remains to be determined whether this association is
   dependent on exposure to stressful life experiences.
   Methods We predicted that the combination of a high number of recent
   negative life events and low childhood SES would be associated with the
   highest levels of both circulating interleukin (IL)-6 and
   lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of IL-6. We tested this
   prediction among a community sample of 459 adults (47% male, mean
   [standard deviation] age = 42.8 [7.3] years).
   Results Inverse associations were found between childhood and adult SES
   indices with circulating IL-6 levels (r values between -0.07 and -0.16,
   p < .05) but not stimulated IL-6 levels (r values between -0.007 and
   0.07, p > .05). The number of recent negative life events (mean
   [standard deviation] = 2.43 [2.34]) was not significantly related to
   subjective childhood SES and other SES indices (r values < 0.06, p >
   .10). Multivariate linear regression analyses revealed a significant
   association between the interaction of subjective childhood SES and
   recent negative life events and circulating IL-6 ( = -0.09, t(404) =
   -1.98, p = .049) and a marginally significant association with
   stimulated levels of IL-6 ( = -0.10, t(365) = -1.94, p = .054), whereas
   these covariate-adjusted models revealed no main effects for subjective
   SES or recent negative life events.
   Conclusions The relationship between childhood SES and IL-6 seems to be
   moderated by recent life events, such that individuals with a relatively
   low childhood SES exhibit an inflammatory phenotype in the context of a
   high number of recent negative life events.

AB Purpose: Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with adverse
   outcomes among unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT)
   recipients, but the biologic mechanisms contributing to this health
   disparity are poorly understood. Therefore, we examined whether social
   environment affects expression of a stress-related gene expression
   profile known as the conserved transcriptional response to adversity
   (CTRA), which involves upregulation of proinflammatory genes and
   downregulation of genes involved in type I IFN response and antibody
   synthesis.
   Experimental Design: We compared pretransplant leukocyte CTRA gene
   expression between a group of 78 high versus low SES recipients of
   unrelated donor HCT for acute myelogenous leukemia in first remission.
   Post hoc exploratory analyses also evaluated whether CTRA gene
   expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes.
   Results: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected pre-HCT from low
   SES individuals demonstrated significant CTRA upregulation compared with
   matched HCT recipients of high SES. Promoter-based bioinformatics
   implicated distinct patterns of transcription factor activity, including
   increased CREB signaling and decreased IRF and GR signaling. High
   expression of the CTRA gene profile was also associated with increased
   relapse risk and decreased leukemia-free survival.
   Conclusions: Low SES is associated with increased expression of the CTRA
   gene profile, and CTRA gene expression is associated with adverse HCT
   clinical outcomes. These findings provide a biologic framework within
   which to understand how social environmental conditions may influence
   immune function and clinical outcomes in allogeneic HCT. (C)2015 AACR.

AB Patient-physician communication often occurs outside the clinic setting;
   many institutions discourage electronic communication outside of
   established electronic health record systems. Little empirical data are
   available on patient interest in electronic communication and Web-based
   health tools that are technically feasible but not widely available.
   To explore patient behavior and interest in using the Internet to
   contact physicians.
   National cross-sectional online survey.
   A sample of 4,510 CVS customers with at least one chronic condition in
   the household was used to target patients with chronic conditions and
   their caregivers. Subjects were identified from a national panel of over
   100,000 retail pharmacy customers. Of those sampled, 2,252 responded
   (50.0 % response rate).
   Survey measures included demographic and health information, patient use
   of email and Facebook to contact physicians, and patient interest in and
   use of Web-based tools for health.
   A total of 37 % of patients reported contacting their physicians via
   email within the last six months, and 18 % via Facebook. Older age was
   negatively associated with contacting physicians using email (OR 0.57
   [95 % CI 0.41-0.78]) or Facebook (OR 0.28 [0.17-0.45]). Non-white race
   (OR 1.61 [1.18-2.18] and OR 1.82 [1.24-2.67]) and caregiver status (OR
   1.58 [1.27-1.96] and OR 1.71 [1.31- 2.23]) were positively associated
   with using email and Facebook, respectively. Patients were interested in
   using Web-based tools to fill prescriptions, track their own health, and
   access health information (37-57 %), but few were currently doing so
   (4-8 %).
   In this population of retail pharmacy users, there is strong interest
   among patients in the use of email and Facebook to communicate with
   their physicians. The findings highlight the gap between patient
   interest for online communication and what physicians may currently
   provide. Improving and accelerating the adoption of secure Web messaging
   systems is a possible solution that addresses both institutional
   concerns and patient demand.

AB Introduction: Racial-ethnicminority status is a consistent risk factor
   for schizophrenia, with associations extending to bipolar disorder and
   subthreshold psychotic experiences. However, few epidemiologic studies
   have been conducted in the U.S., and evidence is inconsistent.
   Furthermore, no U.S. studies of youths have directly investigated the
   phenomenological overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We
   aimed to do so at the subthreshold level in the Philadelphia
   Neurodevelopmental Cohort.
   Methods: Participants included 6533 individuals, age 11-21 years, from a
   community healthcare network. Latent class analysis was used to form
   subtypes of sub-psychosis based on 12 attenuated positive items and 7
   mania items without duration criteria. Associations between
   race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
   "other") and sub-psychosis subtype were estimated using latent class
   regression.
   Results: Four classes were identified: Sub-positive Only (13.4%), Mania
   Only (15.5%), Both (9.1%), and Neither (62.0%). Minority participants
   were generally more likely than non-Hispanic whites to belong to one of
   the three sub-psychosis classes compared to the Neither class.
   Associations for Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks remained after
   adjustment for age, sex, and maternal education, and restriction to
   participants without significant physical health conditions.
   Racial-ethnic disparities were greater in magnitude for the two classes
   characterized by sub-positive symptoms, Sub-positive Only and Both, than
   for the Mania Only class. This pattern was statistically significant
   among non-Hispanic blacks.
   Conclusions: We found evidence for racial-ethnic disparities in
   empirically-derived subtypes of subthreshold psychosis, broadly defined,
   among U.S. youths. Further research is needed to determine whether these
   disparities persist to the clinical disorder level in adulthood.

AB This article conceptualizes economies of spectatorship through a case
   study of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (SMR). Economies of spectatorship
   produce spectacular diegeses as commodities sold to spectators and
   sponsors. They develop through a dialectical process of progressive
   decontextualization as their diegeses are cross-marketed with discrepant
   products and services to reach new markets. Progressive
   decontextualization leads to diegetic incoherence that threatens the
   realization of profit. As an economy of spectatorship, the SMR produced
   an outlaw biker themed diegesis replete with vicarious action and
   consumable character gambles. The SMR progressively decontextualized as
   it cross-marketed its outlaw diegesis with establishment corporate,
   religious and political themes. The resulting diegetic incoherence
   threatened profits and required the SMR's producers to make significant
   investments in order to stabilize its flow of spectators and sponsors.
   Conceptualizing such inherently negating processes is critical to
   understanding the commodification of spectacle in mature capitalism.

   were comparable in 1970, sociology witnessed a decline while psychology
   witnessed expansion. This article considers strategies of expanding the
   popularity of the sociology major, considering data from a variety of
   sources. Primary recommendations are to configure programs to maximize
   prospects that students discover sociology early in their college
   careers and to limit the number of barriers that might prevent students
   from enrolling in sociology courses. Departments that expanded the
   number of sociology majors from 2008 to 2014 are identified. These
   departments prioritized expanding the major as an objective and
   developed a variety of methods to increase access, visibility, and
   vitality of the sociology program at their institutions.

   student/faculty research team conducted a content analysis of 160 field
   notes from 34 undergraduate participant-observers enrolled in an
   academically grounded, field-based sociology course. The analysis
   revealed patterns of "pivot points" where students' understanding is
   characterized by a noticeable jump rather than as incremental or gradual

   categorical shifts in understanding connecting particular observations
   to generalized theories or constructs.

AB Blended learning, in the form of screencasts to be viewed online outside
   of class, was incorporated into three sections of an introductory
   sociology course in a liberal arts college setting. The screencasts were
   used to introduce concepts and theories to provide more time for
   discussion in class and more opportunity for students to review concepts
   and theories outside of class. Students' use and their perceptions of
   the impact of the screencasts were assessed with an in-class survey
   instrument in addition to a web-based college-administered survey.
   Although it was not possible to measure the impact of blended learning
   on students' academic performance and learning outcomes in this
   exploratory study, student responses indicated high use of the
   screencasts as well as the perception that the screencasts were helpful,
   contributed positively to performance on exams, and also led to more
   positive feelings about the course more generally. Overall, this
   provides an optimistic initial appraisal of the prospects for blended
   learning.

AB Motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death and injury for
   people aged 5-34, accounting annually for over 3000 deaths, and 100
   times as many injuries. It is well established that distracted driving,
   and cell phone use while driving in particular, pose significant crash
   risk to drivers. Research has demonstrated that drivers are well aware
   of this danger but over 90% of drivers report using a cell phone while
   driving. Given the likely role that social influence plays in how people
   use cell phones while driving surprisingly little research has been
   conducted investigating to whom drivers are talking or texting. We
   report the results of a national survey to determine who drivers are
   most likely to call or text when behind the wheel and compared these
   results with general cell phone calling and texting patterns as well as
   previous findings on the prevalence of calling and texting while
   driving. The results suggest that social distance is a key factor in
   cell phone use-while driving: Teens are more likely to talk with
   parents, and adults are more likely to talk with spouses than general
   calling patterns would suggest. We discuss whether the purpose of calls
   made while driving, such as coordination, could help explain these
   patterns. We propose next steps for further examining the role social
   relationships play in cell phone use while driving to potentially reduce
   teen driver cell phone use by lowering the number of calls from parents.

   review of patients with TBSA >15% between 2005 and 2012. Demographics
   and clinical course were recorded. Socioeconomics were approximated
   using census data of percent below poverty level at patient zip code,
   which was also used for calculating distance to regional burn center.
   Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis Software.
   Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated followed by
   regression models for factors associated with graft loss and
   readmission. Two hundred and fifty subjects survived to discharge: 33%
   were of upper socioeconomic status, 32% were of middle status, and 35%
   were of lower status. Fourteen percentage of patients lived <99 miles
   from the burn center, 60% 100 to 249 miles away, and 26% >240 miles
   away. Eighty readmissions occurred among 39 patients; 43% were
   unplanned. Each percent increase in TBSA was associated with a 5%
   increase in likelihood of being readmitted. Thirty six percentage of
   readmission patients were covered under worker's compensation. Patients
   with worker's compensation were four times more likely to be readmitted
   than private insurance. Only worker's compensation had a majority of
   unplanned readmissions (58%). Graft loss occurred in 12% of patients.
   Those in the low socioeconomic group had five times the odds of having
   graft loss than those in the high socioeconomics. There was no
   correlation between graft loss and insurance status or distance.
   Findings indicate strong and statistically significant correlations
   between type of insurance and likelihood of readmission and between
   graft loss and poverty.

AB Objective: Major lower extremity (MLE) amputation is a common procedure
   that results in a profound change in a patient's life. We sought to
   determine the association between social support and outcomes after
   amputation. We hypothesized that patients with greater social support
   will have better post amputation outcomes.
   Methods: From November 2011 to May 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional,
   observational, multicenter study. Social integration was measured by the
   social integration subset of the Short Form Craig Handicap Assessment
   and Reporting Technique. Systemic social support was assessed by
   comparing a United States and Tanzanian population. Walking function was
   measured using the 6-minute walk test and quality of life (QoL) was
   measured using the EuroQol-5D.
   Results: We recruited 102 MLE amputees. Sixty-three patients were
   enrolled in the United States with a mean age of 58.0. Forty-two (67%)
   were male. Patients with low social integration were more likely to be
   unable to ambulate (no walk 39% vs slow walk 23% vs fast walk 10%; P =
   .01) and those with high social integration were more likely to be fast
   walkers (no walk 10% vs slow walk 59% vs fast walk 74%; P = .01). This
   relationship persisted in a multivariable analysis. Increasing social
   integration scores were also positively associated with increasing QoL
   scores in a multivariable analysis (beta, .002; standard error, 0.0008;
   P = .02). In comparing the United States population with the Tanzanian
   cohort (39 subjects), there were no differences between functional or
   QoL outcomes in the systemic social support analysis.
   Conclusions: In the United States population, increased social
   integration is associated with both improved function and QoL outcomes
   among MLE amputees. Systemic social support, as measured by comparing
   the United States population with a Tanzanian population, was not
   associated with improved function or QoL outcomes. In the United States,
   steps should be taken to identify and aid amputees with poor social
   integration.

AB Introduction: Childhood adversity is an under-addressed dimension of
   primary prevention of disease in children and adults. Evidence shows
   racial/ethnic and socioeconomic patterning of childhood adversity in the
   U.S., yet data on the interaction of race/ethnicity and SES for exposure
   risk is limited, particularly with consideration of immigration history.
   This study examined racial/ ethnic differences in nine adversities among
   children (from birth to age 17 years) in the National Survey of Child
   Health (2011-2012) and determined how differences vary by immigration
   history and income (N = 84,837).
   Methods: We estimated cumulative adversity and individual adversity
   prevalences among white, black, and Hispanic children of U.S.-born and
   immigrant parents. We examined whether family income mediated the
   relationship between race/ethnicity and exposure to adversities, and
   tested interactions (analyses conducted in 2014-2015).
   Results: Across all groups, black and Hispanic children were exposed to
   more adversities compared with white children, and income disparities in
   exposure were larger than racial/ethnic disparities. For children of
   U.S.-born parents, these patterns of racial/ethnic and income
   differences were present for most individual adversities. Among children
   of immigrant parents, there were few racial/ethnic differences for
   individual adversities and income gradients were inconsistent. Among
   children of U.S.-born parents, the Hispanic-white disparity in exposure
   to adversities persisted after adjustment for income, and racial/ethnic
   disparities in adversity were largest among children from high-income
   families.
   Conclusions: Simultaneous consideration of multiple social statuses
   offers promising frameworks for fresh thinking about the distribution of
   disease and the design of targeted interventions to reduce preventable
   health disparities. (C) 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB Introduction: Military sexual trauma (MST) includes sexual harassment or
   sexual assault that occurs during military service and is of increasing
   public health concern. The population prevalence of MST among female and
   male veterans who served during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi
   Freedom (OEF/OIF) has not been estimated to our knowledge. The purpose
   of this study is to assess the population prevalence and identify
   military correlates of MST, sexual harassment, and sexual assault among
   OEF/OIF veterans.
   Methods: MST was assessed in the 2009-2011 National Health Study for a
   New Generation of U.S. Veterans, a survey of 60,000 veterans who served
   during the OEF/OIF eras (response rate, 34%, n = 20,563). Weighted
   prevalence estimates and AORs of MST, sexual harassment, and sexual
   assault among women and men were calculated. Gender-stratified logistic
   regression models controlled for military and demographic
   characteristics. Data analyses were conducted in 2013-2014.
   Results: Approximately 41% of women and 4% of men reported experiencing
   MST. Deployed men had lower risk for MST compared with non-deployed men,
   though no difference was found among women. However, veterans reporting
   combat exposure during deployment had increased risk for MST compared
   with those without, while controlling for OEF/OIF deployment. Among
   women, Marines and Navy veterans had increased risk for MST compared
   with Air Force veterans. MST was significantly higher among veterans who
   reported using Veterans Affairs healthcare services.
   Conclusions: These prevalence estimates underscore the importance of
   public awareness and continued investigation of the public health impact
   of MST. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of

AB Fire ants link their bodies to form aggregations; these can adopt a
   variety of structures(1-4), they can drip(2) and spread(4), or withstand
   applied loads(5,6). Here, by using oscillatory rheology, we show that
   fire ant aggregations are viscoelastic. We find that, at the lowest ant
   densities probed and in the linear regime, the elastic and viscous
   moduli are essentially identical over the spanned frequency range, which
   highlights the absence of a dominant mode of structural relaxation(7).
   As ant density increases, the elastic modulus rises, which we interpret
   by alluding to ant crowding and subsequent jamming. When deformed beyond
   the linear regime, the aggregation flows, exhibiting shear-thinning
   behaviour with a stress load that is comparable to the maximum load the
   aggregation can withstand before individual ants are torn apart. Our
   findings illustrate the rich, collective mechanical behaviour that can
   arise in aggregations of active, interacting building blocks.

   account @AP, which affected financial markets, wiping out $136.5 billion
   of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index's value. While the speed of the
   Associated Press hack crash event and the proprietary nature of the
   algorithms involved make it difficult to make causal claims about the
   relationship between social media and trading algorithms, we argue that
   it helps us to critically examine the volatile connections between
   social media, financial markets, and third parties offering human and
   algorithmic analysis. By analyzing the commentaries of this event, we
   highlight two particular currents: one formed by computational processes
   that mine and analyze Twitter data, and the other being financial
   algorithms that make automated trades and steer the stock market. We
   build on sociology of finance together with media theory and focus on
   the work of Christian Marazzi, Gabriel Tarde and Tony Sampson to analyze
   the relationship between social media and financial markets. We argue
   that Twitter and social media are becoming more powerful forces, not
   just because they connect people or generate new modes of participation,
   but because they are connecting human communicative spaces to automated
   computational spaces in ways that are affectively contagious and highly
   volatile.

AB This article discusses the uneasy relationship between forward-oriented
   sociological research and public debate. It explores how implicit
   assumptions and explicit conceptualizations influence sociology's
   ability to address the future. It argues that the stakes are not merely
   theoretical but also practical because methodological pre-decisions
   shape sociology's relation to public debate and its abilities to tackle
   the emergent challenges of our time. Sociology was geared since its
   inception toward the collective reflection of not only present or past
   conditions of social existence but also of possibilities for change.
   While deterministic and expertocratic closures limited its potential,
   shifting epistemological, institutional, and social constellations allow
   the expansion, evasion, and re-emergence of open and contestable future
   orientations. Case studies related to climate change, globalization,
   social movements, values, and media are used to explore actual and
   potential contributions to public discourse.

AB Declining public confidence in science is a concern in the US and
   Europe, but it is unclear what predicts confidence in science in
   developed countries, let alone in developing countries. This article
   examines how development and risk society' shape individual attitudes
   toward science across 47 diverse countries, using four theoretically
   driven measures of risk society. It is found that people in affluent
   societies have lower support for science than those in less affluent
   societies. Specifically, individuals holding post-materialist attitudes
   and living in countries with greater human and economic development
   (measured by higher internet access and tertiary enrollment, and lower
   infant mortality) have lower confidence in future-oriented science. The
   article concludes that the scientific gains that are brought by
   affluence are accompanied by heightened fears of human-made risks.

AB Elite universities are credited as launch points for the widest variety
   of meaningful careers. Yet, year after year at the most selective
   universities, nearly half the graduating seniors head to a surprisingly
   narrow band of professional options. Over the past few decades, this has
   largely been into the finance and consulting sectors, but increasingly
   it also includes high-tech firms. This study uses a
   cultural-organizational lens to show how student cultures and campus
   structures steer large portions of anxious and uncertain students into
   high-wealth, high-status occupational sectors. Interviewing 56 students
   and recent alumni at Harvard and Stanford Universities, we found that
   the majority of our respondents experienced confusion about career paths
   when first arriving at college but quickly learned what were considered
   to be the most prestigious options. On-campus corporate recruitment for
   finance, consulting, and high-tech jobs functioned as a significant
   driver of student perceptions of status; career prestige systems built
   up among peers exacerbated the funneling effect into these jobs. From
   these processes, students learned to draw boundaries between
   high-status'' and ordinary'' jobs. Our findings demonstrate how status
   processes on college campuses are central in generating preferences for
   the uppermost positions in the occupational structure and that elite
   campus environments have a large, independent role in the production and
   reproduction of social inequality.

AB Adaptive governance provides the capacity for environmental managers and
   decision makers to confront variable degrees of uncertainty inherent to
   complex social-ecological systems. Current theoretical
   conceptualizations of adaptive governance represent a series of
   structures and processes best suited for either adapting or transforming
   existing environmental governance regimes towards forms flexible enough
   to confront rapid ecological change. As the number of empirical examples
   of adaptive governance described in the literature grows, the conceptual
   basis of adaptive governance remains largely under theorized. We argue
   that reconnecting adaptive governance with foundational concepts of
   ecological resilience-specifically Panarchy and the adaptive cycle of
   complex systems-highlights the importance of episodic disturbances and
   cross-scale interactions in triggering reorganizations in governance. By
   envisioning the processes of adaptive governance through the lens of
   Panarchy, scholars and practitioners alike will be better able to
   identify the emergence of adaptive governance, as well as take advantage
   of opportunities to institutionalize this type of governance in pursuit
   of sustainability outcomes. The synergistic analysis of adaptive
   governance and Panarchy can provide critical insight for analyzing the
   role of social dynamics during oscillating periods of stability and
   instability in social-ecological systems. A deeper understanding of the
   potential for cross-scale interactions to shape adaptive governance
   regimes may be useful as society faces the challenge of mitigating the
   impacts of global environmental change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Past research suggests that warmth and competence are primary dimensions
   of social perception used by adults to understand social groups. The
   current study investigated whether children use these two dimensions to
   structure their representations of familiar groups. Results indicated
   that adult warmth and competence judgments were independent from one
   another and placed groups in warmth by competence space in ways
   consistent with past work. However, children showed some sensitivity to
   both dimensions but did not treat them as independent. Children's
   judgments of competence were closely aligned with adult judgments, but
   their judgments of warmth were influenced by factors that solely
   influenced adult judgments of competence. These data suggest that
   children develop an understanding of competence as an independent
   dimension prior to developing an understanding of warmth as an
   independent dimension and that their judgments of warmth may reflect a
   more general summing of all available evaluative information.
   Implications for children's developing understanding of the broader

   interests. Four- to 8-year-olds heard conflicting information about
   traditionally feminine or masculine domains from a gender
   counter-stereotypical expert (e.g., a boy with expertise in ballet) and
   a layperson of the other gender (e.g., a girl with little knowledge
   about ballet). Participants were asked which informant was correct, who
   they would prefer to learn from in the future, and to rate their liking
   of each informant. Overall, participants selected the gender
   counter-stereotypical expert as correct. Four- to 5-year-olds reported a
   preference to learn from same-gender participants in the future
   irrespective of expertise, whereas 6- to 8-year-olds reported wanting to
   learn from counter-stereotypical experts. Boys showed relatively greater
   acceptance of information from a male counter-stereotypical expert than
   from a female counter-stereotypical expert. Although participants
   reported greater liking of same-gender informants, liking evaluations
   were largely positive irrespective of gender norm deviations.

AB Intercountry adoptions from Guatemala were highly controversial, because
   of the large numbers of children being adopted to the USA, along with
   evidence of corruption and child theft. Since the implementation of the
   Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption in 2008, Guatemala's central
   authority for adoption has prioritized domestic placements for children
   over intercountry adoption. A possible attitudinal barrier to domestic
   adoption in Guatemala-negative attitudes and prejudice against
   Indigenous people-was investigated through questionnaires measuring
   attitudes toward adoption and attitudes toward and social distance from
   the two major ethnic groups (Ladino and Indigenous). Guatemalan
   university students (N = 177, 61 % men) were recruited from basic
   required courses at a private university. Results showed that attitudes
   toward adoption in general were more favorable than toward interethnic
   adoption, with the most negative attitudes toward adoption of Ladino
   children by Indigenous parents. Multiple regression and analysis of
   covariance models revealed that female gender, experience with adoption
   and more positive attitudes about Indigenous persons were associated
   with more positive attitudes toward adoption. The findings imply that
   negative attitudes toward Indigenous persons are associated with
   negative attitudes toward adoption, and serve as barriers to promoting
   domestic adoption in Guatemala.

AB People frequently use physical appearance stereotypes to categorize
   individuals when their group membership is not directly observable.
   Recent research indicates that political conservatives tend to use such
   stereotypes more than liberals do because they express a greater desire
   for certainty and order. In the present research, we found that
   conservatives were also more likely to negatively evaluate and
   distribute fewer economic resources to people who deviate from the
   stereotypes of their group. This occurred for people belonging to both
   preexisting and novel groups, regardless of whether the stereotypes were
   real or experimentally fabricated. Critically, conservatives only
   negatively evaluated counterstereotypical people when the stereotypes
   were functional-that is, when they expected that they would need to use
   the stereotypes at a later point to categorize individuals into groups.
   Moreover, increasing liberals' desire for certainty led them to
   negatively evaluate counterstereotypical people just like conservatives
   did. Thus, conservatives are not only more likely to use stereotypes
   than are liberals, but are especially likely to negatively evaluate
   counterstereotypical people to organize the social world with greater
   certainty.

AB Humans are unique among all species in their ability to develop and
   enforce social norms, but there is wide variation in the strength of
   social norms across human societies. Despite this fundamental aspect of
   human nature, there has been surprisingly little research on how social
   norm violations are detected at the neurobiological level. Building on
   the emerging field of cultural neuroscience, we combine noninvasive
   electroencephalography (EEG) with a new social norm violation paradigm
   to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the detection of norm
   violations and how they vary across cultures. EEG recordings from
   Chinese and US participants (n = 50) showed consistent negative
   deflection of event-related potential around 400 ms (N400) over the
   central and parietal regions that served as a culture-general neural
   marker of detecting norm violations. The N400 at the frontal and
   temporal regions, however, was only observed among Chinese but not US
   participants, illustrating culture-specific neural substrates of the
   detection of norm violations. Further, the frontal N400 predicted a
   variety of behavioral and attitudinal measurements related to the
   strength of social norms that have been found at the national and state
   levels, including higher culture superiority and self-control but lower
   creativity. There were no cultural differences in the N400 induced by
   semantic violation, suggesting a unique cultural influence on social
   norm violation detection. In all, these findings provided the first
   evidence, to our knowledge, for the neurobiological foundations of
   social norm violation detection and its variation across cultures.

AB An essential tension can be found between researchers interested in
   ecological validity and those concerned with maintaining experimental
   control. Research in the human neurosciences often involves the use of
   simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important
   aspects of real world activities and interactions. While this research
   is valuable, there is a growing interest in the human neurosciences to
   use cues about target states in the real world via multimodal scenarios
   that involve visual, semantic, and prosodic information. These scenarios
   should include dynamic stimuli presented concurrently or serially in a
   manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes
   carried out by perceivers over time. Furthermore, there is growing
   interest in contextually embedded stimuli that can constrain participant
   interpretations of cues about a target's internal states. Virtual
   reality environments proffer assessment paradigms that combine the
   experimental control of laboratory measures with emotionally engaging
   background narratives to enhance affective experience and social
   interactions. The present review highlights the potential of virtual
   reality environments for enhanced ecological validity in the clinical,
   affective, and social neurosciences.

AB A sense of fairness plays a critical role in supporting human
   cooperation(1-3). Adult norms of fair resource sharing vary widely
   across societies, suggesting that culture shapes the acquisition of
   fairness behaviour during childhood(4,5). Here we examine how fairness
   behaviour develops in children from seven diverse societies, testing
   children from 4 to 15 years of age (n = 866 pairs) in a standardized
   resource decision task(6,7). We measured two key aspects of fairness
   decisions: disadvantageous inequity aversion (peer receives more than
   self) and advantageous inequity aversion (self receives more than a
   peer). We show that disadvantageous inequity aversion emerged across all
   populations by middle childhood. By contrast, advantageous inequity
   aversion was more variable, emerging in three populations and only later
   in development. We discuss these findings in relation to questions about
   the universality and cultural specificity of human fairness.

AB The decision to engage in corruption-public and private corruption,
   nepotism, and embezzlement-is often attributed to rational actors
   maximizing benefits to themselves. However, the importance of reciprocal
   relationships in humans suggests that an actor may weigh the costs of
   harms of her corrupt behavior to individuals who may generate future
   benefits for her. We hypothesize that actors who have a larger circle of
   actual and potential social partners will have more individuals to
   consider when generating harms and will thus be less likely to find
   corrupt acts permissible than actors with smaller circles of valued
   others. Using data from the World Values Survey and European Values
   Study (WVS), we explore whether participants with a larger geographic
   identity or a greater number of group memberships (i.e. a larger scope
   of actual and potential social partners) are less likely to find
   accepting bribes permissible. We find mixed support for our hypotheses,
   but consistently find that WVS participants with local, country,
   continent, or world geographic identities are less likely to find
   accepting a bribe permissible than those with regional identities-that
   is, actors whose primary identities that encompass more than their
   region find corruption less permissible. We discuss the importance of
   considering an actor's valuation of others when modeling corruption
   persistence, noting that establishing scopes of positive valuation is a
   precursor to predicting where actors will target benefits and shunt
   costs.

   Five longitudinal leukocyte transcriptome surveys in 141 older adults
   showed up-regulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), monocyte
   population expansion, and up-regulation of the leukocyte conserved
   transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA). Mechanistic analyses in a

   impaired response to infection by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).
   These analyses identify neuroendocrine-related alterations in myeloid

AB Archaeological accounts of cultural change reveal a fundamental
   conflict: Some suggest that change is gradual, accelerating over time,
   whereas others indicate that it is punctuated, with long periods of
   stasis interspersed by sudden gains or losses of multiple traits.
   Existing models of cultural evolution, inspired by models of genetic
   evolution, lend support to the former and do not generate trajectories
   that include large-scale punctuated change. We propose a simple model
   that can give rise to both exponential and punctuated patterns of gain
   and loss of cultural traits. In it, cultural innovation comprises
   several realistic interdependent processes that occur at different
   rates. The model also takes into account two properties intrinsic to
   cultural evolution: the differential distribution of traits among social
   groups and the impact of environmental change. In our model, a
   population may be subdivided into groups with different cultural
   repertoires leading to increased susceptibility to cultural loss,
   whereas environmental change may lead to rapid loss of traits that are
   not useful in a new environment. Taken together, our results suggest the
   usefulness of a concept of an effective cultural population size.

AB Tuberculosis transmission and progression are largely driven by social
   factors such as poor living conditions and poor nutrition. Increased
   standards of living and social approaches helped to decrease the burden
   of tuberculosis before the introduction of chemotherapy in the 1940s.
   Since then, management of tuberculosis has been largely biomedical. More
   funding for tuberculosis since 2000, coinciding with the Millennium
   Development Goals, has yielded progress in tuberculosis mortality but
   smaller reductions in incidence, which continues to pose a risk to
   sustainable development, especially in poor and susceptible populations.
   These at-risk populations need accelerated progress to end tuberculosis
   as resolved by the World Health Assembly in 2015. Effectively addressing
   the worldwide tuberculosis burden will need not only enhancement of
   biomedical approaches but also rebuilding of the social approaches of
   the past. To combine a biosocial approach, underpinned by social,
   economic, and environmental actions, with new treatments, new
   diagnostics, and universal health coverage, will need multisectoral
   coordination and action involving the health and other governmental
   sectors, as well as participation of the civil society, and especially
   the poor and susceptible populations. A biosocial approach to stopping
   tuberculosis will not only target morbidity and mortality from disease
   but would also contribute substantially to poverty alleviation and
   sustainable development that promises to meet the needs of the present,
   especially the poor, and provide them and subsequent generations an
   opportunity for a better future.

AB Reputations are a ubiquitous feature of human social life, and a large
   literature has been dedicated to explaining the relationship between
   prosocial reputations and cooperation in social dilemmas. However,
   humans form reputations in domains other than prosociality, such as
   economic competency that could affect cooperation. To date, no research
   has evaluated the relative effects of multiple reputation domains on
   cooperation. To bridge this gap, we analyse how prosocial and competency
   reputations affect cooperation in two Latin American communities (Bwa
   Mawego, Dominica, and Pucucanchita, Peru) across a number of social
   contexts (Dominica: labour contracting, labour exchange and conjugal
   partnership formation; Peru: agricultural and health advice network
   size). First, we examine the behavioural correlates of prosocial and
   competency reputations. Following, we analyse whether prosocial,
   competency, or both reputation domains explain the flow of cooperative
   benefits within the two communities. Our analyses suggest that (i)
   although some behaviours affect both reputation domains simultaneously,
   each reputation domain has a unique behavioural signature; and (ii)
   competency reputations affect cooperation across a greater number of
   social contexts compared to prosocial reputations. Results are
   contextualized with reference to the social markets in which behaviour
   is embedded and a call for greater theory development is stressed.

AB Life abounds with examples of conspecifics actively cooperating to a
   common end, despite conflicts of interest being expected concerning how
   much each individual should contribute. Mathematical models typically
   find that such conflict can be resolved by partial-response strategies,
   leading investors to contribute relatively equitably. Using a case study
   approach, we show that such model expectations can be contradicted in at
   least four disparate contexts: (i) bi-parental care; (ii) cooperative
   breeding; (iii) cooperative hunting; and (iv) human cooperation. We
   highlight that: (a) marked variation in contributions is commonplace;
   and (b) individuals can often respond positively rather than negatively
   to the contributions of others. Existing models have surprisingly
   limited power in explaining these phenomena. Here, we propose that,
   although among-individual variation in cooperative contributions will be
   influenced by differential costs and benefits, there is likely to be a
   strong genetic or epigenetic component. We then suggest that selection
   can maintain high investors (key individuals) when their contributions
   promote support by increasing the benefits and/or reducing the costs for
   others. Our intentions are to raise awareness in-and provide testable
   hypotheses of-two of the most poorly understood, yet integral, questions
   regarding cooperative ventures: why do individuals vary in their
   contributions and when does cooperation beget cooperation?

AB Anthropological evidence from diverse societies suggests that
   prestige-based leadership may provide a foundation for cooperation in
   many contexts. Here, inspired by such ethnographic observations and
   building on a foundation of existing research on the evolution of
   prestige, we develop a set of formal models to explore when an evolved
   prestige psychology might drive the cultural evolution of n-person
   cooperation, and how such a cultural evolutionary process might create
   novel selection pressures for genes that make prestigious individuals
   more prosocial. Our results reveal (i) how prestige can foster the
   cultural emergence of cooperation by generating correlated behavioural
   phenotypes, both between leaders and followers, and among followers;
   (ii) why, in the wake of cultural evolution, natural selection favours
   genes that make prestigious leaders more prosocial, but only when groups
   are relatively small; and (iii), why the effectiveness of status
   differences in generating cooperation in large groups depends on
   cultural transmission (and not primarily on deference or coercion). Our
   theoretical framework, and the specific predictions made by these
   models, sketch out an interdisciplinary research programme that
   cross-cuts anthropology, biology, psychology and economics. Some of our
   predictions find support from laboratory work in behavioural economics
   and are consistent with several real-world patterns.

AB While many hormones play vital roles in facilitating or reinforcing
   cooperative behaviour, the neurohormones underlying competitive and
   cooperative behaviours are largely conserved across all mammals. This
   raises the question of how endocrine mechanisms have been shaped by
   selection to produce different levels of cooperation in different
   species. Multiple components of endocrine physiology-from baseline
   hormone concentrations, to binding proteins, to the receptor sensitivity
   and specificity-can evolve independently and be impacted by current
   socio-ecological conditions or individual status, thus potentially
   generating a wide range of variation within and between species. Here,
   we highlight several neurohormones and variation in hormone receptor
   genes associated with cooperation, focusing on the role of oxytocin and
   testosterone in contexts ranging from parenting and pair-bonding to
   reciprocity and territorial defence. While the studies reviewed herein
   describe the current state of the literature with regard to hormonal
   modulators of cooperation and collective action, there is still a
   paucity of research on hormonal mechanisms that help facilitate
   large-scale collective action. We end by discussing several potential
   areas for future research.

AB Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are often characterized as remedies
   to educational disparities related to social class. Using data from 68
   MOOCs offered by Harvard and MIT between 2012 and 2014, we found that
   course participants from the United States tended to live in
   more-affluent and better-educated neighborhoods than the average U.S.
   resident. Among those who did register for courses, students with
   greater socioeconomic resources were more likely to earn a certificate.
   Furthermore, these differences in MOOC access and completion were larger
   for adolescents and young adults, the traditional ages where people find
   on-ramps into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   course work and careers. Our findings raise concerns that MOOCs and
   similar approaches to online learning can exacerbate rather than reduce
   disparities in educational outcomes related to socioeconomic status.

AR 285
DI 10.1186/s12916-015-0518-x

AB Background: Globally, countries are increasingly prioritizing the
   reduction of health inequalities and provision of universal health
   coverage. While national benchmarking has become more common, such work
   at subnational levels is rare. The timely and rigorous measurement of
   local levels and trends in key health interventions and outcomes is
   vital to identifying areas of progress and detecting early signs of
   stalled or declining health system performance. Previous studies have
   yet to provide a comprehensive assessment of Uganda's maternal and child
   health (MCH) landscape at the subnational level.
   Methods: By triangulating a number of different data sources -
   population censuses, household surveys, and administrative data - we
   generated regional estimates of 27 key MCH outcomes, interventions, and
   socioeconomic indicators from 1990 to 2011. After calculating
   source-specific estimates of intervention coverage, we used a two-step
   statistical model involving a mixed-effects linear model as an input to
   Gaussian process regression to produce regional-level trends. We also
   generated national-level estimates and constructed an indicator of
   overall intervention coverage based on the average of 11 high-priority
   interventions.
   Results: National estimates often veiled large differences in coverage
   levels and trends across Uganda's regions. Under-5 mortality declined
   dramatically, from 163 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 85 deaths
   per 1,000 live births in 2011, but a large gap between Kampala and the
   rest of the country persisted. Uganda rapidly scaled up a subset of
   interventions across regions, including household ownership of
   insecticide-treated nets, receipt of artemisinin-based combination
   therapies among children under 5, and pentavalent immunization.
   Conversely, most regions saw minimal increases, if not actual declines,
   in the coverage of indicators that required multiple contacts with the
   health system, such as four or more antenatal care visits, three doses
   of oral polio vaccine, and two doses of intermittent preventive therapy
   during pregnancy. Some of the regions with the lowest levels of overall
   intervention coverage in 1990, such as North and West Nile, saw marked
   progress by 2011; nonetheless, sizeable disparities remained between
   Kampala and the rest of the country. Countrywide, overall coverage
   increased from 40 % in 1990 to 64 % in 2011, but coverage in 2011 ranged
   from 57 % to 70 % across regions.
   Conclusions: The MCH landscape in Uganda has, for the most part,
   improved between 1990 and 2011. Subnational benchmarking quantified the
   persistence of geographic health inequalities and identified regions in
   need of additional health systems strengthening. The tracking and
   analysis of subnational health trends should be conducted regularly to
   better guide policy decisions and strengthen responsiveness to local
   health needs.

AB Objectives. We determined the association between maternal neighborhood
   socioeconomic position (SEP) and the risk of cleft lip with or without
   cleft palate (CL +/- P) or cleft palate alone (CP) in offspring.
   Methods. We obtained information on CL +/- P (n = 2555) and CP (n =
   1112) cases and unaffected controls (n = 14 735) among infants delivered
   during 1999 to 2008 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. Neighborhood
   SEP variables, drawn from the 2000 US Census, included census
   tract-level poverty, education, unemployment, occupation, housing, and
   crowding, from which we created a composite neighborhood deprivation
   index (NDI). We used mixed-effects logistic regression to evaluate
   neighborhood SEP and oral clefts.
   Results. Mothers with CL +/- P-affected offspring were more likely to
   live in high-NDI (adverse) areas than mothers with unaffected offspring
   (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05, 1.37).
   This association was strongest among Hispanic mothers (OR = 1.32, 95% CI
   = 1.07, 1.62). No associations were observed with CP.
   Conclusions. Using data from one of the world's largest active
   surveillance birth defects registries, we found that adverse
   neighborhood SEP is modestly associated with CL +/- P, especially among
   Hispanics. These findings may have important implications for health
   disparities prevention.

AB Museums often keep secret information concerning the acquisition and
   stewardship of their collections even though retaining such privileged
   information may contradict the ideal of the museum-serving the public
   good in the public trust. Over the last three decades, this paradox has
   been particularly revealed during repatriation debates, which have
   threatened many museums with the loss of objects while exposing
   histories of illicit and unethical collecting. In this article, I
   provide a case study to the theme of secrecy by exploring how, in the
   United States, the institutional culture of museums creates a process
   that shelters certain kinds of knowledge. While repatriation law in the
   United States was intended to increase transparency about Native
   American collections and thus shift power asymmetries between museums
   and tribes, the law has ultimately reinforced preexisting power
   structures. Repatriation reveals the tension between concealing and
   disclosing secrets.

AB Italy's 1998 Immigration Law 40 includes Article 18, which allows
   foreign "victims of human trafficking" the right to temporary residence
   permits on the condition that they participate in a rehabilitation
   program. The first step of this program, the act of denuncia, is to file
   criminal charges against exploiters at the police station. However, the
   resulting testimony cannot be understood through the victim/agent trope
   of the bureaucratic state, which uses these categories to make the other
   understandable through a process of what I call "confessional
   recognition." In this article, I show how, despite the proliferation of
   biometric technologies to identify foreign others and so control
   migration flows at borders, confessional practices continue to play a
   central role in deciding who is admitted legally. Moreover, I illustrate
   how the question of redemption and expiation is not only a crucial issue
   for Catholic groups involved in aid programs for foreigners but is also
   central to Italian state integration policies, thus revealing how
   juridical norms are deeply influenced by the vocabulary of religious
   morality and vice versa.

AB Although social mechanisms for the control of knowledge are widely
   studied, research into how intersecting groups and institutions
   reconcile culturally different approaches to knowledge has been limited.
   I explore this territory by looking at a collaborative project to create
   digital 3-D scans and replicas of objects of cultural patrimony that was
   developed between the National Museum of Natural History and the Tlingit
   tribe of Alaska in 2010. These 3-D reproductions highlight the social
   values ascribed to digital technology, including its perceived ability
   to disseminate knowledge and reveal to the public the inner workings of
   museums, such as the process of repatriation. The presumed and
   deceptively straightforward nature of copies, however, belies their
   powers of social transformation. As explored through these 3-D digital
   replica projects, I argue these are not only about the power to
   physically replicate something but also the potential to construct
   relationships and, therefore, to transform the current social order. I
   look at the problems of using the term "secrecy" in these cross-cultural
   contexts, opting instead to identify how responsibilities are assigned
   to knowledge and its use. By also identifying what I term "perclusive"
   alliances that traverse groups and public/private knowledge categories,
   I argue for an analytical approach that studies across institutional and
   cultural contexts, thereby identifying variations in how these
   responsibilities toward knowledge are assigned and according to which
   contexts as well as the means employed to negotiate difference.

AB During the last decade alone, it is estimated that tens of thousands of
   children have been born worldwide as a result of wartime rape and sexual
   exploitation, yet we know very little about these living legacies of
   sexual violence. I complement research in Peru with comparative data to
   explore four themes. Influenced by the incitement to "break the
   silence," the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission actively
   sought out first-person accounts of rape, understood to be the
   emblematic womanly wound of war. I analyze what a focus on rape and
   sexual violence brings into our field of vision and what it may obscure.
   I turn next to local biologies and theories of transmission. Children
   conceived of rape face stigma and infanticide in many societies, which
   in part reflects the theories of transmission that operate in any given
   social context. Theories of transmission lead to " strategic
   pregnancies" as women seek to exert some control over their reproductive
   labor and to identify the father of their child. The effort to determine
   paternity involves names and naming practices and the patriarchal law of
   the father. I conclude with questions to assist in making these issues

AB Background: Early social experiences are believed to shape
   neurodevelopment, with potentially lifelong consequences. Yet minimal
   evidence exists regarding the role of the social environment on
   children's neural functioning, a core domain of neurodevelopment.
   Methods: We analysed data from 36 443 participants in the United States
   Collaborative Perinatal Project, a socioeconomically diverse pregnancy
   cohort conducted between 1959 and 1974. Study outcomes included:
   physician (neurologist or paediatrician)-rated neurological abnormality
   neonatally and thereafter at 4 months and 1 and 7 years; indicators of
   neurological hard signs and soft signs; and indicators of autonomic
   nervous system function.
   Results: Children born to socioeconomically disadvantaged parents were
   more likely to exhibit neurological abnormalities at 4 months [odds
   ratio (OR) = 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06, 1.37], 1 year
   (OR = 1.35; CI = 1.17, 1.56), and 7 years (OR = 1.67; CI = 1.48, 1.89),
   and more likely to exhibit neurological hard signs (OR = 1.39; CI =
   1.10, 1.76), soft signs (OR = 1.26; CI = 1.09, 1.45) and autonomic
   nervous system dysfunctions at 7 years. Pregnancy and delivery
   complications, themselves associated with socioeconomic disadvantage,
   did not account for the higher risks of neurological abnormalities among
   disadvantaged children.
   Conclusions: Parental socioeconomic disadvantage was, independently from
   pregnancy and delivery complications, associated with abnormal child
   neural development during the first 7 years of life. These findings
   reinforce the importance of the early environment for neurodevelopment
   generally, and expand knowledge regarding the domains of
   neurodevelopment affected by environmental conditions. Further work is
   needed to determine the mechanisms linking socioeconomic disadvantage
   with children's neural functioning, the timing of such mechanisms and
   their potential reversibility.

   questions: (1) How welcome do Iranian-American men and women from
   various religious backgrounds (Muslim, Jewish, or no religious
   affiliation) feel in their new homeland (specifically, how much social
   distance (affective distance) do they think their Euro-American
   neighbors feel toward them? and (2) to what extent does the possession
   of stereotypical Middle Eastern, Iranian, or Muslim traits (an accent,
   darker skin, wearing of religious symbols, traditional garb, etc.) spark
   prejudice and thus Iranian-Americans perception of social distance?
   Participants were recruited from two very different sources: (1)
   shoppers at grocery stores in Iranian-American neighborhoods in Los
   Angeles, and (2) a survey posted on http://Surveymonkey.com. A total of
   374 Iranian-Americans, ages 18 and older, completed an in-person or
   online questionnaire that included the following: a request for
   demographic information, religious preferences, a survey of how
   typically Iranian-American the respondents' traits were, and the social
   distance scale. A surprise was that it was the Iranian-American Jews
   (not the Muslims), who felt most keenly that Euro-Americans kept them at
   a distance. Jewish women received higher scores on the social distance
   scale than did members of any other group. In addition, again, it was
   mainly Iranian-American Jews, particularly those who spoke with a Middle
   Eastern accent or wore stereotypically religious symbols, who felt the
   most social distance existing between them and "typical" Americans.

AB The whooping crane (Grus americana) is an endangered North American
   species facing multiple environmental and anthropogenic threats. Even if
   the species thrives, it must continue to be managed after recovery
   because the threats will not abate. We examined how social capital
   serves as a resource for potential community involvement in whooping
   crane management by conducting semi-structured interviews (Jul-Sep 2010)
   of 35 individuals, 25 of whom are concerned community members who work
   and/or live in the wintering grounds of the lone wild population of
   whooping cranes in the Texas Coastal Bend, USA. We used an iterative
   process of inductive analysis to examine structural and cognitive
   dimensions of social capital within the community. We observed networks
   with bonding ties within the community that are strengthened by active
   engagement in crane-related activities, shared values and community
   identity, and institutions that have fostered leadership and service.
   Bridging ties between community and state, federal, academic, and
   nonprofit organizations offer opportunities for knowledge sharing and
   legitimacy. Reciprocity and trust were evident from descriptions of the
   community working together effectively to address environmental and
   crane-related concerns. Challenges to successful community involvement
   include finding ways for meaningful community contributions to foster
   greater trust between the community and federal natural resource
   managers. We suggest social capital in this community provides a
   resource that has the potential to save time and money in addressing
   ongoing efforts to protect this charismatic endangered species. (C) 2015

AB Sociologists have undertheorized the role of aesthetic judgment in group
   identification. The author argues that the communication of aesthetic
   judgments in face-to-face interaction powerfully works to confirm or
   deny feelings of group belonging. The author introduces the concept of
   community sense, the public face of shared aesthetic judgments that is
   communicated and upheld within a group. The author illustrates this
   concept through an ethnographic case study of an erotic arts club, a
   group predicated on achieving a shared sense of good and bad taste. The
   author shows how the community sense is formed, challenged, and
   sustained in interaction, examining three characteristics of aesthetic
   judgmentsderivation in form, visceral force, and intersubjective
   validitythat together constitute a strong basis for feelings of
   belonging and distinction. This setting acts as a wedge to access larger
   theoretical concerns, as the author explore the relationship between
   aesthetic judgment and feelings of group belonging in diverse contexts.

AB Sociological theorists have long understood the central role of status
   distinctions in producing social inequality. Although empirical studies
   have demonstrated how status hierarchies are reproduced in a broad range
   of cultural domains, there remains little research into where
   legitimating cultural practices take place, where they do not, and the
   role of space itself in producing status differences. As a result,
   sociologists lack a clear understanding of how status hierarchies give
   shape to cities and how the structure of cities might be practiced
   hierarchically. On the basis of interviews at a high-end shopping center
   in Istanbul, Turkey, I examine how consumers enact social rank in
   physical space with specific reference to the social contours of their
   city. Through privileging particular forms of consumption practices
   within socially and spatially exclusive venues, elites map legitimating
   values upon the physical shape of the city itself, providing a
   spatialized understanding of how status inequalities are distributed.

AB Researchers studying the role of music in human evolution and the role
   of music in everyday life suggest that music helps to promote social
   bonding. However, there is limited direct evidence to support this idea.
   The current experiment investigated the role of different pieces of
   music in the perceived social bonding of videotaped walkers. The
   participants watched one of two videos of three women walking away from
   the camera. In one video the women walked in synchrony and in the other
   the women were out of step with each other. Participants rated the
   perceived degree of rapport and entitativity among the three walkers. In
   each run of the experiment a different piece of music was paired with
   the videos for half the participants. Both music and synchrony of
   walkers influenced the perceived degree of entitativity. Even though
   there was no indication that the actors in the video heard the music,
   observers perceived that a social bond existed among the walkers when
   the music was present.

AB News sources consistently report stories about issues of racism in
   athletics. Despite the prominence of these reports, few empirical
   studies have investigated how observers of racism respond to
   perpetrators in sport settings. In the present study, perpetrator of
   racism, type of sport played, and interracial contact on a team were
   analyzed to understand how White collegiate athletes respond to racism
   directed at a teammate of color. White collegiate athletes reacted to
   two vignettes and rated possible responses when witnessing a teammate of
   color experiencing racism during competition. Results showed that
   cooperative sport collegiate athletes endorsed more direct action
   against racism from an opposing player than individualistic sport
   collegiate athletes. Also, greater interracial contact on an athlete's
   team related to decreased endorsement of redirection against racism from
   opposing fans. Further, athletes expressed significantly greater
   willingness to report racism from opposing fans than from an opposing
   player. Implications for how White collegiate athletes respond to racism
   during competition are discussed.

AB Background Growing spatial social and economic polarisation may be an
   important societal determinant of health, but only a few studies have
   used the recently developed Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE)
   to analyse the impact of joint concentrations of privilege and privation
   on health outcomes. We explore use of the ICE to investigate risk of
   hypertension in an urban, multiracial/ethnic, and predominantly
   working-class study population of US adults.
   Methods We generated novel ICE measures at the census tract level that
   jointly assess extreme concentrations of both income and racial/ethnic
   composition. We then linked the ICE measures to data from two
   observational, cross-sectional studies conducted in the Boston
   metropolitan area (2003-2004; 2008-2010; N=2145).
   Results The ICE measure for extreme concentrations of white compared
   with black residents was independently associated with lower odds of
   hypertension (OR=0.76; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.93), controlling for
   race/ethnicity, age, gender, smoking, body mass index, household income,
   education and self-reported exposure to racial discrimination. Even
   stronger associations were observed for the ICE measures that compared
   concentrations of high-income white residents versus low-income
   residents of colour (OR=0.61; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96) and high-income white
   versus low-income black residents (OR=0.48; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.81).
   Conclusions Results suggest public health studies should explore the
   joint impact of racial/ethnic and economic spatial polarisation on
   population health.

AB Objective. Youth smoking is complex with multilevel influences. While
   much is known about certain levels of influence on youth smoking, the
   lack of focus on institutional influences is notable. This study
   evaluated the effects of ambient smoking attitudes and behaviors in
   schools on individual youth smoking.
   Method. Data from the 2012 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey (n=67,460) were
   analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate
   individual and aggregated school-level factors that were associated with
   a youth being classified as a "susceptible nonsmoker" (SN) or " current
   smoker" (CS) relative to a " non-susceptible nonsmoker" (NN).
   Results. The aggregated percentage of regular smokers at a school,
   ambient school level positive smoking perceptions, and the standardized
   difference between individual and school-level positive smoking
   perceptions were statistically significant in the fully adjusted model.
   We also found an increased risk of being a SN relative to a NN for
   Hispanic youth. Moreover, our approach to modeling institutional-level
   factors raised the pseudo r-squared from 0.05 to 0.14.
   Conclusion. These findings suggest the importance of ambient smoking
   attitudes and behaviors on youth smoking. Prevention efforts affecting
   ambient smoking attitudes may be beneficial. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The United States has become increasingly characterized by stark class
   divides in family structure. Poor women are less likely to marry than
   their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth
   outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the
   intersection of demography and cultural sociology suggests that these
   patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly
   unattainable, economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker
   connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. We use the
   events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of
   the crisis between years and across states, to examine how exposure to
   worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women's
   likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and
   2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic
   status (SES) exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat
   less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-SES women
   exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their
   fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from nonmarital
   fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to
   fertility decisions for low-SES unmarried women during the Great
   Recession.

   i.e. symbolically constituted behavior - for the historical and social
   sciences. The work of Max Weber and contemporary American historian and
   theorist William H. Sewell, Jr. are examined, so as to shed light on the
   debate concerning social science's central subject matter as well as on
   the implications of this work for sociological and historical theory.
   The examination of Sewell's view leverages the importance of the concept
   of action underlying Weber's concept of "social action." Weber's
   position on action and social action is of great interest not only to
   general theory but also to the field of cultural sociology, which has
   neglected to develop systematically upon the theoretical purchase Weber
   offers to it.

AB Extant research has established important linkages between threats and

   settings. Yet, comparatively little attention has been paid to the
   relationship between environmental threats and activism. Drawing from
   literatures in environmental sociology and social movements, we examine
   the coal industry and its resultant environmental devastation in
   Czechoslovakia to investigate the intersection of political and
   environmental threats in provoking activism in highly repressive
   settings. Using a range of data sources, we illustrate how the
   externalities of extreme production coupled with developing weaknesses
   in the state ultimately incited public protest against the regime. Our
   analysis of protest in North Bohemia provides insight into broader
   patterns of elite legitimacy and resistance. Our findings show that the
   environmental externalities stemming from state-mandated production in
   the North Bohemian region posed an imminent threat that spurred
   residents to protest despite harsh state repression. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for future research on
   environmental and political threats, elite legitimation, and citizen
   activism.

AB In recent years, professional science organizations in the United
   States, including the National Research Council, National Institutes of
   Health, and National Science Foundation, have expressed concern about
   waning policy influence, declining government funding, and the growing
   politicization of science. Given this background, a number of
   theoretical questions motivate this study. First, what is the political
   context of scientific authority in the contemporary United States? More
   specifically, how can we best understand the association between
   political ideology and public perceptions of science in the current
   polarized environment? Using data from the National Science Foundation's
   Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and
   Technology (2006-2012), this study finds that the American public is
   culturally and politically divided in its support for the intersection
   of science and the state. Various models of political and cultural
   polarization are tested. Overall, ideological challenges to the cultural
   authority of science cannot be reduced to left-right political
   polarization or to conservative religious beliefs. Instead, skepticism
   on the political right is multifold, involving distinct modes of thought
   and concerns about the institutional ties between science and the state.

AB While there is a wealth of information about the extent to which people
   across the world disapprove of homosexuality, we know a lot less about
   the lenses through which they view same-sex relations. The aim of this
   study is to understand better how homosexuality is framed in the public
   press, and how religion and economic development may combine to shape
   this discourse. Through an analysis of almost 400 newspaper articles,
   this study compares how homosexuality is framed in Uganda, South Africa,
   and the United States. Because these nations have high levels of
   religious belief, but differ in their level of economic development and
   democracy, we can assess how these factors interact to shape portrayals.
   Drawing on work from cultural sociology and the sociology of religion,
   this study shows that the United States is much more likely than Uganda
   to frame homosexuality as a civil rights issue and use entertainers as
   claimsmakers. Conversely, articles from Uganda are more likely than
   those from the United States or South Africa to frame homosexuality as a
   religious issue and draw on religious claimsmakers. Likewise, Uganda is
   much more likely than South Africa to discuss homosexuality in the
   context of Western influences.

   "costly" or demands "resources." This explanation overlooks important
   sociopsychological processes. By situating the income-volunteering
   relationship within the stress process framework, we develop a theory
   that traces the influence of income on chronic financial strain which in
   turn affects subjective well-being, which functions as a psychological
   resource for volunteers. Data taken from two waves of the National
   Survey of Midlife in the United States confirm this theory: household
   income has no direct effect on volunteering once chronic financial
   strain and two measures of subjective well-being-social and

AB Background: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) use alcohol and other
   drugs at rates higher than their heterosexual peers. While social
   networks of YMSM have been acknowledged as an important contextual
   influence on their health behavior, studies have largely focused on
   social and sexual networks rather than substance use networks, despite
   the potential importance of substance use alters in shaping substance
   use behavior.
   Method: Using data collected from a diverse sample of YMSM (n= 156), two
   multilevel models examined the associations between network (e.g.,
   degree and transitivity), dyadic (e.g., strength of relationship), and
   individual characteristics and two alter level dependent variables:
   recent drug use (versus no recent drug use) and frequency of substance
   use.
   Results: Results indicated that transitivity was associated with both
   recent drug use (OR= 1.21, p = 0.012) and more frequent substance use (b
   = 0.08, p = 0.002). Degree was not significantly associated with either
   variable. Furthermore, participants were also less likely to have
   recently used drugs (OR= 0.93, p < 0.001) and tended to use substances
   less frequently (b = 0.01, p = 0.028) with older alters.
   Conclusions: Despite substantial interest in network influences on
   health, much remains unknown about the impact of network structures on
   substance use. The current findings suggest that structural
   characteristics of substance use networks may provide important
   information regarding the drug and alcohol use behavior of YMSM even
   when controlling for dyadic and individual characteristics. (C) 2015

AB The scholarship on aesthetics and materiality has studied how objects
   help shape identity, social action and subjectivity. Objects, as
   'equipment[s] for living' (Luhmann 2000), become the 'obligatory passage
   points humans have to contend with in order to pursue their projects
   (Latour 1991). They provide patterns to which bodies can unconsciously
   latch onto, or help human agents work towards particular states of being
   (DeNora 2000, 2003). Objects are central in the long term process of
   taste construction, as any attachment to an object is made out of a
   delicate equilibrium of mediators, bodies, situations and techniques
   (Hennion and his collaborators (Hennion and Fouquet 2001; Hennion and
   Gomart 1999). In all of these accounts objects are the end result of
   long-term processes of stabilization, in which the actual material
   object (a musical piece, a sculpture, an art installation, a glass of
   wine, the oeuvre of Bach as we know it) is both a result and yet a key
   co-producer of its own generation. Whereas the literature has been
   generous and detailed in exploring the processes of assembling and
   sustaining object-centered attachments, it has not sufficiently engaged
   with what happens when the aesthetic elements of cultural artifacts that
   have produced emotional resonance are transformed: what do these
   artifacts morph into? What explains the transition (or not) of different
   cultural objects? And relatedly, what happens to the key aesthetic
   qualities that were so central to how the objects had been defined, and
   to those who have emotionally attached to them? To answer these
   questions, this article uses as exemplars two different cases of
   attachment, predicated on the distinctive features of a cultural object
   -the transcendence of opera and the authenticity of a soccer jersey -
   that have undergone transformations.

   Methods: The 50 largest cities in the U.S. were the units of analysis.
   Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause
   was malignant neoplasms of trachea, bronchus, and lung (lung cancer)
   (ICD-9 = 162 and LCD-10 = C33-C34). Population-based denominators were
   obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for 1990, 2000, and 2010. To
   measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic
   Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals for
   each 5-year period. We calculated correlation coefficients for 12
   ecological variables and the RRs.
   Results: At the final time point (2005-2009), 15 RRs were less than 1,
   but only 8 significantly so while 29 RRs were greater than 1,16 of them
   significantly so. Of the 45 cities included in the analysis, 21 saw an
   increase in the Black:White RR between the first and second time points.
   Measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and inequalities therein were
   found to be associated with the RRs.
   Conclusion: This analysis revealed large disparities in Black:White lung
   cancer mortality in the U.S. and many of its largest cities during the
   period 1990-2009. The data demonstrate considerable variation in the
   degree of disparity across cities, even among cities within the same
   state. These data can inform and motivate local health officials to
   implement targeted prevention and treatment strategies where they are
   needed most, ultimately contributing to a reduction in the disparity in
   lung cancer mortality rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Childhood poverty is associated with harsh parenting with a risk of
   transmission to the next generation. This prospective study examined the
   relations between childhood poverty and non-parent adults' neural
   responses to infant cry sounds. While no main effects of poverty were
   revealed in contrasts of infant cry versus acoustically matched white
   noise, a gender by childhood poverty interaction emerged. In females,
   childhood poverty was associated with increased neural activations in
   the posterior insula, striatum, calcarine sulcus, hippocampus, and
   fusiform gyrus, while, in males, childhood poverty was associated with
   reduced levels of neural responses to infant cry in the same regions.
   Irrespective of gender, neural activation in these regions was
   associated with higher levels of annoyance with the cry sound and
   reduced desire to approach the crying infant. The findings suggest
   gender differences in neural and emotional responses to infant cry
   sounds among young adults growing up in poverty. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB Prenatal psychosocial exposures can significantly affect infant health
   and development. Infants with higher temperamental negativity are
   theorized to be more susceptible to environmental exposures. We
   evaluated the interaction of prenatal maternal exposures and infant
   temperamental negativity to predict infant cortisol response to mildly
   challenging mother-infant interaction tasks. Participants included 322
   Mexican American mother-infant dyads (mother age 18-42; 82%
   Spanish-speaking; modal family income $10,000-$15,000). Mothers reported
   depressive symptoms and social support prenatally and infant
   temperamental negativity at 6 weeks postpartum. Salivary cortisol was
   collected from infants before and after mother-infant interaction tasks
   at 12 weeks. Higher prenatal maternal depressive symptoms and lower
   social support predicted higher cortisol among infants with higher
   temperamental negativity. Higher infant temperamental negativity
   predicted an increase in maternal distress and a decrease in social
   support from prenatal to 12 weeks postpartum. Interactive influences of
   maternal social-contextual factors and infant temperament may influence
   the development of infant neurobiological regulation and promote or
   strain maternal and infant adaptation over time. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB Background. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) publishes
   evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of papillary thyroid
   carcinoma (PTC). We sought to identify factors associated with receiving
   treatment compliant with the 2006 ATA guidelines for advanced-stage PTC.
   Methods. The 2006 ATA guideline compliance was examined in patients with
   stage III and IV PTC extrapolated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER).
   Results. Sixty percent of patients received ATA-compliant treatment. A
   stepwise increase in compliance occurred between 2006 and 2009 (p-value
   trend = .0003). Age 45 to 64 years versus >= 65 (odds ratio [OR] =
   0.682; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.57-0.81; p <. 0001) and higher
   income (p trend = .012) were associated with an increased likelihood of
   receiving ATA-compliant care. African Americans (OR = 0.56; 95% CI =
   0.42-0.76; p - .0001) and single patients (OR = 0.81; 95% CI =
   0.67-0.97; p = .02) were less likely to receive ATA-compliant care.
   Conclusion. This study highlights specific populations at risk for
   receiving non-ATA-compliant care for PTC and underscores the need to
   further implement guideline-based practice. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

AB The association between aflatoxin exposure and alteration in immune
   responses observed in humans suggest that aflatoxin could suppress the
   immune system and work synergistically with HIV to increase disease
   severity and progression to AIDS. No longitudinal study has been
   conducted to assess exposure to aflatoxin (AF) among HIV positive
   individuals. We examined temporal variation in AFB(1) albumin adducts
   (AF-ALB) in HIV positive Ghanaians, and assessed the association with
   socioeconomic and food consumption factors. We collected socioeconomic
   and food consumption data for 307 HIV positive antiretroviral naive
   adults and examined AF-ALB levels at recruitment (baseline) and at six
   (follow-up 1) and 12 (follow-up 2) months post-recruitment, by age,
   gender, socioeconomic status (SES) and food consumption patterns.
   Generalized linear models were used to examine the influence of
   socioeconomic and food consumption factors on changes in AF-ALB levels
   over the study period, adjusting for other covariates. AF-ALB levels
   (pg/mg albumin) were lower at baseline (mean AF-ALB: 14.9, SD: 15.9),
   higher at six months (mean AF-ALB: 23.3, SD: 26.6), and lower at 12
   months (mean AF-ALB: 15.3, SD: 15.4). Participants with the lowest SES
   had the highest AF-ALB levels at baseline and follow up-2 compared with
   those with higher SES. Participants who bought less than 20% of their
   food and who stored maize for less than two months had lower AF-ALB
   levels. In the adjusted models, there was a statistically significant
   association between follow up time and season (dry or rainy season) on
   AF-ALB levels over time (p = 0.04). Asymptomatic HIV-positive Ghanaians
   had high plasma AF-ALB levels that varied according to season,
   socioeconomic status, and food consumption patterns. Steps need to be
   taken to ensure the safety and security of the food supply for the
   population, but in particular for the most vulnerable groups such as HIV
   positive people.

AB We present a social-ecological framework to provide insight into climate
   adaptation strategies and diverse perspectives on interventions in
   protected areas for species experiencing climate-induced impacts. To
   develop this framework, we examined the current ecological condition of
   a culturally and commercially valuable species, considered the predicted
   future effects of climate change on that species in a protected area,
   and assessed the perspectives held by forest users and managers on
   future adaptive practices. We mapped the distribution of yellow-cedar
   (Callitropsis nootkatensis) and examined its health status in Glacier
   Bay National Park and Preserve by comparing forest structure, tree
   stress-indicators, and associated thermal regimes between forests inside
   the park and forests at the current latitudinal limit of the species
   dieback. Yellow-cedar trees inside the park were healthy and relatively
   unstressed compared to trees outside the park that exhibited reduced
   crown fullness and increased foliar damage. Considering risk factors for
   mortality under future climate scenarios, our vulnerability model
   indicated future expected dieback occurring within park boundaries.
   Interviews with forest users and managers revealed strong support for
   increasing monitoring to inform interventions outside protected areas,
   improving management collaboration across land designations, and using a
   portfolio of interventions on actively managed lands. Study participants
   who perceived humans as separate from nature were more opposed to
   interventions in protected areas. Linking social and ecological
   analyses, our study provides an interdisciplinary approach to identify
   system-specific metrics (e.g., stress indicators) that can better
   connect monitoring with management, and adaptation strategies for
   species impacted by climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Language skills, strongly linked to academic success, are
   known to differ by socioeconomic status (SES), with lower SES
   individuals performing less well than higher SES.
   Aims: To examine the effect of SES on infant language at 7 months of age
   and the relationship between maternal vocabulary skills and infant
   language function. To determine if the relationships between SES and
   infant language are mediated by maternal vocabulary skills.
   Study design: Longitudinal follow-up of healthy term female African
   American infants born to mothers in two SES groups: Low SES
   (income-to-needs 1, no education beyond high school) and Higher SES
   (Income-to-Needs >1, at least a high school diploma).
   Subjects: 54 infants tested at 7 months of age; 54 mothers tested at
   infant age 7 months.
   Outcome measures: Preschool Language Scale-5 (PLS-5), Vocabulary and
   Matrix Reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV.
   Results: Low SES infants (n = 29) performed less well than Higher SES (n
   = 25) on PLS-5 Total Language, Auditory Comprehension, and Expressive
   Communication (p <= 0.012). Maternal Vocabulary subtest scores were
   lower in Low SES than Higher SES (p = 0.002), but not related to infant
   PLS Language scores (p >= 0.17). Maternal vocabulary did not mediate the
   relationship between SES and infant language skills at age 7 months.
   Conclusions: In this single sex and race cohort of healthy, term, female
   infants, lower SES exerted negative effects on infant language by 7
   months of age. While maternal vocabulary scores showed no relation with
   infant language skills at 7 months, continued study of the relations
   between SES, infant outcomes and maternal characteristics is needed to
   determine how low SES conditions impact early language. These findings
   underscore the importance of early interventions, as well as policies
   designed to improve socioeconomic conditions for infants and families.

   DesignRetrospective cohort.
   SettingFirst-time, kidney-only transplant recipients aged 60 and older
   of age at transplantation transplanted between July 1996 and October
   2010 (N=44,013).
   ParticipantsUnited Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database.
   MeasurementsTime to graft failure and death obtained from the UNOS
   database and linkage to the Social Security Death Index. Neighborhood
   poverty from 2000 U.S. Census geographic data.
   ResultsOf the 44,013 recipients in the sample, 20% were black, 63%
   non-Hispanic white, 11% Hispanic, 5% Asian, and the rest other racial
   groups. In adjusted Cox models, blacks were more likely than whites to
   experience graft failure (hazard ratio (HR)=1.23, 95% confidence
   interval (CI)=1.15-1.32), whereas Hispanics (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.70-0.85)
   and Asians (HR=0.70, 95% CI=0.61-0.81) were less likely to experience
   graft failure. Blacks (HR=0.84, 95% CI=0.80-0.88), Hispanics (HR=0.68,
   95% CI=0.64-0.72), and Asians (HR=0.62, 95% CI=0.57-0.68) were less
   likely than whites to die after renal transplantation.
   ConclusionElderly blacks are at greater risk of graft failure than white
   transplant recipients but survive longer after transplantation. Asians
   have the highest recipient and graft survival, followed by Hispanics.
   Further studies are needed to assess additional factors affecting graft
   and recipient survival in elderly adults and to investigate outcomes
   such as quality of life.

AB How could Franz Boas, trained in physics and geography in Bismarck's
   Germany, carry any weight for twenty-first century anthropology, given
   the theoretical upheavals of the past few decades? As early as 1887, I
   argue, Boas foreshadowed certain theoretical innovations of recent
   years, especially Bruno Latour's ethnographic and philosophical analysis
   of science and modern society. My thesis is that Latourian and Boasian
   anthropologies are surprisingly alike, first in their rejection of
   "purified" high-modernist imagery, but more distinctively in their
   development of an ontologically "reckless" approach that traces the
   interwoven pathways of humans and nonhumans. Latour's resonance with
   Boas has less to do with any direct Boasian influence on his thinking
   than with their parallel alignments against the same hegemonic
   rationalism, which reached its climax in the long century of high
   modernism (ca. 1880-1990). At the same time, I argue, Latour and Boas
   are sharply contrasting in their treatment of elite or esoteric
   doctrines as opposed to general or exoteric culture. This difference
   turns out to be instructive, as it suggests what a Latourian
   anthropology stands to gain from a neo-Boasian one and vice versa.

AB Based on dream and life-history data and research on American families
   in the US Northwest, this article argues that a contemporary US
   middle-class model that I call the Close Family prescribes child-rearing
   practices that alternate between adulation and audit. Adulation and
   auditing are forms of social mirroring that make what Lacan calls "the
   mirror phase" an enduring feature of American cultural psychology and
   produce feelings of porosity and dependence that compel defensive
   assertions of independence. Because these assertions are therefore
   common, they too take the form of a cultural model-the bounded person
   intrinsically separate from social context that Geertz and others
   associate with the West-yet this individualistic model is secondary,
   helping people deny and dissociate a more primary reaction. Models and
   defenses together, I argue, constitute cultural psychodynamics. The case
   study of a young woman I call Ruby further suggests that for aspirants
   to class mobility, what is a balance between adulation and audit in the
   middle class tips toward audit, magnifying feelings of shame and
   inadequacy and imposing one of the most formidable barriers such
   aspirants must overcome.

AB IMPORTANCE Most children with retinoblastoma in the United States are
   diagnosed as having a large intraocular tumor burden that requires
   intensive ocular-salvage treatment or enucleation.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of socioeconomic status, race, and
   ethnicity on the extent of disease and the outcomes of retinoblastoma.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based review of 18
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. From
   January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2010, 830 cases of retinoblastoma
   were recorded for children aged 0 to 9 years. Data were collected and
   analyzed from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2010, with the last
   follow-up on December 31, 2010.
   EXPOSURES County-based socioeconomic variables analyzed included poverty
   level, educational attainment, language isolation, crowding,
   unemployment, and percentage of immigrants.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Extent of disease, ocular outcome, and
   children's survival.
   RESULTS Of the 830 individuals included, Hispanic children had a higher
   percentage of extraocular disease (86 of 261 [33.0%] vs 102 of 510
   non-Hispanic children [20.0%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.97 [95% CI,
   1.38-2.79]). The percentage of extraocular cases was also higher in
   counties with the following low socioeconomic status indicators: higher
   vs lower poverty status (115 of 413 [27.8%] vs 73 of 358 [20.4%]; OR,
   1.51; 95% CI, 1.06-2.14); lower vs higher educational attainment (115 of
   400 [28.7%] vs 73 of 371 [19.7%]; OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.16-2.34); higher
   vs lower levels of crowding (124 of 398 [31.2%] vs 64 of 373 [17.2%];
   OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.53-3.13); higher vs lower unemployment (119 of 411
   [28.9%] vs 69 of 360 [19.2%]; OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.45); higher vs
   lower language isolation (117 of 388 [30.2%] vs 71 of 383 [18.5%]; OR,
   1.89; 95% CI, 1.34-2.70); and higher vs lower percentage of immigrants
   (109 of 386 [28.2%] vs 79 of 385 [20.5%]; OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.08-2.16).
   Higher rates of enucleation were associated with low educational
   attainment (265 of 401 [66.1%] vs 309 of 421 [73.4%]; OR, 1.42; 95% CI,
   1.04-1.93), a higher level of crowding (316 of 416 [76.0%] vs 258 of 406
   [63.5%]; OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.32-2.48), and Hispanic origin (202 of 271
   [74.5%]; OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01-1.98). Relative survival at 5 years was
   lower among black compared with non-Hispanic white children (92.7% vs
   99.2%; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Significant disparities exist in the care and
   outcomes of children with retinoblastoma. A low socioeconomic status
   negatively affects disease extent and ocular outcomes, presumably by
   limiting access to primary and cancer-directed care. Hispanic children
   in particular have more advanced disease and higher rates of
   enucleation.

AB Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that sub-threshold psychotic
   experiences commonly occur in the general population. When these
   experiences persist over time, they may increase risk for psychotic
   disorder or lead to other clinical or functional impairments. The aims
   of this study were to distinguish the relative importance of
   sociodemographic factors and clinical factors, including characteristics
   of the psychotic experiences themselves, in determining the course of
   psychotic symptoms over time. Participants were drawn from the
   Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys. We tested for
   retrospectively-reported predictors of current psychotic experiences
   among individuals who reported lifetime psychotic experiences, with
   onset prior to the past year (n = 921), using logistic regression.
   Persistence was primarily related to demographic variables, with lower
   odds associated with being married and having at least a college
   education. Individuals reporting prior to the past year auditory
   hallucinations were more likely to have persistent psychotic experiences
   than those reporting other types of psychotic experiences. Interventions
   aiming at strengthening family support and social skills may reduce the
   likelihood of persistence among individuals with psychotic experiences,
   thereby reducing risk for psychotic disorders and other related
   outcomes. Future studies should continue to identify predictors of
   persistence versus remission and further explore clinical services for
   those with persistent psychotic experiences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The neighborhood context affects social capital, yet scholars do not
   adequately account for the dynamic nature of the social spaces people
   occupy in measuring social capital. Research has focused on neighborhood
   effects as though the neighborhood space is fixed across all inhabitants
   without regard for the ways individuals define their neighborhoods
   considering their own spatial location and social interactions. Using a
   neighborhood-level social capital measure, we examine the relationship
   between cognitive neighborhood boundaries and social capital in
   residents (N = 135) of two public housing communities in a Southern
   urban city. As collective efficacy (bonding social capital) increased so
   too did the predicted size of one's cognitive neighborhood. GIS maps
   demonstrated that participant boundaries included areas of commerce and
   services necessary to build and maintain social capital. Larger
   cognitive neighborhoods suggest one may interact with a wider array of
   people to achieve instrumental and expressive returns despite the
   high-poverty neighborhood context.

AB Most research in the sociology of taste has focused primarily on the
   role of socioeconomic status (SES) in modulating patterns of cultural
   choice. This has led to a general neglect of the role of age as a
   structuring factor in its own right. In this paper, we turn our
   attention to cross-sectional and over-time differences in expressions of
   cultural taste across age groups. We concentrate on the phenomenon that
   Bryson (1996) has referred to as "symbolic exclusion": namely, the
   (differential) propensity of persons to express dislike for certain
   cultural styles. Comparing musical dislikes from the 1993 General Social
   Survey data to a replication of the same instrument in 2012, we find
   that, overall, Americans are less likely to express dislikes across most
   musical categories, with the most substantial declines observed for Rap
   and Heavy Metal, especially among college-educated young adults. The
   exceptions to this pattern are the Country, Folk, and Religious styles,
   all of which are more likely to be disliked in 2012 than they were in
   1993, and Rock and Classical music, both of which are increasingly
   rejected by high-status young people at the same time that they are less
   likely to be rejected by their same-status older counterparts. (C) 2015

AB In an attempt to reproduce the results of an inconclusive 1927 report by
   the British Medical Research Council on the hereditary versus social
   origins of rheumatic fever, Read, Ciocco, and Taussig, from Johns
   Hopkins University, with the support of Frost, conducted a case-control
   study in 1935 and 1936. Their study, which appeared in the American
   Journal of Hygiene in 1938, was outstanding for its clear and tidy
   rational for separating hereditary from environmental causes. The
   authors compared the prevalence of rheumatic fever among the relatives
   of 33 children admitted for "incident" rheumatic fever and 33 control
   children admitted in a tuberculosis clinic for reasons other than
   rheumatic fever. Both rheumatic fever (cases) and tuberculosis
   (controls) were diseases of the poor. All family members of both cases
   and controls, including uncles, aunts, and grandparents, were eligible
   for interview and physical examination. The results were compatible with
   the presence of an "inherited predisposition" to rheumatic fever because
   the disease was more prevalent among the uncles, aunts, and grandparents
   of case patients than among those of control patients. Methodologically,
   the paper by Read, Ciocco, and Taussig is an important but almost
   completely forgotten milestone in the evolution of case-control studies
   and of genetic epidemiology.

AB Introduction: Even as the number of women living with HIV around the
   globe continues to grow, realization of their sexual and reproductive
   health and human rights remains compromised. The objective of this study
   was to review the current state of knowledge on the sexual and
   reproductive health and human rights of women living with HIV to assess
   evidence and gaps.
   Methods: Relevant databases were searched for peer-reviewed and grey
   literature. Search terms included a combination of MeSH terms and
   keywords representing women, HIV/AIDS, ART, human rights, sexual and
   reproductive health. We included both qualitative and quantitative
   literature published in English, French, or Spanish between July 2011
   and December 2014.
   Results and discussion: The search yielded 2228 peer-reviewed articles,
   of which 40 met the inclusion criteria in the final review. The grey
   literature search yielded 2186 documents of which seven met the
   inclusion criteria in the final review. Of the articles and documents
   reviewed, not a single peer-reviewed article described the explicit
   implementation of rights in programming, and only two documents from the
   grey literature did so. With one possible exception, no articles or
   documents were found which addressed rights comprehensively, or
   addressed the majority of relevant rights (i.e. equality;
   non-discrimination; participation; privacy and confidentiality; informed
   decision making; availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality
   (3AQ) of services individually or in their totality; and
   accountability). Additional findings indicate that the language of
   rights is used most often to describe the apparent neglect or violation
   of human rights and what does exist only addresses a few rights in the
   context of a few areas within sexual and reproductive health.
   Conclusions: Findings from this review suggest the need to better
   integrate rights into interventions, particularly with attention to
   provider training, service delivery, raising awareness and capacity
   building among the community of women living with HIV. Further research
   is urgently needed to support the sexual and reproductive health and
   rights of women living with HIV, to identify what works and to inform
   future programming and policies to improve care, treatment and support
   for women living with HIV.

AB I investigate the structure of an argument that culture cannot be
   maintained in a population if each individual learns only from a single
   person. This appears to conflict with (1) many models of cultural
   transmission and (2) real-world cases. I resolve the first problem by
   showing that one of the models central to the argument is conceptually
   analogous and mathematically equivalent to one used to investigate the
   evolution of sexual reproduction. I resolve the second by arguing that
   probabilistic models of epistemological coherence can be reinterpreted
   as models of support between cultural variants-illustrating the idea
   with a new model.

AB Previous research suggests that in contrast to invisible social support,
   visible social support produces exaggerated negative emotional
   responses. Drawing on work by Bolger and colleagues, this study
   disentangled social support visibility from negative social evaluation
   in an examination of the effects of social support on negative emotions
   and cardiovascular responses. As part of an anticipatory speech task, 73
   female participants were randomly assigned to receive no social support,
   invisible social support, non-confounded visible social support or
   visible social support as delivered in a 2007 study by Bolger and
   Amarel. Twelve readings, each for systolic blood pressure, diastolic
   blood pressure and heart rate were taken at 5-min intervals throughout
   the periods of baseline, reactivity and recovery. Cardiovascular
   outcomes were tested by incorporating a series of theoretically driven
   planned contrasts into tests of stress reactivity conducted through
   piecewise growth curve modelling. Linear and quadratic trends
   established cardiovascular reactivity to the task. Further, in
   comparison to the control and replication conditions, the non-confounded
   visible and invisible social support conditions attenuated
   cardiovascular reactivity over time. Pre- and post-speech negative
   emotional responses were not affected by the social support
   manipulations. These results suggest that appropriately delivered
   visible social support may be as beneficial as invisible social support.

AB Arguments for restricting access to legal marriage for same-sex couples
   are commonly based in claims about differences between heterosexual and
   same-sex couples regarding the social and psychological meaning of
   marriage. This mixed methods study examined meanings of intimacy and
   relational experience in a purposive North American sample of members of
   long-term heterosexual and same-sex couples (N = 150) in order to
   examine the validity of meaning-based justifications for restricted
   access to legal marriage. Guided autobiographical techniques elicited
   narrative accounts of four significant events in participants'
   relationships. Directed Content Analyses revealed no detectable
   differences between members of heterosexual and same-sex couples in
   multiple qualitative and quantitative indicators of the meaning of
   intimacy. Members of same-sex couples, however, evidenced experiences of
   stigmatization more frequently than heterosexuals. By integrating
   theoretical and methodological approaches across psychological and
   sociological traditions within a mixed methods study, the present
   findings usefully inform ongoing policy debates regarding the
   legalization of same-sex marriage.

AB In 2006, a multistate Escherichia coli O157:H7 outbreak linked to
   spinach grown in California's Central Coast region caused public
   concerns, catalyzing far-reaching reforms in vegetable production.
   Industry and government pressured growers to adopt costly new measures
   to improve food safety, many of which targeted wildlife as a disease
   vector. In response, many growers fenced fields, lined field edges with
   wildlife traps and poison, and removed remaining adjacent habitat.
   Although the efficacy of these and other practices for mitigating
   pathogen risk have not been thoroughly evaluated, their widespread
   adoption has substantial consequences for rural livelihoods,
   biodiversity, and ecological processes. Today, as federal regulators are
   poised to set mandatory standards for on-farm food safety throughout the
   United States, major gaps persist in understanding the relationships
   between farming systems and food safety. Addressing food-safety
   knowledge gaps and developing effective farming practices are crucial
   for co-managing agriculture for food production, conservation, and human
   health.

AB Young adults with ASD and no intellectual impairment are more likely to
   exhibit clinical levels of anxiety than typically developing peers
   (DSM-5, American Psychiatric Association, 2013). This study tests a
   mechanistic model in which anxiety culminates via emotion dysregulation
   and social motivation. Adults with ASD (49 males, 20 females) completed
   self-report measures on emotion regulation, caregivers completed
   measures on ASD severity and both on social anxiety. Results indicated
   that emotion dysregulation (p < .001; p < .05) and social motivation (p
   < .05, p < .001) significantly predicted social anxiety as reported by
   caregivers and young adults respectively. However, social motivation did
   not appear to play a moderating role in the relationship between emotion
   regulation and anxiety, even when controlling for social awareness.
   Significant predictor variables of social anxiety varied based on
   reporter (i.e. caregiver versus young adult), with difficulty engaging
   in goal-directed behaviors during negative emotions serving as the only
   shared predictor.

AB Pursuing happiness can paradoxically impair well-being. Here, the
   authors propose the potential down-sides to pursuing happiness may be
   specific to individualistic cultures. In collectivistic (vs.
   individualistic) cultures, pursuing happiness may be more successful
   because happiness is viewed-and thus pursued-in relatively socially
   engaged ways. In 4 geographical regions that vary in level of
   collectivism (United States, Germany, Russia, East Asia), we assessed
   participants' well-being, motivation to pursue happiness, and to what
   extent they pursued happiness in socially engaged ways. Motivation to
   pursue happiness predicted lower well-being in the United States, did
   not predict well-being in Germany, and predicted higher well-being in
   Russia and in East Asia. These cultural differences in the link between
   motivation to pursue happiness and well-being were explained by cultural
   differences in the socially engaged pursuit of happiness. These findings
   suggest that culture shapes whether the pursuit of happiness is linked
   with better or worse well-being, perhaps via how people pursue
   happiness.

AB Objectives This study examined the impact of neighborhood environments
   on health consciousness, information seeking, and attitudes among
   uninsured free clinic patients to better understand the specific needs
   of the population for health promotion and prevention efforts.
   Methods US-born English-speaking, non-US-born English-speaking, and
   Spanish-speaking free clinic patients completed a self-administered
   survey using reliable measures in autumn 2014 (N = 769).
   Results The results of this study suggest that social cohesion is
   positively associated with health consciousness, information seeking,
   and attitudes. Lower levels of available healthy food in the community
   were associated with higher levels of health consciousness. Although
   Spanish speakers reported lower levels of the availability of healthy
   food, social cohesion, and access to the Internet or text messaging
   compared with US-born or non-US-born English speakers, they were more
   likely to be health conscious and have higher levels of health
   information seeking. Spanish speakers as well as non-US-born English
   speakers, were more likely to attend health education classes compared
   with US-born English speakers.
   Conclusions Health education programs for free clinic patients should
   include strategies to increase social cohesion. Health education
   programs should consider the diverse needs of these individual
   populations to maximize the effectiveness of the programs for free
   clinic patients.

AB Sociologists generally agree that history affects or conditions moral
   belief, but the relationship is still only vaguely understood. Using a
   case study of the appearance of social justice beliefs in Victorian-era
   Britain, this article develops an explanation of the link between
   history and morality by applying field theory to capture the historical
   genesis of a field. A moral way of evaluating poverty and inequality
   developed slowly over the course of the nineteenth century in Britain,
   with a trajectory extending back to Malthus's Essay on the Principle of
   Population and moving forward to the Fabians, the Settlement Movement,
   and other social reformers at the end of the nineteenth century. Drawing
   from field theory, I argue that social justice beliefs emerged during
   this time through the genesis of moral universalism as a distinct mode
   of experience. Several recognizable moral beliefs appeared in the
   process, including "equality of opportunity," "equality of reward,"
   "character," and "effort," "ability," and "duty" as forms of merit
   (among others). I argue for treating moral beliefs as historical and
   relational entities that are situated and dated by the conditions
   marking their appearance in a field. As I conclude, this lends the
   sociology of morality to a critical moral reflexivity instead of moral
   relativism or moral realism.

AB Introduction: Although patients who experience health-related social
   problems such as food insecurity are at increased risk for negative
   health outcomes, there are few systems for screening and intervention.
   The study aimed to determine whether a web-based intervention can (1)
   connect youth to services to address these problems and (2) increase
   their resolution.
   Design: Prospective intervention study.
   Setting/participants: A total of 401 youth, aged 15-25 years, from an
   urban adolescent/young adult clinic were recruited.
   Intervention: A self-administered, web-based tool was developed to
   screen participants for problems in nine health-related social domains,
   identify and provide feedback about potential problems, and facilitate a
   patient-centered selection process of recommended local health and human
   service agencies to assist in addressing selected problems (conducted in
   2008-2010). Follow-up phone calls 1-2 months later determined if
   patients had contacted recommended agencies and resolved their
   top-priority problem. Main outcome measures: Outcome measures included
   prevalence of identified problems, selected problems, and priority
   problem selected by domain. We also examined frequencies of referral
   agencies contacted and resolution of priority problem at time of
   follow-up analysis conducted in 2011-2013.
   Results: Seventy-eight percent (313/401) of youth selected at least one
   problem to address. The most frequent domains selected as priority were
   income security (21%); nutrition/fitness (15%); and healthcare access
   (15%). Eighty-three percent (259/313) were reached at follow-up;
   overall, 40% contacted a selected agency and 47% reported "completely"
   or "mostly" resolving their priority problem.
   Conclusions: When provided with services to address health-related
   social problems, the majority of youth choose to receive help, with
   nearly half successfully addressing their priority concern. Further
   research to understand the barriers to contacting and utilizing services
   is needed. A technology-based patient-centered feedback and referral
   system for social determinants of health can facilitate screening and
   connect patients with resources to address these problems. (C) 2015

AB Although many researchers agree that multiple determinants impact
   health, there is no consensus regarding the magnitude of the relative
   contributions of individual health factors to health outcomes. This
   study presents a method to empirically estimate the relative
   contributions of health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic
   factors, and the physical environment to health outcomes using
   nationally representative county-level data and statistical approaches
   that account for potential sources of bias. The analyses for this study
   were conducted in 2014. Data were from the 2010-2013 County Health
   Rankings & Roadmaps. Data covered 2,996 of 3,141 U.S. counties. Ordinary
   least squares modeling was used as a baseline model. Multilevel latent
   growth curve modeling was used to estimate the relative contributions of
   health factors to health outcomes while accounting for measurement
   errors and state-specific characteristics. Almost half of the variance
   of health outcomes was due to state-level variation rather than
   county-level variation. When adjusted for measurement errors and
   state-level variation using multilevel latent growth curve modeling, the
   relative contribution of clinical care decreased and that of social and
   economic factors increased compared with the baseline model. This study
   presents how potential sources of bias affected the estimates of the
   relative contributions of a set of modifiable health factors to health
   outcomes at the county level. Further verification of these approaches
   with other data sources could lead to a better understanding of the
   impact of specific health determinants to health outcomes, and will
   provide useful information on policy interventions. (C) 2015 American

AB Introduction: Chemotherapy for breast cancer has been associated with
   cognitive problems; however, the impact of adjuvant hormone therapy is
   less clear. No studies have explored provider discussions about
   cognitive concerns or factors associated with neurocognitive treatment.
   This study examined cognitive problems, factors associated with having a
   provider discussion, and receipt of neurocognitive treatment.
   Methods: Female breast cancer survivors (N=2,537) from the Sister Study
   and the Two Sister Study who were at least 1 year post-treatment were
   surveyed in 2012 about their cancer therapies (confirmed by medical
   records); cognitive concerns; related provider discussions; and
   neurocognitive treatment. A total of 2,296 women were included in the
   current 2014 analysis. Extensive covariate information was also
   ascertained for predictive multivariate models.
   Results: The prevalence of self-reported cognitive problems after
   treatment was 60%. Of those reporting cognitive problems, only 37% had
   discussed those concerns with a provider and 15% had been treated for
   cognitive symptoms. The odds of reported cognitive concerns that started
   during and after treatment were elevated for those who received only
   hormone therapy and no chemotherapy (OR=1.64, 95% CI=1.15, 2.33);
   chemotherapy and no hormone therapy (OR=5.63, 95% CI=3.52, 9.00); or
   both (OR=6.33, 95% CI=4.21, 9.54) compared with those reporting neither
   treatment.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of cognitive concerns underscores the
   importance of monitoring breast cancer survivors for potential
   neurocognitive effects of hormone and chemotherapy, discussions with
   survivors about those concerns, and treatment referrals. Monitoring
   changes over time can help to evaluate both psychosocial and
   neurocognitive care provided for survivors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   Very limited work has evaluated associations of sociocultural processes
   with prevalence of the MetS.
   The purpose of the present study was to evaluate associations between
   family environment (cohesion/conflict) and the MetS, in a multi-site
   sample of US Hispanics/Latinos.
   A total of 3278 participants from the Hispanic Community Health
   Study/Study of Latinos underwent a clinical exam and completed
   psychosocial measures including family environment (cohesion and
   conflict) as part of the Sociocultural Ancillary Study.
   The association between family environment and the MetS was moderated by
   sex. Among all women, higher family conflict was associated with MetS
   prevalence. Results by ancestry group showed that only among Cuban
   women, higher conflict was associated with the MetS, whereas only among
   Dominican men, greater cohesion was associated with the MetS.
   The family context may be a sociocultural protective or risk factor
   among Hispanics/Latinos in terms of MetS risk, but these associations
   may vary by sex and Hispanic background.

AB Stigma may contribute to HIV-related disparities among HIV-positive

   We examined whether social network characteristics moderate stigma's
   effects.
   At baseline and 6 months post-baseline, 147 HIV-positive Black Americans
   on antiretroviral treatment completed egocentric social network
   assessments, from which we derived a structural social support capacity
   measure (i.e., ability to leverage support from the network, represented
   by the average interaction frequency between the participant and each
   alter). Stigma was operationalized with an indicator of whether any
   social network member had expressed stigmatizing attributions of blame
   or responsibility about HIV. Daily medication adherence was monitored
   electronically.
   In a multivariate regression, baseline stigma was significantly related
   to decreased adherence over time. The association between stigma and
   non-adherence was attenuated among participants who increased the
   frequency of their interactions with alters over time.
   Well-connected social networks have the potential to buffer the effects
   of stigma.

AB The quality of social relationships and social support appears to be

   previous research in this area focuses on positive aspects of
   relationships.
   The present study thus intended to examine the links between supportive,
   aversive, ambivalent, and indifferent network ties and sleep quality.
   Relationship data, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)-assessed sleep
   quality, and depression were examined in 175 middle-aged and older
   adults.
   Consistent with hypotheses, supportive ties were positively related to
   sleep quality, while aversive ties predicted worse sleep quality,
   associations that were primarily seen for close relationships.
   Ambivalent and indifferent ties were not significant predictors of sleep
   quality. Importantly, depression was found to mediate the link between
   relationship quality and sleep quality.
   These data suggest the more specific types of social relationships that
   may be linked to poor sleep quality and that depression appears to
   underlie these associations.

AB Physician implicit (unconscious, automatic) bias has been shown to
   contribute to racial disparities in medical care. The impact of medical
   education on implicit racial bias is unknown.
   To examine the association between change in student implicit racial
   bias towards African Americans and student reports on their experiences
   with 1) formal curricula related to disparities in health and health
   care, cultural competence, and/or minority health; 2) informal curricula
   including racial climate and role model behavior; and 3) the amount and
   favorability of interracial contact during school.
   Prospective observational study involving Web-based questionnaires
   administered during first (2010) and last (2014) semesters of medical
   school.
   A total of 3547 students from a stratified random sample of 49 U.S.
   medical schools.
   Change in implicit racial attitudes as assessed by the Black-White
   Implicit Association Test administered during the first semester and
   again during the last semester of medical school.
   In multivariable modeling, having completed the Black-White Implicit
   Association Test during medical school remained a statistically
   significant predictor of decreased implicit racial bias (-5.34, p a
   parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand 0.001: mixed
   effects regression with random intercept across schools). Students'
   self-assessed skills regarding providing care to African American
   patients had a borderline association with decreased implicit racial
   bias (-2.18, p = 0.056). Having heard negative comments from attending
   physicians or residents about African American patients (3.17, p =
   0.026) and having had unfavorable vs. very favorable contact with
   African American physicians (18.79, p = 0.003) were statistically
   significant predictors of increased implicit racial bias.
   Medical school experiences in all three domains were independently
   associated with change in student implicit racial attitudes. These
   findings are notable given that even small differences in implicit
   racial attitudes have been shown to affect behavior and that implicit
   attitudes are developed over a long period of repeated exposure and are
   difficult to change.

AB Purpose In the US, women surpass men in the prevalence of lung diseases.
   Limited studies exist on the association of adverse childhood events
   (ACEs) to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD)
   particularly among women and cohorts of understudied populations (e.g.,
   Pacific Islanders). This study evaluated the ACEs-asthma and ACEs-COPD
   relationships among women in Hawaii and the contribution of poor health
   factors (smoking, binge drinking, and obesity) in these associations.
   Methods Using data from 3363 women in the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System-Hawaii, we assessed how self-reported ACEs [count
   and type (household dysfunction, and physical, verbal and sexual abuse)]
   relate to asthma and COPD. Multivariable log-binomial regression,
   accounting for the sampling design, and model adjustments for
   socio-demographics, healthcare access, emotional support, current
   smoking, binge drinking, and BMI status were used to generate prevalence
   ratios.
   Results For every increase in ACE count, the likelihood for asthma
   increased by 7 % (CI = 1.02-1.13), and for COPD, by 21 % (CI =
   1.12-1.31) accounting for socio-demographics, healthcare access, and
   emotional support. Verbal abuse was also associated with greater
   likelihood for asthma independent of these covariates (PR = 1.43, CI =
   1.14-1.79). Household dysfunction (PR = 1.82, CI = 1.15-2.82) and
   physical (PR = 2.01, CI = 1.20-3.37), verbal (PR = 2.24, CI = 1.38-3.65)
   and sexual (PR = 1.81, CI = 1.10-2.97) abuse were all associated with
   COPD using similar adjustments. Additional adjustment for smoking, binge
   drinking, and BMI status did not impact the ACE-asthma associations and
   only modestly attenuated the ACE-COPD relationships.
   Conclusions Primary and secondary prevention of ACEs may optimize the
   health of young girls in Hawaii, and reduce the burden of asthma and
   COPD among women in the state.

AB Why do workers participate in their own exploitation? This article moves
   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.

AB This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces
   the payment received for the last client among female sex workers.
   Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate
   a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association,
   and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We
   analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female
   sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish
   between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the
   client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with
   significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are
   associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does
   not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week.
   Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with
   earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over
   the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to
   show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the
   results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging
   the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling
   for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing
   countries.

AB The belief that natural sciences are more scientific than the social
   sciences has been well documented in the perceptions of both lay and
   scientific populations. Influenced by the Kuhnian concept of paradigm
   development and empirical studies on the closure of scientific
   controversies, scholars from divergent traditions associate scientific
   development with increased consensus and stability. However, both the
   macro/quantitative and micro/qualitative approaches are limited in key
   ways. This article is the first comparative ethnography of a natural
   science (molecular biology) and a social science (psychology) and it
   highlights important differences between the fields. Molecular
   biologists engage in a process of bench-building, in which they create
   and integrate new manipulation techniques and technologies into their
   practice, whereas psychologists have far less opportunity for this type
   of development. This suggests an alternative conception of the
   natural/social divide, in which the natural sciences are defined by
   dynamic material evolution while the social sciences remain relatively
   stable.

AB Religion has received a large amount of scholarly attention for its role
   in promoting pro-social outcomes for a community. One of the areas in
   which religion may demonstrate a positive effect is suicide. The role
   that religion plays in reducing suicide within a community has long
   roots in sociology. Emile Durkheim suggested that religion would have a
   pro-social effect in decreasing suicide. Religion should reduce suicide
   by establishing values and norms that integrate individuals into society
   and regulate the behavior of the members of a society. However, the
   presence of many different religions could erode the social integration
   and regulation effects of religion. This would cause suicide to increase
   as individuals become confused as to what values and norms are to be
   followed. The current analysis uses the religious fractionalization
   index to examine the effect of religious heterogeneity on suicide. The
   findings demonstrate that increased religious heterogeneity increased
   suicide for a sample of countries.

AB In survey research, how can we measure actors' judgments concerning who
   is a member of a particular social group and who is not? How can we
   measure changes in this process over time? Within the sociology of
   culture, the operationalization of boundary work, or decisions of group
   membership, has been relatively overlooked. Similarly, measurement of
   changes in boundaries has been relatively overlooked as well. An
   important first step is to better match the operationalization of
   boundary work with theory. To do so, I argue that survey items
   concerning decisions of social exclusion measured in the Likert scale
   can be used. In addition to allowing scholars to compare those who
   exclude with those who include (often measured as Strongly Agree/Agree
   vs. Disagree/Strongly Disagree), the Likert scale offers a measurement
   of boundary strength: how strongly respondents are committed to their
   exclusionary judgments (Agree vs. Strongly Agree, Disagree vs. Strongly
   Disagree). A novel element of boundary change can then be measured as
   variation over time in commitment to exclusionary judgment in time
   series data. A boundary that has increased in strength would be one for
   which respondents increase in their emotional commitment to their
   exclusionary judgment over time.

AB The concepts of sex and gender have received increasing attention in
   sociology in recent years, with social psychologists providing many of
   the key insights. Issues of sexual orientation and sexuality have
   received comparably less attention, although many of the tools social
   psychologists use could be fruitfully applied to better understand sex,
   gender, sexual orientation, and the intimate connections between the
   three. In particular, I outline the perspectives of doing gender,
   stereotyping, and status and suggest possible ways to incorporate these
   frameworks into intersectional examinations of sex, gender, and sexual
   orientation. I argue that to fully understand sex, gender, or sexual
   orientation, researchers should consider all three and recognize the
   highly interconnected nature of each.

AB Cognitive paradigms allow clinical psychologists to examine memory
   processes, such as false memory production, to better understand
   psychopathology. The current study uses the Deese-Roediger-McDermott
   task to investigate true and false memories in a sample with social
   anxiety disorder (n = 37) compared to a non-anxious control group (n =
   40) before and after a three-day delay following list presentation.
   Additionally, the study examines anticipation of a social stressor and
   stimuli content (social versus nonsocial) as moderators of memory
   effects. Contrary to hypotheses, results for true memories showed no
   effects involving social anxiety or stressor group. However, nonsocial
   false memories were reported more frequently when participants with
   social anxiety disorder were anticipating a speech and when control
   participants were not (the latter at the level of a trend). Notably,
   when lists were socially relevant, these group differences in false
   memory disappeared. Results suggest that individuals with social anxiety
   disorder may be vulnerable to some unexpected memory distortions when
   anticipating social stress.

   were Cuban American (n = 34), Mexican American (n = 209), Puerto Rican
   (n = 78), and other Hispanic American (n = 54). Results suggested that
   Cuban Americans and individuals with more connection to Hispanic culture
   had lower treatment retention. Hispanics born in the U.S and those who
   spoke English at home had a lower percentage of days abstinent during
   weeks 5-16, although Puerto Ricans born in the U.S. and Cuban Americans
   living more years in the U.S. had a higher percentage of days abstinent
   in weeks 1-4 and 5-16, respectively. Results may inform future

   creation of a dialogical performance' (Conquergood, 1985), arguing for
   the ways integrated tandem cycling challenges distinct binary
   categories, bodily hierarchies, and constructs of social otherness.
   Based on one year of fieldwork conducted during cycling, I examine the
   form of togetherness' this activity creates, as well as the
   intersensory' aspects of this activity, discussing the ways it allows
   group members to critically reflect upon their bodily and sensory
   identities, and to re-embody sight as an active and somatic sense.
   Contributing to and integrating disability ethnography, anthropology of

   this mutual experience enriches the meanings of both blindness and
   sight, and challenges rigid definitions of and boundaries around the

AB In this article, we examine gender representations in secular and
   religious media. Based on comparative content analysis of six secular
   and religious magazines, we analyze how both types of media represented
   manhood in ways that facilitate the elevation of men at the expense of
   women. Specifically, we demonstrate how religious and secular magazines
   represented fatherly and spousal manhood by emphasizing inherent gender
   differences, male leadership, protection and control, and reasons to
   excuse men for failing to live up to familial and marital expectations.
   In conclusion, we draw out implications for understanding the importance
   of comparative analyses of secular and religious media, the insights
   that such analyses provide for the study of contemporary secular and
   religious dynamics, and the reproduction of gender inequalities.

AB Social scientists are not taking philanthropy seriously enough. New
   approaches to philanthropy such as venture philanthropy,
   philanthrocapitalism, strategic philanthropy, and effective altruism are
   creating what is often broadly termed "the new philanthropy." Living
   hands-on mega wealthy donors such as Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, and
   John Arnold have publicly committed their energies and wealth to
   transforming society through philanthropy. Some of these philanthropic
   endeavors, notably in K-12 education, are creating jurisdictional
   challenges to the public sector. Others are approaching transversal and
   transnational issues in ways that are difficult to do through government
   policies. This essay provides an overview of these issues and, drawing
   from the other essays in this symposium, makes the case that scholars
   should do more research on the social contexts and consequences of
   philanthropy.

AB The diversity of life is made up not only of the diversity of plants and
   animal species, habitats and ecosystems, but also of the diversity of
   human cultures. These diversities interact with one another in complex
   ways and express the mutual adaptation between humans and the
   environment at local level. Sicilian traditional agro-ecosystems, due to
   the history of the territory and the resulting social and economic
   context, are configured in a heterogeneous mosaic rich in residual
   features of environmental value, which enhance the connectivity of the
   ecological network and support a high proportion of species that are
   rare or of conservation concern. As a case study we analyzed the
   characteristics of the cultural and natural landscape of the Madonie
   Mountains (Sicily), acknowledged as one of the most relevant
   biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean. In a G.I.S. environment, we
   created a digital naturalness grid map and a floristic map including
   extensive data collected in field. We measured landscape naturalness
   degree, using the Naturalness Evaluation Index, and analysed its
   relationship with plant species distribution. We produce evidence that
   the cultural processes that shape a traditional landscape can foster an
   amount of specific richness disproportionate to the area covered. The
   presence of even limited surfaces with remnant semi-natural vegetation
   cover, scattered within the agricultural land mosaic, positively affects
   biodiversity. Therefore, we suggest that environmental management plans
   and policies aimed at nature and biodiversity conservation should take
   into account not only natural and semi-natural habitats but also the key
   role of agro-ecosystems.

AB This study examines the factors distinguishing breast cancer (BC)
   subtypes.
   We examined subtypes in 629 women with invasive BC, diagnosed from 2006
   to 2012, and enrolled in an epidemiological study in New Jersey. Using
   molecular characteristics from pathology reports, BCs were categorized
   as luminal A, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, or triple-negative
   breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Multinomial logistic models (luminal A as
   referent) were used to describe BC subtype associations.
   Women with luminal B tumors were more likely to be younger at diagnosis
   [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.4] and to have
   higher-grade (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.5-4.7), larger (OR 1.9, 95 % CI
   1.0-3.6), and Ki67-positive tumors (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.1-4.0). Women with
   non-luminal HER2-expressing BCs were more likely to have higher-grade
   tumors (OR 14.5, 95 % CI 5.3-39.7). Women with TNBCs were more likely to
   be African-American (OR 1.9, 95 % CI 1.0-3.4) and to have higher-grade
   (OR 9.7, 95 % CI 5.1-18.4), larger (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.0-4.8), and
   Ki67-positive (OR 2.9, 95 % CI 1.6-5.2) tumors. Notably, compared to the
   luminal A subtype, luminal B, non-luminal HER2-expressing, and
   triple-negative subtypes were more frequently self-detected; however,
   these associations were attenuated in multivariable models.
   These findings suggest that some BC subtypes were associated with
   features denoting more aggressive phenotypes, namely higher grade,
   larger size, and Ki67 positivity, and possibly patient self-detection
   among some women. These findings highlight a need for enhanced
   screening, particularly among younger women, racial/ethnic minorities,
   and lower socioeconomic subgroups.

AB Background: Primary care practices that concentrate linguistically and
   culturally appropriate services for Latinos may result in higher
   cardiology consultation rates and improved process measure performance
   for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and congestive heart
   failure (CHF).
   Methods: Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to
   assess differences in referral at high proportion (HP) vs low proportion
   (LP) practices. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to assess the
   frequency of follow-up consultation.
   Results: Among the 9,761 patients, 9,168 had CAD, 4,444 had CHF, and
   3,851 had both conditions. Latinos comprised 11% of the CAD cohort and
   11% of the CHF cohort. Multivariable analyses showed higher consultation
   rates for Latinos at HP practices for CAD and CHF. Blacks and Whites at
   HP practices had no significant differences in rates of consultation
   compared to those in LP practices. Latinos at HP practices had 25% more
   consultations for CAD and 23% more consultations for CHF than Latinos at
   LP practices. Latinos at HP clinics had higher overall mean quality
   performance on clinical measures for both CAD and CHF. Latinos at an LP
   clinic had the largest improvement in quality performance with
   consultation.
   Conclusions: Among Latinos with CAD or CHF receiving care within a
   single large academic care network, Latino patients at HP practices have
   higher rates of cardiologist consultation and performance on CVD process
   measures compared to Latino patients at LP practices. Elucidating the
   essential components of individual practice environments that pro-vide
   higher quality of care for Latinos will allow for well designed systems
   to reduce health care disparities.

AB Objective: Residential ethnic segregation may operate through multiple
   mechanisms to increase stroke risk. The current study evaluated if
   residential ethnic segregation was associated with stroke risk in a
   bi-ethnic population.
   Design: Incident strokes were identified in Nueces County, Texas from
   2000 to 2010. Residential ethnic segregation (range: 0-1) was derived
   for each census tract in the county (n=64) using 2000 US Census data,
   and categorized into: predominantly non-Hispanic White (NHW, <.3);
   ethnically mixed (.3-.7); predominantly Mexican American (MA, >.7).
   Multilevel Poisson regression models were fitted separately for NHWs and
   MAs to assess the association between residential ethnic segregation
   (predominantly NHW referent) and relative risk for stroke, adjusted for
   age category, sex and census tract-level median per capita income.
   Effect modification by age was also examined.
   Results: In adjusted models, residential ethnic segregation was not
   associated with stroke risk in either ethnic group. Effect modification
   by age was significant in both groups. Young MAs and NHWs living in
   predominantly MA census tracts were at greater relative risk for stroke
   than those living in predominantly NHW census tracts, but this
   association was only significant for MAs (MAs: RR = 2.38 [95% CI:
   1.31-4.31]; NHWs: RR = 1.53 [95% CI: .92-2.52]).
   Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that residential ethnic segregation
   may influence downstream stroke risk in young MAs. Pathways between
   residential ethnic segregation and stroke in young MAs should be
   explored.

AB Background: Few studies have examined the actual hospital arrival mode,
   emergency department (ED) care processes, and early outcomes in Hispanic
   vs non-Hispanic acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We evaluated
   processes and prognosis by Hispanic ethnicity among AIS patients
   encountered in urban setting.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed prospectively-collected data on
   1,117 AIS patients presenting within 12 hours of ictus to five hospitals
   in a tertiary-level stroke center network in San Diego, California.
   Variables of interest included pre-hospital factors, ED care processes,
   and favorable outcome (day-90 modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0-1);
   all of which were adjusted for pre-specified covariates in a
   multivariable logistic regression model.
   Results: There were 192 Hispanic AIS patients (17.2% of cohort)
   encountered from June 2004 to March 2011. Hispanic patients were
   significantly more likely to be younger, female, and diabetic. Hispanic
   patients arrived by ambulance (vs other arrival modes) less frequently
   (adjusted OR .56; 95% CI: .38-.81), trended toward a longer time of
   stroke onset to treatment decision (351.6 vs. 320.02 minutes, P=.07),
   and experienced a favorable day-90 outcome less often (adjusted OR.52,
   CI: .28-.96). However, for the day-90 outcome, there was no interaction
   between ambulance arrival and Hispanic ethnicity (P=.5614).
   Discussion: Hispanic AIS patients in this study were less likely to
   arrive at the hospital by ambulance, and experienced half the odds of a
   favorable outcome compared to others. Strategies to boost ambulance
   utilization among Hispanic AIS patients and identify contributors to
   this worrisome outcome disparity are needed.

AB Objectives: The John Henryism (JH) hypothesis suggests that, under
   adverse social and economic conditions, high-effort coping styles that
   reflect hard work and determination may contribute to elevated blood
   pressure. Results from tests of this hypothesis have been mixed, with
   variations by region, urban versus rural areas, race, gender, and age.
   The majority of studies reporting that socioeconomic position modifies
   associations between JH and blood pressure have been for non-Latino
   Blacks in rural communities. In contrast, most studies conducted in
   urban areas report little support for the JH hypothesis. Few studies
   have been conducted in samples that include Latinos. We extend previous
   research by testing the JH hypothesis in a multi-ethnic, low-to-moderate
   income urban community.
   Design: We used multivariate linear regression to test the hypothesis
   that associations between JH and blood pressure were modified by income,
   education, or labor force status in a multi-ethnic (non-Latino Black,
   Latino, non-Latino White) sample (N=703) in Detroit, Michigan. The
   outcome measures were systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
   Results: John Henryism was associated with higher SBP (beta=3.92,
   P=.05), but not DBP (beta=1.85, P=.13). These associations did not
   differ by income, education, or labor force status. Results did not
   differ by race or ethnicity.
   Conclusions: John Henryism is positively associated with SBP in this
   multi-ethnic, low-to-moderate income sample. This association did not
   differ by income, education, or labor force status. Results are
   consistent with studies conducted in urban communities, finding limited
   evidence that associations between JH and blood pressure vary by
   socioeconomic position.

AB Objective: To determine if there are disparities between White and Black
   inpatient mortality rates for specific medical and surgical conditions
   and whether disparities vary by patient and hospital subgroups.
   Design, Setting, Participants: All-payer discharge records in the 2009
   Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, State Inpatient Databases (SID)
   for 36 states that comprised about 80% of the Black and White
   populations in the United States were used to create a random,
   stratified sample of about 1,900 community hospitals (a 40% sample of US
   hospitals). All discharges in the hospitals were included and weighted
   for national estimates.
   Main Outcome Measures: Inpatient Quality Indicators, developed by the
   Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, were used to measure
   risk-adjusted hospital mortality for six medical conditions and four
   surgeries. National estimates compared non-Hispanic Whites to Blacks by
   patient and hospital characteristics.
   Results: Blacks had lower mortality for all medical conditions compared
   to Whites. However, they had higher mortality rates for two surgical
   procedures (coronary artery bypass graft and craniotomy) and lower
   mortality for one surgery (abdominal aortic anuerysm repair). These
   patterns held for most, though not all, patient and hospital subgroups
   for medical conditions, but disparities typically varied by subgroup for
   surgeries.
   Conclusions: Policymakers and researchers may use these findings in
   targeting interventions, designing quality reporting programs and
   designing studies on why the disparities exist and how to reduce them.

   aftermath of AB 109's enactment in 2011 as empirical windows into how
   actors shape the meaning of law in local settings. I find that
   practitioners in counties with divergent historical imprisonment
   patterns enact four processes (overwriting or underwriting law,
   selective magnification, and selective siting) to arrive at distinct
   interpretations of AB 109 as mandating system-wide decarceration or the
   relocation of incarceration from state prisons to county jails. Although
   my data do not speak to the ultimate implementation of AB 109, the
   processes revealed have practical implications for the reform goal of
   decarceration by rationalizing distinct resource allocations at an early
   stage in the implementation process.

AB There is a growing commitment by different parts of the alternative food
   movement (AFM) to improve labor conditions for conventional food chain
   workers, and to develop economically fair alternatives, albeit under a
   range of conditions that structure mobilization. This has direct
   implications for the process of intra-movement building and therefore
   the degree to which the movement ameliorates economic inequality at the
   point of food labor. This article asks what accounts for the variation
   in AFM labor commitments across different contexts. It then appraises a
   range of activist perspectives, practices, and organizational
   approaches. The answer emerges through a comparative analysis of three
   California social movement organizations enmeshed in the particularities
   of local contentious food politics. The cases include a labor union
   representing grocery store and meatpacking/food processing workers, a
   food justice organization working to create green jobs and independent
   funding models, and an organic urban farming and educational
   organization. Commitment to fair labor standards varies due to
   differences in organizational capacity, the degree of dedication to
   ending economic inequality in local activist culture, and the openness
   of local political and economic institutions to working class struggles.
   The article concludes with a discussion of how these findings inform our
   understanding of the process of cooperation and division in the AFM,
   particularly regarding the complexities and contradictions of using food
   labor to combat economic inequality. Movement building in the midst of
   varying institutional, organizational, and cultural contexts reinforces
   the value of a reflexive approach to this imperfect politics of process.

AB Introduction: Parental monitoring and family relations are recognized as
   protective factors for youth alcohol use. The purpose of this study was
   to investigate perceived parental monitoring and family relations among
   subgroups of Mexican youths with different patterns of drinking
   behaviors and consequences.
   Methods: A latent profile analysis (LPA) identified profiles of drinking
   behavior in a cross-sectional survey of entering first year university
   students. Multinomial regression examined associations between parental
   monitoring, family relations and drinking profiles among 22,224
   students.
   Results: Both lower perceived parental monitoring and weaker perceived
   family relations were associated with heavier drinking profiles among
   males and females, but more strongly associated with female than male
   heavier drinking profiles. Being older, having parents with lower
   education, and not living with parents were also associated with lower
   parental monitoring and weaker family relations. There was a general
   trend of lower parental monitoring and weaker family relations as the
   profiles increased from Non/Infrequent-No Consequences to Excessive-Many
   Consequences Drinkers. Lower perceived parental monitoring and weaker
   perceived family relations were more strongly associated with drinking
   profiles among females than among males. Both the parental monitoring
   and family relations scales had similar associations with drinking
   profiles.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that drinking norms and values may
   contribute to any protective influences of parental monitoring and
   family relations on Mexican youths' drinking. Research about changes in
   drinking norms, contextual factors, and youth-parent trust would inform
   the utility of parental monitoring or family relations as protective
   strategies against alcohol misuse among Mexican and Mexican American
   youths and also youths from other backgrounds. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   national successes in achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the living and working
   conditions of waste pickers and their children in a landfill slum
   located in the largest city in eastern Indonesia. A total of 113 people
   from the landfill slum and 1184 people from the general population
   participated in face-to-face interviews. Municipal solid waste (MSW) was
   analyzed for metals, metalloids and fecal indicator bacteria. Ambient
   air quality including particulate matter was measured in the landfill.
   Households in the landfill slum were 5.73 (p = 0.04) times more likely
   to be below the international poverty line (MDG 1: Poverty) and 15.6
   times (p < 0.01) more likely to have no one in the household possessing
   a primary education (MDG 2: Universal Education), and 107 times (p b
   0.01) more likely not to have improved sanitation facilities (MDG 7:
   Environmental Sustainability) when compared to the general population.
   Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five in
   Indonesia. Young children living in the landfill slum were 2.87 times
   (p=0.02) more likely to develop diarrhea than their general population
   counterparts. Other survey results and environmental measurements
   suggest that landfill slum children have additional adverse health
   effects (e.g. infections and poisoning). Poverty underlies several MDG
   issues that directly or indirectly affect child health. Therefore,
   eradicating extreme poverty will continue to be the most critical
   challenge for the MDGs beyond 2015. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Biomedical and geriatric technologies are having major impacts on the
   development and management of human longevity. Our contention in this
   special issue is that longevity should be considered as a point of
   departure for new forms of politics in which social sciences, in
   particular sociology and politics, can play an important role. In this
   introduction, we argue that emerging consumer markets in biomedicine are
   incrementally redefining the relationship between old age and society.
   Techno-economic transformations are creating new sites of vulnerability
   that are masked by medical utopias of good health and living forever. In
   this context, it is unlikely that such technologies will be able to
   overcome inequalities in distribution and may well exacerbate various
   forms of injustice. By drawing on notions of institutional
   precariousness and scarcity, we conclude that to maintain any degree of
   social solidarity, increasing longevity will force the emergence of a
   sociology of limits.

AB Introduction: Reducing racial/ethnic disparities in immunization rates
   is a compelling public health goal. Disparities in childhood vaccination
   rates have not been observed in recent years for most vaccines. The
   objective of this study is to assess adult vaccination by race/ethnicity
   in the U.S.
   Methods: The 2012 National Health Interview Survey was analyzed in 2014
   to assess adult vaccination by race/ethnicity for five vaccines
   routinely recommended for adults: influenza, tetanus, pneumococcal (two
   vaccines), human papilloma virus, and zoster vaccines. Multivariable
   logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors
   independently associated with all adult vaccinations.
   Results: Vaccination coverage was significantly lower among non-Hispanic
   blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians compared with non-Hispanic
   whites, with only a few exceptions. Age, sex, education, health
   insurance, usual place of care, number of physician visits in the past
   12 months, and health insurance were independently associated with
   receipt of most of the examined vaccines. Racial/ethnic differences
   narrowed, but gaps remained after taking these factors into account.
   Conclusions: Racial and ethnic differences in vaccination levels narrow
   when adjusting for socioeconomic factors analyzed in this survey, but
   are not eliminated, suggesting that other factors that are associated
   with vaccination disparities are not measured by the National Health
   Interview Survey and could also contribute to the differences in
   coverage. Additional efforts, including systems changes to ensure
   routine assessment and recommendations for needed vaccinations among
   adults for all racial/ethnic groups, are essential for improving vaccine
   coverage. (C) 2015 by American Journal of Preventive Medicine and

AB Introduction: India has one of the lowest immunization rates worldwide
   despite a longstanding Universal Immunization Program (UIP) that
   provides free childhood vaccines. This study characterizes the
   predictors for under- and non-vaccination among Indian children aged
   12-36 months.
   Methods: This study utilized District Level Household and Facility
   Survey Data, 2008 (DLHS3), from India. DLHS3 is a nationally
   representative sample collected from December 2007 through December
   2008; this analysis was conducted during 2014. Children's vaccination
   status was categorized as fully, under-, and non-vaccinated based on
   whether children received all, some, or none of the UIP-recommended
   vaccines (one dose each of bacillus Calmette-Guerin and measles, and
   three doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus). A multinomial logistic
   regression model estimated the odds of under-vaccination compared with
   full vaccination, and odds of non-vaccination compared with full
   vaccination. Analytic predictors included socioeconomic, cultural,
   household, maternal, and childhood characteristics.
   Results: The analysis included 108,057 children; the estimated
   proportions of fully, under-, and non-vaccinated children were 57%,31%,
   and 12%, respectively. After adjusting for state of residence, age,
   gender, household wealth, and maternal education, additional significant
   predictors of children's vaccination status were religion, caste, place
   of delivery, number of antenatal care visits, and maternal tetanus
   vaccination, all of which demonstrated large effect sizes.
   Conclusions: India's immunization coverage remained low in 2008, with
   just slightly more than half of all children aged 12-36 months fully
   vaccinated with DIP-recommended vaccines. A better understanding of the
   predictors for vaccination can help shape interventions to reduce
   disparities in full vaccination among children of differing
   demographic/cultural groups. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

AB Background
   Globally, client-perpetrated violence against female sex workers (FSWs)
   has been associated with multiple health-related harms, including
   high-risk sexual behavior and increased exposure to HIV/STIs. This study
   examined correlates of client-perpetrated sexual, physical, and economic
   violence (e.g., robbery) against FSWs in 13 cities throughout Mexico.
   Methods
   FSWs (N = 1,089) who were enrolled in a brief, evidence-based, sexual
   risk reduction intervention for FSWs (Mujer Segura) were interviewed
   about their work context, including experiences of violence perpetrated
   by clients, sexual risk and substance use practices, financial need, and
   social supports. Three broad categories of factors (sociodemographic,
   work context, behavioral and social characteristics of FSWs) were
   examined as correlates of sexual, physical, and economic violence.
   Results
   The prevalence of different types of client-perpetrated violence against
   FSWs in the past 6 months was: sexual (11.7%), physical (11.8%),
   economic (16.9%), and any violence (22.6%). Greater financial need,
   self-identification as a street worker, and lower perceived emotional
   support were independently associated with all three types of violence.
   Alcohol use before or during sex with clients in the past month was
   associated with physical and sexual violence. Using drugs before or
   during sex with clients, injection drug use in the past month, and
   population size of city were associated with sexual violence only, and
   FSWs' alcohol use score (AUDIT-C) was associated with economic violence
   only.
   Conclusions
   Correlates of client-perpetrated violence encompassed sociodemographic,
   work context, and behavioral and social factors, suggesting that
   approaches to violence prevention for FSWs must be multi-dimensional.
   Prevention could involve teaching FSWs strategies for risk avoidance in
   the workplace (e.g., avoiding use of alcohol with clients), enhancement
   of FSWs' community-based supports, development of interventions that
   deliver an anti-violence curriculum to clients, and programs to address
   FSWs' financial need by increasing their economic opportunities outside
   of the sex trade.

AB Fifteen triads of unacquainted men conversed for ten minutes while
   stress was measured in real time by pulse rate and thumb blood volume
   (TBV). Salivary measures of testosterone (T), cortisol (C), and the
   stress-related enzyme alpha-amylase (AA) were measured at the beginning
   and end of the session. Fully or partially transitive status hierarchies
   formed in 14 triads. (Highest ranked man was scored 1, lowest 3, with
   ties allowed.) Ten of the triads participated in Study 1, where nothing
   was at stake in the casual conversation. Five additional triads were run
   in Study 2, intended to introduce competition by offering a $20 reward
   to the man afterward chosen as having led the conversation. Most results
   from the two studies are similar, suggesting that the $20 reward had
   little effect. Combining studies, pulse and TBV show that conversation
   is more stressful than watching a video beforehand. Within the
   conversation, speaking turns are more stressful than listening turns,
   especially among the lowest ranked men, less so among those higher in
   rank. This supports a stress-based mechanism for status allocation among
   humans. Apparently, human speech is a form of status signaling,
   homologous with nonlinguistic status signals used by other primates, as
   posited by the "biosocial model." The biosocial model also posits that a
   physiological substrate (T, C, and AA) is related to dominance or
   status. Predicted effects are not replicated here, except for an inverse
   relationship between the stress enzyme AA and status. The mostly null
   results, obtained from conversations where there was little or nothing
   at stake, suggest that T and C (and their interaction) are not relevant
   to emergent status in the absence of serious competition.

AB Background
   Recruitment and retention of talent is central to the research
   performance of universities. Existing research shows that, while men are
   more likely than women to be promoted at the different stages of the
   academic career, no such difference is found when it comes to faculty
   retention rates. Current research on faculty retention, however, focuses
   on careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
   We extend this line of inquiry to the social sciences.
   Methods
   We follow 2,218 tenure-track assistant professors hired since 1990 in
   seven social science disciplines at nineteen U.S. universities from time
   of hire to time of departure. We also track their time to promotion to
   associate and full professor. Using survival analysis, we examine gender
   differences in time to departure and time to promotion. Our methods
   account for censoring and unobserved heterogeneity, as well as effect
   heterogeneity across disciplines and cohorts.
   Results
   We find no statistically significant differences between genders in
   faculty retention. However, we do find that men are more likely to be
   granted tenure than women. When it comes to promotion to full professor,
   the results are less conclusive, as the effect of gender is sensitive to
   model specification.
   Conclusions
   The results corroborate previous findings about gender patterns in
   faculty retention and promotion. They suggest that advances have been
   made when it comes to gender equality in retention and promotion, but
   important differences still persist.

AB BACKGROUNDPatient navigation may reduce cancer disparities associated
   with socioeconomic status (SES) and household factors. This study
   examined whether these factors were associated with delays in diagnostic
   resolution among patients with cancer screening abnormalities and
   whether patient navigation ameliorated these delays.
   METHODSThis study analyzed data from 5 of 10 centers of the National
   Cancer Institute's Patient Navigation Research Program, which collected
   SES and household data on employment, income, education, housing,
   marital status, and household composition. The primary outcome was the
   time to diagnostic resolution after a cancer screening abnormality.
   Separate adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were fit for each SES
   and household factor, and an interaction between that factor and the
   intervention status was included.
   RESULTSAmong the 3777 participants (1968 in the control arm and 1809 in
   the navigation intervention arm), 91% were women, and the mean age was
   44 years; 43% were Hispanic, 28% were white, and 27% were African
   American. Within the control arm, the unemployed experienced a longer
   time to resolution than those employed full-time (hazard ratio [HR],
   0.85; P=.02). Renters (HR, 0.81; P=.02) and those with other (ie,
   unstable) housing (HR, 0.60; P<.001) had delays in comparison with
   homeowners. Never married (HR, 0.70; P<.001) and previously married
   participants (HR, 0.85; P=.03) had a longer time to care than married
   participants. There were no differences in the time to diagnostic
   resolution with any of these variables within the navigation
   intervention arm.
   CONCLUSIONSDelays in diagnostic resolution exist by employment, housing
   type, and marital status. Patient navigation eliminated these
   disparities in the study sample. These findings demonstrate the value of
   providing patient navigation to patients at high risk for delays in
   cancer care. Cancer 2015;121:4025-4034. (c) 2015 American Cancer

AB BACKGROUNDSurvivors of childhood cancer who are treated with
   platinum-based chemotherapy and/or cranial radiation are at risk of
   treatment-induced hearing loss. However, the effects of such hearing
   loss on adult social attainment have not been well elucidated.
   METHODSAdult survivors of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) solid
   tumors (180 survivors) and non-CNS solid tumors (226 survivors) who were
   treated with potentially ototoxic cancer therapy completed audiologic
   evaluations and questionnaires assessing their perception of social
   functioning and social attainment (ie, independent living, marriage, and
   employment). Audiograms were graded with the Chang ototoxicity grading
   scale. Analyses were stratified by tumor type (ie, CNS vs non-CNS).
   Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted with adjustment
   for age; sex; chronic health conditions; and, for the CNS group, IQ.
   Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were
   reported.
   RESULTSSerious hearing loss (that requiring a hearing aid or deafness)
   was detected in 36% of survivors of CNS tumors and 39% of survivors of
   non-CNS tumors. Serious hearing loss was associated with an increased
   risk of perceived negative impact in 1 areas of social functioning
   (survivors of non-CNS tumors: OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.00-3.34]). Among
   survivors of non-CNS tumors, serious hearing loss was associated with
   2-fold increased risk of nonindependent living (OR, 2.19; 95% CI,
   1.19-4.04) and unemployment or not graduating from high school (OR,
   1.85; 95% CI, 1.00-3.34).
   CONCLUSIONSA substantial proportion of adult survivors of childhood
   cancer treated with potentially ototoxic therapy have serious hearing
   loss. Treatment-induced hearing loss was found to be associated with
   reduced social attainment, both perceived and actual, in this study
   sample. Cancer 2015;121:4053-4061. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.
   A substantial proportion of adult survivors of childhood cancer who
   received treatment with potentially ototoxic therapy experience serious
   hearing loss. Treatment-induced hearing loss is associated with reduced
   social attainment in adulthood.

AB Privately owned woodlands are an important source of timber and
   ecosystem services in North America and worldwide. Impacts of management
   on these ecosystems and timber supply from these woodlands are difficult
   to estimate because complex behavioral theory informs the owner's
   management decisions. The decision-making environment consists of
   exogenous market factors, internal cognitive processes, and social
   interactions with fellow landowners, foresters, and other rural
   community members. This study seeks to understand how social
   interactions, information flow, and peer-to-peer networks influence
   timber harvesting behavior using an agent-based model. This theoretical
   model includes forested polygons in various states of 'harvest
   readiness' and three types of agents: forest landowners, foresters, and
   peer leaders (individuals trained in conservation who use peer-to-peer
   networking). Agent rules, interactions, and characteristics were
   parameterized with values from existing literature and an empirical
   survey of forest landowner attitudes, intentions, and demographics. The
   model demonstrates that as trust in foresters and peer leaders
   increases, the percentage of the forest that is harvested sustainably
   increases. Furthermore, peer leaders can serve to increase landowner
   trust in foresters. Model output and equations will inform forest policy
   and extension/outreach efforts. The model also serves as an important
   testing ground for new theories of landowner decision making and
   behavior.

AB Marijuana exerts profound effects on human social behavior, but the
   neural substrates underlying such effects are unknown. Here we report
   that social contact increases, whereas isolation decreases, the
   mobilization of the endogenous marijuana-like neurotransmitter,
   anandamide, in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain structure that
   regulates motivated behavior. Pharmacological and genetic experiments
   show that anandamide mobilization and consequent activation of CB1
   cannabinoid receptors are necessary and sufficient to express the
   rewarding properties of social interactions, assessed using a socially
   conditioned place preference test. We further show that oxytocin, a
   neuropeptide that reinforces parental and social bonding, drives
   anandamide mobilization in the NAc. Pharmacological blockade of oxytocin
   receptors stops this response, whereas chemogenetic, site-selective
   activation of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the
   hypothalamus stimulates it. Genetic or pharmacological interruption of
   anandamide degradation offsets the effects of oxytocin receptor blockade
   on both social place preference and cFos expression in the NAc. The
   results indicate that anandamide-mediated signaling at CB1 receptors,
   driven by oxytocin, controls social reward. Deficits in this signaling
   mechanism may contribute to social impairment in autism spectrum
   disorders and might offer an avenue to treat these conditions.

AB A geographically-resolved, multi-level Bayesian model is used to analyze
   the data presented in the U.S. Police-Shooting Database (USPSD) in order
   to investigate the extent of racial bias in the shooting of American
   civilians by police officers in recent years. In contrast to previous
   work that relied on the FBI's Supplemental Homicide Reports that were
   constructed from self-reported cases of police-involved homicide, this
   data set is less likely to be biased by police reporting practices.
   County-specific relative risk outcomes of being shot by police are
   estimated as a function of the interaction of: 1) whether
   suspects/civilians were armed or unarmed, and 2) the race/ethnicity of
   the suspects/civilians. The results provide evidence of a significant
   bias in the killing of unarmed black Americans relative to unarmed white
   Americans, in that the probability of being {black, unarmed, and shot by
   police} is about 3.49 times the probability of being {white, unarmed,
   and shot by police} on average. Furthermore, the results of multi-level
   modeling show that there exists significant heterogeneity across
   counties in the extent of racial bias in police shootings, with some
   counties showing relative risk ratios of 20 to 1 or more. Finally,
   analysis of police shooting data as a function of county-level
   predictors suggests that racial bias in police shootings is most likely
   to emerge in police departments in larger metropolitan counties with low
   median incomes and a sizable portion of black residents, especially when
   there is high financial inequality in that county. There is no
   relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and
   crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial
   bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as
   a response to local-level crime rates.

AB Background
   Cataract surgery is the most common surgery performed on beneficiaries
   of Medicare, accounting for more than $3.4 billion in annual
   expenditures. The purpose of this study is to examine racial and
   geographic variations in cataract surgery rates and determine the
   association between the racial composition of the community population
   and the racial disparity in the likelihood of receiving necessary
   cataract surgery.
   Methods
   Using the national prevalence rates from the National Institute of Eye
   Health and the 2010 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Florida
   State Ambulatory Surgery Database, we determined the estimated cases of
   cataract and the actual number of cataract procedures performed, on four
   race/gender determined groups aged 65 and over in the state of Florida
   in 2010. The utilization rates and disparity ratios were also calculated
   for each Florida county. The counties were segmented into groups based
   on their racial composition. The association between racial composition
   and disparity ratios in receiving necessary cataract surgery was
   examined. The Geographic Information System was used to display
   county-level geospatial relationships.
   Results
   African-Americans have a lower gender-specific cataract prevalence
   (African-American male = 0.246, African-American female = 0.392, white
   male = 0.368, and white female = 0.457), but they are also less likely
   than whites to receive necessary cataract surgery (utilization rate:
   African-American male = 7.92%, African-American female = 6.17%, white
   male = 12.08%, and white female = 10.54%). The statistical results show
   no overall differences between the disparity ratios and the racial
   composition of the communities. However, our geospatial analyses
   revealed a concentration of high racial disparity/high white population
   counties largely along the West Coast and South Central portion of the
   state.
   Conclusions
   There are racial differences in the likelihood of receiving necessary
   cataract surgery. However, there is no significant statewide association
   between the racial composition of the community population and the
   racial disparity in the likelihood of receiving necessary cataract
   surgery. Geospatial techniques did, however, identify subpopulations of
   interest which were not otherwise identifiable with typical statistical
   approaches, nor consistent with their conclusions.

AB Knowledge of one's own HIV status is essential for long-term disease
   management, but there are few data on how disclosure of HIV status to
   infected children and adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa is associated
   with clinical and psychosocial health outcomes. We conducted a detailed
   baseline assessment of the disclosure status, medication adherence, HIV
   stigma, depression, emotional and behavioral difficulties, and quality
   of life among a cohort of Kenyan children enrolled in an intervention
   study to promote disclosure of HIV status. Among 285 caregiver-child
   dyads enrolled in the study, children's mean age was 12.3 years.
   Caregivers were more likely to report that the child knew his/her
   diagnosis (41%) compared to self-reported disclosure by children (31%).
   Caregivers of disclosed children reported significantly more positive
   views about disclosure compared to caregivers of non-disclosed children,
   who expressed fears of disclosure related to the child being too young
   to understand (75%), potential psychological trauma for the child (64%),
   and stigma and discrimination if the child told others (56%). Overall,
   the vast majority of children scored within normal ranges on screenings
   for behavioral and emotional difficulties, depression, and quality of
   life, and did not differ by whether or not the child knew his/her HIV
   status. A number of factors were associated with a child's knowledge of
   his/her HIV diagnosis in multivariate regression, including older age
   (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.1), better WHO disease stage (OR 2.5, 95% CI
   1.4-4.4), and fewer reported caregiver-level adherence barriers (OR 1.9,
   95% CI 1.1-3.4). While a minority of children in this cohort knew their
   HIV status and caregivers reported significant barriers to disclosure
   including fears about negative emotional impacts, we found that
   disclosure was not associated with worse psychosocial outcomes.

AB W.E.B. Du Bois' early work as a sociologist from 1896 to 1914 represents
   a milestone in the development of modern sociology. His empirical
   studies often employed a triangular methodological approach, and by
   grounding The Philadelphia Negro in what is the earliest extensive
   social survey by an American sociologist, Du Bois set the stage for the
   growth of sociology as a legitimate science. In fact, his approach
   became the model that the discipline eventually followed. Had Du Bois
   been white, he would have been recognized as a leading founder of the
   field. Since Du Bois' early sociological scholarship was completed
   during the height of the Jim Crow era, his brilliant landmark work was
   largely negated by the profession. His scholarly accomplishments clearly
   focused on establishing a scientific sociology. Based on his exemplary
   work, can sociology finally negate the sociological negation of W.E.B.

AB Objectives. We examined whether kindergarten teachers' ratings of
   children's prosocial skills, an indicator of noncognitive ability at
   school entry, predict key adolescent and adult outcomes. Our goal was to
   determine unique associations over and above other important child,
   family, and contextual characteristics.
   Methods. Data came from the Fast Track study of low-socioeconomic status
   neighborhoods in 3 cities and 1 rural setting. We assessed associations
   between measured outcomes in kindergarten and outcomes 13 to 19 years
   later (1991-2000). Models included numerous control variables
   representing characteristics of the child, family, and context, enabling
   us to explore the unique contributions among predictors.
   Results. We found statistically significant associations between
   measured social-emotional skills in kindergarten and key young adult
   outcomes across multiple domains of education, employment, criminal
   activity, substance use, and mental health.
   Conclusions. A kindergarten measure of social-emotional skills may be
   useful for assessing whether children are at risk for deficits in
   noncognitive skills later in life and, thus, help identify those in need
   of early intervention. These results demonstrate the relevance of
   noncognitive skills in development for personal and public health
   outcomes.

AB Objectives. We used an environmental justice screening tool
   (CalEnviroScreen 1.1) to compare the distribution of environmental
   hazards and vulnerable populations across California communities.
   Methods. CalEnviroScreen 1.1 combines 17 indicators created from 2004 to
   2013 publicly available data into a relative cumulative impact score. We
   compared cumulative impact scores across California zip codes on the
   basis of their location, urban or rural character, and racial/ethnic
   makeup. We used a concentration index to evaluate which indicators were
   most unequally distributed with respect to race/ethnicity and poverty.
   Results. The unadjusted odds of living in one of the 10% most affected
   zip codes were 6.2, 5.8, 1.9, 1.8, and 1.6 times greater for Hispanics,
   African Americans, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and other
   or multiracial individuals, respectively, than for non-Hispanic Whites.
   Environmental hazards were more regressively distributed with respect to
   race/ethnicity than poverty, with pesticide use and toxic chemical
   releases being the most unequal.
   Conclusions. Environmental health hazards disproportionately burden
   communities of color in California. Efforts to reduce disparities in
   pollution burden can use simple screening tools to prioritize areas for
   action.

AB Objectives. We examined whether and how racial prejudice at both the
   individual and community levels contributes to mortality risk among
   majority as well as minority group members.
   Methods. We used data on racial attitudes from the General Social Survey
   (1993-2002) prospectively linked to mortality data from the National
   Death Index through 2008.
   Results. Whites and Blacks living in communities with higher levels of
   racial prejudice were at an elevated risk of mortality, independent of
   individual and community sociodemographic characteristics and
   individually held racist beliefs (odds ratio = 1.24; 95% confidence
   interval = 1.04, 1.49). Living in a highly prejudiced community had
   similar harmful effects among both Blacks and Whites. Furthermore, the
   interaction observed between individual-and community-level racial
   prejudice indicated that respondents with higher levels of racial
   prejudice had lower survival rates if they lived in communities with low
   degrees of racial prejudice. Community-level social capital explained
   the relationship between community racial prejudice and mortality.
   Conclusions. Community-level racial prejudice may disrupt social
   capital, and reduced social capital is associated with increased
   mortality risk among both Whites and Blacks. Our results contribute to
   an emerging body of literature documenting the negative consequences of
   prejudice for population health.

AB Objectives. I examined the individual-and community-level factors
   associated with spousal violence in post-Soviet countries.
   Methods. I used population-based data from the Demographic and Health
   Survey conducted between 2005 and 2012. My sample included currently
   married women of reproductive age (n = 3932 in Azerbaijan, n = 4053 in
   Moldova, n = 1932 in Ukraine, n = 4361 in Kyrgyzstan, and n = 4093 in
   Tajikistan). I selected respondents using stratified multistage cluster
   sampling. Because of the nested structure of the data, multilevel
   logistic regressions for survey data were fitted to examine factors
   associated with spousal violence in the last 12 months.
   Results. Partner's problem drinking was the strongest risk factor
   associated with spousal violence in all 5 countries. In Moldova,
   Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, women with greater financial power than their
   spouses were more likely to experience violence. Effects of community
   economic deprivation and of empowerment status of women in the community
   on spousal violence differed across countries. Women living in
   communities with a high tolerance of violence faced a higher risk of
   spousal violence in Moldova and Ukraine. In more traditional countries
   (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan), spousal violence was lower in
   conservative communities with patriarchal gender beliefs or higher
   financial dependency on husbands.
   Conclusions. My findings underscore the importance of examining
   individual risk factors in the context of community-level factors and
   developing individual- and community-level interventions.

AB Many animals have ornaments that mediate choice and competition in
   social and sexual contexts. Individuals with elaborate sexual ornaments
   typically have higher fitness than those with less elaborate ornaments,
   but less is known about whether socially selected ornaments are
   associated with fitness. Here, we test the relationship between fitness
   and facial patterns that are a socially selected signal of fighting
   ability in Polistes dominula wasps. We found wasps that signal higher
   fighting ability have larger nests, are more likely to survive harsh
   winters, and obtain higher dominance rank than wasps that signal lower
   fighting ability. In comparison, body weight was not associated with
   fitness. Larger wasps were dominant over smaller wasps, but showed no
   difference in nest size or survival. Overall, the positive relationship
   between wasp facial patterns and fitness indicates that receivers can
   obtain diverse information about a signaler's phenotypic quality by
   paying attention to socially selected ornaments. Therefore, there are
   surprisingly strong parallels between the information conveyed by
   socially and sexually selected signals. Similar fitness relationships in
   social and sexually selected signals may be one reason it can be
   difficult to distinguish the role of social versus sexual selection in
   ornament evolution.

AB Does society benefit from private measures to mitigate infectious
   disease risks? Since mitigation reduces both peak prevalence and the
   number of people who fall ill, the answer might appear to be yes. But
   mitigation also prolongs epidemics and therefore the time susceptible
   people engage in activities to avoid infection. These avoidance
   activities come at a cost-in lost production or consumption, for
   example. Whether private mitigation yields net social benefits depends
   on the social weight given to the costs of illness and illness
   avoidance, now and into the future. We show that, for a large class of
   infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially beneficial.
   However, in cases where society discounts the future at either very low
   or very high rates relative to private individuals, or where it places a
   low weight on the private cost of illness, the social cost of illness
   under proportionate mixing (doing nothing) may be lower than the social
   cost of illness under preferential mixing (avoiding infectious
   individuals). That is, under some circumstances, society would prefer
   shorter, more intense epidemics without avoidance costs over longer,
   less intense epidemics with avoidance costs. A sobering (although not
   surprising) implication of this is that poorer societies should be
   expected to promote less private disease-risk mitigation than richer
   societies.

AB The ship recycling industry in Bangladesh provides critical metal
   resources for construction and consumer products in the country, which
   has no native metal sources. This industry illustrates how industrial
   recycling can arise in a self-organized manner and be maintained through
   social embeddedness. Information provided through interviews with
   shipyard owners, traders, and blacksmiths illustrate the importance of
   historical, cognitive, structural, and cultural embeddedness to
   maintaining the flow of metals from the ships beached in the coastal
   city of Chittagong to the capitol city of Dhaka, more than 300 km away.
   The industry began through small scale metal scavenging; the early
   scavengers developed the major metal trading businesses operating today,
   maintained by family relationships. The metalworking community maintains
   a balance between the strong family ties and weak social ties, ensuring
   an optimum flow of information among the businessmen in the community.
   The engagement with scrap handling produces a sense of pride and a
   pleasure of innovation that binds this community with waste recycling.
   Thus, the embeddedness of this community through self-recruitment and
   trade information via social ties directs the resource flows in the
   community. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The night-time economy is often described as repelling consumers fearful
   of the 'undesirable Others' imagined dominant within such time-spaces.
   In this paper we explore this by describing attitudes towards, and
   reactions to, one particularly contentious site: the 'lap dance' club.
   Often targeted by campaigners in England and Wales as a source of
   criminality and anti-sociality, in this paper we shift the focus from
   fear to disgust, and argue that Sexual Entertainment Venues (SEVs) are
   opposed on the basis of moral judgments that reflect distinctions of
   both class and gender. Drawing on documentary analysis, survey results
   and interview data collected during guided walks, we detail the concerns
   voiced by those anxious about the presence of lap dance or striptease
   clubs in their town or city, particularly the notion that they 'lower
   the tone' of particular streets or neighbourhoods. Our conclusion is
   that the opposition expressed to lap dance clubs is part of an attempt
   to police the boundaries of respectable masculinities and femininities,
   marginalizing the producers and consumers of sexual entertainment
   through 'speech acts' which identify such entertainment as unruly,
   vulgar and uncivilized. These findings are considered in the light of
   ongoing debates concerning the relations of morality, respectability and
   disgust.

AB In the paper, we use data from an English study of security consumption,
   and recent work in the cultural sociology of markets, to illustrate the
   way in which moral and social commitments shape and often constrain
   decisions about how, or indeed whether, individuals and organizations
   enter markets for protection. Three main claims are proffered. We
   suggest, firstly, that the purchase of security commodities is a
   mundane, non-conspicuous mode of consumption that typically exists
   outside of the paraphernalia of consumer culture - a form of grudge
   spending. Secondly, we demonstrate that security consumption is weighed
   against other commitments that individuals and organizations have and is
   often kept in check by these competing considerations. We find, thirdly,
   that the prospect of consuming security prompts people to consider the
   relations that obtain between security objects and other things that
   they morally or aesthetically value, and to reflect on what the buying
   and selling of security signals about the condition and likely futures
   of their society. These points are illustrated using the examples of
   organizational consumption and gated communities. In respect of each
   case, we tease out the evaluative judgements that condition and
   constrain the purchase of security among organizations and individuals
   and argue that they open up some important but neglected questions to do
   with the moral economy of security.

AB With a majority of humans now living in cities, strategic research is
   necessary to elucidate the impact of this evolutionarily unfamiliar
   habitat on neural functions and well-being. In this review, both rodent
   and human models are considered in the evaluation of the changing
   physical and social landscapes associated with urban dwellings. Animal
   models assessing increased exposure to artificial physical elements
   characteristic of urban settings, as well as exposure to unnatural
   sources of light for extended durations, are reviewed. In both cases,
   increased biomarkers of mental illnesses such as major depression have
   been observed. Additionally, applied human research emphasizing the
   emotional impact of environmental threats associated with urban habitats
   is considered. Subjects evaluated in an inner-city hospital reveal the
   impact of combined specific genetic vulnerabilities and heightened
   stress responses in the expression of posttraumatic stress disorder.
   Finally, algorithm-based models of cities have been developed utilizing
   population-level analyses to identify risk factors for psychiatric
   illness. Although complex, the use of multiple research approaches, as
   described herein, results in an enhanced understanding of urbanization
   and its far-reaching effects - confirming the importance of continued
   research directed toward the identification of putative risk factors
   associated with psychiatric illness in urban settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Aims: Socioeconomic, psychosocial, and neighborhood factors influence
   clinical outcomes and self-care behaviors in diabetes; however, few
   studies simultaneously assessed the impact of multiple social
   determinant of health factors on glycemic control. We used an
   explanatory model to examine the differential contribution of social
   determinants and clinical factors on glycemic control. Secondarily, we
   examined the contribution of mutable and immutable factors to identify
   meaningful future interventions.
   Methods: Six hundred and fifteen adults with type 2 diabetes in the
   southeastern United States were recruited. A hierarchical model was run
   with HbA1c as the dependent variable and independent variables entered
   in blocks: demographics (block 1), socioeconomic (block 2), psychosocial
   (block 3), built environment (block 4), clinical (block 5), and
   knowledge/selfcare (block 6).
   Results: Significant associations for HbA1c included self-efficacy (beta
   = -0.10, p < 0.001), social support (beta = 0.01, p < 0.05), comorbidity
   (beta = -0.09, p < 0.05), insulin use (beta = 0.95, p < 0.001),
   medication adherence (beta = -0.11, p < 0.05), and being a former smoker
   (beta = 0.34, p < 0.05); accounting for 24.4% of the variance.
   Conclusions: Important factors that drive glycemic control are mutable,
   and amenable to health interventions. Greater attention should be given
   to interventions that increase self-efficacy and social support, reduce
   the burden of comorbidities, and enhance medication adherence and
   smoking cessation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundThe current study is the first to examine the association of a
   broad range of sociodemographic factors with conditions thought to arise
   most of the time by de novo mutation.
   MethodsData were taken from 1999 to 2009 from the Texas Birth Defects
   Registry (TBDR), a statewide active surveillance program. We used
   Poisson regression to generate crude and adjusted measures of
   association; the latter included models with all variables and with a
   parsimonious subset of variables.
   ResultsThere were 1694 cases with any of the phenotypes in the panel,
   1100 cases in a subpanel with 90% of cases thought to arise de novo, 523
   with chromosomal deletion disorders, and 243 with imprinting disorders.
   In the most parsimonious models, there was an increasing time trend in
   all groups except imprinting (p 0.01). Plurality (twins, triplets, etc.)
   was associated with greater risk of all groups except chromosomal
   deletions (p 0.01). Parental age showed strong trends with all groups;
   paternal age was most important for the total and imprinting groups (p
   0.0001), and maternal age for the others (p 0.04). De novo mutation
   phenotypes were more prevalent among offspring of fathers who are
   non-Hispanic White compared with some other race/ethnic groups.
   ConclusionThis study suggests that birth defects arising by new mutation
   may be more prevalent among offspring of older parents and in plural
   births. The increasing time pattern and race/ethnic pattern may be
   related to greater use of or access to genetic tests. This approach to
   mutation epidemiology seems feasible for birth defects registries to
   consider.Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB BackgroundHeterotaxy syndrome (HTX) is a constellation of defects
   including abnormal organ lateralization and often including congenital
   heart defects. HTX has widely divergent population-based estimates of
   prevalence, racial and ethnic predominance, and mortality in current
   literature.
   MethodsThe objective of this study was to use a population-based
   registry to investigate potential racial and ethnic disparities in HTX.
   Using the Texas Birth Defects Registry, we described clinical features
   and mortality of HTX among infants delivered from 1999 to 2006. We
   calculated birth prevalence and crude prevalence (cPR) ratios for infant
   sex, maternal diabetes, and sociodemographic factors.
   ResultsA total of 353 HTX cases were identified from 2,993,604 births
   (prevalence ratio = 1.18 per 10,000 live births. HTX prevalence was
   approximately 70% higher among infants of Hispanic and non-Hispanic
   black mothers and 28% higher among female infants (cPR = 1.28; 95%
   confidence interval,1.04-1.59). There was a twofold higher female
   preponderance for infants of mothers who were non-Hispanic white or
   black. Mothers with diabetes were three times more likely to have a
   child with HTX compared with nondiabetics (cPR = 3.13; 95% confidence
   interval, 2.12-4.45). Among nondiabetics, HTX cases were 86% more likely
   to have a Hispanic mother and 72% a non-Hispanic black mother.
   First-year mortality for live born children with HTX was 30.9%.
   ConclusionThis study represents one of the largest population-based
   studies of HTX to date, with a novel finding of higher rates of HTX
   among Hispanic infants of mostly Mexican origin, as well as among female
   infants of only non-Hispanic white and black mothers. These findings
   warrant further investigation.Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2015. (c)

AB Multiple studies confirm that African Americans are less likely than
   non-Hispanic whites to receive needed mental health services. Research
   has consistently shown that African Americans are under-represented in
   outpatient mental health treatment settings and are over-represented in
   inpatient psychiatric settings. Further, African Americans are more
   likely to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia and are less likely
   receive an affective disorder diagnosis during inpatient psychiatric
   hospitalization compared to non-Hispanic white patients, pointing to a
   need for examining factors contributing to mental health disparities.
   Using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, this study
   examined predisposing, enabling and need factors differentially
   associated with health service utilization among African American and
   non-Hispanic white patients (n = 5183) during psychiatric admission. We
   conducted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to
   examine both main effects and interactions. In the multivariate model,
   African American race at admission was predicted by multiple factors
   including younger age, female gender, multiple psychiatric
   hospitalizations, elevated positive and negative symptoms of psychosis,
   a diagnosis of schizophrenia and substance use, as well as having
   housing and commercial insurance. Additionally, screening positive for
   cannabis use at intake was found to moderate the relationship between
   being female and African American. Our study findings highlight the
   importance of examining mental health disparities using a conceptual
   framework developed for vulnerable populations (such as racial
   minorities and patients with co-occurring substance use). (C) 2015

   development of children of young Latina mothers (N = 170; M-age = 17.9
   years). Mothers were interviewed and observed interacting with their
   children at 18 months (W1). Children were tested at 18 (W1) and 24 (W2)
   months. Mothers' cultural orientation (W1) was related to aspects of the
   childrearing environment (W1), which in turn had implications for the
   children's development (W2). Specifically, a stronger orientation toward
   American culture was related to higher mother-reported engagement in
   parenting by their own mothers (grandmothers), which in turn predicted
   stronger gains in cognitive and expressive language functioning from W1
   to W2. A stronger Latino orientation related to the display of more
   directiveness and greater mother-reported engagement by the children's
   biological fathers; directiveness, in turn, predicted fewer gains in
   cognitive functioning only when father engagement was low and did not
   predict expressive language development. Finally, mothers' display of
   more positive affect, a stronger American orientation, and higher
   grandmother engagement uniquely predicted gains in W2 expressive
   language functioning. Implications for intervention are discussed. (C)

   the development of social engagement, communicative gestures, and
   imitation in 7- to 25-month-old twins. Twin dyads (N = 20 pairs)
   participated in 10-min, semi-structured play sessions, with the mother
   seated in a chair completing paperwork for half the session, and on the
   floor with her children for the other half. Overall, twins engaged more
   with their mothers than with their siblings: they showed objects and
   imitated speech and object use more frequently when interacting with
   their mothers than with their siblings. When the mother was otherwise
   engaged, the twins played with toys separately, observed each other's
   toy play, or were unengaged. These results demonstrate that adult

AB Background: Eating disorders are severe psychiatric disorders with a
   complex etiology involving transactions among sociocultural,
   psychological, and biological influences. Most research and reviews,
   however, focus on only one level of analysis. To address this gap, we
   provide a qualitative review and summary using an integrative
   biopsychosocial approach. Methods: We selected variables for which there
   were available data using integrative methodologies (e.g., twin studies,
   gene-environment interactions) and/or data at the biological and
   behavioral level (e.g., neuroimaging). Factors that met these inclusion
   criteria were idealization of thinness, negative emotionality,
   perfectionism, negative urgency, inhibitory control, cognitive
   inflexibility, serotonin, dopamine, ovarian hormones. Literature
   searches were conducted using PubMed. Variables were classified as risk
   factors or correlates of eating disorder diagnoses and disordered eating
   symptoms using Kraemer et al.' s (1997) criteria. Findings:
   Sociocultural idealization of thinness variables (media exposure,
   pressures for thinness, thin-ideal internalization, thinness
   expectancies) and personality traits (negative emotionality,
   perfectionism, negative urgency) attained ` risk status' for eating
   disorders and/or disordered eating symptoms. Other factors were
   identified as correlates of eating pathology or were not classified
   given limited data. Effect sizes for risk factors and correlates were
   generally small-to-moderate in magnitude. Conclusions: Multiple
   biopsychosocial influences are implicated in eating disorders and/or
   disordered eating symptoms and several can now be considered established
   risk factors. Data suggest that psychological and environmental factors
   interact with and influence the expression of genetic risk to cause
   eating pathology. Additional studies that examine risk variables across
   multiple levels of analysis and that consider specific transactional
   processes amongst variables are needed to further elucidate the
   intersection of sociocultural, psychological, and biological influences
   on eating disorders.

   study, we examined the relationships among the number of years of
   household receipt of public assistance from age 5-16 years, neural
   activation during monetary reward anticipation and receipt at age 16,
   and depression symptoms at age 16 in 123 girls. Results: Number of years
   of household receipt of public assistance was positively associated with
   heightened response in the medial prefrontal cortex during reward
   anticipation, and this heightened neural response mediated the
   relationship between socioeconomic disadvantage and current depression
   symptoms, controlling for past depression. Conclusions: Chronic exposure
   to socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood may alter neural circuitry
   involved in reward anticipation in adolescence, which in turn may confer
   risk for depression.

AB Background: This study examined whether relocating from a high-poverty
   neighborhood to a lower poverty neighborhood as part of a federal
   housing relocation program (HOPE VI; Housing Opportunities for People
   Everywhere) had effects on adolescent mental and behavioral health
   compared to adolescents consistently living in lower poverty
   neighborhoods. Methods: Sociodemographic, risk behavior, and
   neighborhood data were collected from 592 low-income, primarily
   African-American adolescents and their primary caregivers. Structured
   psychiatric interviews were conducted with adolescents. Prerelocation
   neighborhood, demographic, and risk behavior data were also included.
   Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to test associations between
   neighborhood variables and risk outcomes. HLM was used to test whether
   the effect of neighborhood relocation and neighborhood characteristics
   might explain differences in sexual risk taking, substance use, and
   mental health outcomes. Results: Adolescents who relocated of HOPE VI
   neighborhoods (n = 158) fared worse than control group participants (n =
   429) on most self-reported mental health outcomes. The addition of
   subjective neighborhood measures generally did not substantively change
   these results. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that moving from a
   high-poverty neighborhood to a somewhat lower poverty neighborhood is
   not associated with better mental health and risk behavior outcomes in
   adolescents. The continued effects of having grown up in a high-poverty
   neighborhood, the small improvements in their new neighborhoods, the
   comparatively short length of time they lived in their new neighborhood,
   and/or the stress of moving appears to worsen most of the mental health
   outcomes of HOPE VI compared to control group participants who
   consistently lived in the lower poverty neighborhoods.

AB About two of every five undernourished young children of the world live
   in India. These high levels of child undernutrition have persisted in
   India for several years, even in its relatively well-developed states.
   Moreover, this pattern was observed during a period of rapid economic
   growth. Evidence from India and other developing countries suggests that
   economic growth has little to no impact on reducing child
   undernutrition. We argue that a growth-mediated strategy is unlikely to
   be effective in tackling child undernutrition unless growth is pro-poor
   and leads to investment in programs addressing the root causes of this
   persistent challenge.

AB Several species of wildlife are hunted around the world for the
   perceived potency of certain parts of their bodies in traditional
   medicine and in fetish practices. In Africa, many cultures require
   animal parts for a wide range of traditional and religious practices.
   This has resulted in the persecution of more than 354 bird species
   across the continent In this study, we evaluated the drivers and
   frequency of human-related avian mortality focusing on the trade in
   avian body parts around major protected areas in the Cross River region
   of southeastern Nigeria. We conducted personal interviews with men from
   18 villages in proximity to four natural areas in the region, and asked
   themen questions related to their knowledge of trade in avian body
   parts. From the responses obtained, we identified 27 bird species from
   13 families in regional trade. Three of the top 5 most reported species
   are globally threatened. Both knowledge of and participation in the
   trade were pervasive across the study sites and across different
   occupational groups. 94% of respondents claimed knowledge of trade in
   avian body parts; 66% had participated in that trade in the last 2
   years. To identify predictors of participation in the avian body part
   trade, we fitted all possible model combinations using the Generalized
   Linear Mixed Model approach and ranked them based on their AlCc values.
   The top-ranked model identified age, average monthly income, perceived
   personal need for avian body parts, and number of wives as the top
   socio-economic drivers of participation. Younger people and villagers
   with low monthly income were more likely to participate in the trade.
   Probability of involvement also increased with the number of wives and a
   perceived personal need for avian body parts. The former may be an
   indication of a larger household that requires more resources to sustain
   it; the latter likely reflects personal conviction of the efficacy of
   using avian body parts in traditional medicine and other cultural
   practices. Our study highlights the importance of targeting
   socio-economic factors and integrating cultural needs of the people into
   conservation planning aimed at reducing human-wildlife conflicts. (C)

AB Background: Given recent changes in marijuana policy in the United
   States, it is important to understand the long-term effects of marijuana
   use on adult functioning. We examined whether men who displayed
   different trajectories of marijuana use from adolescence through
   emerging adulthood (age similar to 15-26) differed in terms of
   socioeconomic, social, and life satisfaction outcomes in their mid-30s.
   Methods: Data came from a longitudinal sample of men who were recruited
   in early adolescence (N=506) and followed into adulthood. Four
   trajectory groups based on patterns of marijuana use from adolescence
   into emerging adulthood were compared on adult outcomes (age similar to
   36) before and after controlling for co-occurring use of other
   substances and several pre-existing confounding factors in early
   adolescence. The potential moderating effect of race was also examined.
   Results: Although there were initially group differences across all
   domains, once pre-existing confounds and co-occurring other substance
   use were included in the model, groups only differed in terms of partner
   and friend marijuana use. Chronic marijuana users reported the highest
   proportions of both. Frequent and persistent marijuana use was
   associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES) for Black men only.
   Conclusions: After statistically accounting for confounding variables,
   chronic marijuana users were not at a heightened risk for maladjustment
   in adulthood except for lower SES among Black men. Chronic users were
   more likely to have friends and partners who also used marijuana. Future
   studies should take into account pre-existing differences when examining
   outcomes of marijuana use. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Previous research suggests that adult perceptions of children's social
   competence may vary depending on the socialization goals in a given
   cultural context. There is also ample evidence of cultural differences
   in values concerning emotional display, with East Asian collectivistic
   contexts favoring restraint and Western individualistic contexts
   favoring open expression of internal states. The present study examined
   an individualistic versus collectivistic comparison in the links between
   children's emotional expressivity and teacher evaluations of their
   social competence. A sample of 127 Korean, Asian American (AA) and
   European American (EA) preschoolers participated in emotion eliciting
   tasks and were rated by their teachers on three dimensions of social
   competence (peer acceptance, prosocial behavior, and antisocial
   behavior). Moderation analyses revealed that for Korean children,
   sadness and happiness expressivity were associated with higher
   antisocial behavior scores, but these associations were reversed or not
   significant for EAs. For AA children, anger display was associated with
   lower ratings of peer acceptance and prosocial behavior, but this link
   did not hold for their EA counterparts. Overall, there was some support
   for the hypotheses that expressivity was related to lower teacher
   perceptions of child social competence for a collectivistic group (AA
   and Korean) but not for an individualistic group (EA). Thus, these
   findings indicate cultural group differences in teacher perceptions and
   values of children's emotion expressivity.

   collected from mothers' reports. Data on children's adjustment were
   collected from multiple sources including peer assessments, teacher
   ratings, self-reports, and school records. It was found that maternal
   warmth was associated with children's social and school performance, and
   that maternal encouragement of sociability was associated with
   children's psychological adjustment. Maternal behavioral control was not
   associated with children's adjustment. The results indicate that
   maternal warmth, behavioral control, and encouragement of sociability
   may serve different functions in different domains of adjustment among

AB Background: Representative data on folate and vitamin B-12 dietary
   intake and status in low-income countries are rare, despite the
   widespread adoption of folic acid fortification.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate folate and vitamin
   B-12 intake, status, and risk factors for deficiency before
   implementation of a national fortification program in Cameroon.
   Methods: A nationally representative cross-sectional cluster survey was
   conducted in 3 ecologic zones of Cameroon (South, North, and the 2
   largest cities, Yaounde/Douala), and information on dietary intake was
   collected from 10 households in each of 30 randomly selected clusters
   per zone. In a subset of women and their 12- to 59-mo-old children (n =
   396 pairs), plasma folate and vitamin B-12, as well as breast milk
   vitamin B-12, were analyzed.
   Results: Vitamin B-12 and folate dietary intake patterns and plasma
   concentrations were similar for women and children. In the subsample,
   18% and 29% of women and 8% and 30% of children were vitamin 3-12 (<=
   221 pmol/L) and folate (<10 nmol/L) deficient, respectively. Mean
   dietary folate ranged from 351 mu g dietary folate equivalents/d in the
   North to 246 mu g dietary folate equivalents/d in Yaounde/Douala; plasma
   folate was negatively associated with socioeconomic status (P = 0.001).
   Plasma vitamin 3-12 deficiency was similar in the South and North, 29%
   and 40%, respectively, but was only 11% in Yaounde/Douala, and was
   positively associated with socioeconomic status. Mean breast milk
   vitamin B-12 was statistically significantly lower in the North (101
   pmol/L) than in the South (296 pmol/L) or Yaounde/Douala (349 pmol/L).
   Conclusions: Folate intake and status are inadequate among women and
   young children in Yaounde/Douala, whereas low vitamin 3-12 intake and
   status are more common in poor and rural area, especially in the North.
   Different strategies may be needed to control deficiency of these
   nutrients in different regions of Cameroon.

AB OBJECTIVE:To examine 30-day readmission rates after vaginal and cesarean
   delivery by race-ethnicity and insurance status.METHODS:We analyzed
   hospital discharge data contained in a statewide database maintained by
   the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Discharge data for patients
   admitted for vaginal delivery without complication (n=167,857) and
   cesarean delivery without complication (n=75,552) from 2005 to 2012 were
   analyzed using marginal logistic models for clustered data with
   generalized estimating equations.RESULTS:Results from logistic models
   indicated that 30-day readmission rates per 1,000 patients were
   significantly higher among black (28.9/1,000; confidence interval [CI]
   25.5-32.7) and Hispanic women (21.4/1,000; CI 18.9-24.2) than among
   white women (12.9/1,000; CI 11.9-14.0) after cesarean delivery.
   Similarly higher rates of readmission were observed for black
   (14.6/1,000; CI 13.0-16.5) and Hispanic women (10.7/1,000; CI 9.6-12.0)
   relative to white women (7.5/1,000; CI 7.0-8.1) after vaginal delivery.
   Rates of 30-day readmission were significantly higher (odds ratio
   1.27-1.30) among those covered by Medicaid. Controlling for patient
   socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and payer did not substantially
   reduce race and ethic differences in the odds of
   readmission.CONCLUSION:Significant racial and ethnic disparities in
   readmissions were observed for procedures related to childbirth using a
   statewide database capturing all payers across all acute care hospital
   settings. Compared with white women, black women were twice as likely
   and Hispanic women 40-50% more likely to be readmitted within 30 days of

AB Warrants for continued attention to the sociological classics take
   diverse forms. This variation appears to be linked to a diversity of
   narrative interpretations of the sociological tradition. Positivist
   narratives affirm classics as building blocks for a naturalistic social
   science and as sources of material not yet incorporated into mainstream
   sociology. Pluralist narratives celebrate classics as exemplars of
   different legitimate perspectives. In synthetic narratives, classics are
   hailed for raising fundamental problems and pointing the way toward
   culminating syntheses. In humanistic narratives, classics appear as
   texts of enduring significance for their admixture of poetic insight and
   moral rumination as well as deep sociological analyses. Contextualist
   narratives view classics as expressive documents, giving voice to a
   cultural ambience or complex of collective interests. Dialogical
   narratives hail classics as parties to transnational and
   transgenerational conversations. This schema helps organize the wide
   array of interpretations of Emile Durkheim.

AB This article identifies two different patterns in how Karl Marx, in
   collaboration with Friedrich Engels, portrayed the relationship between
   the Jews and modern capitalism. The early Marx described modern economic
   life as domination by a Jewish spirit that is internalized by non-Jews
   and objectified in economic institutions. The Jews did not drop out of
   Marx's mature work, as is sometimes supposed, but there was a major
   shift in how he linked European Jewry to capitalist development. The
   mature Marx, it is argued, substituted a new narrative in which the
   Jews, after contributing to the creation of modern capitalism, were then
   superseded. In addition, the article seeks to explain these patterns: it
   argues that assumptions about the Jews originally derived from Christian
   theology but subsequently secularized and transposed to economic life
   formed part of the cultural toolkit with which Marx and other classical
   German social thinkers constructed their understanding of modern
   capitalism.

AB Purpose: Measurement of socioeconomic status (SES) is traditionally
   based on education, income, and occupation. This information may not be
   readily available from adolescents participating in research.
   Methods: Using data from school-based randomized trial of an asthma
   intervention targeting urban adolescents, we compared percent poverty in
   zip code of residence (% poverty), median housing value, and parental
   income and education, to teen responses on the Home Affluence Scale for
   Children (HASC), which included home, car, and computer ownership for
   the family and eligibility for free school lunch. The association of
   HASC with measures of asthma control was also assessed.
   Results: Of 422 adolescents, 390(92%) responded to HASC items (mean HASC
   = 2.5). HASC was associated with mother's education and household income
   (both P < .001), and significantly correlated with % poverty (P < .0001)
   and median home value (P = .003). The association of HASC < 2.0 to
   indicators of uncontrolled asthma was in the direction hypothesized,
   especially for nighttime symptoms, odds ratio (95% confidence interval)
   = 1.59 (0.95-2.66) and restricted activity, odds ratio = 1.87
   (1.12-3.12).
   Conclusions: HASC correlates well with more traditional measures of SES,
   and the risk estimates for HASC less than 2.0 and indicators of
   uncontrolled asthma were mostly in the hypothesized direction. Methods
   of obtaining SES indicators from youth are needed for research studies.

AB Empirical research has documented that contact with lesbians and gays is
   associated with more positive feelings toward and greater support for
   legal rights for them, but we know less about whether these effects
   extend to informal aspects of same-sex relationships, such as reactions
   to public displays of affection. Furthermore, many studies have assumed
   that contact influences levels of sexual prejudice; however, the
   possibility of selection effects, in which less sexually prejudiced
   people have contact, and more sexually prejudiced people do not, raises
   some doubts about this assumption. We used original data from a
   nationally representative sample of heterosexuals to determine whether
   those reporting contact with a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender
   friend or relative exhibited less sexual prejudice toward lesbian and
   gay couples than those without contact. This study examined the effect
   of contact on attitudes toward formal rights and a relatively unexplored
   dimension, informal privileges. We estimated the effect of having
   contact using traditional (ordinary least squares regression) methods
   before accounting for selection effects using propensity score matching.
   After accounting for selection effects, we found no significant
   differences between the attitudes of those who had contact and those who
   did not, for either formal or informal measures. Thus, selection effects
   appeared to play a pivotal role in confounding the link between contact
   and sexual prejudice, and future studies should exercise caution in
   interpreting results that do not account for such selection effects.

AB In the nationally representative General Social Survey, U.S. Adults (N =

   were more likely to have had sex with a casual date or pickup or an
   acquaintance, and were more accepting of most non-marital sex
   (premarital sex, teen sex, and same-sex sexual activity, but not
   extramarital sex). The percentage who believed premarital sex among
   adults was "not wrong at all" was 29 % in the early 1970s, 42 % in the

   Mixed effects (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses separating time

   the most accepting of non-marital sex. Number of sexual partners
   increased steadily between the G.I.s and 1960s-born GenX'ers and then
   dipped among Millennials to return to Boomer levels. The largest changes
   appeared among White men, with few changes among Black Americans. The

   and rejection of traditional social rules in the U.S.

AB The WHO's International Studies of Schizophrenia conclude that
   schizophrenia may have a more benign course in developing societies than
   in the West. The authors focus on this finding's most common corollary:
   cultural schemata are shaped by the transition from agrarian to
   industrial society. Developing societies are viewed as traditional,
   gemeinschaft cultures lacking the stigmatizing beliefs about persons
   with mental illness held in modern, gesellschaft cultures of developed
   societies. The Stigma in Global ContextMental Health Study formalized
   the cultural myth of public stigma (CMPS) with propositions linking
   level of development to intolerant, exclusionary, and individualistic
   attitudes. In 17 countries, the authors find no support for the
   corollary; where support is found, the findings are opposite
   expectations, with developed societies reporting lower stigma levels.
   Reconceptualizing of the cultural landscape on more specific dimensions
   also produces null or contrary findings. This correction to nostalgic
   myths of cultural context in developing societies thwarts misguided
   treatment, policy, and stigma-reduction efforts.

AB This article proposes a variational approach to describe the evolution
   of organization of complex systems from first principles, as increased
   efficiency of physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is
   the product of the energy and time necessary for motion. When complex
   systems are modeled as flow networks, this efficiency is defined as a
   decrease of action for one element to cross between two nodes, or
   endpoints of motiona principle of least unit action. We find a
   connection with another principle, that of most total action, or a
   tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase
   provides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to
   motion to decrease unit action, and therefore, to increase organization.
   Also, with the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for
   total amount of action increases. We present a model of positive
   feedback between action efficiency and the total amount of action in a
   complex system, based on a system of ordinary differential equations,
   which leads to an exponential growth with time of each and a power law
   relation between the two. We present an agreement of our model with data
   for core processing units of computers. This approach can help to
   describe, measure, manage, design, and predict future behavior of
   complex systems to achieve the highest rates of self-organization and
   robustness. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The range of hospital charges for similar diagnoses show tremendous
   variability across U.S. hospitals. This charge variability remains
   unexplained.
   We aimed to describe hospital charge variability in the U.S. and examine
   its relationship to local health factors.
   This was a descriptive study of the 2011 Medicare Inpatient Charge data
   summarizing inpatient hospital charges billed to Medicare. This data was
   evaluated using 29 county-level measures of health status, health
   behavior, clinical access and quality, built environment, and
   socioeconomic status in a clustered, multivariate linear regression.
   2871 U.S. hospitals registered with Medicare and with at least ten
   discharges for diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) of six common inpatient
   conditions.
   Inpatient hospital charges were assessed.
   No community health measures were associated with hospital charges. The
   one notable exception associated with higher charges was higher rates of
   uninsured status ($344.84 higher charges for every one-percentage point
   increase in prevalence (p < 0.001)). One variable was associated with
   lower hospital charges: the percentage of children living in poverty
   [$309.30 lower charges for every one-percentage point increase in
   prevalence (p < 0.001)].
   Overall, hospital charges lacked an association with population health
   measures, and their variability remains largely unexplained. However,
   the association of higher charges with uninsured status raises concerns
   about hospitals' price-setting strategies, such as price discrimination
   and cost-shifting strategies that expose vulnerable populations to great
   financial risks.

AB Community-based participatory research (CBPR) poses ethical challenges
   that are distinct from biomedical research. These arise from the
   epistemological differences between traditional biomedical research
   paradigms and CBPR, as the latter entails ongoing engagement of
   communities in research from development to dissemination. Biomedical
   research typically poses research questions and obtains ethics review
   before engaging with the population or community of interest. While
   institutional review board (IRB) practices seek to minimize harm in
   research conducted with human subjects, traditional IRB review can
   introduce new or exacerbate existing ethical challenges when reviewing
   non-traditional research protocols. In what follows, we seek to: define
   CBPR; identify unique ethical obligations in CBPR; pose potential
   solutions for amending the IRB process to support CBPR; and facilitate a
   research ethics framework that aims to reduce the exploitive and
   appropriational tendencies in research by inviting researchers, IRBs,
   and communities into a collaborative effort aimed at best practices.

AB The practice of community based participatory research (CBPR) has
   evolved over the past 20 years with the recognition that health equity
   is best achieved when academic researchers form collaborative
   partnerships with communities. This article theorizes the possibility
   that core principles of CBPR cannot be realistically applied unless
   unequal power relations are identified and addressed. It provides
   theoretical and empirical perspectives for understanding power,
   privilege, researcher identity and academic research team composition,
   and their effects on partnering processes and health disparity outcomes.
   The team's processes of conducting seven case studies of diverse
   partnerships in a national cross-site CBPR study are analyzed; the
   multi-disciplinary research team's self-reflections on identity and
   positionality are analyzed, privileging its combined racial, ethnic, and
   gendered life experiences, and integrating feminist and post-colonial
   theory into these reflections. Findings from the inquiry are shared, and
   incorporating academic researcher team identity is recommended as a core
   component of equalizing power distribution within CBPR.

   courses, and then we present and analyze a case study based on a
   collaborative community-based research model developed by the
   co-authors. By shifting the theoretical foundations for community-based
   research, and more specifically, grounding our work in feminist ethics
   and critical pedagogy theories, we created linked courses that weave
   both collaborative theory and practice into the fabric of the courses.
   Upon teaching these courses, we found that students responded in an
   overwhelmingly positive way to collaborative theoretical models and to
   collaborative dialogical practice in the classroom, but when it came to
   team-based work conducted with community members, student responses were
   mixed. Reactions to collaborative grading practice conducted by faculty
   members and the community partner were more unanimous: a majority of
   students expressed confusion and discomfort with this practice.
   Collaborative theory and dialogical practice, then, were uniformly
   embraced in the classroom, while team-based work and evaluation in the
   community provided more discomfort and displeasure. This finding
   reiterates the pervasiveness of individualist thinking, even when
   students have chosen courses that are expressly collaborative in both
   theory and practice.

   sociology's displacement theory to examine the newspaper's radical
   purpose, the study found that once the left came into power after
   decades of rightist and authoritarian rule, the newspaper's alternative
   mission and goals were displaced, becoming less radical and more
   propagandistic. Pro-government coverage increased and coverage of social
   movements, civil society, and other traditionally alternative' topics
   decreased. Journalists at the newspaper acknowledged the shift in goals
   and lessening of radical purpose, but clung to the newspaper's

   dramatically over the past 25 years. This study explores undocumented
   status as a social determinant of occupational health by examining its
   perceived consequences on workplace safety of Latino immigrants.
   MethodsGuided by the Theory of Work Adjustment, qualitative analysis was
   conducted on transcripts from focus groups and individual interviews
   conducted with a convenience sample of Latino immigrant workers.
   ResultsParticipants reported that unauthorized status negatively
   impacted their safety at work and resulted in a degree of alienation
   that exceeded the specific proscriptions of the law. Participants
   overwhelming used a strategy of disengagement to cope with the
   challenges they face as undocumented immigrants.
   ConclusionThis study describes the complex web of consequences resulting
   from undocumented status and its impact on occupational health. This
   study presents a framework connecting the daily work experiences of
   immigrants, the coping strategy of disengagement, and efforts to
   minimize the impact of structural violence. Am. J. Ind. Med.

AB Religion and spirituality (R/S) play an important role in the daily
   lives of many cancer patients. There has been great interest in
   determining whether R/S factors are related to clinically relevant
   health outcomes. In this meta-analytic review, the authors examined
   associations between dimensions of R/S and social health (eg, social
   roles and relationships). A systematic search of the PubMed, PsycINFO,
   Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
   Literature databases was conducted, and data were extracted by 4 pairs
   of investigators. Bivariate associations between specific R/S dimensions
   and social health outcomes were examined in a meta-analysis using a
   generalized estimating equation approach. In total, 78 independent
   samples encompassing 14,277 patients were included in the meta-analysis.
   Social health was significantly associated with overall R/S (Fisher z
   effect size=.20; P<.001) and with each of the R/S dimensions (affective
   R/S effect size=0.31 [P<.001]; cognitive R/S effect size=.10 [P<.01];
   behavioral R/S effect size=.08 [P<.05]; and other' R/S effect size=.13
   [P<.001]). Within these dimensions, specific variables tied to social
   health included spiritual well being, spiritual struggle, images of God,
   R/S beliefs, and composite R/S measures (all P values<.05). None of the
   demographic or clinical moderating variables examined were significant.
   Results suggest that several R/S dimensions are modestly associated with
   patients' capacity to maintain satisfying social roles and relationships
   in the context of cancer. Further research is needed to examine the
   temporal nature of these associations and the mechanisms that underlie
   them. Cancer 2015;121:3779-3788. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.
   In this meta-analytic review, the authors investigate associations
   between religious/spiritual dimensions and social health among patients
   with cancer. Based on data from 78 independent samples and more than
   14,000 patients, the results suggest that several religious/spiritual
   domains are related to social functioning during the course of illness.

AB Both objective and, more recently, subjective measures of low social
   status have been linked to poor health outcomes. It is unclear, however,
   through which precise physiological mechanisms such standing may
   influence health, although it has been proposed that those of lower
   status may have biomarker profiles that are more dysregulated (and hence
   pose a greater risk for poorer health). The main objective of this study
   was to investigate whether lower subjective social standing is
   associated with riskier neuroendocrine biomarker profiles. Data were
   from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), a
   nationally representative survey of Taiwanese men and women (ages 54-91)
   conducted in Taiwan in 2000. Five neuroendocrine markers (cortisol,
   dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), adrenaline, noradrenaline and
   dopamine) were analysed both separately and collectively in an index
   termed neuroendocrine allostatic load (NAL) in relation to status - both
   self-reported and as measured through objective socioeconomic status
   (SES) indicators. For the biomarker DHEAS, some connection was found
   between its levels and the measures of status, but for the other markers
   and the NAL index almost no connection was found. The overall negative
   finding of this paper would be further supported with more and different
   measures of neuroendocrine system function and a reordering of the
   subjective social status questions in the survey such that the one
   probing about status in the community (that has no prompt) was asked
   before the one probing about status in all of Taiwan (which has a SES
   prompt).

   decision-making power for women. An extensive literature documents ways
   in which broader, societal changes have facilitated roles for women
   beyond reproduction, yet there is minimal exploration at the family
   level. This study used inter-generational cohort data from the
   Philippines to examine mothers' aspirations for their children's
   education, and how these aspirations predict children's subsequent
   educational attainment. Mothers' education, household wealth and a
   locally developed measure of women's status were positively associated
   with higher educational aspirations for children; however, only mothers
   with the highest fertility were less likely to desire their children to
   attend college or higher. Mothers' fertility and aspirations both
   significantly and independently predicted children's school completion.
   Together, these findings indicate that increased opportunities for
   Filipina women beyond childbearing may not only positively benefit these

AB Background: Measures of individual socioeconomic status correlate with
   recurrent violent injury; however, neighborhood socioeconomic status may
   also matter. We conducted a review of victims of interpersonal violence
   treated at our trauma center, hypothesizing that the percent of the
   population living under the poverty level in their neighborhood is
   associated with recurrent violent victimization.
   Materials and methods: We identified victims of interpersonal violence,
   ages 12-24, in our trauma registry from 2005-2010. Recurrent episodes of
   violent injury were identified through 2012. The percentage of the
   population living under the poverty level for the patient's zip code of
   residence was derived from United States census estimates and divided
   into quartiles. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to
   evaluate predictors of violent injury recidivism.
   Results: Our cohort consisted of 1890 patients. Multivariable logistic
   regression confirmed the following factors as independent predictors of
   violent injury recidivism: male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2 [1.06-3.80]; P
   = 0.03), black race (OR = 2.1 [1.44-3.06]; P < 0.001), injury due to
   firearms (OR = 1.67 [1.12-2.50]; P = 0.01), and living in the lowest zip
   code socioeconomic quartile (OR = 1.59 [1.12-2.25]; P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: For young patients injured by violence, the socioeconomic
   position of their neighborhood of residence is independently correlated
   with their risk of violent reinjury. Low neighborhood socioeconomic
   status may be associated with a disrupted sense of safety after injury
   and also may alter a person's likelihood of engaging in behaviors
   correlated with recurrent violent injury. Programs aimed at reducing
   violent injury recidivism should address needs at the individual and
   neighborhood level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND:Few studies have examined the general correlation between
   socioeconomic status and imaging. This study is the first to analyze
   this relationship in the spine patient population.OBJECTIVE:To assess
   the effect of socioeconomic status on the frequency with which imaging
   studies of the lumbar spine are ordered and completed.METHODS:Patients
   that were diagnosed with lumbar radiculopathy and/or myelopathy and had
   at least 1 subsequent lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed
   tomography (CT), or X-ray ordered were retrospectively identified.
   Demographic information and the number of ordered and completed imaging
   studies were among the data collected. Patient insurance status and
   income level (estimated based on zip code) served as representations of
   socioeconomic status.RESULTS:A total of 24105 patients met the inclusion
   criteria for this study. Regression analyses demonstrated that uninsured
   patients were significantly less likely to have an MRI, CT, or X-ray
   study ordered (P < .001 for all modalities) and completed (P < .001 for
   MRI and X-ray, P = .03 for CT). Patients with lower income had higher
   rates of MRI, CT, and X-ray (P < .001 for all) imaging ordered but were
   less likely to have an ordered X-ray be completed (P = .009). There was
   no significant difference in the completion rate of ordered MRIs or
   CTs.CONCLUSION:Disparities in image utilization based on socioeconomic
   characteristics such as insurance status and income level highlight a
   critical gap in access to health care. Physicians should work to
   mitigate the influence of such factors when deciding whether to order
   imaging studies, especially in light of the ongoing shift in health
   policy in the United States.ABBREVIATION:SES, socioeconomic status

   (76.9%), black (14.7%), or Asian (8.4%). Multivariate logistic

   regression was performed to evaluate the effect of these factors on
   survival.
   Results. The proportion of black patients with HCC increased in the
   United States during the 13-year period. There were no substantial
   differences among races in tumor size, grade, or overall clinical stage
   at the time of presentation; however, black patients were less likely to
   have surgery (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.72). Of
   patients who had surgery, there were no significant differences in
   pathologic stage, margin negative resection rate, or 30-day mortality;
   however, black patients had the longest interval between diagnosis and
   surgery, as well as the worst overall adjusted survival (hazard ratio
   1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.25). These findings were
   independent of HCC stage, insurance provider, and socioeconomic status.
   Conclusion. Despite similar clinical presentation of HCC, substantial
   racial differences exist with regard to management and outcomes. Black
   patients are less likely to receive surgery for HCC and have worse
   long-term survival, despite similar perioperative quality metrics. This
   difference in long-term survival may highlight neighborhood, cultural,
   or biological differences between races.

   Here the state played a familiar role where waiting is used to dominate
   or subordinate or further marginalize the poor. Residents of the Lower
   Ninth Ward, however, used waiting as a basis for interacting with other
   community members and as a way to structure social life. In doing so,
   they created a timescape of hyper-marginalization where waiting became
   normative. In examining this timescape, I conduct a tempography of the

   named Peer Network Counseling that integrates motivational interviewing
   and peer network strategies with 119 urban adolescents who reported
   occasional or problem substance use. Adolescents presenting at primary
   care clinic were randomized to intervention or control conditions and
   followed for 6 months. Mixed-effect latent growth models were used to
   evaluate intervention effects on trajectories of alcohol and marijuana
   use, offers to use substances, and moderation models to test for
   interactions between intervention condition and peer network
   characteristics. A significant intervention effect was found for boys
   for offers to use alcohol from friends (p < .05), along with a trend
   significant effect for alcohol use (p < .08). Intervention was more
   effective in reducing marijuana use, vs. control, for participants with
   more peer social support (p < .001) and with more peer encouragement for
   prosocial behavior (school, clubs, sports, religious activities);
   however, intervention did not affect these network characteristics.
   Results provide support to continue this line of research to test brief
   interventions that activate protective peer network characteristics
   among at-risk adolescents, while also raising some interesting
   gender-based intervention questions for future research. (C) 2015

AB Objective. This study examined socioeconomic disparities in adolescent
   substance use utilizing a behavioral economic theoretical framework. We
   tested the hypothesis that teens of lower (vs. higher) socioeconomic
   status (SES) are vulnerable to substance use because they engage in
   fewer pleasurable substance-free activities that provide reinforcement
   and may deter substance use.
   Method. In a cross-sectional correlational design, 9th grade students (N
   = 2839; mean age = 14.1 years) in Los Angeles, California, USA completed
   surveys in Fall 2013 measuring SES (i.e., parental education),
   alternative reinforcement (engagement in pleasurable substance-free
   activities, e.g., hobbies), substance use susceptibility, initiation,
   and frequency, and other factors.
   Results. For multi-substance composite outcomes, lower parental
   education was associated with greater likelihood of substance use
   initiation in the overall sample, frequency of use among lifetime
   substance users, and susceptibility to substance use in never users.
   Substance-specific analyses revealed that lower parental education was
   associated with higher likelihood of initiating cigarettes, alcohol, and
   marijuana use as well as greater susceptibility to use cigarettes in
   never smokers. Each inverse association between parental education and
   substance-related outcomes was statistically mediated by diminished
   alternative reinforcement; lower parental education was associated with
   lower engagement in alternative reinforcers, which, in turn, was
   associated with greater substance use susceptibility, initiation, and
   frequency.
   Conclusion. These results point to a behavioral economic interpretation
   for socioeconomic disparities in adolescent substance use. Replication
   and extension of these findings would suggest that prevention programs
   that increase access to and engagement in healthy and fun activities may
   reduce youth socioeconomic health disparities related to substance use.

   sound disorder may persist into adulthood and span multiple domains of
   activity limitations and/or participation restrictions, as defined by
   the World Health Organization's International Classification of
   Functioning, Disability and Health model. However, the nature and extent
   of these influences varies widely across children. This study aimed to
   expand the evidence base on the social; emotional, and academic impact
   of residual speech errors by collecting survey data from parents of
   children receiving treatment for /r/ misarticulation. By examining the
   relationship between an overall measure of impact (weighted summed
   score) and responses to 11 survey items, the present study offers
   preliminary suggestions for factors that could be considered when making
   decisions pertaining to treatment allocation in this population.

   regarding their experiences of queerness and maleness. As the narrators
   chart their journeys toward identifying as queer, they recount
   incongruity between and within identities, which the author argues
   creates queer consciousness. Intersectional and reflexive queer
   consciousness is demonstrated in narratives that recount how critically
   evaluating identities led the narrators to contest elements of misogyny,
   effemimania, hypermasculinity, and other discourses and practices that
   have implications for our bodies. Espousing a queer identification opens
   up new discursive and material spaces for queer men to critically
   explore our bodies, while remaining cognizant of and reflexive about the
   messy and contradictory aspects of queerness.

AB Many people are guided by religious beliefs, but judgments of
   religiously and secularly motivated individuals remain unclear. We
   investigated reasoning about religiously versus secularly motivated
   characters among 5- to 10-year-olds and adults. In Study 1, theist and
   non-theist children reported similar attitudes toward theists; however,
   large differences emerged between theist and non-theist adults. Study 2
   obtained similar results using a continuous, rather than forced choice,
   measure of preference. Additionally, Studies 2-3 tested two explanations
   for the stronger influence of religious background on adults' versus
   children's responses. Study 2 did not find strong evidence for the
   theistic majority account, which posits that the greater perceived
   prevalence of theists as compared with non-theists influenced children's
   responses more than adults' responses. The results of Study 3 were
   consistent with the intuition account, which argues that non-theist
   adults had effortfully overridden the teleological intuitions that may
   have influenced children's responses in Studies 1-2 and potentially led
   children to prefer characters whose beliefs were in line with children's
   own intuitions. The degree to which teleological intuitions persisted
   implicitly among adults predicted those adults' pro-theist preferences.
   These findings offer connections between religious judgments and other
   areas of social cognition, such as social preferences and teleology. (C)

AB Introduction: American Indian (AI) adolescents have the highest
   prevalence of commercial tobacco use of any ethnic group in the United
   States. This study examines ethnic identity (El), participation in
   cultural activities, and stressful life events (SLEs) as correlates of
   smoking and examines historical trauma (HT) as a mediator of these
   associations.
   Methods: California AI youth (N = 969, ages 13-19, recruited from 49
   tribal youth organizations and cultural activities in urban and
   reservation areas in California) completed a tobacco survey. Structural
   equation modeling was used to test a model examining HT as a potential
   mediator of the associations of El, participation in cultural
   activities, and SLEs with cigarette smoking.
   Results: Model fit was adequate. El, participation in cultural
   activities, and SLEs predicted HT. HT mediated the associations of
   participation in cultural activities and SLEs with past-month smoking.
   Stronger El predicted greater past-month smoking and this effect was
   mediated by greater HT. The direct effects from HT to both smoking
   outcomes were positive and the direct effect from El to past-month
   smoking was negative.
   Conclusions: HT is a risk factor for cigarette smoking both directly and
   in mediating the links of El, cultural activities, and SLEs. More
   efforts are needed to help AI youth to process these thoughts and
   empower themselves to contribute to their own lives and those of their
   families and communities without resorting to unhealthy addictive
   behaviors such as commercial tobacco use. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The use of shared infrastructure to direct natural processes for the
   benefit of humans has been a central feature of human social
   organization for millennia. Today, more than ever, people interact with
   one another and the environment through shared human-made infrastructure
   (the Internet, transportation, the energy grid, etc.). However, there
   has been relatively little work on how the design characteristics of
   shared infrastructure affect the dynamics of social-ecological systems
   (SESs) and the capacity of groups to solve social dilemmas associated
   with its provision. Developing such understanding is especially
   important in the context of global change where design criteria must
   consider how specific aspects of infrastructure affect the capacity of
   SESs to maintain vital functions in the face of shocks. Using
   small-scale irrigated agriculture (the most ancient and ubiquitous
   example of public infrastructure systems) as a model system, we show
   that two design features related to scale and the structure of benefit
   flows can induce fundamental changes in qualitative behavior, i.e.,
   regime shifts. By relating the required maintenance threshold (a design
   feature related to infrastructure scale) to the incentives facing users
   under different regimes, our work also provides some general guidance on
   determinants of robustness of SESs under globalization-related stresses.

AB How does lacking vs. possessing power in a social exchange affect
   people's trust in their exchange partner? An answer to this question has
   broad implications for a number of exchange settings in which dependence
   plays an important role. Here, we report on a series of experiments in
   which we manipulated participants' power position in terms of structural
   dependence and observed their trust perceptions and behaviors. Over a
   variety of different experimental paradigms and measures, we find that
   more powerful actors place less trust in others than less powerful
   actors do. Our results contradict predictions by rational actor models,
   which assume that low-power individuals are able to anticipate that a
   more powerful exchange partner will place little value on the
   relationship with them, thus tends to behave opportunistically, and
   consequently cannot be trusted. Conversely, our results support
   predictions by motivated cognition theory, which posits that low-power
   individuals want their exchange partner to be trustworthy and then act
   according to that desire. Mediation analyses show that, consistent with
   the motivated cognition account, having low power increases individuals'
   hope and, in turn, their perceptions of their exchange partners'
   benevolence, which ultimately leads them to trust.

AB BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women are known to have poorer breast
   cancer survival than whites, and the differences may be related to
   underlying disparities in their clinical presentation or access to care.
   This study evaluated the relationship between demographic, treatment,
   and socioeconomic factors and breast cancer survival among women in
   southeast Michigan. METHODS: The population included 2387 women (34% AA)
   with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III breast cancer who
   were treated at the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) from 1996 through
   2005. Linked data sets from the HFHS, the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer
   Surveillance System, and the US Census Bureau were used to obtain
   demographic and clinical information. Comorbidities were classified with
   the modified Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Economic deprivation was
   categorized with a census tract-based deprivation index (DI), which was
   stratified into 5 quintiles of increasing socioeconomic disadvantage.
   RESULTS: Compared with whites, AA women were significantly more likely
   to have larger, hormone receptor-negative tumors and more comorbidities
   and to reside in an economically deprived area. In an unadjusted
   analysis, AAs had a significantly higher risk of death (hazard ratio
   [HR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.59); however, after
   adjustments for clinical (age, stage, hormone receptor, and CCI) and
   societal factors (DI), the effect of race was not significant (HR, 1.13
   [95% CI, 0.96-1.34], and HR, 0.97 [0.80-1.19] respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in breast cancer survival can be
   explained by clinical and socioeconomic factors. Nonetheless, AA women
   with breast cancer remain disproportionately affected by unfavorable
   tumor characteristics and economic deprivation, which likely contribute
   to their increased overall mortality. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

AB Women are underrepresented in most high-level positions in
   organizations. Though a great deal of research has provided evidence
   that bias and discrimination give rise to and perpetuate this gender
   disparity, in the current research we explore another explanation: men
   and women view professional advancement differently, and their views
   affect their decisions to climb the corporate ladder (or not). In
   studies 1 and 2, when asked to list their core goals in life, women
   listed more life goals overall than men, and a smaller proportion of
   their goals related to achieving power at work. In studies 3 and 4,
   compared to men, women viewed high-level positions as less desirable yet
   equally attainable. In studies 57, when faced with the possibility of
   receiving a promotion at their current place of employment or obtaining
   a high-power position after graduating from college, women and men
   anticipated similar levels of positive outcomes (e.g., prestige and
   money), but women anticipated more negative outcomes (e.g., conflict and
   tradeoffs). In these studies, women associated high-level positions with
   conflict, which explained the relationship between gender and the
   desirability of professional advancement. Finally, in studies 8 and 9,
   men and women alike rated power as one of the main consequences of
   professional advancement. Our findings reveal that men and women have
   different perceptions of what the experience of holding a high-level
   position will be like, with meaningful implications for the perpetuation
   of the gender disparity that exists at the top of organizational
   hierarchies.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), used in food packaging and
   stain-resistant coatings, are suspected developmental toxicants that are
   ubiquitous and persistent in the environment. We measured plasma PFAS
   concentrations during early pregnancy (median = 9.7 weeks gestation)
   among 1645 women in the Boston-area Project Viva cohort, recruited
   during 1999-2002. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate
   associations of sociodemographic and perinatal predictors, including
   measures of pregnancy physiology (albumin, glomerular filtration rate
   (GFR)), with log-transformed plasma PFAS concentrations. Geometric mean
   concentrations for the four main PFASs, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS),
   perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and
   perfluorononanoate (PFNA) were 25.4, 5.7, 2.5, and 0.6 ng/mL,
   respectively, comparable with general U.S. population concentrations
   during those years. Higher early pregnancy PFAS concentrations were
   associated with younger age (except PFNA), less educational attainment,
   nulliparity, no history of breastfeeding and higher prepregnancy body
   mass index in adjusted models. In addition, lower GFR was associated
   with 3-4% higher PFAS concentrations and higher albumin was associated
   with 4-6% higher PFAS concentrations. Our results show associations
   consistent (parity and breastfeeding) and less consistent (age and
   education) with previous studies. We also report associations with GFR
   and albumin, which were strongly related to PFAS concentrations and thus
   could confound estimates of PFAS-outcome associations in epidemiologic
   studies.

AB Background Previous studies have been unable to disentangle the negative
   associations of black race and low socioeconomic status (SES) with
   long-term outcomes of patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Such information could assist in efforts to address both racial and
   socioeconomic disparities.
   Methods and Results We used data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular
   Project, a prospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries
   hospitalized with AMI with 17 years of follow-up, to evaluate the
   relationship between race, area-level SES (measured by zip code-level
   median household income), and life expectancy after AMI. Life expectancy
   was estimated by using Cox proportional hazards regression with
   extrapolation using exponential models. Of the 141 095 patients with
   AMI, 6.3% were black and 6.8% resided in low-SES areas; 26% of black
   patients lived in low-SES areas in comparison with 5.7% of white
   patients. Post-myocardial infarction life expectancy estimates were
   shorter for black patients than for white patients across all
   socioeconomic levels in patients 75 years of age. After adjustment for
   patient and treatment characteristics, the association between race and
   life expectancy persisted but was attenuated. Younger black patients
   (<68 years) had shorter life expectancies than white patients, whereas
   older black patients had longer life expectancies. The largest
   white-black gap in life expectancy occurred in patients residing in
   high- and medium-SES areas (P=0.02 interaction).
   Conclusions Black and white patients residing in low-SES areas have
   similar life expectancies after AMI, which are lower than those living
   in higher-SES areas. Racial disparities were most prominent among
   patients living in high-SES areas.

AB Poor social support and mental health may be important modifiable risk
   factors for HIV acquisition, but they have not been evaluated prior to
   HIV testing in South Africa. We sought to describe self-perceived mental
   health and social support and to characterize their independent
   correlates among adults who presented for voluntary HIV testing in
   Durban. We conducted a large cross-sectional study of adults (18 years
   of age) who presented for HIV counseling and testing between August 2010
   and January 2013 in Durban, South Africa. We enrolled adults presenting
   for HIV testing and used the Medical Outcomes Study's Social Support
   Scale (0 [poor] to 100 [excellent]) and the Mental Health Inventory
   (MHI-3) to assess social support and mental health. We conducted
   independent univariate and multivariable linear regression models to
   determine the correlates of lower self-reported Social Support Index and
   lower self-reported MCH scores. Among 4874 adults surveyed prior to HIV
   testing, 1887 (39%) tested HIV-positive. HIV-infected participants
   reported less social support (mean score 66 +/- 22) and worse mental
   health (mean score 66 +/- 16), compared to HIV-negative participants (74
   +/- 21; 70 +/- 18; p < 0.0001). In a multivariable analysis, significant
   correlates of less social support included presenting for HIV testing at
   an urban hospital, not having been tested previously, not working
   outside the home, and being HIV-infected. In a separate multivariable
   analysis, significant correlates of poor mental health were similar, but
   also included HIV testing at an urban hospital and being in an intimate
   relationship less than six months. In this study, HIV-infected adults
   reported poorer social support and worse mental health than HIV-negative
   individuals. These findings suggest that interventions to improve poor
   social support and mental health should be focused on adults who do not
   work outside the home and those with no previous HIV testing.

   the cooperative and selective nature of language and something of its
   contributions to the structural, social, and developmental character of
   human action and cognition. In doing so, it introduces 3 other articles
   that form a special section of this issue that is a continuation of an
   earlier special issue (Fowler & Hodges, 2015). The evidence reviewed
   here points to the possibility that the integrated, synergistic,
   cooperative character of language may prove to be a particular strength
   of ecological approaches to cognition and action rather than a

   address diversity and cultural competence at a new medical school was
   undertaken by a multidisciplinary team of librarians, faculty, staff,
   and medical students. From 2011 to 2015, the team sponsored a voluntary
   programming series to promote cultural competence and raise awareness of
   health care disparities for the medical school. Thirteen events were
   hosted with 562 participants across all. This approach to diversity
   proved effective and could be adapted in any higher education setting.

AB Background: Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors are
   disproportionally concentrated among the socioeconomically disadvantaged
   in high-income countries; however, this relationship is not
   well-understood or documented in resource-limited countries.
   Methods: We analysed data from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and
   Health Survey to estimate age-, sex- and location-adjusted differences
   in blood pressure and blood glucose outcomes by categories of a
   standardized wealth index and education levels. Body mass index (BMI)
   was examined as a secondary outcome and also assessed as a potential
   confounder.
   Results: There was strong evidence that the prevalence of hypertension
   was higher among Bangladeshi women than among men (33.6% vs 19.6%, P <
   0.001), whereas the overall prevalence of hyperglycaemia was 7.1% with
   no evidence of sex differences. The likelihood of having hypertension
   was more than double for individuals in the highest vs lowest wealth
   quintile [odds ratio (OR) for men: 2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI):
   2.32-3.44; OR for women: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.90-2.67], and for individuals
   with the highest level of education attained vs those with no education
   (OR for men: 2.55, 95% CI: 2.06-3.16; OR for women: 1.42, 95% CI:
   0.99-2.03). Likewise, the likelihood of having hyperglycaemia was more
   than four times higher in the wealthiest compared with the poorest
   individuals (OR for men: 6.48, 95% CI: 5.11-8.22; OR for women: 4.77,
   95% CI: 3.72-6.12), and in individuals with the highest level of
   education attained vs those with no education (OR for men: 4.68, 95% CI:
   3.56-6.15; OR for women: 5.02, 95% CI: 3.30-7.64). There were no
   appreciable differences in these trends when stratified by geographical
   location. BMI did not attenuate these associations and exhibited
   similarly positive associations with education and wealth.
   Conclusions: Increasing levels of wealth and educational attainment were
   associated with an increased likelihood of having hypertension and
   hyperglycaemia in Bangladesh.

AB This paper presents a parsimonious model of social construction that can
   be extended and applied by researchers interested in unpacking how
   culture emerges from individual meaning-making. Using a review of
   contemporary cognition research, it first hones in on the mental
   representation processes which drive individual sense-making in social
   situations. It then uses agent-based modeling (ABM), a modern simulation
   tool used to theorize how emergent phenomena arise from individual
   behaviors, to systematically demonstrate how this cognitive mechanism
   generates macro-level dynamics. Specifically, it shows how mental
   representation processes can account for cultural emergence and
   subgrouping, cultural path dependency and lock-in, endogenous cultural
   change, and the manifestation of these collective dynamics as variations
   in individuals' experiences of culture. The final part of the paper
   discusses a few initial implications of this work including the expanded
   use of ABM in cultural theory, testing and verification of this
   theoretical work using Implicit Association Testing (IAT) and
   large-scale quantitative analyses, and this model's significance for
   existing qualitative approaches to the study of culture. (C) 2015

   and personal interviews, we developed a socio-demographic profile of

   with outdoor recreation and tourism in the region. We then developed a
   historical model to outline discrete stages of outdoor recreation and
   tourism development in the Valley. We identified critical issues, such
   as the lack of coordination and level of conflict, then formulated
   sustainable development options for the Valley and its environs. Two
   specific strategies towards sustainable development include (1) the
   creation of a Canaan Valley Coordinating Council and (2) the County's
   active participation in regional heritage- and nature-based tourism
   initiatives. Tourism development should be part of a broad economic
   diversification strategy, not just a replacement for a traditional
   boom-and-bust, resource-based economy.

AB Focusing on two ethnographic vignettes, I draw attention to the lives of
   Iraqis in poverty as not merely caught in the forms and structures of
   tribal obligations and sectarianism and the violence and destruction of
   terror but also in the "rough ground" of mundane affairs and encounters.
   I argue that in the overlappings and relations of lives and
   intentionalities resides an intercorporeal ethics of the rough ground of
   the everyday. An ethics of the rough ground of the everyday is one
   understood in terms of the ways in which life is not only open to the
   pain, suffering, joy, and ennui of others but also how in the
   entanglements and relations of lives with other lives in the everyday,
   lines of care and concern emerge, are fostered, and are also frayed.
   Such relations, I suggest, form the background of different forms of
   sociality and politics much ignored in the social and political
   sciences.

AB How do we explore the relationship between the urban poor and
   large-scale revolutions? What kind of politics do they espouse in such
   extraordinary times? In this article I narrate the story of the poor
   people's struggles for sustenance and citizenship during and after the
   Arab uprisings, focusing on Egypt and Tunisia. I suggest that while the
   abject poor and rural migrants avoid direct involvement in large-scale
   uprisings, the nature of which they do not comprehend, the "middle-class
   poor," a product of the neoliberal restructuring, tend to engage in and
   lead others to these broader revolts. But most take advantage of the
   collapse of state control to extend their everyday struggles to secure
   life chances in their immediate environs-neighborhoods and work sites.
   This is also a time when they engage in extraordinary mobilization and
   organized protests to demand collective consumption and recognition as
   legitimate citizens of the city. Yet in the aftermath of the
   revolutions, when the new elites show their inability or unwillingness
   to respond to the rising demands, the subaltern retreat to their
   strategy of "quiet encroachment," but with new capability and clout.

AB In June 2013, a series of large demonstrations throughout Brazil started
   to shake its main cities and political landscape. In this article I
   juxtapose these protests, the social movements of the 1970s and 1980s
   that brought the poor peripheries of Sao Paulo to the center of the
   political scene, and the cultural production coming from these
   peripheries after the 1990s. This juxtaposition creates a perspective
   from which to look at the changes that have transformed cities,
   citizens, and the polity in Brazil during the last decades. One of my
   main arguments is that in Sao Paulo, as in many other metropolises
   shaped by peripheral urbanization, political agency is inseparable from
   the spatial configuration of the city and from its shifting patterns of
   spatial segregation and social inequality. I focus on the peripheries
   and argue that the quality of both poverty, the urban environment, and
   citizens' engagement have changed a great deal from the 1970s to the
   present. Poverty has different signifiers in a city of better
   infrastructure, mass communication, democracy, less violence, and
   broader access to consumption. Difficulty in moving around the city is
   one of these signifiers. Moreover, politics has other languages and
   tools in the context of intensified cultural production and circulation
   and of a democracy people can take for granted.

AB Nonstate providers are often more important in the everyday lives of the
   poor than outposts of the state. In this essay, I focus on one type of
   provider, sectarian organizations, which are an integral component of
   politics and welfare regimes in parts of the Middle East and other
   developing regions. Focusing on Lebanon, I describe how sectarian
   welfare providers emerge from and help to constitute political
   sectarianism while tracing what is at stake for the poor. First, by
   holding public offices and dominating informal channels that mediate
   access to public benefits, these actors mediate the experience of
   accessing the "rights" of citizenship. Second, while they provide
   benefits and services that might not otherwise be available, the modes
   of allocating welfare by sectarian parties can be discriminatory,
   notably along partisan and religious lines. Third, sectarian groups
   politicize the process of accessing social benefits while undercutting
   the political voice of the poor by weakening alternative channels of
   claim making. Finally, the crosscutting effects of sectarian
   organizations in welfare regimes suggest additional challenges to
   boosting local participation in development policy: while they are
   deeply embedded in the communities they serve, they produce and
   reinforce social inequalities.

AB Based on survey research and ethnographic interviews, we analyze
   struggles over housing and access to infrastructure in two low-income
   "unplanned settlements" in the National Capital Region of Delhi, India.
   We argue that political leadership in these two different areas cannot
   be regarded as a simple extension of traditional forms of authority from
   the village to the city. Rather, the local leaders emerge in the process
   of learning how to engage institutional processes of law and bureaucracy
   in an urban context to secure housing and infrastructure. The enfolding
   of structures of governance with democratic politics in these
   neighborhoods reveals the overlapping movements of law, bureaucracy,
   markets, and democratic mobilization through which social life is made
   durable for the urban poor. Instead of asking what democracy has done
   for the poor in India, we shift the focus to ask, How does the work that
   the poor perform through and with these institutions give form and
   substance to democracy in India?

AB Based on longitudinal ethnographic work, the authors of this special
   issue on the politics of the urban poor examine how regional events as
   well as scholarly traditions in these places have influenced the way the
   categories of the urban poor and of politics have emerged in both
   scholarly and public discourse. As the discussions that follow make
   clear, the relation between urban processes and city forms is a volatile
   one, and this volatility in turn has a decisive effect on how the poor
   emerge as political actors. Further, liberal forms of citizenship are
   but one form among others that become materialized through the claims

AB This study of La Salada, renamed by Cuartel's residents as the "poor
   people's shopping mall," was founded in the early 1990s, at the height
   of neoliberalism, by several dozen undocumented Bolivian immigrants and
   Argentine street hawkers in Cuartel, a pauperized, stigmatized, and
   disenfranchised district near the city of Buenos Aires. By the early
   2000s, La Salada occupied a central place in public life in Cuartel and
   beyond and was described by the European Union as "emblematic of
   counterfeit markets" and among the 10 worst of its kind. In studying
   this market and the network of satellite "Saladitas" that have
   proliferated in hundreds of neighborhoods across the country, my aim is
   to analyze the way the "structural poor" and the recently impoverished
   middle class-in the course of practicing noninstitutional politics,
   socioeconomic informality, and a-legality-transformed themselves into
   plebeian citizens. These practices have contributed to the emergence of
   a new form of life: plebeian democracy. In order to make sense of it, I
   have highlighted the ordinary ethics that accompanied these practices.
   In dialogue with James Holston's study of "insurgent citizenship," my
   study of plebeian citizenship provides an alternative account of the
   development of democratic life across the global south.

AB In this paper I explore the attempt to organize in order to secure
   permanent housing among poor urban families in Buenos Aires who reside
   temporarily in government-subsidized welfare hotels. My aim is to
   examine the passage that appears to take place between the ever-present
   tropes of "need" (and being assisted) and of "patience" (and being an
   activist in an autonomous and project-oriented movement) in the
   families' experience of time as they embark collectively in this
   endeavor. I argue that as activists strive to move away from the subject
   position of asistido into which social programs seem to place them, they
   assume a political engagement that requires "patience," a kind of work
   necessary for overriding the feeling of urgency often connected with a
   condition of need.

AB While the fields of the sociology of time and the sociology of emotion
   have grown exponentially, missing from the literature is explicit
   theorizing on the intersections of emotion and time. In this review
   article, we begin by examining literature that explores both how time
   (e.g. temporal control, perceived amount) influences emotional responses
   and how emotions (e.g. emotional intensity, valence) impact perceptions
   of time. Although such research occurs in a variety of disciplines, much
   of it fails to look at individuals' active manipulation of time and
   emotion to produce desired experiences. After discussing the established
   concepts of emotion work (Hochschild 1979) and time work (Flaherty
   2003), we illustrate how two newer concepts-"temporal emotion work"
   (Lois 2010, 2012) and "emoting time" (Mullaney and Shope 2012) - serve
   as starting points for thinking about how individuals actively use time
   in emotion work and emotions in time work. Although much of the thinking
   to date occurs within the scholarly literature on work and family, we
   call for more intentional and systematic theorizing about the
   relationship between time and emotion.

AB Environmental sociology is premised on the inseparability of humans and
   nature and involves an analytical focus on the place of power and social
   inequality in shaping human/nonhuman interactions. Our purpose here is
   to conduct a broad overview of the place of gender in environmental
   sociology. We review gender-relevant scholarship within environmental
   sociology and argue that to date, critical gender theorizing in the
   sub-discipline is relatively undeveloped, as evidenced by theory that
   examines gender without considering power relations. We argue that this
   represents a shortcoming that should be addressed by future scholarship.
   In order to inform future critical gender-environment theorizing, we
   provide a brief review of ecofeminism and note promising examples of
   scholarship that takes power and inequality seriously when accounting
   for phenomena of relevance to women and the environment. It is likely
   that theorizing at the intersection of gender and the environment will
   become more prevalent given a growing consensus that social justice and
   equity are precursors to ecological sustainability; environmental
   sociologists could be the vanguard of critical gender-environment
   theory.

AB Numerous studies have linked air pollution with adverse birth outcomes,
   but relatively few have examined differential associations across the
   socioeconomic gradient. To evaluate interaction effects of gestational
   nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and area-level socioeconomic deprivation on fetal
   growth, we used: (1) highly spatially-resolved air pollution data from
   the New York City Community Air Survey (NYCCAS); and (2)
   spatially-stratified principle component analysis of census variables
   previously associated with birth outcomes to define area-level
   deprivation. New York City (NYC) hospital birth records for years
   2008-2010 were restricted to full-term, singleton births to non-smoking
   mothers (n=243,853). We used generalized additive mixed models to
   examine the potentially non-linear interaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
   and deprivation categories on birth weight (and estimated linear
   associations, for comparison), adjusting for individual-level
   socio-demographic characteristics and sensitivity testing adjustment for
   co-pollutant exposures. Estimated NO2 exposures were highest, and most
   varying, among mothers residing in the most-affluent census tracts, and
   lowest among mothers residing in mid-range deprivation tracts. In
   non-linear models, we found an inverse association between NO2 and birth
   weight in the least-deprived and most-deprived areas (p-values < 0.001
   and 0.05, respectively) but no association in the mid-range of
   deprivation (p = 0.8). Likewise, in linear models, a 10 ppb increase in
   NO2 was associated with a decrease in birth weight among mothers in the
   least-deprived and most-deprived areas of -16.2 g(95% CI: -21.9 to
   -10.5) and -11.0 g(95% CI: -22.8 to 0.9), respectively, and a
   non-significant change in the mid-range areas [beta=0.5 g (95% CI: -7.7
   to -8.7)]. Linear slopes in the most- and least-deprived quartiles
   differed from the mid-range (reference group) (p-values <0.001 and 0.09,
   respectively). The complex patterning in air pollution exposure and
   deprivation in NYC, however, precludes simple interpretation of
   interactive effects on birth weight, and highlights the importance of
   considering differential distributions of air pollution concentrations,
   and potential differences in susceptibility, across deprivation levels.

AB Background: Features of neighborhoods associated with walkability (i.e.,
   connectivity, accessibility, and density) may also be correlated with
   levels of ambient air pollution, which would attenuate the health
   benefits of walkability.
   Objectives: We examined the relationship between neighborhood
   walkability and ambient air pollution in a cross-sectional analysis of a
   cohort study spanning the entire United States using residence-level
   exposure assessment for ambient air pollution and the built environment.
   Methods: Using data from the Nurses' Health Study, we used linear
   regression to estimate the association between a neighborhood
   walkability index, combining neighborhood intersection count, business
   count, and population density (defined from Census data, infoUSA
   business data, and StreetMap USA data), and air pollution, defined from
   a GIS-based spatiotemporal PM2.5 model.
   Results: After adjustment for Census tract median income, median home
   value, and percent with no high school education, the highest tertile of
   walkability index, intersection count, business count, and population
   density was associated with a with 1.58 (95% CI 1.54, 1.62), 1.20 (95%
   CI 1.16, 1.24), 1.31 (95% CI 1.27, 135), and 1.84 (95% CI 1.80, 1.88) mu
   g/m(3) higher level of PM2.5 respectively, compared to the lowest
   tertile. Results varied somewhat by neighborhood socioeconomic status
   and greatly by region.
   Conclusions: This nationwide analysis showed a positive relationship
   between neighborhood walkability and modeled air pollution levels, which
   were consistent after adjustment for neighborhood-level socioeconomic
   status. Regional differences in the air pollution-walkability
   relationship demonstrate that there are factors that vary from region to
   region that allow for walkable neighborhoods with low levels of air
   pollution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper advances the debate regarding the social relations of
   prehistoric islanders beyond the dichotomy of isolation vs connectivity
   by proposing a general and cross-cultural model of adaptive behavioral
   responses to stochastically-forced demographic fragility. I show that
   smaller populations-more likely earlier in the settlement histories of
   islands-are more exposed to localized extinction via stochastic
   processes. To alleviate this greater degree of exposure, maintaining
   social links that allow for genetic flow between otherwise isolated
   populations should increase overall fitness. Conversely, as discrete
   populations expand, the imperative for access to a widely distributed
   metapopulation, and hence the need to maintain these links, should
   decrease. This is illustrated via simple network analysis. Potential
   venues for testing this general model are outlined; wider implications
   for the archaeology of colonization, and for spatial modeling of social
   interaction, are briefly discussed.

AB Difficulty processing social information is a defining feature of autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet the failure of children with ASD to process
   social information effectively is poorly understood. Using Crick and
   Dodge's model of social information processing (SIP), this study
   examined the relationship between social-emotional (SE) skills of
   pragmatic language, theory of mind, and emotion recognition on the one
   hand, and early stage SIP skills of problem identification and goal
   generation on the other. The study included a sample of school-aged
   children with and without ASD. SIP was assessed using hypothetical
   social situations in the context of a semistructured scenario-based
   interview. Pragmatic language, theory of mind, and emotion recognition
   were measured using direct assessments. Social thinking differences
   between children with and without ASD are largely differences of
   quantity (overall lower performance in ASD), not discrepancies in
   cognitive processing patterns. These data support theoretical models of
   the relationship between SE skills and SIP. Findings have implications
   for understanding the mechanisms giving rise to SIP deficits in ASD and
   may ultimately inform treatment development for children with ASD. (c)

AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by social impairments
   that have been related to deficits in social attention, including
   diminished gaze to faces. Eye-tracking studies are commonly used to
   examine social attention and social motivation in ASD, but they vary in
   sensitivity. In this study, we hypothesized that the ecological nature
   of the social stimuli would affect participants' social attention, with
   gaze behavior during more naturalistic scenes being most predictive of
   ASD vs. typical development. Eighty-one children with and without ASD
   participated in three eye-tracking tasks that differed in the ecological
   relevance of the social stimuli. In the Static Visual Exploration task,
   static images of objects and people were presented; in the Dynamic
   Visual Exploration task, video clips of individual faces and objects
   were presented side-by-side; in the Interactive Visual Exploration task,
   video clips of children playing with objects in a naturalistic context
   were presented. Our analyses uncovered a three-way interaction between
   Task, Social vs. Object Stimuli, and Diagnosis. This interaction was
   driven by group differences on one task onlythe Interactive task.
   Bayesian analyses confirmed that the other two tasks were insensitive to
   group membership. In addition, receiver operating characteristic
   analyses demonstrated that, unlike the other two tasks, the Interactive
   task had significant classification power. The ecological relevance of
   social stimuli is an important factor to consider for eye-tracking
   studies aiming to measure social attention and motivation in ASD. Autism

AB In contexts of land conflict and deep social divisions, evaluations of
   dirty and disordered landscapes carry social and political weight. This
   article employs a "political dwelling" perspective in southern Israel to
   examine how links between Bedouin character, litter and disorder, and
   lawlessness have become widespread, even naturalized, among many
   government officials and Jewish residents and even some Bedouin Arab
   residents. Contemporary trash talk draws on, but simultaneously masks, a
   history of state-building projects that employed Orientalist evaluations
   of order and disorder and segregationist approaches to development.
   While this masking of social construction is a property of all
   symbolically powerful social distinctions, I argue that the distinctions
   undergirding trash talk are especially accessible for normalization
   because of the language of nature within which they are
   expressed-natural landscapes, ethnic groups, and human nature. As a
   result, trash talk naturalizes links between dirty places, disorderly
   people, and the need to remove (or reform) them. This trash talk has
   profound emotional and material consequences for Bedouin residents of
   Israel because the discourse makes it easier for many within mainstream
   Israeli society to treat Bedouin Arabs themselves as matter out of place
   and to justify various acts of social control.

AB Objectives: Globally, the number of older people living with HIV (PLH)
   is growing. Additionally, older PLH are facing particular challenges
   related to accessing health care. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the older PLH's access to care and its relationship to
   emotional and tangible social support.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 PLH who were 50
   years of age or older in Anhui, China. A computer-assisted personal
   interview was used to collect the participants' demographic
   characteristics, perceived health status, and access to care. The
   following two dimensions of social support were measured: emotional
   support and tangible support. The association between emotional/tangible
   support and access to care was calculated using Pearson's/point-biserial
   correlations and with multiple linear regression.
   Results: Higher tangible support was reported by the participants who
   were married or living with a partner, those who had higher annual
   income levels, and those with better perceived health status. Emotional
   support was correlated with higher education, higher income, and better
   perceived health status. Multiple regression analyses showed that access
   to care was significantly associated with emotional support (beta =
   0.2807, p<0.0001) but not with tangible support (beta = -0.0183,
   p=0.7922).
   Conclusions: The study findings point to the importance of providing
   emotional support for older PLH. It is suggested that emotional support
   should be provided for older PLH in addition to tangible assistance, in
   order to engage them in treatment and care. Copyright (C) 2015 John

AB Objective To retrospectively characterize electrocardiogram (ECG) use
   among preparticipation history and examinations (PPEs).
   Study design Using the 2005 to 2010 MarketScan insurance database, we
   identified subjects aged 5-21 years with either a PPE with an ECG or a
   PPE alone, excluding those with known cardiac diagnoses. We described
   cardiology referrals and subspecialty testing within 180 days and
   cardiac diagnoses within 1 year of the PPE, and the costs of testing in
   each group.
   Results From 2005-2009, 503 304 PPEs occurred in 419 456 subjects, of
   which 8621 (2%) included an ECG. ECG use increased from 12-20 per 1000
   PPEs from 2005-2009. Females, lower socioeconomic status, and rural
   settings were associated with fewer ECGs. Thirteen percent of PPEs with
   ECG and 0.5% of PPEs alone led to a cardiology referral. After PPEs with
   ECG, cardiac disease was identified in 18% (2% sports-limiting); after
   PPEs alone, cardiac disease was identified in 0.5% (0.03%
   sports-limiting). The PPE had a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of
   98.6% of identifying cardiac disease. The total reimbursement cost of
   PPEs plus testing was $ 80 396 464 ($ 160 per PPE).
   Conclusions These real-world data demonstrate that community providers
   selectively use the ECG as part of the PPE with a high rate of
   identification of cardiac disease. Mass ECG screening would need to be
   more efficient at identifying disease than this selective approach.

AB This paper pursues the research question how can asset mapping using
   mobile technology impact the discursive planning environment affecting a
   cultural landscape? This paper examines this through the review of a
   case study entitled Cellphone Diaries. It features the work of African
   American community residents who participated in asset mapping using
   smartphones and created self-authored digital videos recording their
   memories of people, places, and events occurring in John Chavis Memorial
   Park. The park, located one mile southeast of the center of Raleigh,
   North Carolina and situated in the heart of Raleigh's largest
   historically African American community. The park was undergoing
   significant changes that the community interpreted as the loss of
   significant cultural landscape features. Through Cellphone Diaries,
   community residents created videos that were examined using discourse
   analysis, linked to an online map, and disseminated as a catalog of
   community perceptions of the meaning of the park. The location of their
   narratives on spatial maps produced a geographically referenced
   interpretive tool highlighting previously undocumented people, places,
   and events important to the community. The paper argues that the use of
   mobile technology constitutes a critical visualization approach that
   affected the park planning discourse by enabling community people to
   create material products (videos and maps) that positioned their
   narratives in multiple discourses beyond the immediate planning context.
   The larger influence of these expanded positions, including through
   media and arts community outlets, increased the power of their
   narratives to affect change in the park planning process. (C) 2015

AB Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate racial and
   socio-economic differences in breast cancer surgery treatment,
   post-surgical complications, hospital length of stay and mortality among
   hospitalized breast cancer patients.
   Methods: We examined the association between race/ethnicity and
   socio-economic status with treatment and outcomes after surgery among
   71,156 women hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer
   using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2007 to 2011.
   Multivariable regression models were used to compute estimates, odds
   ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusting for age, comorbidities,
   stage at diagnosis, insurance, and residential region.
   Results: Black women were more likely to receive breast conserving
   surgery but less likely to receive mastectomies compared with white
   women. They also experienced significantly longer hospital stays (beta =
   0.31, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.39), post-surgical complications (OR = 1.21, 95%
   CI: 1.04-1.42) and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.07-1.50)
   compared with Whites, after adjusting for other factors including the
   number of comorbidities and treatment type.
   Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized for breast cancer, there were
   racial differences observed in treatment and outcomes. Further studies
   are needed to fully characterize whether these differences are due to
   individual, provider level or hospital level factors, and to highlight
   areas for targeted approaches to eliminate these disparities. (C) 2015

AB The 27 oil and gas platforms offshore southern California will
   eventually reach the end of their useful lifetimes (estimated between
   2015 and 2030) and will be decommissioned. Current state and federal
   laws and regulations allow for alternative uses in lieu of the complete
   removal required in existing leases. Any decommissioning pathway will
   create a complex mix of costs, benefits, opportunities, and constraints
   for multiple user groups. To assist the California Natural Resources
   Agency in understanding these issues, we evaluated the potential
   socioeconomic impacts of the 2 most likely options: complete removal and
   partial removal of the structure to 85 feet below the waterline with the
   remaining structure left in place as an artificial reef-generally
   defined as a manmade structure with some properties that mimic a natural
   reef. We estimated impacts on commercial fishing, commercial shipping,
   recreational fishing, nonconsumptive boating, and nonconsumptive SCUBA
   diving. Available data supported quantitative estimates for some
   impacts, semiquantitative estimates for others, and only qualitative
   approximations of the direction of impact for still others. Even
   qualitative estimates of the direction of impacts and of user groups'
   likely preferred options have been useful to the public and decision
   makers and provided valuable input to the project's integrative decision
   model. Uncertainty surrounds even qualitative estimates of the likely
   direction of impact where interactions between multiple impacts could
   occur or where user groups include subsets that would experience the
   same option differently. In addition, we were unable to quantify effects
   on ecosystem value and on the larger regional ecosystem, because of data
   gaps on the population sizes and dynamics of key species and the
   uncertainty surrounding the contribution of platforms to available hard
   substrate and related natural populations offshore southern California.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of mortality
   among middle-aged women. Most work in the field emphasizes the
   psychiatric, psychological, or biological determinants of suicide.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between social integration and
   suicide.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the Nurses' Health
   Study, an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of nurses in the
   United States. Beginning in 1992, a population-based sample of 72 607
   nurses 46 to 71 years of age were surveyed about their social
   relationships. The vital status of study participants was ascertained
   through June 1, 2010.
   EXPOSURES Social integration was measured with a 7-item index that
   included marital status, social network size, frequency of contact with
   social ties, and participation in religious or other social groups.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interestwas suicide,
   defined as deaths classified using the codes E950 to E959 from the
   International Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision.
   RESULTS During more than 1.2 million person-years of follow-up
   (1992-2010), there were 43 suicide events. The incidence of suicide
   decreased with increasing social integration. In a multivariable Cox
   proportional hazards regression model, the relative hazard of suicide
   was lowest among participants in the highest category of social
   integration (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.09-0.58]) and
   second-highest category of social integration (adjusted hazard ratio,
   0.26 [95% CI, 0.09-0.74]). Increasing or consistently high levels of
   social integration were associated with a lower risk of suicide. These
   findings were robust to sensitivity analyses that accounted for poor
   mental health and serious physical illness.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Women who were socially well integrated had a
   more than 3-fold lower risk for suicide over 18 years of follow-up.

AB Objective:To explore biopsychosocial factors (beliefs, depression,
   catastrophizing cytokines) in individuals newly diagnosed with lung
   cancer and no pain to determine their relationship at diagnosis and
   across time and to determine whether these factors contribute to pain
   intensity or pain interference with function at pain onset.Materials and
   Methods:A longitudinal, exploratory, pilot study was implemented in a
   private medical center and a VA medical center in the southeast. Twelve
   subjects not experiencing pain related to cancer of the lung or its
   treatment were recruited. A Karnofsky status of 40% and hemoglobin of 8
   g were required. Five questionnaires were completed and 10 mL of blood
   was drawn at baseline; 4 questionnaires and blood draws were repeated
   monthly for 5 months. One baseline questionnaire and a pain assessment
   were added at final. Demographic, clinical, and questionnaire data were
   summarized; standardized scale scores were
   calculated.Results:Biopsychosocial scores that were low at baseline
   increased from T1-T4 but decreased slightly T5-T6. Individuals with
   higher pain intensity and higher pain interference at final had higher
   psychosocial scores at baseline than individuals with lower pain
   intensity and lower pain interference at final.Conclusions:Unrelated to
   disease stage, metastasis, or treatment, unique levels of
   biopsychosocial factors are observed in patients newly diagnosed with
   lung cancer who report higher levels of pain intensity and higher levels
   of pain interference at the time pain occurs. Replication studies are
   needed to validate this response pattern and determine the value of
   repeated individual assessments.

AB Objective. To identify racial and ethnic differences in mortality and
   cardiovascular (CV) risk among patients with end-stage renal disease
   (ESRD) due to lupus nephritis (LN).
   Methods. Within the US ESRD registry (1995-2008), we identified
   individuals ages >17 years with incident ESRD due to systemic lupus
   erythematosus. We ascertained demographics, clinical factors, and deaths
   from registry patient files and CV events (myocardial infarction, heart
   failure, and hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes) from inpatient Medicare
   claims. We calculated incidence rates (95% confidence intervals [95%
   CIs]) per 1,000 person-years for study events, stratified by race and
   ethnicity. We compared probabilities of the events among racial and
   ethnic groups using cumulative incidence function curves and
   multivariable-adjusted subdistribution proportional hazard ratios
   (HRsd), taking into account the competing events of kidney
   transplantation and death (for nonfatal CV events).
   Results. Of 12,533 patients with LN-associated ESRD, the mean +/- SD age
   was 40.7 +/- 14.9 years, 82% were women, and 49% were African American.
   The overall mortality rate was 98.1/1,000 person-years (95% CI
   95.3-100.9). In multivariable models, Asian and Hispanic LN-associated
   ESRD patients had lower mortality than whites (HRsd 0.70 [95% CI
   0.58-0.84] and 0.79 [95% CI 0.71-0.88], respectively), whereas African
   Americans had higher mortality (HRsd 1.27 [95% CI 1.18-1.36]). African
   American patients >40 years old had higher mortality than their white
   counterparts (HRsd 1.67 [95% CI 1.44-1.93]). African Americans were more
   likely to be admitted for heart failure or hemorrhagic stroke.
   Conclusion. Among patients with LN-associated ESRD, Asians and Hispanics
   experienced lower mortality and CV event risks than whites, and African
   Americans had higher mortality and CV event risks than whites.

AB Poorer survival from oral and pharyngeal cancer (OPC) has been reported
   for populations of lower socioeconomic status (SES), adjusting for risk
   factors such as patient and clinical characteristics. Beyond these risk
   factors, higher rates of tobacco use may be a mediator for the observed
   poorer OPC survival for low SES populations. In this study, we aimed to
   examine the impact of the relationships among SES, individual smoking
   status, and living in a region with a higher smoking rate on OPC
   survival. We obtained Florida Cancer Data System data from 1996 to 2010
   and merged the data with US Census data and Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System data from 1996 to 2010. We built multivariable
   survival models to quantify the mediational effect of individual smoking
   on overall and OPC-specific survival, adjusting for regional smoking,
   demographics, and clinical characteristics. We found that lower SES,
   individual smoking, and living in a region with a higher smoking rate
   were all strongly associated with poorer survival. We estimated that the
   indirect effect of individual smoking accounted for a large part (ranged
   from 13.3% to 30.2%) of the total effect of SES on overall and
   OPC-specific survival. In conclusion, individual and regional smoking
   are both significant and independent predictors of poor cancer survival.
   Higher rate of individual smoking is partially responsible for poorer
   cancer survival in low SES populations. Results of this study provide
   rationale for considering a multi-level approach that simultaneously
   targets both individual and contextual factors for future smoking
   cessation interventions.

AB IMPORTANCE Outpatient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) health care
   facilities receive funding from the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP)
   to provide medical care and essential support services that help
   patients remain in care and adhere to treatment. Increased access to
   Medicaid and private insurance for HIV-infected persons may provide
   coverage for medical care but not all needed support services and may
   not supplant the need for RWHAP funding.
   OBJECTIVE To examine differences between RWHAP-funded and
   non-RWHAP-funded facilities and in patient outcomes between the 2
   systems.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The study was conducted from June 1,
   2009, to May 31, 2012, using data from the 2009 and 2011 cycles of the
   Medical Monitoring Project, a national probability sample of 8038
   HIV-infected adults receiving medical care at 989 outpatient health care
   facilities providing HIV medical care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data were used to compare patient
   characteristics, service needs, and access to services at RWHAP-funded
   vs non-RWHAP-funded facilities. Differences in prescribed antiretroviral
   treatment and viral suppression were assessed. Data analysis was
   performed between February 2012 and June 2015.
   RESULTS Overall, 34.4% of facilities received RWHAP funding and 72.8% of
   patients received care at RWHAP-funded facilities. With results reported
   as percentage (95% CI), patients attending RWHAP-funded facilities were
   more likely to be aged 18 to 29 years (8.5% [7.4%-9.5%] vs
   5.0%[3.9%-6.2%]), female (29.2%[27.2%-31.2%] vs 20.1%[17.0%-23.1%]),
   black (47.5%[41.5%-53.5%] vs 25.8% [20.6%-31.0%]) or Hispanic
   (22.5%[16.4%-28.6%] vs 12.9% [10.6%-15.2%]), have less than a high
   school education (26.1% [24.0%-28.3%] vs 10.9%[8.7%-13.1%]), income at
   or below the poverty level (53.6%[50.3%-56.9%] vs 23.9% [19.7%-28.0%]),
   and lack health care coverage (25.0%[21.9%-28.1%] vs 6.1% [4.1%-8.0%]).
   The RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to provide case management
   (76.1% [69.9%-82.2%] vs 15.4%[10.4%-20.4%]) as well as mental health
   (64.0%[57.0%-71.0%] vs 18.0%[14.0%-21.9%]), substance abuse
   (33.6%[27.0%-40.2%] vs 12.0% [8.0%-16.0%]), and other support services;
   patients attending RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to receive
   these services. After adjusting for patient characteristics, the
   percentage prescribed ART antiretroviral therapy, reported as adjusted
   prevalence ratio (95% CI), was similar between RWHAP-funded and
   non-RWHAP-funded facilities (1.01 [0.99-1.03]), but among poor patients,
   those attending RWHAP-funded facilities were more likely to be virally
   suppressed (1.09 [1.02-1.16]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A total of 72.8% of HIV-positive patients
   received care at RWHAP-funded facilities. Many had multiple social
   determinants of poor health and used services at RWHAP-funded facilities
   associated with improved outcomes. Without facilities supported by the
   RWHAP, these patients may have had reduced access to services elsewhere.
   Poor patients were more likely to achieve viral suppression if they
   received care at a RWHAP-funded facility.

AB Background: Inaccuracies in energy intake (El) measurement hinder
   identification of risk factors that predict weight gain and evaluation
   of obesity prevention and treatment interventions. Research has used
   objective measures of El to identify underreporting correlates,
   producing mixed results, suggesting the need to examine novel potential
   correlates.
   Objective: With the use of an objective measure of El from doubly
   labeled water (DLW) this report examined multiple potential
   underreporting correlates.
   Methods: Adolescents from 2 studies (study 1, n = 91; mean age: 18.4 +/-
   0.58 y; 100% female; study 2, n = 162; mean age: 15.2 +/- 1.99 y; 82
   female adolescents; 80 male adolescents) completed a DLW assessment of
   El, a food-frequency questionnaire, and measures of perceived pressure
   for thinness, thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dieting,
   food-cue reactivity, eating disorder symptoms, socioeconomic status, and
   neural response to food; BMI (in kg/m2) was measured over a 2-y
   follow-up.
   Results: Elevated BMI correlated with underreported El in study 1 (r =
   0.26, P< 0.05) and study 2 (r= 0.20, P= 0.01), as did male sex in study
   2 (r= 0.24, P< 0.01); the other survey measures did not. Underreporting
   correlated negatively (r= -0.29; uncorr P < 0.001) with responsivity of
   brain regions implicated in motor control tb paiatable food receipt and
   positively (r = 0.31; uncorr P < 0.001) with responsivity of a region
   implicated in taste processing to cues signaling impending milkshake
   receipt. Underreporting did not predict future change in BMI in either
   study.
   Conclusions: Findings document marked underreporting and replicate
   evidence that BMI correlates positively with underreporting and extends
   this literature by revealing that several novel factors were unrelated
   to underreporting and further that neural responsivity to food
   correlated with underreporting, suggesting that adolescents who showed
   reduced responsivity in a motor control region to food receipt and
   elevated responsivity of gustatory regions to anticipated palatable food
   receipt showed greater underreporting. This trial was registered at
   clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00433680 and NCT02084836.

AB The relationship of socioeconomic status (SES) with long-term outcomes
   in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors has not
   been well described. We studied the association of SES with the outcomes
   of 283 consecutive allogeneic HCT recipients transplanted between 2003
   and 2012 who had survived for at least 1 year in remission. Median
   annual household income was estimated using Census tract data and from
   ZIP code of residence. SES categories were determined by recursive
   partitioning analysis (low SES (< $51 000/year), N = 203; high SES (>=
   $51 000/year), N = 80). In multivariable analyses, low SES patients had
   higher risks of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.98, P = 0.012)
   and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (HR 2.22, P = 0.028), but similar risks
   of relapse mortality (HR 1.01, P = 0.97) compared with high SES
   patients. A trend toward better survival and lower NRM for high SES
   patients with no chronic GVHD was observed; low SES patients without
   GVHD had similar survival as patients with chronic GVHD. In allogeneic
   HCT survivors who survive in remission for at least 1 year, SES is
   associated with long-term survival that is primarily mediated through
   higher risks of NRM. More research is needed to understand the
   mechanisms of health-care disparities and interventions to mitigate
   them.

AB Objective:To determine whether early social-emotional problems are
   associated with child feeding practices, maternal-child feeding styles,
   and child obesity at age 5 years, in the context of a primary care-based
   brief general parenting intervention led by an integrated behavioral
   health specialist to offer developmental monitoring, on-site
   intervention, and/or referrals.Methods:A retrospective cohort study was
   conducted of mothers with 5-year-old children previously screened using
   the Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) during the
   first 3 years of life. ASQ:SE scores were dichotomized not at risk
   versus at risk. At risk subjects were further classified as
   participating or not participating in the intervention. Regression
   analyses were performed to determine relationships between
   social-emotional problems and feeding practices, feeding styles, and
   weight status at age 5 years based on participation, controlling for
   potential confounders and using not at risk as a reference
   group.Results:Compared with children not at risk, children at riskno
   participation were more likely to be obese at age 5 years (adjusted odds
   ratio, 3.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 9.45). Their mothers were
   less likely to exhibit restriction and limit setting and more likely to
   pressure to eat than mothers in the not at risk group. Children at
   riskparticipation did not demonstrate differences in weight status
   compared with children not at risk.Conclusion:Early social-emotional
   problems, unmitigated by intervention, were related to several feeding
   styles and to obesity at age 5 years. Further study is needed to
   understand how a general parenting intervention may be protective
   against obesity.

AB Objective:This study investigated the association of cervical human
   papillomavirus (HPV) infection with cumulative psychosocial risk
   reflecting family disadvantage, psychological distress, and unhealthy
   lifestyle.Methods:The sample (N = 745) comprised sexually active female
   adolescent patients (12-19 yr), primarily ethnic minorities, enrolled in
   a free HPV vaccination program. Subjects completed questionnaires and
   provided cervical swabs for HPV DNA testing. Unweighted and weighted
   principal component analyses for categorical data were used to derive
   multisystemic psychosocial risk indices using 9 indicators: low
   socioeconomic status, lack of adult involvement, not attending high
   school/college, history of treatment for depression/anxiety,
   antisocial/delinquent behavior, number of recent sexual partners, use of
   alcohol, use of drugs, and dependency risk for alcohol/drugs. The
   association between cervical HPV (any type, high-risk types, vaccine
   types) assayed by polymerase chain reaction and self-reported number of
   psychosocial risk indicators was estimated using multivariable logistic
   regression.Results:Subjects had a median of 3 psychosocial risk
   indicators. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed associations
   with unweighted and weighted number of psychosocial indicators for HPV
   any type (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.0-1.2), with the strongest associations between weighted drug/alcohol
   use, drug/alcohol dependency risk, and antisocial/delinquent behavior
   and detection of HPV vaccine types (aOR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0)
   independent of number of recent sexual partners and vaccine dose
   (0-3).Conclusion:Increased HPV infections including HPV vaccine types
   were associated with greater number of psychosocial risk indicators even
   after controlling for demographics, sexual behavior, history of
   chlamydia, and vaccine dose.

AB Recently, a new research agenda emphasizing interactions between social
   factors and health has emerged. The term social determinant of health
   often refers to any nonmedical factor directly influencing health.
   Health across the life span is strongly and adversely affected by social
   disadvantage. Research in epigenetics indicates that alterations in DNA
   methylation may provide a causal link between social adversity and
   health disparity. Likewise, accelerated loss of telomeres is correlated
   with chronic stress. Research is still required to develop an
   understanding of the role of epigenetics and perturbed telomere function
   in linking social adversity with health outcome.

AB Self-enhancement is a positive bias in self-perception, which may imply
   error. However, conventional measures of self-enhancement are difference
   scores that do not distinguish a positive bias from a self-enhancement
   error, that is, they fail to identify those individuals who hold an
   irrationally or inaccurately positive view of themselves. We propose 2
   new measures to separate error from bias. In the domain of personality
   judgment, we estimate a defensible bias and an enhancement error from
   individuals' actual and perceived similarity with others. In the domain
   of performance, we adapt a decision-theoretic framework to distinguish
   those who falsely believe to be better than average from those who
   actually are better. We illustrate the properties of these measures in 3
   empirical studies and computer simulations. Implausibly high majorities
   of people consider themselves to be above average on various dimensions.

AB Ecological restoration programs often attempt to maintain or enhance
   ecosystem services (ES), but fine-scale maps of multiple ES are rarely
   available to support prioritization among potential projects. Here we
   use agency reports, citizen science, and social media as data sources to
   quantify the spatial distribution of five recreational elements of
   cultural ES (CES) - sport fishing, recreational boating, birding, beach
   use, and park visitation across North America's Laurentian Great Lakes,
   where current restoration investments exceed US$1.5 billion. These
   recreational CES are widely yet unevenly distributed, and spatial
   correlations among all except park visitation indicate that many
   locations support multiple CES benefits. Collectively, these five
   service metrics cor-relate with tourism gross domestic product,
   indicating that local economies benefit from ecosystem conditions that
   support CES. However, locations of high recreational CES delivery are
   often severely affected by environmental stressors, suggesting that
   either ecosystem condition or human enjoyment of these recreational CES
   is resilient even to substantial levels of stress. Our analyses show
   that spatial assessments of recreational CES are an informative
   complement to ecosystem stress assessments for guiding large-scale
   restoration efforts.

AB Foucauldian analyses and studies in the sociology of knowledge have
   provided vibrant accounts of the effects and lives of knowledge
   practices, yet they have been less attuned to their unexpected
   consequences upon reception in disparate settings. This article examines
   the employment of survey methodology as a means to enact modernization
   theory in non-Western areas during the early phases of the Cold War. An
   examination of the original questionnaires employed in sociologist
   Daniel Lerner's seminal text, The Passing of Traditional Society:
   Modernizing the Middle East, reveals an alignment between the ideal
   subject of modernization theory and the expectations placed upon the
   respondent. These expectations included familiarity with the conditions
   of the survey setting, impersonal relationships, the promise of
   anonymity, and the capacity for having and voicing opinions regarding
   otherwise improbable situations. Lerner's work and the studies it
   spawned did not merely measure and describe the attitudes of peasants,
   students, and administrators; they were intended to be performative: the
   interviews were designed to occasion the forms of subjectivity and
   interpersonal relations articulated and idealized by modernization
   theory. However, the researchers' interest in the very activity of
   survey-taking as a modernizing edifice was undercut by skeptical
   respondents, disorderly interviewer behavior, and the relentless
   remaking of coding procedures. In this reading, the questionnaires and
   their specific stipulations surface as artifacts of knowledge practices
   that nonetheless overflow the intentions of their coders, sponsors, and
   creators.

AB Judgments of affordances, the potential actions that an observer can
   carry out within an environment, require observers to relate information
   about their body to information in the environment. Although humans can
   accurately judge affordances for others, it is unknown whether other
   people's capability to act influences one's own affordance judgments.
   Based on theoretical accounts and recent empirical evidence highlighting
   the importance of social information in perception and action, we
   hypothesized that the action capabilities of another person would
   influence one's own affordance judgments. Participants judged their own
   and another's ability to pass through an aperture in 3 experiments that
   varied the differences in body sizes between the participant and another
   agent using naturally occurring body size differences or an artificial
   large body suit. Results showed an influence of the other's body size on
   self-affordance judgments only when the participant and the other agent
   remained in their natural body size (Experiment 3), but not when the
   body size differences between the participant and the other agent were
   extreme because of the body suit (Experiments 1 and 2).

AB Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the
   mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how
   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.

AB It is well known that family socioeconomic background influences
   childhood access to opportunities. Educational reforms that introduce
   new information about school quality may lead to increased inequality if
   families with more resources are better able to respond. However, these
   policies can also level the playing field for choice by equalizing
   disadvantaged families' access to information. This study assesses how a
   novel accountability system affected family enrollment decisions in the
   Chicago Public Schools by introducing new test performance information
   and consequences. We show that a substantial proportion of families
   responded by transferring out when their child's school was assigned
   probation. Poor families transferred children to other schools in the
   district, but at a lower rate than non-poor families, who were also more
   likely to leave for another district or enroll in private school. Most
   striking, we show that despite family response to the probation label,
   access to higher-performing schools changed very little under the new
   policy; students who left probation schools were the most likely of all
   transfer students to enroll in other low-performing schools in the
   district. Although new information changed families' behavior, it did
   not address contextual and resource-dependent factors that constrain the
   educational decisions of poor families.

AB Community-based agrobiodiversity management projects have been at the
   forefront of integrating informal seed systems into food security
   initiatives. These projects co-create open-pollinated crops and
   reintroduce lost varieties. A prevailing critique regarding these
   projects regards unequal distribution of seed to communities quality
   seed, when introduced, does not reach target populations. The purpose of
   this study is to identify key farmers who can distribute open-pollinated
   seed through their existing, diverse social channels and evaluate if
   this method enables vulnerable populations to access improved varieties.
   Data was collected and combined from two subsistence-based communities
   in Northern Ghana. This study combines social seed network analysis and
   regression to determine centrally connected farmers over their project
   areas. To understand which types of farmers have the most equitable and
   efficient seed distribution networks, this study uses harmonic closeness
   centrality as a dependent variable in a set of ordinary least squares
   regressions. Results suggest that harmonic closeness centrality can best
   be estimated per study community, but results were not constant after
   combining communities. Two warnings emerge from this analysis: i)
   central farmers can leverage their control on resources to maintain
   their network position, which may promote unequal seed dissemination,
   and ii) seemingly analogous networks may be difficult to compare when
   combined due to a scale mismatch between analysis and intended analysis
   utility (i.e. seed dissemination). These findings validate the utility
   of social network analysis in unfolding the socioecological complexity
   of informal seed systems; yet offer warning on using network parameters
   for equitable (re)introduction of open-pollinated varieties. (C) 2015

AB Weather variability affects many parts of the Philippines, can threaten
   human health and well-being, and may become more frequent and intense
   due to climate change. Compared to more visible extreme weather events
   (e.g., typhoons), seasonal and inter-annual weather variations (e.g., in
   precipitation, wind, temperature) associated with otherwise normal
   weather systems are less often incorporated into adaptation planning. To
   better inform such planning, this study examines self-reported household
   impacts of atypical rainy and dry seasons, with a focus on gender. By
   collecting data from women and men in the same randomly sampled
   households, this study contributes an innovative intrahousehold analysis
   to the growing body of work at the nexus of gender, weather, and
   climate. The study finds gendered differences in reported impacts for
   rainier than usual rainy seasons but few differences for drier or longer
   than usual dry seasons. Climate adaptation plans should further
   incorporate seasonal and inter-annual weather variability and seek
   participatory input from both women and men so that a diversity of
   concerns is addressed.

AB Islands are traditionally considered sensitive to environment and
   climate change. The Caribbean Islands are a biodiversity hotspot, where
   conservation efforts should be a priority. However, the archaeological
   record suggests that the biotic characteristics of the islands, even
   within nature or forests reserves, are strongly shaped by thousands of
   years of intense human activity. This presents an issue for conservation
   efforts because defining what should be preserved and what should be
   reconstructed is not straightforward. Using Puerto Rico as case study,
   this article explores how socioecosystem dynamics influenced the biotic
   characteristics of the island at specific archaeological periods and to
   what extent these processes have affected the environmental resources on
   the island today. Climatic data, its implications on forest type and
   cover, and landscape characteristics as seen from sedimentary records,
   combined with archaeological data on human-environment interactions over
   time, from the mid-Holocene to the present are used to investigate these
   themes. This article brings forth more questions than answers, but it
   reflects the status of deep-time environmental research on the island,
   which is still in its early stages. I argue that, starting from the
   earliest occupations, human influence has altered the ecology of Puerto
   Rico so deeply that the natural resources we work toward preserving,
   conserving, or restoring today cannot be understood without considering
   the social contexts that shaped them. In this sense, if the Anthropocene
   is a proposal to rename the current geological period because of the
   overwhelming physical evidence of change that human activity has left
   behind, then the history of the Puerto Rico supports the proposal for
   the application of the term since at least 5ka. Applying the concept
   would bring the relevance of human activity to the forefront,
   contributing to the reconsideration of the role of humans in the
   formation and preservation of modern ecological systems.

   screening among 237 Latin American (Latino) and non-Latino White (Anglo)

   Multi-group structural equation modeling revealed that for Latino and

   women, perceptions of higher professional empathy and less negative
   emotions were associated with better continuity of cancer screening.

AB Socioeconomic disadvantage has been linked to elevated blood pressure
   (BP), and the purpose of this study was to assess whether interpersonal
   social supports buffer these adverse relations in African-American
   adults. In three communities matched demographically, a subsample of
   participants (N = 204) of the Positive Action for Today's Health trial
   provided measures of perceived social support, annual household income,
   and BP. Multiple regression analyses with cross-product interactions
   were conducted using follow-up data. The sample had a mean age of 52.8
   years (SD = 15.1), and was predominantly female (66 %) with a high body
   mass index (M = 33.5, SD = 14.7). Results indicated an inverse relation
   between social support and diastolic BP (B = -.178, p = .005), and also
   an interaction with income (p = .046), such that higher social support
   related to lower diastolic BP in the lowest-income individuals (B =
   -1.05). The same direct (B = -.141, p = .025) and interacting (B =
   -1.42, p = .040) social support effects were present for systolic BP,
   however the omnibus model for systolic BP was not significant, F(6, 196)
   = 1.80, p = .09. The hypothesized buffering effect of social support on
   the adverse relation of income to BP was partially supported in at-risk
   African-American adults. Future prevention efforts for reducing the
   impact of socioeconomic stress on BP may aim to increase perceptions of
   social support.

AB Person-centered and family-centered care represents the pinnacle of
   health care quality, but delivering it is challenging, as is assessing
   whether it has occurred. Prior studies portray older adults as passive
   in health decisions and burdened by care-but emphasize age-based
   differences or focus on vulnerable subgroups.
   We aimed to examine domains of person-centered and family-centered care
   among older adults and whether the social context in which older adults
   manage their health relates to preferences for participating in health
   decisions and experiences with care.
   This was an observational study of a nationally representative survey of
   adults aged 65+ years, conducted in concert with the 2012 National
   Health and Aging Trends Study (n = 2040).
   Approach to managing health (self-manage, co-manage, delegate);
   preferences for making health care decisions with: (1) doctors, (2)
   family/close friends; and experiences with care pertaining to treatment
   burden were measured.
   Approximately two-thirds of older adults self-manage (69.4 %) and
   one-third co-manage (19.6 %) or delegate (11.0 %) health care
   activities. The majority prefer an independent or shared role when
   making health decisions with doctors (84.7 %) and family/close friends
   (95.9 %). Nearly four in ten older adults (37.9 %) experience treatment
   burden-that managing health care activities are sometimes or often hard
   for either them or their family/close friends, that health care
   activities get delayed or don't get done, or that they are cumulatively
   too much to do. Relative to older adults who self-manage, those who
   delegate health care activities are more likely to prefer to share or
   leave health decisions to doctors (aOR = 1.79 (95 % CI, 1.37-2.33) and
   family/close friends (aOR = 3.12 (95 % CI, 2.23-4.36), and are more
   likely to experience treatment burden (aOR = 2.37 (95 % CI, 1.61-3.47).
   Attaining person-centered and family-centered care will require
   strategies that respect diverse decision-making preferences, minimize
   treatment burden, and support the broader social context in which older
   adults manage their health.

AB Purpose The establishment of formal physical activity (PA) guidelines
   has led to considerable interest in quantifying participation in
   moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). However, evidence on the context of MVPA
   at the population level is scarce. The aim of this study was to provide
   information on the type, location, and purpose of MVPA in a
   representative sample of adults.
   Methods Data from a representative sample of 1234 Iowa adults were
   included in this study. Each participant performed a
   telephone-administered 24-h PA recall method to recall PA in the
   previous 24 h. Self-reported data from the recall instrument included
   time and types of reported activities across five distinct location and
   purpose codes. Reported activities were matched with corresponding
   metabolic equivalent (MET) scores from a reduced list of compendium of
   physical activities. MVPA was defined as any activity with assigned MET
   3.0.
   Results Of the top 30 most frequently reported MVPA, 16 were lifestyle
   activities involving walking, and only 4 can be regarded as traditional
   exercises. Occupational activities (41% for purpose and 40% for
   location) and household activities (37% for purpose and 39% for
   location) accounted for nearly 80% of total reported MVPA time. Time
   allocations across purpose and location codes considerably differed by
   sociodemographic indicators.
   Conclusion Lifestyle activities are more frequently reported than sports
   and/or recreational activities. Individuals with varying levels of
   sociodemographic indicators exhibit different patterns of use of time
   within a given day. A multidomain approach is needed to better
   understand and increase MVPA in diverse populations of US adults.

AB The US health care system is struggling with rising costs, poor
   outcomes, waste, and inefficiency. The Patient Protection and Affordable
   Care Act represents a substantial effort to improve access and
   emphasizes value-based care. Value in health care has been defined as
   health outcomes for the patient per dollar spent. However, given the
   opacity of health outcomes and cost, the identification and
   quantification of patient-centered value is problematic. These problems
   are magnified by highly technical, specialized care (eg, neurosurgery).
   This is further complicated by potentially competing interests of the 5
   major stakeholders in health care: patients, doctors, payers, hospitals,
   and manufacturers. These stakeholders are watching with great interest
   as health care in the United States moves toward a value-based system.
   Market principles can be harnessed to drive costs down, improve
   outcomes, and improve overall value to patients. However, there are many
   caveats to a market-based, value-driven system that must be identified
   and addressed. Many excellent neurosurgical efforts are already underway
   to nudge health care toward increased efficiency, decreased costs, and
   improved quality. Patient-centered shared value can provide a
   philosophical mooring for the development of health care policies that
   utilize market principles without losing sight of the ultimate goals of
   health care, to care for patients.ABBREVIATIONS:ACO, Accountable Care

AB Objectives The role of occupation in the development of cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) remains a topic of research because few studies have
   examined longitudinal associations, and because occupation can be an
   indicator of socioeconomic position (SEP) and a proxy for hazard
   exposure. This study examines associations of occupational category as
   an SEP marker and selected occupational exposures with progression of
   the subclinical carotid artery disease.
   Methods A community-based, multiethnic sample (n=3109, mean age=60.2)
   provided subclinical CVD measures at least twice at three data
   collection points (mean follow-up=9.4 years). After accounting for
   demographic characteristics, SEP, and traditional CVD risk factors, we
   modelled common carotid intima-media thickness, carotid plaque scores,
   and carotid plaque shadowing as a function of occupational category,
   physical hazard exposure, physical activity on the job, interpersonal
   stress, job control and job demands. These job characteristics were
   derived from the Occupational Resource Network (O*NET). Random
   coefficient models were used to account for repeated measures and
   time-varying covariates.
   Results There were a few statistically significant associations at
   baseline. After all covariates were included in the model, men in
   management, office/sales, service and blue-collar jobs had 28-44% higher
   plaque scores than professionals at baseline (p=0.001). Physically
   hazardous jobs were positively associated with plaque scores among women
   (p=0.014). However, there were no significant longitudinal associations
   between any of the occupational characteristics and any of the
   subclinical CVD measures.
   Conclusions There was little evidence that the occupational
   characteristics examined in this study accelerated the progression of
   subclinical CVD.

   experiences and anxiety symptomology in a Black American sample. One
   hundred forty participants completed a questionnaire packet containing
   measures of anxious arousal and stress (general anxiety) symptoms,
   difficulties in emotion regulation, and experiences of racist events.
   Results indicated that difficulties in emotion regulation moderated the
   relationship between past week frequency of racist events and anxious
   arousal as well as past year frequency of racist events and anxious
   arousal. Specifically, these relationships were significantly positive
   at high levels of difficulties in emotion regulation and not significant
   at low levels of difficulties in emotion regulation. Emotion regulation
   skills may help Black Americans cope with anxious arousal related to
   racist experiences. The clinical implications of these findings and
   future research directions are discussed.

AB Increasing empathy toward others is an unspoken goal of many sociology
   courses, but rarely do instructors measure changes in empathy throughout
   a semester. To address this gap in the literature, I use a combination
   of quantitative and qualitative data gathered before and after students
   from five sociology classes participated in a simulation on domestic
   violence. I systematically evaluate whether students' levels of global
   empathy, empathetic responses toward victims, definitions of abuse, and
   propensity to agree with victim-blaming attitudes change after
   completing this experiential learning activity. Posttest results suggest
   a statistically significant but small increase in global empathy scores,
   a growth in empathetic responses toward victims, an expansion in
   students' definitions of abuse, and greater disagreement with
   victim-blaming attitudes. I discuss ways sociology instructors can use
   this simulation as a tool to help students comprehend a difficult
   subject matter while simultaneously engendering empathy toward victims
   of abuse.

   togetherin our classes to facilitate student engagement, critical
   awareness, and medical coming out processes in our classrooms. In so
   doing, we have both built highly successful and popular Medical
   Sociology courses where students learn about and engage with the
   interpersonal and emotional effects of health care systems, structures,
   and patterned disparities. Throughout this article, we use our
   experiences as a case for facilitating debate concerning the
   incorporation of personal and emotional biography into sociological
   teaching and provide questions that may facilitate such conversation. In
   closing, we encourage sociologists to reflect upon, consider, and debate
   the usefulness of incorporating personal and emotional biographies into

AB Objectives. We sought to quantify how socioeconomic, health care,
   demographic, and geographic effects explain racial disparities in low
   birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) rates in Brazil.
   Methods. We employed a sample of 8949 infants born between 1995 and 2009
   in 15 cities and 7 provinces in Brazil. We focused on disparities in LBW
   (< 2500 g) and PTB (< 37 gestational weeks) prevalence between infants
   of African ancestry alone or African mixed with other ancestries, and
   European ancestry alone. We used a decomposition model to quantify the
   contributions of conceptually relevant factors to these disparities.
   Results. The model explained 45% to 94% of LBW and 64% to 94% of PTB
   disparities between the African ancestry groups and European ancestry.
   Differences in prenatal care use and geographic location were the most
   important contributors, followed by socioeconomic differences. The model
   explained the majority of the disparities for mixed African ancestry and
   part of the disparity for African ancestry alone.
   Conclusions. Public policies to improve children's health should target
   prenatal care and geographic location differences to reduce health
   disparities between infants of African and European ancestries in
   Brazil. (Am J Public Health. 2013; 103: 1675-1684.

AB Geosocial networking applications (GSN apps) represent important virtual

   (MSM) seek affiliation. These apps allow users to create and view public
   profiles, send photos, and text messages, and connect with other users
   based on shared interests and geographic proximity. The present study
   examined substance use homophily among a sample of 295 MSM recruited via
   a popular GSN app. Comparisons of social network members met via GSN app
   versus elsewhere and associations between both individual and network
   characteristics and recent binge drinking, marijuana use, and illicit
   substance use were explored using bivariate tests of association and
   multivariate logistic regression analyses. High rates of recent binge
   drinking (59 %), marijuana use (37 %), and illicit substance use (27 %)
   were observed among participants. GSN app use greater than 1 year and
   showing naked chest or abs in a profile picture were positively
   associated with recent illicit substance use. In multivariate analyses,
   the strongest predictors of binge drinking (AOR 3.81; 95 % CI
   1.86-7.80), marijuana use (AOR 4.12; 95 % CI 2.22-7.64), and illicit
   substance use (AOR 6.45; 95 % CI 3.26-12.79) were the presence of a
   social network member who also engaged in these behaviors. Social
   network interventions that target binge drinking, marijuana use, and
   illicit substance use may be delivered via GSN apps to reduce the
   prevalence of substance use and related risks among MSM in these virtual
   contexts.

AB Most of the research among HIV-positive populations has been approached
   from behavioral risk models. This is particularly true for those
   otherwise socially vulnerable groups like men who have sex with men
   (MSM). As a response to this pattern, we examined data from an ongoing
   health promotion research being conducted in Puerto Rico (PR). The study
   is limited to HIV-positive MSM and consists of the participation in a
   survey interview that includes domains used to assess indicators of
   socio-economic-related factors (age, educational level, employment,
   religion, and partnership status) and sexual health (sexual
   satisfaction, condom use, and sexual health knowledge(SHK)).
   Participants reported a relatively high level (75 %) of sexual
   satisfaction and inconsistent condom use (50.9 % reported always using a
   condom). A deficient (61 %) SHK was also reported. In multivariate
   analyses, a higher educational level was associated with higher sexual
   satisfaction (a beta = 3.223; 95 % CI 0.291-6.156) and higher levels of
   SHK (a beta = 1.328; 95 % CI 0.358-2.297), while unemployment was
   associated with less condom use (aOR 0.314; 95 % CI 0.122-0.810). Not
   having a primary sexual partner was associated with less sexual
   satisfaction (a beta = -3.871; 95 % CI -7.534-0.208) and more condom use
   (aOR 4.292; 95 % CI 1.310-14.068). Findings support the notion that men
   of a disadvantaged socioeconomic position may have a poorer sexual
   health status; with a lower level of education and unemployment leading
   this disparity. Findings also evidence that partnership status may have
   a role in the sexual health of HIV-positive MSM. To our knowledge, this
   is the first comprehensive analysis of sexual health and socioeconomic
   indicators among Hispanic/Latino HIV-positive MSM in PR and in the
   Caribbean. Findings provide valuable information to address the sexual
   health needs of an underserved population.

AB Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by the
   HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. The epidemic is not evenly
   distributed across MSM, and young racial minority MSM experience the
   highest rate of new infections. Race-based sexual stereotyping is not
   uncommon among MSM, and it may contribute to the isolation of racial
   minority sexual networks, which has been found to contribute to
   increased HIV incidence in Black MSM. The goals of these analyses were
   to describe the race-based sexual preferences and stereotypes of
   racially diverse young MSM (YMSM), and to examine whether endorsement of
   sexual stereotypes was associated with sexual risk behavior when having
   sex with partners of the stereotyped race. Data were taken from Crew
   450, an ongoing longitudinal study of a syndemic of psychosocial health
   issues linked to HIV among YMSM in Chicago and surrounding areas.
   Analyses utilized data from three study waves, and longitudinal analyses
   were conducted with Hierarchical Linear Modeling. YMSM generally
   endorsed same-race preferences for sexual partners. Black partners were
   rated highest in displaying stereotypically dominant characteristics and
   in likelihood of taking the top/insertive sex role, while Latino
   partners were rated the highest in likelihood of sex being hot and
   passionate. White partners were rated lowest on each of these domains.
   Longitudinal analyses found that endorsement of these stereotypes had
   important implications for the rate of condomless receptive and
   insertive anal sex with racial minority partners. Findings suggest that
   sexual stereotypes may contribute to the isolation of racial minority
   sexual networks.

AB Black men have historically been stereotyped as hedonistic, aggressive,
   and animalistic in their sexual interactions. This study sought to
   describe pleasure, affection, and love experienced by Black men who have
   sex with men (MSM) during their last male-partnered sexual event and to
   examine differences relative to White, Latino, and Asian MSM. A total of
   21,696 (793 Black, 18,905 White, 1,451 Latino, and 547 Asian) U.S. men
   ages 18-87 (M (Age) = 39) were recruited from social/sexual networking
   sites targeting MSM in 2010-2011. Participants reported multiple
   dimensions of sexual experience (pleasure, affection, and love)
   occurring at their last male-partnered sexual event, partner
   relationship, and sociodemographic characteristics. Across relationship
   categories, a sizeable percentage of Black MSM reported pleasure (72-87
   % orgasmed, 57-82 % experienced high subjective pleasure) and affection
   (70-91 % kissed, 47-90 % cuddled). Love was primarily reported for
   events involving main partners (felt love for partner: 96 %; felt loved
   by partner: 97 %; verbalized love to partner: 89 %). Latent class
   analysis with MSM of all races, adjusting for partner relationship and
   sociodemographic characteristics, revealed three distinct profiles of
   sexual experience: affection and love (Class 1); affection in the
   absence of love (Class 2); and neither affection nor love (Class 3).
   Pleasure was probable across profiles. Some racial differences in
   profile probability were present, but no overall pattern emerged.
   Contrary to Black male stereotypes, Black MSM commonly reported
   pleasure, affection, and love at their last male-partnered sexual event
   and did not show a meaningful pattern of difference from other-race MSM
   in their likelihood of experiencing all three.

AB Previous social and behavioral research on identity among bisexual men,
   when not subsumed within the category of men who have sex with men
   (MSM), has primarily focused on samples of self-identified bisexual men.
   Little is known about sexual self-identification among men who are
   behaviorally bisexual, regardless of sexual identity. Using qualitative
   data from 77 in-depth interviews with a diverse sample of behaviorally
   bisexual men (i.e., men who have had sex with at least one woman and at
   least one man in the past six months) from a large city in the
   Midwestern United States, we analyzed responses from a domain focusing
   on sexual self-identity and related issues. Overall, participants'
   sexual self-identification was exceptionally diverse. Three primary
   themes emerged: (1) a resistance to, or rejection of, using sexual
   self-identity labels; (2) concurrent use of multiple identity categories
   and the strategic deployment of multiple sexual identity labels; and (3)
   a variety of trajectories to current sexual self-identification. Based
   on our findings, we offer insights into the unique lived experiences of
   behaviorally bisexual men, as well as broader considerations for the
   study of men's sexuality. We also explore identity-related information
   useful for the design of HIV/STI prevention and other sexual health
   programs directed toward behaviorally bisexual men, which will ideally
   be variable and flexible in accordance with the wide range of diversity
   found in this population.

AB Abnormal parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)-related cardiac activity
   has been linked to aggression. However, little is known about how it
   interacts with psychosocial adversity in predisposing to
   reactive-proactive aggression. In the current study, 84 male and female
   college students self-reported reactive and proactive aggression, and
   were assessed for respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of
   PNS-related cardiac activity, during rest and when they contemplated an
   emotion-evoking decision-making task. Regression analyses showed that
   (a) resting RSA was positively linked to reactive aggression in
   conditions of high social adversity, and (b) RSA reactivity was
   positively associated with reactive but negatively associated with
   proactive aggression, in conditions of low social adversity. Main
   effects were not found for psychophysiological functioning or
   psychosocial adversity, suggesting the importance of their interaction.
   Findings support a biosocial basis for aggression and add additional
   support for the distinctions between reactive and proactive aggression.

AB The association between SES and health is well established; however,
   only a handful of studies have investigated the relationship between SES
   and daily cortisol parameters. Further, within this small literature,
   virtually no studies have looked at psychological factors that might
   mitigate this relationship. In this study, we tested whether life
   satisfaction - the overall subjective affective assessment of one's own
   life - acts as a protective factor against cortisol dysregulation driven
   by low-SES. Among a large sample (N=1325) of individuals from the Mid
   life in the United States (MIDUS) survey, we found that low-SES
   individuals with high levels of life satisfaction had a cortisol
   circadian profile similar to those of high-SES individuals. In contrast,
   low-SES individuals reporting low life satisfaction experienced
   attenuated morning cortisol concentrations and a flatter ("less
   healthy") diurnal cortisol slope. Although more studies are needed to
   investigate the constellation of psychological resources and processes
   through which life satisfaction exerts its effects, the current work
   shows that the general affective evaluation of one's own life acts as a
   buffer against the detrimental effect of low-SES on health-related
   physiological processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   specific traits in childrenin the United States and other mainly

   placed on intellectual heteronomy (obedience to authority) versus
   intellectual autonomy (thinking for oneself). Here, we augment this work
   focusing on Turkey, a predominantly Muslim society. Using data from the
   World Values Survey (n = 3,401), findings indicate that religious
   factors are strong positive predictors of the emphasis on (a) obedience
   to authority and (b) good manners, but inversely associated with an
   emphasis on (a) intellectual independence and (b) imagination. The
   estimated net effects of religion are strongest and most consistent for
   intellectual autonomy. Furthermore, the links between religious
   variables and child-rearing orientation are robust across age/cohort,
   gender, and educational categories. Implications and future directions
   are discussed.

TI Intimate-Partner and Client-Initiated Violence among Female Street-Based
   Sex Workers in China: Does a Support Network Help?

AB Background
   Globally, female street-based sex workers are vulnerable to gender-based
   violence. Previous research has shown having a peer social network can
   reduce sex workers' risks of victimization. However, mechanisms of how
   social network impacts violence among female street-based sex workers
   are still far from clear.
   Methods
   Our study was based on data abstracted from a paper-and-pencil survey
   administered among 218 female street-based sex workers in Shanghai,
   China. We focused on selfreported client-initiated violence and
   intimate-partner violence in emotional, physical, and sexual forms.
   Social networks were characterized by the size and sources of financial
   and psychosocial support (e.g. family, friends, and peers).
   Multi-variable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds
   ratios (AOR) of each type of violence exposure by social network
   structure after the adjustment of age, education, and years in Shanghai.
   Results
   The street-based female sex workers in our study were primarily
   rural-to-urban migrants (95.7%) with an average age of 41 years old.
   24.3% and 62.8% of the sex workers reported intimate-partner violence
   and client-initiated violence respectively. Lack of financial support,
   as defined by having only one individual or none in her peer support
   system to help financially, was significantly associated with
   self-reported intimate-partner violence (AOR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.9).
   Respondents who reported client-initiated violence, by contrast, were
   more likely to report lacked psychosocial support from family (AOR: 2.2,
   95% CI: 1.0-4.6) and peers (AOR: 5.1, 95% CI: 2.2-11).
   Conclusion
   This study is one of the first to systematically analyze the
   associations between social network and gender-based violence among
   street-based female sex worker. We reported a high prevalence of both
   types of gender-based violence and their complex associations with
   family, friends, and peer support network. Policies with goals to reduce
   violence against women may apply these findings to leverage social
   network in the interventions against gender-based violence.

AB The county-level geographic mortality differentials have persisted in
   the past four decades in the United States (US). Though several
   socioeconomic factors (e.g., inequality) partially explain this
   phenomenon, the role of race/ethnic segregation, in general, and the
   different dimensions of segregation, more specifically, has been
   underexplored. Focusing on allcause age-sex standardized US county-level
   mortality (2004-2008), this study has two substantive goals: (1) to
   understand whether segregation is a determinant of mortality and if yes,
   how the relationship between segregation and mortality varies by
   racial/ethnic dyads (e.g., white/black), and (2) to explore whether
   different dimensions of segregation (i.e., evenness, exposure,
   concentration, centralization, and clustering) are associated with
   mortality. A third goal is methodological: to assess whether spatial
   autocorrelation influences our understanding of the associations between
   the dimensions of segregation and mortality. Race/ethnic segregation was
   found to contribute to the geographic mortality disparities. Moreover,
   the relationship with mortality differed by both race/ethnic group and
   the dimension of segregation. Specifically, white/black segregation is
   positively related to mortality, whereas the segregation between whites
   and non-black minorities is negatively associated with mortality. Among
   the five dimensions of segregation, evenness and exposure are more
   strongly related to mortality than other dimensions. Spatial filtering
   approaches also identified six unique spatial patterns that
   significantly affect the spatial distribution of mortality. These
   patterns offer possible insights that help identify omitted variables
   related to the persistent patterning of mortality in the US.

AB Individuals tend to give losses approximately 2-fold the weight that
   they give gains. Such approximations of loss aversion (LA) are almost
   always measured in the stimulus domain of money, rather than objects or
   pictures. Recent work on preference-based decision-making with a
   schedule-less keypress task (relative preference theory, RPT) has
   provided a mathematical formulation for LA similar to that in prospect
   theory (PT), but makes no parametric assumptions in the computation of
   LA, uses a variable tied to communication theory (i.e., the Shannon
   entropy or information), and works readily with non-monetary stimuli. We
   evaluated if these distinct frameworks described similar LA in healthy
   subjects, and found that LA during the anticipation phase of the
   PT-based task correlated significantly with LA related to the RPT-based
   task. Given the ease with which non-monetary stimuli can be used on the
   Internet, or in animal studies, these findings open an extensive range
   of applications for the study of loss aversion. Furthermore, the
   emergence of methodology that can be used to measure preference for both
   social stimuli and money brings a common framework to the evaluation of
   preference in both social psychology and behavioral economics.

AB Vaccination is an effective public health tool for reducing morbidity
   and mortality caused by infectious diseases. However, increasing numbers
   of parents question the safety of vaccines or refuse to vaccinate their
   children outright. The Internet is playing a significant role in the
   growing voice of the anti-vaccination movement as a growing number of
   people use the Internet to obtain health information, including
   information about vaccines. Given the role the Internet plays in
   providing vaccination-related communication, coupled with limited
   research in this area, this study focused on the social media platform
   Pinterest, analyzing 800 vaccine-related pins through a quantitative
   content analysis. The majority of the pins were anti-vaccine, and most
   were original posts as opposed to repins. Concerns about vaccine safety
   and side effects were oft-repeated themes, as was the concept of
   conspiracy theory. Pro-vaccine pins elicited consistently more
   engagement than anti-vaccine pins. Health educators and public health
   organizations should be aware of these dynamics, since a successful
   health communication campaign should start with an understanding of what
   and how publics communicate about the topic at hand. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is systematic, rooted in
   history, and important as an identity marker and expressive resource for
   its speakers. In these respects, it resembles other vernacular or
   nonstandard varieties, like Cockney or Appalachian English. But like
   them, AAVE can trigger discrimination in the workplace, housing market,
   and schools. Understanding what shapes the relative use of AAVE vs.
   Standard American English (SAE) is important for policy and scientific
   reasons. This work presents, to our knowledge, the first experimental
   estimates of the effects of moving into lower-poverty neighborhoods on
   AAVE use. We use data on non-Hispanic African-American youth (n = 629)
   from a large-scale, randomized residential mobility experiment called
   Moving to Opportunity (MTO), which enrolled a sample of mostly minority
   families originally living in distressed public housing. Audio
   recordings of the youth were transcribed and coded for the use of five
   grammatical and five phonological AAVE features to construct a measure
   of the proportion of possible instances, or tokens, in which speakers
   use AAVE rather than SAE speech features. Random assignment to receive a
   housing voucher to move into a lower-poverty area (the
   intention-to-treat effect) led youth to live in neighborhoods (census
   tracts) with an 11 percentage point lower poverty rate on average over
   the next 10-15 y and reduced the share of AAVE tokens by similar to 3
   percentage points compared with the MTO control group youth. The MTO
   effect on AAVE use equals approximately half of the difference in AAVE
   frequency observed between youth whose parents have a high school
   diploma and those whose parents do not.

AB Background
   Cancer health disparities research depends on access to biospecimens
   from diverse racial/ethnic populations. This multimethodological study,
   using mixed methods for quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey
   results, assessed barriers, concerns, and practices for sharing
   biospecimens/data among researchers working with biospecimens from
   minority populations in a 5 state region of the United States (Arizona,
   Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas). The ultimate goals of this
   research were to understand data sharing barriers among biomedical
   researchers; guide strategies to increase participation in biospecimen
   research; and strengthen collaborative opportunities among researchers.
   Methods and Population
   Email invitations to anonymous participants (n = 605 individuals
   identified by the NIH RePORT database), resulted in 112 responses. The
   survey assessed demographics, specimen collection data, and attitudes
   about virtual biorepositories. Respondents were primarily principal
   investigators at PhD granting institutions (91.1%) conducting basic
   (62.3%) research; most were non-Hispanic White (63.4%) and men (60.6%).
   The low response rate limited the statistical power of the analyses,
   further the number of respondents for each survey question was variable.
   Results
   Findings from this study identified barriers to biospecimen research,
   including lack of access to sufficient biospecimens, and limited
   availability of diverse tissue samples. Many of these barriers can be
   attributed to poor annotation of biospecimens, and researchers'
   unwillingness to share existing collections. Addressing these barriers
   to accessing biospecimens is essential to combating cancer in general
   and cancer health disparities in particular. This study confirmed
   researchers' willingness to participate in a virtual biorepository (n =
   50 respondents agreed). However, researchers in this region listed clear
   specifications for establishing and using such a biorepository:
   specifications related to standardized procedures, funding, and
   protections of human subjects and intellectual property. The results
   help guide strategies to increase data sharing behaviors and to increase
   participation of researchers with multiethnic biospecimen collections in
   collaborative research endeavors
   Conclusions
   Data sharing by researchers is essential to leveraging knowledge and
   resources needed for the advancement of research on cancer health
   disparities. Although U.S. funding entities have guidelines for data and
   resource sharing, future efforts should address researcher preferences
   in order to promote collaboration to address cancer health disparities.

AB Recent developments in genetics and molecular biology have classified
   breast cancer into subtypes based on tumor markers of estrogen (ER),
   progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth Factor-2 receptors (Her-2),
   with the basal-like (ER-, PR-, Her2-) subtype commonly referred to as
   "triple negative" breast cancer (TNBC) being the most aggressive. Prior
   studies have provided evidence that higher socio-economic status (SES)
   is associated with increased breast cancer risk, likely due to hormone
   related risk factors such as parity and hormonal contraceptive use.
   However, it is unclear if the relationship between SES and overall
   breast cancer incidence exists within each subtype, and if this
   association varies by race/ethnicity. Analysis was based on data
   obtained from the SEER database linked to 2008-2012 American Community
   Survey data, and restricted to women diagnosed with breast cancer in
   2010. The NCI SES census tract SES index based on measures of income,
   poverty, unemployment, occupational class, education and house value,
   was examined and categorized into quintiles. Age-adjusted incidence rate
   ratios were calculated comparing the lowest to the highest SES groups by
   subtype, separately for each race/ethnic group. We identified 47,586
   women with breast cancer diagnosed in 2010. The majority was diagnosed
   with Her2-/HR+ tumors (73 %), while 12 % had triple negative tumors
   (TNBC). There was a significant trend of higher incidence with
   increasing SES for Her2-/HR+ (IRR Highest vs. Lowest SES: 1.32, 95 % CI
   1.27-1.39; p value trend: 0.01) and Her2+/HR+ tumors (IRR Highest vs.
   Lowest SES: 1.46, 95 % CI 1.27-1.68; p value trend: 0.01) among White
   cases. There was no association between SES and incidence of HR-subtypes
   (Her2+/HR-or TNBC). Similar associations were observed among Black,
   Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander cases. The positive association
   between SES and breast cancer incidence is primarily driven by hormone
   receptor positive tumors. To the extent that neighborhood SES is a proxy
   for individual SES, future studies are still needed to identify
   etiologic risk factors for other breast cancer subtypes.

AB This paper reviews key issues found to affect acceptability and
   preferences for vaginal products to prevent HIV infection or HIV and
   pregnancy. We focus on the interplay between the biological and
   physico-chemical aspects of formulation and the social and behavioral
   issues that may affect use. The need for an HIV prevention product that
   women can use is driven by women's increased biological and social
   vulnerability to HIV infection, and thus social and behavioral research
   on microbicide acceptability has been conducted alongside, as well as
   separate from, the earliest product development efforts. Some
   acceptability and preference issues are specific to a product's dosage
   form, use-requirements, and/or use indications, while others pertain to
   any vaginal product used for prevention of HIV or pregnancy. Although
   most of the work cited here was published since 2010, it draws on a much
   longer trajectory of research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Perceptions of the residential environment may be associated with
   preterm delivery (PTD), though few studies exist. Data from the
   Life-course Influences on Fetal Environments (LIFE) Study (metropolitan
   Detroit, Michigan, 2009-2011) were used to examine whether perceptions
   of the current social and physical environment were associated with PTD
   rates among postpartum African-American women (n = 1,411). Perceptions
   of the following neighborhood characteristics were measured with
   validated multi-item scales: healthy food availability, walkability,
   safety, social cohesion, and social disorder. No significant
   associations between perceived residential environment and PTD were
   found in the total sample. However, education significantly modified 4
   of the 5 associations (all interaction P's < 0.05). In women with a
   parts per thousand currency sign12 years of education, significant
   inverse associations were observed between PTD rates and perceptions of
   the following neighborhood characteristics: healthy food availability
   (unadjusted prevalence ratio (uPR) = 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI):
   0.68, 0.98), walkability (uPR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.95), and safety
   (uPR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.95). Women with a parts per thousand
   currency sign12 years of education also had higher PTD rates with higher
   social disorder (age-adjusted PR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.10, 2.17). Null
   associations existed for women with > 12 years of education. The PTD
   rates of women with lower education may be significantly affected by the
   physical and social residential environment.

AB Few analyses in the United States have examined geographic variation and
   socioeconomic disparities in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
   incidence, because of lack of population-based incidence data. In this
   analysis, we used population-based ALS data to identify whether ALS
   incidence clusters geographically and to determine whether ALS risk
   varies by area-based socioeconomic status (SES). This study included 493
   incident ALS cases diagnosed (via El Escorial criteria) in New Jersey
   between 2009 and 2011. Geographic variation and clustering of ALS
   incidence was assessed using a spatial scan statistic and Bayesian
   geoadditive models. Poisson regression was used to estimate the
   associations between ALS risk and SES based on census-tract median
   income while controlling for age, sex, and race. ALS incidence varied
   across and within counties, but there were no statistically significant
   geographic clusters. SES was associated with ALS incidence. After
   adjustment for age, sex, and race, the relative risk of ALS was
   significantly higher (relative risk (RR) = 1.37, 95% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.02, 1.82) in the highest income quartile than in the lowest. The
   relative risk of ALS was significantly lower among blacks (RR = 0.57,
   95% CI: 0.39, 0.83) and Asians (RR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.97) than
   among whites. Our findings suggest that ALS incidence in New Jersey
   appears to be associated with SES and race.

AB Decisions to help those in need are essential for human development and
   survival. Previous studies have demonstrated the "identified effect", in
   which one identifiable individual typically invokes stronger feelings of
   compassion and receives greater aid than statistical victim. However,
   this preference might be influenced by cultural differences. In the
   current study, Chinese respondents' ratings of distress and sympathy and
   their willingness to contribute are greater for a group of sick children
   than an individual. In the U.S., greater willingness to help and
   sympathy are elicited by an identified victim in comparison with an
   unidentified one. The different results may demonstrate the importance
   of cultural differences when trying to understand people's prosocial
   behavior.

AB IMPORTANCE The proportion of women at the rank of full professor in US
   medical schools has not increased since 1980 and remains below that of
   men. Whether differences in age, experience, specialty, and research
   productivity between sexes explain persistent disparities in faculty
   rank has not been studied.
   OBJECTIVE To analyze sex differences in faculty rank among US academic
   physicians.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We analyzed sex differences in faculty
   rank using a cross-sectional comprehensive database of US physicians
   with medical school faculty appointments in 2014 (91 073 physicians;
   9.1% of all US physicians), linked to information on physician sex, age,
   years since residency, specialty, authored publications, National
   Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, and clinical trial investigation. We
   estimated sex differences in full professorship, as well as a combined
   outcome of associate or full professorship, adjusting for these factors
   in a multilevel (hierarchical) model. We also analyzed how sex
   differences varied with specialty and whether differences were more
   prevalent at schools ranked highly in research.
   EXPOSURES Physician sex.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Academic faculty rank.
   RESULTS In all, there were 30 464 women who were medical faculty vs 60
   609 men. Of those, 3623 women (11.9%) vs 17 354 men (28.6%) had
   full-professor appointments, for an absolute difference of -16.7%(95%
   CI, -17.3% to -16.2%). Women faculty were younger and disproportionately
   represented in internal medicine and pediatrics. The mean total number
   of publications for women was 11.6 vs 24.8 for men, for a difference of
   -13.2 (95% CI, -13.6 to -12.7); the mean first-or last-author
   publications for women was 5.9 vs 13.7 for men, for a difference of -7.8
   (95% CI, -8.1 to -7.5). Among 9.1% of medical faculty with an NIH grant,
   6.8%(2059 of 30 464) were women and 10.3%(6237 of 60 609) were men, for
   a difference of -3.5%(95% CI, -3.9% to -3.1%). In all, 6.4% of women vs
   8.8% of men had a trial registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, for a
   difference of -2.4%(95% CI, -2.8% to -2.0%). After multivariable
   adjustment, women were less likely than men to have achieved
   full-professor status (absolute adjusted difference in proportion,
   -3.8%; 95% CI, -4.4% to -3.3%). Sex-differences in full professorship
   were present across all specialties and did not vary according to
   whether a physician's medical school was ranked highly in terms of
   research funding.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among physicians with faculty appointments at
   US medical schools, there were sex differences in academic faculty rank,
   with women substantially less likely than men to be full professors,
   after accounting for age, experience, specialty, and measures of
   research productivity.

AB Proximity logging is a new tool for understanding social behavior as it
   allows for accurate quantification of social networks. We report results
   from field calibration and deployment tests of miniaturized proximity
   tags (Encounternet), digital transceivers that log encounters between
   tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tag
   attachment (tag, tag on bird, tag on saline-filled balloon) to
   understand how radio signal strength is affected by the tag mounting
   technique used for calibration tests. We investigated inter-tag and
   inter-receiver station variability, and in each calibration test we
   accounted for the effects of antennae orientation. Additionally, we used
   data from a live deployment on breeding barn swallows (Hirundo rustica
   erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs, including reciprocal
   agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass
   changes) of tag attachment on the birds. We were able to statistically
   distinguish between RSSI values associated with different
   close-proximity (<5m) tag-tag distances regardless of antennae
   orientation. Inter-tag variability was low, but we did find significant
   inter-receiver station variability. Reciprocal agreement of dyadic logs
   was high and social networks were constructed from proximity tag logs
   based on two different RSSI thresholds. There was no evidence of
   significant mass loss in the time birds were wearing tags. We conclude
   that proximity loggers are accurate and effective for quantifying social
   behavior. However, because RSSI and distance cannot be perfectly
   resolved, data from proximity loggers are most appropriate for comparing
   networks based on specific RSSI thresholds. The Encounternet system is
   flexible and customizable, and tags are now light enough for use on
   small animals (<50g).

AB Hunting is an integral part of North American cultures, providing a
   powerful connection to the outdoors for millions of people and
   generating billions of dollars to local and national economies.
   Socially, hunting has been part of hominid cultures since very early in
   the fossil record; a tradition that contemporary North American hunters
   tend to pass down to subsequent generations through family and community
   networks. The 13.7 million American hunters and 2.1 million Canadian
   nature-recreationists spend more than $38.3 billion and $1.8 billion,
   respectively, on non-commercial hunting-related expenses each year.
   Hunting activities also yield hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions
   of dollars in tax and other revenues in both countries. The
   contributions of hunters serve as the fundamental foundation for a
   social and economic support system for conserving wildlife and habitats
   for future generations.

   we examine whether change in resources and empowerment in mother's roles
   as biological mothers, caregivers, and providers and social contexts
   that promote the rights and representation of and investment in women
   are associated with better nutritional status and survival of young
   children. Analysis is based on a broad sample of countries (n = 28),
   with data at two or more points in time to enable examination of change.
   Key indicators of child health show improvement in the last 13 years in
   developing nations. Much of this improvement90 percent of the increase
   in nutritional status and 47 percent of the reduction in mortalityis
   associated with improving status of women. Increased maternal education,
   control over reproduction, freedom from violence, access to health care,
   legislation and enforcement of women's rights, greater political
   representation, equality in the education system, and lower maternal
   mortality are improving children's health. These results imply that
   further advancement of women's position in society would be beneficial.

   positive and negative coping, social support, and HIV stigma as
   predictors of physical and global functioning in a cross-sectional
   sample of 317 HIV-infected adult heterosexual male patients recruited
   from clinical and social service agencies in New York City. Study
   participants were primarily minority and low income. Sixty-four percent
   were African-American, 55% were single, and 90% were 40 years of age or
   older. The majority had long-term HIV (LTHIV), with an average duration
   of 15 years since diagnosis. After controlling for participant
   characteristics, structural equation modeling analyses revealed that
   positive coping and social support had a significant positive direct
   effect on global functioning, while stigma had a significant negative
   direct effect on global functioning. The physical functioning model
   revealed that negative coping and HIV stigma had significant negative
   direct effects, whereas social support had a significant positive
   indirect effect. Age and duration of HIV diagnosis were not associated
   with physical and global functioning. In conclusion, we found that
   heterosexual men living with LTHIV who have ineffective coping, less
   social support, and greater stigma have reduced functioning ability.
   Study findings have implications for developing interventions aimed at
   increasing and retaining functioning ability with the end goal of
   improving successful aging in this population.

   associated with adrenocortical reactivity to social stress. Participants
   (N = 94; 36.17% male; M-age = 20.18 yrs; 62.8% Caucasian) completed a
   writing task on a salient problem in society, provided self-report via
   questionnaire of rejection sensitivity, and were then informed that a
   committee of peers would evaluate their written comments. Participants
   received either scripted praise or criticism as a way to induce social
   evaluative threat. Saliva was collected before and after the stress task
   and assayed for cortisol. Results revealed that cortisol levels
   increased in participants with moderate levels of social rejection
   sensitivity inferred by rs53576 genotype and reported rejection
   sensitivity while cortisol levels decreased in participants with high
   and low levels of social rejection sensitivity. Our findings suggest a
   curvilinear relationship between social rejection sensitivity and

AB 'Barefoot doctors' were designed as an innovative task force during the
   Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) to provide health care to rural villages
   in China. Without formal training that would identify the group
   professionally, barefoot doctors were at once amateur medical
   practitioners and expert revolutionary actors in Communist Party
   propaganda. At stake in legitimating revolutionary medicine was allowing
   revolutionary spirit to supplement for minimal medical training. As a
   result, the symbolic power of representing barefoot doctors rested in
   showcasing their devotion to enhancing access to health care in rural
   China. These representations followed an intensifying militarization of
   civilians, embracing the barefoot doctor's ability to survive any
   obstacle while also celebrating those who died in the process. This
   paper examines three public portrayals of barefoot doctors, arguing that
   conflicting idealizations of rural epistemology combined the opposing
   elements of self-cultivation and self-annihilation to unite the identity
   of an emerging group of amateur doctors and illustrate acceptable forms
   of medical and revolutionary expertise.

AB Objectives. We investigated how racial/ethnic shifts in the urban
   landscape influence race-specific violence by considering changes in the
   size of the Hispanic population, racial/ethnic contact, and racial
   segregation patterns.
   Methods. We used a time-series approach incorporating 4 decennial
   periods (1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) to determine whether racial/ethnic
   demographic changes in 144 US cities influenced White and Black homicide
   rates. Sources included census and Uniform Crime Reports Supplemental
   Homicide Report data.
   Results. The growing diversity in the residential population of US
   cities contributed to the dramatic decline in homicide rates over time,
   but the effects differed by racial group. Exposure between Hispanics and
   Blacks and the growing presence of Hispanics led to a reduced Black
   homicide trend but had no impact on Whites, after adjustment for
   economic shifts and other important structural features in US cities.
   Conclusions. Our research highlights the importance of paying closer
   attention to exposure and integration between immigrants and existing
   racial groups. Failure to consider racial/ethnic contact and the racial
   nature of urban violence may produce misleading results in studies of
   associations between Hispanic immigration and crime.

AB Objectives. We assessed sociodemographic disparities in local 100%
   smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking in all indoor areas of
   nonhospitality worksites, restaurants, and bars in 10 states.
   Methods. We obtained data on local 100% smoke-free laws (US Tobacco
   Control Laws Database) and subcounty characteristics (2006-2010 American
   Community Survey) for Alabama, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi,
   Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia.
   Outcomes included (1) 100% smoke-free law covering restaurants, bars,
   and workplaces; (2) 100% smoke-free law covering restaurants, bars, or
   workplaces; and (3) number of venue types covered by 100% smoke-free
   laws (0-3). Sociodemographics included total population, urban status,
   percentage racial/ethnic minority, per capita income, percentage with
   high-school diploma, percentage with blue-collar jobs, and percentage of
   workers who live and work in the same locality.
   Results. Across states, localities with less-educated residents, smaller
   proportions of workers living and working in the same locality, or both
   generally had lower odds of being covered by 100% smoke-free laws.
   Coverage varied across states for other sociodemographics.
   Conclusions. Disparities exist in local smoke-free law coverage.
   Identifying patterns in coverage can inform state efforts to address
   related disparities.

AB The relationship between police violence and race is one fraught with
   both specific historical and contemporary tensions (i.e., white police
   profiling, beating, and murder of people of color) and with ambiguity
   (e.g., what is meant by "race" and how do we operationalize and measure
   "violence" at the hands of law enforcement?). Defining the concept of
   "race" as a multidimensional process of oppression and justification for
   social inequality can shed light on why and how police violence often
   descends upon black and Latino populations as well as why such brutality
   and state surveillance is supported by many whites yesterday and today.
   In this article I analyze the relationships between police violence and
   race as an ongoing feedback loop: "race" produces violence and
   inequality while violence and inequality (re) forms "race." Their
   intertwined formation reproduces the dominant meanings and structural
   location of racial groups in five key domains: ideologies, institutions,
   interests, identities, and interactions - what I call "The Five I's."

AB I argue that sociologists have directed insufficient attention to the
   study of citizenship. When citizenship is studied, sociologists tend to
   concentrate on just one facet: rights. I elaborate four conceptual
   facets of citizenship. I link two-citizenship as rights and belonging-to
   theoretical elaborations of multiculturalism. Considering
   multiculturalism as a state discourse and set of policies, rather than a
   political or normative theory, I outline linkages between
   multiculturalism and two additional facets of citizenship: legal status
   and participation. Over the last 15 years, the idea of multiculturalism
   has come under withering criticism, especially in Europe, in part
   because it is claimed that multiculturalism undermines common
   citizenship. Yet countries with more multicultural policies and a
   stronger discourse of pluralism and recognition are places where
   immigrants are more likely to become citizens, more trusting of
   political institutions, and more attached to the national identity.
   There is also little evidence that multicultural policies fuel majority
   backlash, and some modest evidence that such policies enlarge
   conceptions of inclusive membership. By studying claims-making and the
   equality of immigrant-origin groups, we see that the participatory
   aspect of citizenship needs to take center stage in future work in
   political sociology, social theory, social movements, immigration, and
   race/ethnicity.

AB Objective To examine pediatric emergency department (ED) visits over 5
   years, trends in injury severity, and associations between
   injury-related ED visit outcome and patient and community-level
   sociodemographic characteristics.
   Study design Retrospective analysis of administrative data provided to
   the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Core Data Project,
   2004-2008. Home addresses were geocoded to determine census block group
   and associated sociodemographic characteristics. Maximum Abbreviated
   Injury Scale severity and Severity Classification System scores were
   calculated. Generalized estimating equations were used to test for
   associations between sociodemographic characteristics and admission or
   transfer among injury-related ED visits.
   Results Overall ED visits and injury-related visits increased from 2004
   to 2008 at study sites. Of 2 833 676 successfully geocoded visits, 700
   821 (24.7%) were injury-related. The proportion of higher severity
   injury-related visits remained consistent. Nearly 10% of injury-related
   visits resulted in admission or transfer each year. After adjusting for
   age, sex, payer, and injury severity, odds of admission or transfer were
   lower among minority children and children from areas with moderate and
   high prevalence of poverty.
   Conclusions Pediatric injury-related ED visits to included sites
   increased over the study period while injury severity, anticipated
   resource utilization, and visit outcomes remained stable, with lowrates
   of admission or transfer. Sociodemographic differences in injury-related
   visits and ED disposition were apparent. ED-based injury surveillance is
   essential to understand disparities, inform targets for prevention
   programs, and reduce the overall burden of childhood injuries.

AB Acculturation is a difficult process for minority older adults for a
   variety of reasons, including access and exposure to mainstream culture,
   competing ethnic identities, and linguistic ability and preference.
   There is a paucity of research regarding overall level of acculturation
   for Chinese older adults in the United States. This study aimed to
   provide an overall estimate of level of acculturation of Chinese older
   adults in the United States and to examine correlations between
   sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported health measures, and
   level of acculturation. Data were collected through the Population Study
   of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) study. This community-based
   participatory research study surveyed 3,159 Chinese older adults aged 60
   and older. The PINE Study Acculturation Scale was used to assess level
   of acculturation in three dimensions: language preference, media use,
   and ethnic social relations. Mean acculturation level for all items was
   15.3 +/- 5.1, indicating low levels of acculturation. Older age, more
   offspring, lower income, fewer years living in the United States, lower
   overall health status, and lower quality of life were associated with
   lower levels of acculturation. Level of acculturation was low in Chinese
   older adults, and certain subsets of the population were more likely to
   have a lower level of acculturation. Future research should investigate
   causality and effects of level of acculturation.

AB Background
   Cryptosporidium are parasitic protozoa that infect humans, domestic
   animals, and wildlife globally. In the United States, cryptosporidiosis
   occurs in an estimated 750,000 persons annually, and is primarily caused
   by either of the Cryptosporidium parvum genotypes 1 and 2, exposure to
   which occurs through ingestion of food or water contaminated with
   oocytes shed from infected hosts. Although most cryptosporidiosis cases
   are caused by genotype 1 and are of human origin, the zoonotic sources
   of genotype 2, such as livestock, are increasingly recognized as
   important for understanding human disease patterns. Social inequality
   could mediate patterns of human exposure and infection by placing
   individuals in environments where food or water contamination and
   livestock contact is high or through reducing the availability of
   educational and sanitary resources required to avoid exposure.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We here analyzed data from the National Health and Nutritional
   Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2000, and related
   seropositivity to Cryptosporidium parvum to correlates of social
   inequality at the household and individual scale. After accounting for
   the complex sampling design of NHANES and confounding by individual
   demographics and household conditions, we found impaired household food
   adequacy was associated with greater odds of Cryptosporidium
   seropositivity. Additionally, we identified individuals of non-white
   race and ethnicity and those born outside the United States as having
   significantly greater risk than white, domestic-born counterparts.
   Furthermore, we provide suggestive evidence for direct effects of family
   wealth on Cryptosporidium seropositivity, in that persons from
   low-income households and from families close to the poverty threshold
   had elevated odds of seropositivity relative to those in high-income
   families and in households far above the poverty line.
   Conclusions/Significance
   These results refute assertions that cryptosporidiosis in the United
   States is independent of social marginalization and poverty, and carry
   implications for targeted public health interventions for
   Cryptosporidium infection in resource-poor groups. Future longitudinal
   and multilevel studies are necessary to elucidate the complex
   interactions between ecological factors, social inequality, and
   Cryptosporidium dynamics.

AB Objective: The present study examined familial risk and protective
   factors as moderators of parents allowing their adolescent children to
   drink at home on longitudinal alcohol involvement trajectories. Method:
   A total of 772 community adolescents and their parents provided data
   beginning in 1989 and at four subsequent time points over 15 years;
   Black adolescents were intentionally oversampled (50% at baseline).
   Results: Outcomes related to allowing adolescents to drink at home
   depended on family structure: Adolescents from intact families who were
   allowed to drink at home showed the lowest levels of alcohol use and
   problems over time, whereas those from nonintact families who were
   allowed to drink at home showed the highest levels of involvement. These
   results controlled for family history of alcohol problems, consistent
   parenting styles, and demographic characteristics. Conclusions: Results
   suggest that allowing adolescents to drink at home is neither inherently
   protective nor risky but depends on the family context. Implications for
   the development of adolescent alcohol involvement are discussed.

AB Objective: The aim of this investigation was to test hypothesized

   a two-wave prospective study, 328 European American, 328 African
   American, and 144 Hispanic American youth were studied at the end of
   fifth grade (last year of elementary school) and the end of sixth grade
   (first year of middle school). Results: A positive correlation was
   observed between alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms among all
   youth. However, the predictive relationship differed based on race. For
   European American and Hispanic American youth, depressive symptom levels
   at the end of elementary school predicted alcohol consumption at the end
   of the first year of middle school, but the converse relationship was
   not observed. For African American youth, the opposite pattern was
   found. Alcohol consumption at the end of elementary school predicted
   depressive symptom levels at the end of the first year of middle school,
   and the converse relationship was not observed. Conclusions: These
   findings suggest the possibility that etiological relationships between
   depression and alcohol use vary by race, thus highlighting the
   importance of considering race when studying the risk process.

AB Objective: This study examined the extent to which perceived social
   support is related to longitudinal treatment outcomes among heavy
   drinkers randomized to a brief, telephone-based care management
   intervention versus standard care. Method: This is a secondary analysis
   of data from a randomized trial comparing an enhanced, brief alcohol
   intervention to standard care. Participants comprised 136 male, heavy
   drinkers (mean age = 57.3 years) receiving primary care at Corporal
   Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinics.
   Participants in the intervention arm received a telephone-based care
   management intervention focused on helping patients reduce their alcohol
   use. Primary measures included the Timeline Followback method for number
   of heavy drinking days and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived
   Social Support for self-reported baseline social support. Results:
   Although there was no significant main effect for baseline perceived
   social support on number of heavy drinking days over time, there was a
   significant three-way interaction (Perceived Social Support x
   Randomization Group x Time). Specifically, among patients reporting high
   support, those randomized to the intervention arm experienced
   significantly greater declines in number of heavy drinking days over
   time. Conversely, among patients reporting low support, those randomized
   to standard care experienced more improvement over the course of
   follow-up. Conclusions: Perceived social support may be related to
   differential outcomes depending on whether patients are in care
   management or standard care. For those receiving brief intervention,
   certain therapy techniques may mobilize pre-existing social resources
   and/or enhance the ability for patients to use their social supports,
   suggesting the need for replication and further research in
   understanding this interaction.

AB In early modern Europe, popular hostility toward criminals could be
   expressed through the use of the pillory (a device in which offenders
   were restrained and publicly displayed). Modern electronic
   communications have facilitated the emergence of contemporary versions
   of the pillory. One such example is prodeathpenalty. com, a Web site
   created by supporters of capital punishment that permits members to post
   comments about particular executions. Most such comments are markedly
   hostile toward the convicted offender. But is the hostility random or
   patterned? A new theory by Donald Black predicts that hostility will
   increase with changes in social space, or the movement of social time.
   Testing Black's theory, we find that the number of online comments
   hostile to the killer and supportive of the execution increases with the
   degree to which the murder was a movement of relational, vertical, and
   cultural time. Moving beyond the electronic pillory, we argue that
   Black's theory has much to offer to law and society scholars.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of primary care providers
   (PCPs) regarding the presence and underlying sources of racial/ethnic
   and socioeconomic disparities in hypertension control.
   METHODS
   We conducted a survey of 115 PCPs from 2 large academic centers in
   Colorado. We included physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician
   assistants. The survey assessed provider recognition and perceived
   contributors of disparities in hypertension control.
   RESULTS
   Respondents were primarily female (66%), non-Hispanic White (84%), and
   physicians (80%). Among respondents, 67% and 73% supported the
   collection of data on the patients' race/ethnicity and socioeconomic
   status (SES), respectively. Eighty-six percent and 89% agreed that
   disparities in race/ethnicity and SES existed in hypertension care
   within the US health system. However, only 33% and 44% thought
   racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities existed in the care of their
   own patients. Providers were more likely to perceive patient factors
   rather than provider or health system factors as mediators of
   disparities. However, most supported interventions such as improving
   provider communication skills (87%) and cultural competency training
   (89%) to reduce disparities in hypertension control.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Most providers acknowledged that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
   disparities in hypertension control exist in the US health system, but
   only a minority reported disparities in care among patients they
   personally treat. Our study highlights the need for testing an
   intervention aimed at increasing provider awareness of disparities
   within the local health setting to improve hypertension control for
   minority patients.

AB The first postnatal year is characterized by the most dramatic
   functional network development of the human lifespan. Yet, the relative
   sequence of the maturation of different networks and the impact of
   socioeconomic status (SES) on their development during this critical
   period remains poorly characterized. Leveraging a large, normally
   developing infant sample with multiple longitudinal resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during the first year (N=65,
   scanned every 3 months), we aimed to delineate the relative maturation
   sequence of 9 key brain functional networks and examine their SES
   correlations. Our results revealed a maturation sequence from primary
   sensorimotor/auditory to visual to attention/default-mode, and finally
   to executive control networks. Network-specific critical growth periods
   were also identified. Finally, marginally significant positive SES-brain
   correlations were observed at 6 months of age for both the sensorimotor
   and default-mode networks, indicating interesting SES effects on
   functional brain maturation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first study delineating detailed longitudinal growth trajectories of all
   major functional networks during the first year of life and their SES
   correlations. Insights from this study not only improve our
   understanding of early brain development, but may also inform the
   critical periods for SES expression during infancy.

AB A rapid increase in the empirical literature on ethnic-racial
   socialization has led to the development of numerous assessments that
   capture various aspects of the ethnic-racial socialization process. To
   examine the methodological advances, this paper uses the Process Model
   of Ethnic-Racial Socialization (PMERS) to systematically review the
   assessment of ethnic-racial socialization among ethnic minority families
   in order to review how existing measures assess differential processes
   of ethnic-racial socialization. Using PsycINFO, ERIC, IngentaConnect,
   and JSTOR databases, 41 measures were identified that report information
   on the ethnic-racial socialization process. Findings suggest that
   existing measures largely consist of explicit assessments of parental
   and/or youth beliefs and verbal behaviors as measures of the
   ethnic-racial socialization process. Few measures have captured the
   behavioral and affective domains of the ethnic-racial socialization
   process and the implicit and subtle transmission of messages regarding
   race and ethnicity. Further, methodological approaches in the assessment

AB A central hypothesis about discrimination is that prejudice forces the
   stigmatized into low-paying, undesirable jobs. Prejudice clearly leads
   to exclusion. But surprisingly, evidence linking exclusion to
   disadvantage is mixed. We address this issue theoretically, providing a
   formal rational choice model combining arguments from sociology ( on
   prejudice) and economics ( on competition). Our theory suggests that
   economic organization is crucial. In economies dominated by monopoly,
   oligarchy, tradition, or government, prejudice may reduce some workers'
   pay, and a disadvantageous secondary labor market may emerge. By
   contrast, in competitive free markets, exclusionary discrimination often
   occurs but does not reduce workers' pay, nor does it induce a
   disadvantageous secondary labor market. Our theory suggests the
   conventional analytic approach to discrimination is misguided: Exclusion
   does not necessarily imply disadvantage; a shortfall in pay does not
   necessarily imply that the lower paid worker is disadvantaged; and
   analysis should focus on the overall subjective well-being or utility
   derived from a job, not on pay alone.

AB Social scientists have drawn on theories of embeddedness to explain the
   different ways legal, political, and cultural frameworks shape markets.
   Often overlooked, however, is how the materiality of nature also
   structures markets. In this article, I suggest that neo-Polanyian
   scholars, and economic sociologists more generally, should better engage
   in a historical sociology of concept formation to problematize the human
   exemptionalist paradigm their work upholds and recognize the role of
   nature in shaping markets and society. Unearthing nature in the work of
   Karl Polanyi, I develop a theory of embeddedness that more closely
   accounts for the economic, the social, and the ecological. In doing so,
   I provide a way for scholars to conceptualize both how market societies
   shape nature and how nature shapes market societies.

AB In response to social-evaluative threat induced in the laboratory, lower
   (compared to higher) subjective social class of a participant predicts
   greater increases in the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). In
   spite of the interpersonal nature of social-evaluation, little work has
   explored whether characteristics of the evaluator shape physiological
   responses in this context. In the current study, in a sample of 190
   college students (male = 66), we explored whether one's subjective
   social class interacts with the perceived social class of an evaluator
   to predict changes in Oral Mucosal Transudate (OMT) IL-6 in response to
   the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Participants were randomly assigned
   to be the speaker or the evaluator. Extending past work, we found that
   while speakers low in subjective social class consistently respond with
   strong increases in IL-6 regardless of their perception of their
   evaluator's social class, speakers high in subjective social class
   responded with greater increases in IL-6 when their evaluator was
   perceived as high social class compared to when they were perceived as
   low social class. This finding highlights the importance of perceptions
   of the evaluator in informing inflammatory responses to a
   social-evaluative task. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The magnitude of genetic diversity within human populations varies in a
   way that reflects the sequence of migrations by which people spread
   throughout the world. Beyond its use in human evolutionary genetics,
   worldwide variation in genetic diversity sometimes can interact with
   social processes to produce differences among populations in their
   relationship to modern societal problems. We review the consequences of
   genetic diversity differences in the settings of familial identification
   in forensic genetic testing, match probabilities in bone marrow
   transplantation, and representation in genome-wide association studies
   of disease. In each of these three cases, the contribution of genetic
   diversity to social differences follows from population-genetic
   principles. For a fourth setting that is not similarly grounded, we
   reanalyze with expanded genetic data a report that genetic diversity
   differences influence global patterns of human economic development,
   finding no support for the claim. The four examples describe a limit to
   the importance of genetic diversity for explaining societal differences
   while illustrating a distinction that certain biologically based
   scenarios do require consideration of genetic diversity for solving
   problems to which populations have been differentially predisposed by
   the unique history of human migrations.

AB Social anxiety the fear of social embarrassment and negative evaluation
   by others ranks among peoples worst fears, and it is often thought to
   impair task performance. We investigated the neurocognitive processes
   through which trait social anxiety relates to task performance,
   proposing a model of the joint contributions of reactive control,
   theoretically associated with conflict monitoring and activity of the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and proactive control,
   theoretically associated with top-down regulation and activity of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Participants varying in their
   degree of trait social anxiety completed the Eriksen flanker task while
   electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Task-related left dlPFC
   activity was indexed by relative left prefrontal EEG (inverse alpha),
   and conflict-related dACC activity was indexed by the N2r component of
   the event-related potential. Stronger activity in both regions predicted
   better response control, and greater social anxiety was associated with
   worse response control. Furthermore, for all participants, greater left
   prefrontal EEG activity predicted better behavioral control, but for
   high social anxiety participants only, greater N2r responses also
   predicted behavioral control. This pattern suggests that low social
   anxiety individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by dlPFC
   activity, whereas high social anxiety individuals relied additionally on
   a reactive control process, driven by conflict-related dACC activity.
   These findings support a model of control that involves different
   patterns of interplay between proactive and reactive strategies and may
   help to explain self-regulatory impairments in social anxiety. (C) 2015

AB BACKGROUND: Trauma research has been limited by perceived patient
   reluctance to participate in exception from informed consent (EFIC)
   studies. We hypothesized that race, socioeconomic status, and proximity
   to violence influence willingness to participate in and perception of
   EFIC research among at-risk populations.
   METHODS: Trauma patients, families, and community members ranked
   statements regarding attitude toward EFIC in the context of an upcoming
   trial and willingness to participate in emergency research using a
   5-point Likert scale during a community consultation. Higher total
   scores reflected a more positive attitude regarding EFIC (range, 6-30;
   neutral, 18) and willingness (range, 23-115; neutral, 69). Subject zip
   code was used to calculate median income, as an estimate for
   socioeconomic status, and proximity to the five most violent city zip
   codes. Linear regression, Spearman's correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis
   tests (p < 0.05) were used to evaluate relationships between estimated
   socioeconomic status, race, mechanism of injury, proximity to violence,
   and attitudes toward EFIC.
   RESULTS: A total of 179 subjects participated including trauma patients
   (n = 99), families (n = 33), and community members (n = 47). Overall,
   participants were supportive of EFIC and reported high scores in
   willingness to participate (median, 24; interquartile range, 21-25;
   median 89, interquartile range, 82-95, respectively). Proximity to
   violence did correlate with race (p = 0.03) but was not associated with
   violent mechanism of injury, perception of EFIC, or willingness to
   participate in emergency research. Estimated socioeconomic status and
   race did not correlate with perception of or willingness to participate
   in EFIC.
   CONCLUSION: Based on our data, there is no correlation between either
   proximity to violence or estimated socioeconomic status and willingness
   to participate in EFIC research. Given this lack of correlation,
   researchers should partner with at-risk communities to conduct EFIC
   studies without concern for limited participation. (J Trauma Acute Care

AB BACKGROUND: Adolescence is a formative period when health care services
   have a unique opportunity to influence later health outcomes. Unmet
   health care need in adolescence is known to be associated with poor
   contemporaneous health outcomes; it is unknown whether it predicts poor
   adult health outcomes.
   METHODS: We used nationally representative data from 14 800 subjects who
   participated in Wave I (mean age: 15.9 years [1994/1995]) and Wave IV
   (mean age: 29.6 years [2008]) of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent to Adult Health. Logistic regression models were used to
   estimate the association between unmet health care need in adolescence
   and 5 self-reported measures of adult health (fair/poor general health,
   functional impairment, time off work/school, depressive symptoms, and
   suicidal ideation). Models were adjusted for baseline health, insurance
   category, age, gender, race/ethnicity, household income, and parental
   education.
   RESULTS: Unmet health care need was reported by 19.2% of adolescents and
   predicted worse adult health: fair/poor general health (adjusted odds
   ratio [aOR]: 1.27 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.60]); functional
   impairment (aOR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.23-1.87]); depressive symptoms (aOR:
   1.36 [95% CI: 1.13-1.64]); and suicidal ideation (aOR: 1.30 [95% CI:
   1.03-1.68]). There was no significant association between unmet health
   care need and time off work/school (aOR: 1.13 [95% CI: 0.93-1.36]). Cost
   barriers accounted for only 14.8% of unmet health care need. The reason
   for unmet need was not significantly related to the likelihood of poor
   adult health outcomes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Reported unmet health care need in adolescence is common
   and is an independent predictor of poor adult health. Strategies to
   reduce unmet adolescent need should address health engagement and care
   quality, as well as cost barriers to accessing services.

AB Objective. We conducted an ecological study to determine physical
   activity resource availability overall and by sociodemographic groups in
   parts of six states (CA, IL, MD, MN, NC, NY).
   Methods. Data on parks and recreational facilities were collected from 3
   sources in 2009-2012. Three measures characterized park and recreational
   facility availability at the census tract level: presence of resource,
   number of resources, and >= 1 resource kernel density. Associations
   between resource availability and census tract characteristics
   (predominant racial/ethnic group, median income, and proportion of
   children and older adults) were estimated using linear, binomial, and
   zero-inflated negative binomial regression in 2014. Pooled and
   stratified analyses were conducted.
   Results. The study included 7139 census tracts, comprising 9.5% of the
   2010 US population. Overall the availability of parks and recreational
   facilities was lower in predominantly minority relative to non-Hispanic
   white census tracts. Low-income census tracts and those with a higher
   proportion of children had an equal or greater availability of park
   resources but fewer recreational facilities. Stratification revealed
   substantial variation in resource availability by site.
   Conclusion. The availability of physical activity resources varied by
   sociodemographic characteristics and across regions. Improved knowledge
   of resource distribution can inform strategies to provide equitable
   access to parks and recreational facilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

AB BackgroundThe current study evaluated the roles of drinking motives and
   shyness in predicting problem alcohol use over 2years.
   MethodsFirst-year college student drinkers (n=818) completed assessments
   of alcohol use and related problems, shyness, and drinking motives every
   6months over a 2-year period.
   ResultsGeneralized linear mixed models indicated that shyness was
   associated with less drinking, but more alcohol-related problems.
   Further, shyness was associated with coping, conformity, and enhancement
   drinking motives, but was not associated with social drinking motives.
   However, when examining coping motives, moderation analyses revealed
   that social drinking motives were more strongly associated with coping
   motives among individuals higher in shyness. In addition, coping,
   conformity, and enhancement motives, but not social motives, mediated
   associations between shyness and alcohol-related problems over time.
   Finally, coping motives mediated the association between the interaction
   of shyness and social motives and alcohol-related problems.
   ConclusionsTogether, the results suggest that shy individuals may drink
   to reduce negative affect, increase positive affect, and fit in with
   others in social situations, which may then contribute to greater risk
   for subsequent alcohol-related problems.

   Methods Study sample included 6296 Jewish participants in the Israeli
   National Health Interview Survey of 2007-2008. Neighborhoods were
   assigned socioeconomic scores by the Central Bureau of Statistics,
   incorporating 16 demographic and socioeconomic measures using a 20-point

   distribution assessed the relative cumulative odds for decreasing SRH by
   quartiles of NSES, while accounting for neighborhood clustering. Base
   models were adjusted for age, religiosity, immigration from the former
   Soviet Union, education, income, and then additionally for employment,
   living in the periphery and co-morbidity.
   Results We found a strong association between poor SRH and living in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods, after adjusting for individual-level SES.
   The combination of living in deprived areas with below average income
   was associated with over twice the risk of poor SRH.
   Conclusions The association between low NSES and worsening SRH,
   exacerbated by lower income, highlights the importance of considering
   socioeconomic environmental and individual conditions in targeting
   high-risk populations.

   inferences more generally. Important variables for intervention planning
   such as whether inferences depend on physical experiences or the nature
   of social information have received less consideration. A measure of
   bridging inferences of physical causation, mental states, and emotional
   states was administered to older children, adolescents, and adults with
   and without ASD. The ASD group had more difficulty making inferences,
   particularly related to emotional understanding. Results suggest that
   individuals with ASD may not have the stored experiential knowledge that
   specific inferences depend upon or have difficulties accessing relevant
   experiences due to linguistic limitations. Further research is needed to
   tease these elements apart.

AB The purpose of this paper is to gain empirical footing on the mechanisms

   significance to themes of social justice. Using components of the
   ecological footprint, we construct a measure of each nation's relative
   contributions to carbon dioxide emissions after accounting for the
   amount sequestered by domestic forestlands. We refer to this measure as
   the "climate footprint," and construct a structural equation model to
   test key theorizations in the environmental sociology literature. We add
   to this body of work by incorporating and empirically testing
   ecofeminist positions that the status of women is a cause and an effect
   of environmental conditions. Results suggest women and the environment
   are interconnected dimensions of exploitation, as ecological losses
   weaken women's status in nations. We also find that nations with greater
   female representation in governing bodies have lower climate footprints,
   controlling for domestic (urbanization, production) and global
   (world-system integration) drivers. Conclusions point to the potential
   for gender equality and improving the status of women worldwide to
   curtail climate change. Other theoretical and empirical implications are
   treated, including the benefits of bringing women into theories of the
   environment and the utility of structural equation techniques for
   testing hypotheses that specify direct and indirect connections among

AB OBJECTIVE: Maternal mortality rates rose markedly from 2002 to 2006 in
   California, prompting an in-depth maternal mortality review in a state
   that comprises one twelfth of the US birth cohort. Cardiovascular
   disease has emerged as the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in
   the United States. The primary aim of this analysis was to describe the
   incidence and type of cardiovascular disease as a cause of
   pregnancy-related mortality in California. The secondary aims were to
   describe racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities, risk factors,
   birth outcomes, timing of death and diagnosis, and signs and symptoms of
   cardiovascular disease and identify contributing factors.
   STUDY DESIGN: The California Pregnancy-Associated Mortality Review
   retrospectively examined a case series of 64 cardiovascular
   pregnancy-related deaths from 2002 through 2006. Two cardiologists
   independently reviewed complete inpatient and outpatient medical records
   including laboratory, radiology, electrocardiogram, chest Xray,
   echocardiograms, and autopsy findings for each cardiovascular death and
   classified cause of death by type of cardiovascular disease. Demographic
   data, racial disparities, risk factors, signs and symptoms, timing of
   diagnosis and death, birth outcomes, and contributing factors were
   analyzed using bivariate comparisons with non-cardiovascular
   pregnancy-related deaths and population-based data.
   RESULTS: Among 2,741,220 California women who gave birth, 864 died while
   pregnant or within 1 year of pregnancy; 257 of the deaths were deemed
   pregnancy related, and of these, 64 (25%) were attributed to
   cardiovascular disease. There were 42 deaths caused by cardiomyopathy,
   and the pregnancy-related mortality rate from cardiomyopathy was 1.54
   per 100,000 births. Dilated cardiomyopathy existed in 29 cases, of which
   15 met the definition of peripartum cardiomyopathy. Women with
   cardiovascular disease were more likely than women who died from
   noncardiovascular causes to be African-American (39.1% vs 16.1%; P <
   .01) and more likely to use illicit substances (23.7% vs 9.4%; P < .01).
   Thirty-seven percent were obese and 20% had a concomitant diagnosis of
   hypertension or preeclampsia during pregnancy. Health care decisions in
   the diagnosis or treatment of cardiovascular disease during and after
   pregnancy contributed to the fatal outcomes.
   CONCLUSION: African-American race, substance use, and obesity were risk
   factors for pregnancy-related cardiovascular disease mortality. Chronic
   disease prevention and better recognition and response to cardiovascular
   disease during pregnancy are needed to reduce maternal mortality.

   Methods: Analyses used 2003 to 2007 spousal homicide data from
   Supplementary Homicide Reports for which missing data have been multiply
   imputed. Current Population Survey data provided estimates of the number
   and average characteristics of different couple types. Log-linear models
   related couple types' differing spousal homicide rates to different
   race-sex groups' general rates of homicide victimization and offending
   and couple types' average characteristics.
   Results: Among couple types with at least 50,000 couples, annual rates
   of male-on-female spousal homicide ranged from 0.95 to 8.76 per 100,000
   couples; for female-on-male spousal homicide, this range was 0.13 to
   2.29. Rates somewhat reflect different race-sex groups' nonspousal
   homicide activity, but with greater gender disparity and an excess of
   spousal homicide in some couple types. The association between victim's
   and offender's race is parsimoniously described by models using couple
   types' average characteristics (proportion with female's education
   exceeding the male's, proportion in central cities, and relative
   frequency).
   Conclusions: General homicidal-violence reduction strategies may partly
   apply to spousal homicide, but specifically targeted efforts are
   required too. Interventions must address different couple types'
   particular social, economic, and cultural experiences. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Background: The present study examined the influence of neighborhood
   factors on transitions in marijuana involvement during adolescence in a
   sample of primarily low-income, urban Black youth.
   Methods: 556 Black adolescents were interviewed annually beginning in
   first grade as part of a longitudinal study. Latent class analysis (LCA)
   was used to examine stages of marijuana involvement from 6th to 9th
   grades. The influence of neighborhood disorder, drug activity, violent
   crime, safety and disadvantage on transitions in marijuana involvement
   was tested using latent transition analysis (LTA).
   Results: There was evidence for three stages of involvement: no
   involvement, offered, and use and problems. Involvement increased
   steadily during adolescence with a slightly greater risk to transition
   from offers to use between 6th and 7th grades. Neighborhood disorder
   (AOR= 1.04, Cl = 1.00, 1.08), drug activity (AOR= 1.12, CI = 1.02, 1.22)
   and disadvantage (AOR= 1.44, CI = 1.10, 1.92) were associated with the
   transition from marijuana offers to use and problems. Neighborhood
   disorder (AOR= 1.07, CI= 1.02, 1.11), drug activity (AOR= 1.19, CI =
   1.10, 1.29) and violent crime (AOR= 1.17, CI =1.03, 1.32) were
   associated with transitioning rapidly from no involvement to use and
   problems.
   Conclusions: Understanding how neighborhoods could be organized and
   provided with supports to discourage marijuana use and promote non-drug
   using behaviors should be an important goal of any prevention program in
   low-income, urban Black neighborhoods. Enhancing citizen participation
   and mobilization to address the social processes of neighborhood
   disorder has the potential to reduce marijuana involvement in these
   neighborhoods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Previous work in healthy non-human primates and humans has
   shown that social status correlates positively with dopamine 2/3
   receptor (D2/3R) availability imaged with antagonist radioligands and
   positron emission tomography (PET). Further work in non-human primates
   suggests that this relationship is disrupted by chronic cocaine
   administration. This exploratory study examined the relationship between
   social status and D2/3R availability in healthy (HH) and cocaine
   dependent (CD) humans using the D-3-preferring, agonist radioligand,
   [C-11](+)PHNO.
   Methods: Sixteen HH and sixteen CD individuals completed the Barratt
   Simplified Measure of Social Status (BSMSS) and underwent [C-11](+)PHNO
   scanning to measure regional brain D2/3R binding potentials (BPND).
   Correlations between BPND and BSMSS scores were then assessed within
   each group.
   Results: Within HH and CD groups, inverse associations between BSMSS
   score and BPND were observed in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental
   area (SN/VTA) and the ventral striatum, and for the CD group alone, the
   amygdala. After adjusting for body mass index and age, negative
   correlations remained significant in the SN/VTA for HH and in the
   amygdala for CD subjects.
   Conclusion: These preliminary data utilizing a dopamine agonist tracer
   demonstrate, for the first time, an inverse association between social
   status and D2/3R availability in the D3R rich extrastriatal regions of
   HH and CD humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: "Social smoking" - smoking mostly or even only with others -
   may be an important pattern that implies smoking motivated extrinsically
   by social influences. Non-daily smokers (intermittent smokers; ITS) are
   often assumed to be social smokers, with some authors even assuming that
   all ITS are social smokers (SS+). We sought to identify and characterize
   social smokers in a sample of ITS. Methods: 204 adult ITS (smoking 4-27
   days/month) recorded the circumstances of smoking in their natural
   settings using Ecological Momentary Assessment, while also recording
   their circumstances in nonsmoking moments. SS+ were defined as ITS who
   were with others when they smoked most of their cigarettes, and who were
   >= 50% more likely to be with others when smoking than when not.
   Results: Only 13% of ITS were SS+. Although defined solely on the basis
   of presence of others, SS+ showed a distinct pattern of smoking across
   multiple dimensions: compared to other ITS (who were significantly less
   likely to smoke when with others), SS+ smoking was more associated with
   socializing, being with friends and acquaintances, drinking alcohol,
   weekends, evening or nighttime, being in other people's homes, but not
   their own home. SS+ smoking was low in the morning and increased in the
   evening. SS+ smoked fewer days/week and were less dependent, but did not
   differ demographically. Conclusions: Social smoking does constitute a
   highly distinct smoking pattern, but is not common among adult ITS. (C)

AB Background: Little is known about differences in alcohol use and
   alcohol-related problems between transgender- and
   nontransgender-identified populations. Using data from a large-scale
   health survey, we compare the drinking patterns and prevalence of
   alcohol-related problems of transgender-identified individuals to
   nontransgender-identified males and females. For transgender-identified
   people, we examine how various forms of victimization relate to heavy
   episodic drinking (HED).
   Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were completed by 75,192 students aged
   18-29 years attending 120 post-secondary educational institutions in the
   United States from 2011 to 2013. Self-reported measures included alcohol
   use, alcohol-related problems, victimization, and sociodemographics,
   including 3 gender-identity groups: transgender-identified individuals;
   nontransgender-identified males; and nontransgender-identified females.
   Results: Compared to transgender-identified individuals,
   nontransgender-identified males were more likely to report HED in the
   past 2 weeks (relative risk= 1.42; p = 0.006); however,
   non-transgender-identified males and females reported HED on fewer days
   than transgender-identified people (incidence-rate ratios [IRRs] ranged
   from 0.28 to 0.43; p-values <0.001). Compared to transgender-identified
   people, nontransgender-identified males and females had lower odds of
   past-year alcohol-related sexual assault and suicidal ideation (odds
   ratios ranged from 0.24 to 0.45; p-values <0.05). Among
   transgender-identified people, individuals who were sexually assaulted
   (IRR= 3.21, p = 0.011) or verbally threatened (IRR= 2.42, p = 0.021) in
   the past year had greater HED days than those who did not experience
   those forms of victimization.
   Conclusions: Compared to transgender-identified people,
   nontransgender-identified males and females: have fewer HED occasions
   (despite nontransgender-identified males having greater prevalence of
   HED); and are at lower risk for alcohol-related sexual assaults and
   suicidal ideation. Experiences of sexual assault and verbal threats are
   associated with greater HED occasions for transgender-identified people.

AB Shale gas development (SGD) via horizontal drilling and fracking is
   touted for economic benefits and spurned for health and environmental
   impacts. Despite SGD's socioecological salience, few peer-reviewed,
   empirical studies document the distribution of positive and negative
   effects. The City of Denton, Texas has similar to 280 active gas wells
   and over a decade of SGD. Here we use an environmental justice framework
   to analyze the distribution of SGD's costs and benefits within Denton.
   Using data on mineral property values from 2002 to 2013 and gas well
   locations, we ask: who owns Denton's mineral rights (i.e. the greatest
   financial beneficiaries) and how does this ownership pattern relate to
   who lives near gas wells (i.e. those who shoulder the nuisances and
   health impacts)? Our results show that Denton's mineral wealth is widely
   distributed around the U.S., residents own 1% of the total value
   extracted, and the city government is a large financial beneficiary. In
   addition to distributional inequities, our analysis demonstrates that
   split estate doctrine, legal deference to mineral owners, and SGD's
   uniqueness in urban centers create disparities in municipal SGD
   decision-making processes. The environmental justice issues associated
   with fracking in Denton also provide one possible explanation for
   residents' November 2014 vote to ban hydraulic fracturing. (C) 2015

AB Social exclusion is a potent elicitor of distress. Previous studies have
   shown that medial frontal theta oscillations are modulated by the
   experience of social exclusion. Using the Cyberball paradigm, we
   examined event-related dynamics of theta power in the EEG at medial
   frontal sites while children aged 8-12 years were exposed to conditions
   of fair play and social exclusion. Using an event-related design, we
   found that medial frontal theta oscillations (4-8 Hz) increase during
   both early (i.e., 200-400ms) and late (i.e., 400-800ms) processing of
   rejection events during social exclusion relative to perceptually
   identical "not my turn" events during inclusion. Importantly, we show
   that only for the later time window (400-800 ms) slow-wave theta power
   tracks self-reported ostracism distress. Specifically, greater theta
   power at medial frontal sites to "rejection" events predicted higher
   levels of ostracism distress. Alpha and beta oscillations for rejection
   events were unrelated to ostracism distress at either 200-400 ms or
   400-800 ms time windows. Our findings extend previous studies by showing
   that medial frontal theta oscillations for rejection events are a neural
   signature of social exclusion, linked to experienced distress in middle
   childhood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses cultural issues in psychiatric administration and
   leadership through two issues: (1) the changing culture of psychiatric
   practice based on new clinician performance metrics and (2) the culture
   of psychiatric administration and leadership in light of organizational
   cultural competence. Regarding the first issue, some observers have
   discussed the challenges of creating novel practice environments that
   balance business values of efficient performance with fiduciary values
   of treatment competence. This paper expands upon this discussion,
   demonstrating that some metrics from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
   Services, the nation's largest funder of postgraduate medical training,
   may penalize clinicians for patient medication behaviors that are
   unrelated to clinician performance. A focus on pharmacotherapy over
   psychotherapy in these metrics has unclear consequences for the future
   of psychiatric training. Regarding the second issue, studies of
   psychiatric administration and leadership reveal a disproportionate
   influence of older men in positions of power despite efforts to recruit
   women, minorities, and immigrants who increasingly constitute the
   psychiatric workforce. Organizational cultural competence initiatives
   can diversify institutional cultures so that psychiatric leaders better
   reflect the populations they serve. In both cases, psychiatric
   administrators and leaders play critical roles in ensuring that their
   organizations respond to social challenges.

AB Objective To examine the HIV risk behaviours of men who have sex with
   men only (MSMO) and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW), aged
   12-24 years, in five US cities and in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   Methods Data were collected through four annual cross-sectional
   anonymous surveys at community venues and included questions about
   sexual partnerships, sexual practices including condom use and substance
   use. Demographic and risk profiles were summarised for both groups.
   Results A total of 1198 men were included in this analysis, including
   565 MSMO and 633 MSMW. There were statistically significant differences
   between the two groups for many risk factors examined in multivariable
   models. MSMW were more likely to identify as bisexual, be in a long-term
   relationship, have a history of homelessness, have ever used marijuana,
   have ever been tested for HIV and to have been tested for HIV within the
   past 6 months. MSMW may be more likely to ever exchange sex for money
   and ever have a sexually transmitted infection than MSMO.
   Conclusions MSMW were more likely to report several markers of
   socioeconomic vulnerability or behaviours associated with increased risk
   for HIV than MSMO. MSMW contribute to HIV prevalence in the USA, and
   better understanding of the risk profile of this group is essential to
   understand heterosexual HIV transmission. MSMW, particularly those who
   identify as bisexual or questioning, may feel uncomfortable
   participating in programmes that are designed for gay-identified men.
   Therefore, prevention strategies need to target distinct subgroups that
   compose the population of MSM.

   outpatient clinic in an inner city, county-owned, university-affiliated
   hospital.
   Methods This is a descriptive study of administrative data on
   consecutive patient visits to the University of Tennessee Regional One
   Health at Memphis ambulatory clinic (Medplex) between January 2000 and
   August 2006. We describe demographics, socioeconomic characteristics,
   and the frequency of a pulmonary diagnosis of the outpatient population
   served by our training program. Continuous data were described by mean
   standard deviations and categorical data were described by percentage.
   Results The dataset included 2549 patients, 81% were African American
   with a mean age of 48.7 +/- 13.7, 64.4% were women. Female/male body
   mass index was 34.6 +/- 11.6 vs. 29.2 +/- 10.3. Tenncare (Medicaid)
   covered 59.6 % of patients, whereas 11.1% were uninsured.
   Conclusions We provide evidence that one clinical setting may not be
   enough exposure to the entire lung pathology for pulmonary trainees.
   There is a need for further, larger, and prospective data collections to
   evaluate and guide changes regarding the structure of training programs.

   But a pronounced aspect of much of this work is an indifference to the
   question of the value of studying the past as a way to understanding the
   present. This article argues that, rather than trying to outdo the
   historians by producing better, more theoretically sophisticated
   history, sociologists would better advance the case for historical
   sociology by showing how any particular historical study helps
   illuminate contemporary concerns. The article draws upon the writings of
   C. Wright Mills and Alexis de Tocqueville to show not just the need for
   historical sociology but also as indications of how this might best be

AB Those who undergo health screening often experience physical and
   emotional effects as a result of the screening process. However, the
   effects of health screening go beyond these physical and mental
   complications, often having profound social effects for those who are
   screened. This study explores the social implications of health
   screening for people who undergo it and are designated as being at risk
   for potential disease. Through a qualitative analysis of the experiences
   of individuals with elevated cholesterol levels and men with elevated
   prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, this research offers a
   description of the experience of being at risk, identifying three
   primary components: increased medical contact, a restructuring of
   everyday routines and altered social relationships. Whereas the at-risk
   health status engendered by current clinical approaches to screening and
   surveillance has been characterised as proto-disease, this study
   develops a companion definition of proto-illness to characterise the
   social experience of life with an identified health risk. Those who are
   at risk act in ways that are similar to those who are ill. The concept
   of proto-illness implies that the experience of risk is parallel to the
   experience of illness and contributes to the sociology of medical
   screening by establishing a much needed bridge between the two
   experiences.

AB First-person accounts of the illnesses experienced by sociologists have
   taken hybrid experimental forms. I add my voice to this growing
   tradition with a story about the discovery and treatment of a soft
   tissue sarcoma in my thigh, chronicled in a journal I kept over many
   months. The fragments scribbled in the journal became the basis of an
   extended illness narrative. I interrogate features of the narrative
   itself, including the handling of time and imagined audiences - those I
   was writing for. The illness narrative traces how cancer transformed the
   many identities I enact on a daily basis and how the invisible labour of
   particular health workers enabled the restoration of several prized
   identities. These workers - radiation, occupational and physical
   therapists - are typically subordinated in the medical hierarchy and the
   interactional work that they do with patients to restore and reconfigure

AB Introduction: Current knowledge of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)
   relies on data predominantly collected from white, middle- /
   upper-middle-class participants and focuses on experiences within the
   home. Using a more socioeconomically and racially diverse urban
   population, Conventional and Expanded (community-level) ACEs were
   measured to help understand whether Conventional ACEs alone can
   sufficiently measure adversity, particularly among various subgroups.
   Methods: Participants from a previous large, representative,
   community-based health survey in Southeast Pennsylvania who were aged >=
   18 years were contacted between November 2012 and January 2013 to
   complete another phone survey measuring ACEs. Ordinal logistic
   regression models were used to test associations between Conventional
   and Expanded ACEs scores and demographic characteristics. Analysis was
   conducted in 2013 and 2014.
   Results: Of 1,784 respondents, 72.9% had at least one Conventional ACE,
   63.4% at least one Expanded ACE, and 49.3% experienced both. A total of
   13.9% experienced only Expanded AEs and would have gone unrecognized if
   only Conventional ACEs were assessed. Certain demographic
   characteristics were associated with higher risk for Conventional ACEs
   but were not predictive of Expanded ACEs, and vice versa. Few
   adversities were associated with both Conventional and Expanded ACEs.
   Conclusions: To more accurately represent the level of adversity
   experienced across various sociodemographic groups, these data support
   extending the Conventional ACEs measure. (C) 2015 American Journal of

AB Introduction: One of ten U.S. high school students is a victim of
   adolescent dating violerice (ADV). Understanding ADV risk factors guides
   prevention efforts; however, research examining community- and
   societal-level risk factors is scant. Societal gender inequality is a
   known risk factor for violence against women, but has yet to be explored
   in relation to ADV. This study aims to determine whether the Gender
   Inequality Index (GII) correlates with levels of physical and sexual ADV
   victimization across U.S. states.
   Methods: State-representative prevalence rates of self-reported physical
   and sexual ADV victimization were obtained from the 2013 Youth Risk
   Behavior Survey. The state GII includes five indicators: (1) maternal
   mortality; (2) adolescent birth rate; (3) government representation; (4)
   educational attainment; and (5) labor force participation. Pearson
   correlation coefficients determined the association between physical and
   sexual ADV victimization, the GII, and GII indicators. Analyses were
   conducted in August 2014.
   Results: Among U.S. states, the prevalence of physical ADV victimization
   in 2013 ranged from 7.0% to 14.8%, and the prevalence of sexual ADV
   victimization ranged from 7.8% to 13.8%. The GII was significantly
   associated with the state prevalence of female physical ADV
   victimization (r=0.48, p < 0.01) but not female sexual ADV
   victimization. Neither physical nor sexual male ADV victimization was
   associated with the GII.
   Conclusions: This exploratory study suggests that gender inequality may
   be a societal-level risk factor for female physical ADV victimization.
   As ADV prevention strategies are implemented at the state level, further
   research examining the effect of gender inequality on ADV is needed.

AB Context: The purpose of this review is to summarize the empirical
   research on neighborhood-level factors and dating violence among
   adolescents and emerging adults to guide future research and practice.
   Evidence acquisition: In 2015, a total of 20 articles were identified
   through a search of the literature using Pub Med. Eligible articles
   included those that (1) had been published in a peer-reviewed journal
   since 2005; (2) reported a measure of association between at least one
   neighborhood-level factor and dating violence; and (3) had a study
   population of youth aged <26 years. We abstracted information about the
   studies, including measurement of dating violence and neighborhood
   factors, and measures of effect.
   Evidence synthesis: Results were summarized into three categories based
   on the aspect of neighborhood that was the focus of the work:
   demographic and structural characteristics (n=11); neighborhood disorder
   (n=12); and social disorganization (n=8). There was some evidence to
   suggest that neighborhood disadvantage is associated with dating
   violence, but very little evidence to suggest that residence
   characteristics (e.g., racial heterogeneity) are associated with dating
   violence. Results do suggest that perceived neighborhood disorder is
   associated with physical dating violence perpetration, but do not
   suggest that it is associated with physical dating violence
   victimization. Social control and community connectedness are both
   associated with dating violence, but findings on collective efficacy are
   mixed.
   Conclusions: Existing research suggests that neighborhood factors may be
   associated with dating violence. However, there is a limited body of
   research on the neighborhood context of dating violence, and more
   rigorous research is needed. (C) 2015 American Journal of Preventive

AB Introduction: Theoretic models suggest that associations between
   substance use and dating violence perpetration may vary in different
   social contexts, but few studies have examined this proposition. The
   current study examined whether social control and violence in the
   neighborhood, peer, and family contexts moderate the associations
   between substance use (heavy alcohol use, marijuana, and hard drug use)
   and adolescent physical dating violence perpetration.
   Methods: Adolescents in the eighth, ninth, and tenth grades completed
   questionnaires in 2004 and again four more times until 2007 when they
   were in the tenth, 11th, and 12th grades. Multilevel analysis was used
   to examine interactions between each substance and measures of
   neighborhood, peer, and family social control and violence as
   within-person (time-varying) predictors of physical dating violence
   perpetration across eighth through 12th grade (N=2,455). Analyses were
   conducted in 2014.
   Results: Physical dating violence perpetration increased at time points
   when heavy alcohol and hard drug use were elevated; these associations
   were weaker when neighborhood social control was higher and stronger
   when family violence was higher. Also, the association between heavy
   alcohol use and physical dating violence perpetration was weaker when
   teens had more-prosocial peer networks and stronger when teens' peers
   reported more physical dating violence.
   Conclusions: Linkages between substance use and physical dating violence
   perpetration depend on substance use type and levels of contextual
   violence and social control. Prevention programs that address substance
   use related dating violence should consider the role of social
   contextual variables that may condition risk by influencing adolescents'
   aggression propensity. (C) 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

AB Introduction: Rural adolescents are at high risk for dating violence
   victimization (DVV), which has serious negative consequences.
   Understanding more about the conditions that increase DVV risk for rural
   adolescents is needed to inform prevention efforts. In response to calls
   for examining the influence of upper levels of the social ecology on
   adolescent dating violence, this study examined whether associations
   between the family context and physical DVV were conditioned by the
   characteristics of the neighborhoods in which the family resided.
   Methods: Data were from a multi-wave longitudinal study of 3,236 rural
   adolescents nested in 65 block groups, which defined neighborhoods. Data
   were collected between 2003 and 2005. Multilevel growth curve modeling
   was conducted in 2014 to test hypothesized synergistic effects of the
   family and neighborhood on trajectories of physical DVV from grade 8 to
   12.
   Results: Low parental closeness was a DVV risk in residentially stable
   (p < 0.001), but not unstable, neighborhoods. Family aggression was a
   DVV risk, regardless of neighborhood characteristics (p=0.001). Low
   parental monitoring and rule setting were not DVV risks and their
   effects were not moderated by neighborhood characteristics. Neighborhood
   ethnic heterogeneity was significantly (p < 0.05) positively associated
   with DVV, but neighborhood economic disadvantage, social
   disorganization, and violence were not associated with DVV. None of the
   effects varied by sex of the adolescent, across time (grade), or by the
   combination of sex and time.
   Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the importance of considering the
   family and neighborhood, and particularly their synergistic effects in
   efforts to prevent adolescent DVV. (C) 2015 American Journal of

   To better understand the epidemiology of foodborne disease and to direct

   toxin producing Escherichia coli infection, and hemolytic uremic
   syndrome by census tract level socioeconomic status (SES) in the
   Connecticut Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network site for
   2000-2011. Addresses of case-patients were geocoded to census tracts and
   linked to census tract level SES data. Higher census tract level SES was
   associated with Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli, regardless of
   serotype; hemolytic uremic syndrome; salmonellosis in persons years of
   age; and some Salmonella serotypes. A reverse association was found for
   salmonellosis in children <5 years of age and for 1 Salmonella serotype.
   These findings will inform education and prevention efforts as well as
   further research.

AB ObjectiveMuch research documents the etiology and health consequences of
   adolescent eating disorders (ED), but very little is known about the
   long-term effects of EDs on the transition to adulthood. This study
   explores gender differences in the influence of EDs or disordered eating
   behaviors (DEB) on measures of socioeconomic independence in early
   adulthood.
   MethodUsing the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
   Health), this study compares individuals who self-identified as have
   been diagnosed with an ED or engaged in DEBs in late adolescence to
   those without ED or DEB on three measures of socioeconomic independence
   during early adulthood, including educational attainment, income, and
   likelihood of owning a home. This study uses multiple regression
   techniques and attempts to account for early-life conditions and health
   outcomes associated with EDs and DEBs.
   ResultsFor females, ED or DEB in late adolescence had a statistically
   significant, negative association with educational attainment
   (coefficient=-0.20, p=.05), personal income (coefficient=-0.12, p<.05)
   and odds of owning a home (odds ratio=0.73, p<.02) in early adulthood.
   For males, ED or DEB was not associated with socioeconomic attainment.
   DiscussionOur findings suggest that EDs and DEBs are negatively
   associated with socioeconomic achievement during early adulthood for
   females, but not for males. EDs or DEBs during adolescence may set
   individuals on a different trajectory whereby they do not have the same
   life chances or opportunities for success in adulthood. These results
   confirm the public health message that EDs or DEBs have lasting negative
   consequences for women. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat

AB Social deficits are common in people with schizophrenia and the
   treatment of deficits in social competence has been a long-time
   treatment strategy. However, negative symptoms and social cognitive
   deficits also contribute to social dysfunction. In this study, we
   examined the correlations between everyday social outcomes, a
   performance based measure of social competence, and performance on 8
   different social cognition tests in 179 patients with schizophrenia.
   Social cognition, social competence, and motivation-related negative
   symptoms accounted for 32% of the variance in real-world social
   outcomes. In addition, two different social cognition tests, along with
   expression-related negative symptoms accounted for 32% of the variance
   in performance-based assessments of social competence. These data
   suggest that negative symptoms exert an important influence on social
   outcomes and social competence, but not social cognition, and that
   social cognition and social competence exert separable influences on
   real-world social outcomes. Improving social outcomes seems to require a
   multi-faceted approach which considers social cognition, social
   competence, and negative symptoms. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective:When resource competition within primate social groups is
   effective, high-ranking individuals generally gain fitness benefits.
   Contrary to expectations, female Cercopithecus mitis form linear
   dominance hierarchies without evidence for rank-related variation in
   fitness-relevant measures, raising questions about the evolution of
   guenon social structure. Here, we test whether social status predicts
   gastrointestinal helminth infections, known to influence health and
   morbidity in other mammalian hosts. In addition, we assess whether
   infections contribute to stress responses as indicated by fecal
   glucocorticoid (fGC) levels.
   Methods:We quantified infections and hormone levels in 382 fecal samples
   from 11 adult female Sykes' monkeys (C. m. albogularis) over four months
   in one wild study group at Gede Ruins, Kenya. Using a generalized
   estimating equations technique, we modeled the odds of infection,
   relative infection intensity, and fGC variation.
   Results:High-ranking females were less likely infected with Trichuris
   and Trichostrongylus, had lower fecal egg counts for both taxa, and
   overall lower helminth richness than low-ranking females. An inverse
   relationship between rank and Trichuris egg counts existed also in a
   study population of blue monkeys (C. m. stuhlmanni), where we collected
   comparable data over a shorter period. Regardless of rank, lactating
   females were more likely than non-lactating females to be infected with
   Trichuris, and had higher fecal egg counts for both Trichuris and
   Oesophagostomum. Lastly, we report evidence that Trichuris infections
   exacerbated energetic stress and that food supplementation by tourists
   increased infection levels.
   Conclusion:Our findings suggest that high-rank may provide long-term
   health and energetic benefits for female C. mitis, with potential
   fitness implications. Am J Phys Anthropol 158:55-66, 2015. (c) 2015

AB Understanding the properties of a social environment is important for
   understanding the dynamics of social relationships. Understanding such
   dynamics is relevant for multiple fields, ranging from animal behaviour
   to social and cognitive neuroscience. To quantify social environment
   properties, recent studies have incorporated social network analysis.
   Social network analysis quantifies both the global and local properties
   of a social environment, such as social network efficiency and the roles
   played by specific individuals, respectively. Despite the plethora of
   studies incorporating social network analysis, methods to determine the
   amount of data necessary to derive reliable social networks are still
   being developed. Determining the amount of data necessary for a reliable
   network is critical for measuring changes in the social environment, for
   example following an experimental manipulation, and therefore may be
   critical for using social network analysis to statistically assess
   social behaviour. In this paper, we extend methods for measuring error
   in acquired data and for determining the amount of data necessary to
   generate reliable social networks. We derived social networks from a
   group of 10 male rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, for three behaviours:
   spatial proximity, grooming and mounting. Behaviours were coded using a
   video observation technique, where video cameras recorded the compound
   where the 10 macaques resided. We collected, coded and used 10 h of
   video data to construct these networks. Using the methods described
   here, we found in our data that 1 h of spatial proximity observations
   produced reliable social networks. However, this may not be true for
   other studies due to differences in data acquisition. Our results have
   broad implications for measuring and predicting the amount of error in
   any social network, regardless of species. (C) 2015 The Association for

AB The social life cycle impact assessment (SLCIA) incorporates either a
   type I or type II characterization model. We improved both models by
   introducing explicit causality by using statistic modeling through
   development of (1) a quantitative approach to simultaneously identify
   impact pathways of type II models with multiple impact categories,
   targeting SLCIA method developers and (2) a new hybrid model to
   establish causality between inventory indicators and subcategories,
   targeting social life cycle assessment practitioners.
   Causality establishments for type II impact pathways and the new hybrid
   model are the core requirements for this study. We used structural
   equation modeling (SEM) to identify the impact pathways for type II
   characterization models, therefore resolving the issues of
   unobservability and unvalidatibility in type II models. Using
   country-level data from the World Bank, the method was applied to an
   example impact pathway at macro-scale. We applied Bayesian networks in
   our hybrid model to address the issues of relevance and
   representativeness in type I models, assuming the unobservable social
   performances of an organization are the causes for observable inventory
   indicators. The method was applied to a hypothetical example for the
   stakeholder of the worker at company scale. Temporal precedence (i.e.,
   lag effects) was incorporated into both models.
   The results from the confirmatory SEM supported our hypotheses that
   comprised the impact pathway from economic development to health
   outcomes, which were fully mediated by health expenditures and health
   access. A 1-year lag between each impact category resulted in the best
   model fit. Limitations on the data as well as subjective choice of
   indicators to represent impact categories are subject to criticism. The
   results from the hybrid model showed that, depending on the likelihood
   of the inventory indicators, the posterior probability of subcategories
   either deviated from their prior probability or behaved similarly. The
   construction of proper conditional probability tables and the choice of
   probability distribution for the likelihood are major challenges for the
   hybrid model.
   This study was the first attempt in using statistic causal models to
   quantitatively identify unobservable impact pathways of the type II
   model and to develop a hybrid model for SLCIA. A SEM that incorporates
   temporal precedence enables identification of impact pathways with
   multiple unobservable impact categories. The hybrid model using Bayesian
   networks represents the subcategories in posterior probabilities instead
   of absolute scores, helping companies to better develop instructions for
   future management practices.

AB Background/Purpose. Pediatric breast reduction mammaplasty is a
   procedure commonly performed in children suffering from excess breast
   tissue, back pain, and social anxiety. Minimal information exists
   regarding demographics, epidemiology, and complications in adolescents.
   As health care reform progresses, investigating the socioeconomic and
   patient-related factors affecting cost and operative outcomes is
   essential.
   Methods. The Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) was used from 2000 to 2009.
   Patients with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision
   code of macromastia and procedure code of reduction mammaplasty 20 and
   less were included. Demographic data, including age, sex, payer mix, and
   location, were collected. Significant independent variables associated
   with complications and duration of stay were identified with bivariate
   and multiple regression analysis.
   Results. A total of 1,345 patients between the ages 12 and 20 were
   evaluated. The majority of patients were white (64%), from a zip code
   with greatest income (36%), and had private insurance (75%). Overall
   comorbidity and complication rates were 30% and 3.2%, respectively.
   Duration of stay was associated with race, income quartile, insurance
   type, having complications, and hospital type. African-American race,
   Medicaid, lower income, and private-investor owned hospitals were
   predictive of greater hospital charges.
   Conclusion. In this large retrospective database analysis, pediatric
   reduction mammaplasty had a relatively low early complication rate and
   short duration of stay. Complications, total charges, and duration of
   stay discrepancies were associated with race, location, and
   socioeconomic status. Although demonstrably safe, this is the first
   study demonstrating the negative effect of race and socioeconomic status
   on a completely elective procedure involving children. These results
   demonstrate the intricate association between socioeconomic and
   patient-related factors influencing overall outcomes in the pediatric
   population.

AB Background and aimsSubstance use and risk-taking are common during
   emerging adulthood, a transitional period when peer influences often
   increase and family influences decrease. Investigating relationships
   between social network features and substance use can inform
   community-based prevention programs. This study investigated whether
   substance use among emerging adults living in disadvantaged urban areas
   was influenced by peer and family social network messages that variously
   encouraged and discouraged substance use.
   DesignCross-sectional, naturalistic field study.
   Setting and participantsLower-income neighborhoods in Birmingham,
   Alabama, USA with 344 participants (110 males, 234 females, ages 15-25
   years; mean=18.86 years), recruited via respondent-driven sampling.
   MeasurementsDuring structured interviews conducted in community
   locations, the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test
   assessed substance use and related problems. Predictor variables were
   network characteristics, including presence of substance-using peers,
   messages from friends and family members about substance use and network
   sources for health information.
   FindingsHigher substance involvement was associated with friend and
   family encouragement of use and having close peer network members who
   used substances (Ps<0.001). Peer discouragement of substance use was
   associated with reduced risk (b=- 1.46, P<0.05), whereas family
   discouragement had no protective association.
   ConclusionsSocial networks appear to be important in both promoting and
   preventing substance use in disadvantaged young adults in the United
   States.

AB AimTo determine whether racial disparities in cerebral palsy (CP) risk
   among US children persist after controlling for socio-economic status
   (SES) (here indicated by maternal education) and perinatal risk factors.
   MethodA population-based birth cohort study was conducted using the
   Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network surveillance
   and birth data for 8-year-old children residing in multi-county areas in
   Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, and Wisconsin between 2002 and 2008. The
   birth cohort comparison group included 458027 children and the case
   group included 1570 children with CP, 1202 with available birth records.
   (2) tests were performed to evaluate associations and logistic
   regression was used to calculate relative risks (RR) and adjusted odds
   ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
   ResultsThe risk of spastic CP was more than 50% higher for black versus
   white children (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.33-1.73), and this greater risk
   persisted after adjustment for SES (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18-1.55), but not
   after further adjustment for preterm birth and size for gestational age.
   The protective effect of maternal education remained after adjustment
   for race/ethnicity and perinatal factors.
   InterpretationMaternal education appears to independently affect CP risk
   but does not fully explain existing racial disparities in CP prevalence
   in the US.
   What this paper adds
   <list list-type="bulleted" id="dmcn12746-list-0001"> The risk of spastic
   cerebral palsy (CP) was higher in black relative to white children.
   Disparities in maternal education, an indicator of socio-economic
   status, did not fully explain the greater CP risk among black children.
   Factors associated with higher maternal education may help protect
   against the risk of spastic CP.

AB Background The efficacy of promoting social interactions to improve the
   health of older adults is not fully established due to residual
   confounding and selection bias.
   Methods The government of Taketoyo town, Aichi Prefecture, Japan,
   developed a resident-centred community intervention programme called
   'community salons', providing opportunities for social interactions
   among local older residents. To evaluate the impact of the programme, we
   conducted questionnaire surveys for all older residents of Taketoyo. We
   carried out a baseline survey in July 2006 (prior to the introduction of
   the programme) and assessed the onset of functional disability during
   March 2012. We analysed the data of 2421 older people. In addition to
   the standard Cox proportional hazard regression, we conducted Cox
   regression with propensity score matching (PSM) and an instrumental
   variable (IV) analysis, using the number of community salons within a
   radius of 350 m from the participant's home as an instrument.
   Results In the 5 years after the first salon was launched, the salon
   participants showed a 6.3% lower incidence of functional disability
   compared with non-participants. Even adjusting for sex, age, equivalent
   income, educational attainment, higher level activities of daily living
   and depression, the Cox adjusted HR for becoming disabled was 0.49 (95%
   CI 0.33 to 0.72). Similar results were observed using PSM (HR 0.52, 95%
   CI 0.33 to 0.83) and IV-Cox analysis (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.74).
   Conclusions A community health promotion programme focused on increasing
   social interactions among older adults may be effective in preventing
   the onset of disability.

AB The current study examined whether peer social support, alone or in
   conjunction with peer delinquency, moderated the relations between overt
   and relational victimization, depressive symptoms, and rule-breaking
   behavior. Participants included 152 adolescents (55% male; 95% Latino)
   between the ages of 14-19 and their second-hour teacher. Findings
   indicated that peer social support buffered the association between
   relational victimization and depressive symptoms. Overt victimization
   was uniquely related to increased rule-breaking behavior, but unrelated
   to depressive symptoms. Peer social support and peer delinquency
   interacted to influence the association between relational victimization
   and rule-breaking behavior. When levels of both social support and peer
   delinquency were high, relational victimization marginally significantly
   predicted increased rule-breaking behavior. Relational victimization was
   unrelated to rule-breaking behavior when levels of peer delinquency were
   high and social support were low. The moderating effects of peer social
   support did not differ according to gender. Implications of findings and
   directions for future research are discussed.

AB The adolescent period is associated with high significance of
   interactions with peers, high frequency of stressful situations, and
   high rates of alcohol use. At least two desired effects of alcohol that
   may contribute to heavy and problematic drinking during adolescence are
   its abilities to both facilitate interactions with peers and to
   alleviate anxiety, perhaps especially anxiety seen in social contexts.
   Ethanol-induced social facilitation can be seen using a simple model of
   adolescence in the rat, with normal adolescents, but not their more
   mature counterparts, demonstrating this ethanol-related social
   facilitation. Prior repeated stress induces expression of
   ethanol-induced social facilitation in adults and further enhances
   socially facilitating effects of ethanol among adolescent rats. In
   contrast, under normal circumstances, adolescent rats are less sensitive
   than adults to the social inhibition induced by higher ethanol doses and
   are insensitive to the socially anxiolytic effects of ethanol.
   Sensitivity to the socially anxiolytic effects of ethanol can be
   modified by prior stress or ethanol exposure at both ages. Shortly
   following repeated restraint or ethanol exposure, adolescents exhibit
   social anxiety-like behavior, indexed by reduced social preference, and
   enhanced sensitivity to the socially anxiolytic effects of ethanol,
   indexed through ethanol-associated reinstatement of social preference in
   these adolescents. Repeated restraint, but not repeated ethanol, induces
   similar effects in adults as well, eliciting social anxiety-like
   behavior and increasing their sensitivity to the socially anxiolytic
   effects of acute ethanol: the stressor also decreases sensitivity of
   adults to ethanol-induced social inhibition. The persisting consequences
   of early adolescent ethanol exposure differ from its immediate
   consequences, with males exposed early in adolescence, but not females
   or those exposed later in adolescence, showing social anxiety-like
   behavior when tested in adulthood. Adult males exposed to ethanol early
   in adolescence also show enhanced sensitivity to the socially
   facilitating effects of ethanol, whereas adult males exposed to ethanol
   during late adolescence demonstrate insensitivity to the socially
   suppressing effects of ethanol. To the extent that these results are
   applicable to humans, stressful live events may make alcohol more
   attractive for stressed adolescents and adults due to its socially
   facilitating and socially anxiolytic properties, therefore fostering
   high levels of drinking. Retention of adolescent-typical responsiveness
   to alcohol in adult males following adolescent alcohol exposure,
   including enhanced sensitivity to the socially facilitating effects of
   ethanol following early exposure and insensitivity to the socially
   inhibiting effects following late adolescent exposure, may put these
   males at risk for the development of alcohol-related disorders later in
   life. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

   sociology and network perspectives to explain how cultural features of
   adolescent peer groups influence adolescent romantic relationship
   inauthenticitythe extent of incongruence between one's thoughts/feelings
   and actions within romantic contexts. Using National Longitudinal Study
   of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data, I apply sequence
   analysis and linear regression models to test whether adolescents
   experience greater romantic relationship inauthenticity when the
   ordering of events within ideal romantic relationship scripts (e.g.,
   holding hands, saying I love you, having sexual intercourse) diverges
   from ideal romantic relationship scripts of fellow peer-group members.
   Results indicate romantic relationship inauthenticity increases as one's
   ideal script diverges from fellow peer-group members' scripts.
   Importantly, heterogeneity in relationship scripts at the peer-group
   level was not associated with relationship inauthenticity. This study
   highlights the roles cultural reinforcement and social network processes
   play in the link between culture and action.

AB In Guatemala, especially in rural areas, gender norms contribute to high
   fertility and closely spaced births by discouraging contraceptive use
   and constraining women from making decisions regarding the timing of
   their pregnancies and the size of their families. Community workshops
   for men, women and couples were conducted in 30 rural communities in
   Guatemala to test the hypothesis that the promotion of gender equity in
   the context of reproductive health will contribute to gender-equitable
   attitudes and strengthen the practice of family planning. Communities
   were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Pre/post
   surveys were conducted. Odds ratios estimated with mixed effect models
   to account for community-level randomization and repeated measures per
   participant were compared. The analyses showed statistically significant
   effects of the intervention on two of the three outcomes examined:
   gender attitudes and contraceptive knowledge. Findings regarding
   contraceptive use were suggestive but not significant. The results
   suggest that it is possible to influence both inequitable gender norms
   and reproductive health knowledge and, potentially, behaviours in a
   short span of time using appropriately designed communications
   interventions that engage communities in re-thinking the inequitable
   gender norms that act as barriers to health.

AB This article explores the subtle yet far-reaching ways that cultural
   environments shape the uses of the evening hours among business
   professionals in three countries. Drawing on interviews with
   professional men and women living and working in Paris, Oslo, and San
   Francisco from a spectrum of professional fields and employers, the
   article explores their evening routines. Three contrasting patterns are
   identified. Where the early evening hours between 17:00 and 21:00 are
   concerned, French, Norwegian, and American professionals traverse
   different cultural terrains. The French professionals and their
   employers treat this temporal zone as a status-conferring period.
   Adhering to a transorganizational cultural convention defining the early
   evening as work time, they use these hours to distinguish themselves as
   committed practioners of their m,tier equipped with status and
   authority. In Norway, comparable professionals approach this period as
   nonwork time off limits to their employer. Early departures from the
   office are encouraged and facilitated in the Norwegian workplace. Among
   the American professionals far less uniformity prevails among the
   evening routines of respondents working in different organizations and
   occupations. This variability is explained by the absence of the
   higher-level temporal conventions present in the two European contexts.
   In the American setting two deciding factors come into play: the
   temporal expectations of the professional's employer and the bargaining
   power wielded by the individual professional vis-A -vis this employer.
   These differences between the evening routines of the three groups
   reflect important cultural differences across countries with broadly
   similar postindustrial landscapes.

AB While the US Supreme Court was considering two related cases involving
   the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, one major question informing
   that decision was whether scientific research had achieved consensus
   regarding how children of same-sex couples fare. Determining the extent
   of consensus has become a key aspect of how social science evidence and
   testimony is accepted by the courts. Here, we show how a method of
   analyzing temporal patterns in citation networks can be used to assess
   the state of social scientific literature as a means to inform just such
   a question. Patterns of clustering within these citation networks reveal
   whether and when consensus arises within a scientific field. We find
   that the literature on outcomes for children of same-sex parents is
   marked by scientific consensus that they experience "no differences"
   compared to children from other parental configurations. (C) 2015

   Results point to organizational climate as a key factor in shaping

   contribution of black sociologists and today it confers the discussion
   of racism to a specialist sub-field. Black sociologists by contrast have
   long been attentive to white sociology. Through a detailed discussion of
   the writings of W.E.B Du Bois and Stuart Hall and their respective
   dialogues with figures like Max Weber and C Wright Mills, an argument is
   made for a profound reconstruction of sociology at both the level of
   analysis and of form that changes the way sociology tells about racism

AB Most centralities proposed for identifying influential spreaders on
   social networks to either spread a message or to stop an epidemic
   require the full topological information of the network on which
   spreading occurs. In practice, however, collecting all connections
   between agents in social networks can be hardly achieved. As a result,
   such metrics could be difficult to apply to real social networks.
   Consequently, a new approach for identifying influential people without
   the explicit network information is demanded in order to provide an
   efficient immunization or spreading strategy, in a practical sense. In
   this study, we seek a possible way for finding influential spreaders by
   using the social mechanisms of how social connections are formed in real
   networks. We find that a reliable immunization scheme can be achieved by
   asking people how they interact with each other. From these surveys we
   find that the probabilistic tendency to connect to a hub has the
   strongest predictive power for influential spreaders among tested social
   mechanisms. Our observation also suggests that people who connect
   different communities is more likely to be an influential spreader when
   a network has a strong modular structure. Our finding implies that not
   only the effect of network location but also the behavior of individuals
   is important to design optimal immunization or spreading schemes.

   social networks to stay connected to friends demonstrated higher QOL
   while those using social networking for dating purposes reported lower

AB Cities are recognised as key players in global adaptation and mitigation
   efforts because the majority of people live in cities. However, in
   Europe, which is highly urbanized and one of the most advanced regions
   in terms of environmental policies, there is considerable diversity in
   the regional distribution, ambition and scope of climate change
   responses. This paper explores potential factors contributing to such
   diversity in 200 large and medium-sized cities across 11 European
   countries. We statistically investigate institutional, socioeconomic,
   environmental and vulnerability characteristics of cities as potential
   drivers of or barriers to the development of urban climate change plans.
   Our results show that factors such as membership of climate networks,
   population size, GDP per capita and adaptive capacity act as drivers of
   mitigation and adaptation plans. By contrast, factors such as the
   unemployment rate, warmer summers, proximity to the coast and projected
   exposure to future climate impacts act as barriers. We see that,
   overall, it is predominantly large and prosperous cities that engage in
   climate planning, while vulnerable cities and those at risk of severe
   climate impacts in the future are less active. Our analysis suggests
   that climate change planning in European cities is not proactive, i.e.
   not significantly influenced by anticipated future impacts. Instead, we
   found that the current adaptive capacity of a city significantly relates
   to climate planning. Along with the need to further explore these
   relations, we see a need for more economic and institutional support for
   smaller and less resourceful cities and those at high risk from climate
   change impacts in the future.

AB Recent research suggests that the self-conscious emotions of
   embarrassment, shame, and pride have distinct, nonverbal expressions
   that can be recognized in the United States at above-chance levels.
   However, few studies have examined the recognition of these emotions in
   other cultures, and little research has been conducted in Asia.
   Consequently the cross-cultural generalizability of self-conscious
   emotions has not been firmly established. Additionally, there is no
   research that examines cultural variability in the recognition of the
   self-conscious emotions. Cultural values and exposure to Western culture
   have been identified as contributors to variability in recognition rates
   for the basic emotions; we sought to examine this for the self-conscious
   emotions using the University of California, Davis Set of Emotion
   Expressions (UCDSEE). The present research examined recognition of the
   self-conscious emotion expressions in South Korean college students and
   found that recognition rates were very high for pride, low but above
   chance for shame, and near zero for embarrassment. To examine what might
   be underlying the recognition rates we found in South Korea, recognition
   of self-conscious emotions and several cultural values were examined in
   a U.S. college student sample of European Americans, Asian Americans,
   and Asian-born individuals. Emotion recognition rates were generally
   similar between the European Americans and Asian Americans, and higher
   than emotion recognition rates for Asian-born individuals. These
   differences were not explained by cultural values in an interpretable
   manner, suggesting that exposure to Western culture is a more important
   mediator than values.

AB Human moral judgement may have evolved to maximize the individual's
   welfare given parochial culturally constructed moral systems. If so,
   then moral condemnation should be more severe when transgressions are
   recent and local, and should be sensitive to the pronouncements of
   authority figures (who are often arbiters of moral norms), as the
   fitness pay-offs of moral disapproval will primarily derive from the
   ramifications of condemning actions that occur within the immediate
   social arena. Correspondingly, moral transgressions should be viewed as
   less objectionable if they occur in other places or times, or if local
   authorities deem them acceptable. These predictions contrast markedly
   with those derived from prevailing non-evolutionary perspectives on
   moral judgement. Both classes of theories predict purportedly
   species-typical patterns, yet to our knowledge, no study to date has
   investigated moral judgement across a diverse set of societies,
   including a range of small-scale communities that differ substantially
   from large highly urbanized nations. We tested these predictions in five
   small-scale societies and two large-scale societies, finding substantial
   evidence of moral parochialism and contextual contingency in adults'
   moral judgements. Results reveal an overarching pattern in which moral
   condemnation reflects a concern with immediate local considerations, a
   pattern consistent with a variety of evolutionary accounts of moral
   judgement.

AB Recent research has established both a theoretical basis and strong
   empirical evidence that effective social behavior plays a beneficial
   role in the maintenance of physical and psychological well-being of
   people. To test whether social behavior and well-being are also
   associated in online communities, we studied the correlations between
   the recovery of patients with mental disorders and their behaviors in
   online social media. As the source of the data related to the social
   behavior and progress of mental recovery, we used PatientsLikeMe (PLM),
   the world's first open-participation research platformfor the
   development of patient-centered health outcome measures. We first
   constructed an online social network structure based on
   patient-to-patient ties among 200 patients obtained from PLM. We then
   characterized patients' online social activities by measuring the
   numbers of "posts and views" and " helpful marks" each patient obtained.
   The patients' recovery data were obtained from their self-reported
   status information that was also available on PLM. We found that some
   node properties (in-degree, eigenvector centrality and PageRank) and the
   two online social activity measures were significantly correlated with
   patients' recovery. Furthermore, we re-collected the patients' recovery
   data two months after the first data collection. We found significant
   correlations between the patients' social behaviors and the second
   recovery data, which were collected two months apart. Our results
   indicated that social interactions in online communities such as PLM
   were significantly associated with the current and future recoveries of
   patients with mental disorders.

AB Background
   Studies of cost-effective disease prevention have typically focused on
   the tradeoff between the cost of disease transmission and the cost of
   applying control measures. We present a novel approach that also
   accounts for the cost of social disruptions resulting from the spread of
   disease. These disruptions, which we call social response, can include
   heightened anxiety, strain on healthcare infrastructure, economic
   losses, or violence.
   Methodology
   The spread of disease and social response are simulated under several
   different intervention strategies. The modeled social response depends
   upon the perceived risk of the disease, the extent of disease spread,
   and the media involvement. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we estimate the
   total number of infections and total social response for each strategy.
   We then identify the strategy that minimizes the expected total cost of
   the disease, which includes the cost of the disease itself, the cost of
   control measures, and the cost of social response.
   Conclusions
   The model-based simulations suggest that the least-cost disease control
   strategy depends upon the perceived risk of the disease, as well as
   media intervention. The most cost-effective solution for diseases with
   low perceived risk was to implement moderate control measures. For
   diseases with higher perceived severity, such as SARS or Ebola, the most
   cost-effective strategy shifted toward intervening earlier in the
   outbreak, with greater resources. When intervention elicited increased
   media involvement, it remained important to control high severity
   diseases quickly. For moderate severity diseases, however, it became
   most cost-effective to implement no intervention and allow the disease
   to run its course. Our simulation results imply that, when diseases are
   perceived as severe, the costs of social response have a significant
   influence on selecting the most cost-effective strategy.

AB Agreeable people are more likely to display prosocial attitudes and

   tendency interacts with the personal characteristics of interaction
   partners. In an online study (n = 284), participants were given the
   opportunity to report attitudes toward and make monetary donations to
   needy individuals who were described in dynamically generated
   biographies. Using a machine learning and multilevel modeling framework,
   we tested three potential explanations for the facilitatory influence of
   Agreeableness on charitable behavior. We find that Agreeableness
   preferentially increased donations and prosocial attitudes toward

AB There are persistent socioeconomic disparities in many aspects of child
   development in America. Relative to their affluent peers, children of
   low socioeconomic status (SES) complete fewer years of education, have a
   higher prevalence of health problems, and are convicted of more criminal
   offenses. Based on research indicating that low self-control underlies
   some of these disparities, policymakers have begun incorporating
   character-skills training into school curricula and social services.
   However, emerging data suggest that for low-SES youth, self-control may
   act as a "double-edged sword,"facilitating academic success and
   psychosocial adjustment, while at the same time undermining physical
   health. Here, we examine this hypothesis in a five-wave study of 292
   African American teenagers from rural Georgia. From ages 17 to 20 y, we
   assessed SES and self-control annually, along with depressive symptoms,
   substance use, aggressive behavior, and internalizing problems. At age
   22 y, we obtained DNA methylation profiles of subjects' peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells. These data were used to measure epigenetic aging, a
   methylation-derived biomarker reflecting the disparity between
   biological and chronological aging. Among high-SES youth, better
   mid-adolescent self-control presaged favorable psychological and
   methylation outcomes. However, among low-SES youth, self-control had
   divergent associations with these outcomes. Self-control forecasted
   lower rates of depressive symptoms, substance use, aggressive behavior,
   and internalizing problems but faster epigenetic aging. These patterns
   suggest that for low-SES youth, resilience is a "skin-deep" phenomenon,
   wherein outward indicators of success can mask emerging problems with
   health. These findings have conceptual implications for models of
   resilience, and practical implications for interventions aimed at
   ameliorating social and racial disparities.

AB Objective
   Modification and prevention of risky sexual behavior is important to
   individuals' health and public health policy. This study employed a
   novel sexual discounting task to elucidate the effects of social
   learning and regret expression on delay to sexual gratification in a
   behavioral task.
   Methods
   Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers were assigned to hear one of three
   scenarios about a friend who engages in similar sexual behavior. The
   scenarios included a positive health consequence, a negative health
   consequence or a negative health consequence with the expression of
   regret. After reading one scenario, participants were asked to select
   from 60 images, those with whom they would have casual sex. Of the
   selected images, participants chose one image each for the person they
   most and least want to have sex with and person most and least likely to
   have a sexually transmitted infection. They then answered questions
   about engaging in unprotected sex now or waiting some delay for
   condom-protected sex in each partner condition.
   Results
   Results indicate that the negative health outcome scenario with regret
   expression resulted in delayed sexual gratification in the most
   attractive and least STI partner conditions, whereas in the least
   attractive and most STI partner conditions the negative health outcome
   with and without regret resulted in delayed sexual gratification.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest that the sexual discounting task is a relevant
   laboratory measure and the framing of information to include regret
   expression may be relevant for prevention of risky sexual behavior.

   microdata from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).
   Multivariate analyses such as multiple linear regression (MLR) and
   factor analysis (FA) are used to classify, extract and interpret the
   household water-use costs. The FA results suggest two principal
   varifactors in explaining the variability of household water-use costs
   (64% in 2000 and 50% in 2010), which are grouped into a soft coefficient
   (social, economic and demographic characteristics of household
   residents, i.e., age, size, income, education) and a hard coefficient
   (dwelling conditions, i.e., number of rooms, units in the building,
   building age). The demographic profile of a high water-use household in
   Puerto Rico tends to be that of renters, people who live in larger or
   older buildings, people living in metro areas, or those with higher
   education level and higher income. The findings and discussions from
   this study will help decision makers to plan holistic and integrated

AB In online social media networks, individuals often have hundreds or even
   thousands of connections, which link these users not only to friends,
   associates, and colleagues, but also to news outlets, celebrities, and
   organizations. In these complex social networks, a 'community' as
   studied in the social network literature, can have very different
   meaning depending on the property of the network under study. Taking
   into account the multifaceted nature of these networks, we claim that
   community detection in online social networks should also be
   multifaceted in order to capture all of the different and valuable
   viewpoints of 'community.' In this paper we focus on three types of
   communities beyond follower-based structural communities:
   activity-based, topic-based, and interaction-based. We analyze a Twitter
   dataset using three different weightings of the structural network meant
   to highlight these three community types, and then infer the communities
   associated with these weightings. We show that interesting insights can
   be obtained about the complex community structure present in social
   networks by studying when and how these four community types give rise
   to similar as well as completely distinct community structure.

PY 2015
AB Objective
   Over 9.6 million ED visits occur annually for abdominal pain in the US,
   but little is known about the medical outcomes of these patients based
   on demographics. We aimed to identify disparities in outcomes among
   children presenting to the ED with abdominal pain linked to race and
   SES.
   Methods
   Data from 4.2 million pediatric encounters of abdominal pain were
   analyzed from 43 tertiary US children's hospitals, including 2.0 million
   encounters in the emergency department during 2004-2011. Abdominal pain
   was categorized as functional or organic abdominal pain. Appendicitis
   (with and without perforation) was used as a surrogate for abdominal
   pain requiring emergent care. Multivariate analysis estimated likelihood
   of hospitalizations, radiologic imaging, ICU admissions, appendicitis,
   appendicitis with perforation, and time to surgery and hospital
   discharge.
   Results
   Black and low income children had increased odds of perforated
   appendicitis (aOR, 1.42, 95% CI, 1.32-1.53; aOR, 1.20, 95% CI 1.14 -
   1.25). Blacks had increased odds of an ICU admission (aOR, 1.92, 95% CI
   1.53 - 2.42) and longer lengths of stay (aHR, 0.91, 95% CI 0.86 - 0.96)
   than Whites. Minorities and low income also had lower rates of imaging
   for their appendicitis, including CT scans. The combined effect of race
   and income on perforated appendicitis, hospitalization, and time to
   surgery was greater than either separately.
   Conclusions
   Based on race and SES, disparity of health outcomes exists in the acute
   ED setting among children presenting with abdominal pain, with
   differences in appendicitis with perforation, length of stay, and time
   until surgery.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the reliability of the Attitudes to Randomized
   Trial Questionnaire (ARTQ) in measuring perceptions of cancer clinical
   trials in a predominantly African American (AA) sample in South Carolina
   (SC).
   Methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cronbach's alpha
   estimates were used to assess the reliability of the ARTQ in a
   convenience sample of 315 participants (81.4 % AA) who were recruited
   from 2008 to 2013, and who live in eleven different counties in South
   Carolina with high rates of racial disparities in cancer mortality
   rates.
   Results: Slightly more than half of the 315 participants had at least a
   college education (77.9 %), 84.8 % were female, and 53.1 % had an annual
   income of $40,000 or more. In this study, PCA confirmed that the ARTQ is
   unidimensional. Cronbach's alpha for the ARTQ was 0.86.
   Conclusion: The ARTQ displayed strong evidence of high statistical
   reliability. This analysis has great implications for future research
   because it represents the first test of reliability of the ARTQ in a
   predominantly African American sample and lays the groundwork for use of
   the ARTQ in future studies in diverse populations.

AB Background
   According to the 2014 World Population Data Sheet, Nigeria has one of
   the highest fertility and lowest contraceptive prevalence rates around
   the world. However, research suggests that national contraceptive
   prevalence rate overshadows enormous spatial variations in reproductive
   behavior in the country.
   Objective
   I examined the variations in women's socioeconomic status and modern
   contraceptive use across states in Nigeria.
   Methods
   Using the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data (n = 18,910),
   I estimated the odds of modern contraceptive use among sexually active
   married and cohabiting women in a series of multilevel logistic
   regression models.
   Results
   The share of sexually active, married and cohabiting women using modern
   contraceptives widely varied, from less than one percent in Kano, Yobe,
   and Jigawa states, to 40 percent in Osun state. Most of the states with
   low contraceptive prevalence rates also ranked low on women's
   socioeconomic attributes. Results of multilevel logistic regression
   analyses showed that women residing in states with greater shares of
   women with secondary or higher education, higher female labor force
   participation rates, and more women with health care decision-making
   power, had significantly higher odds of using modern contraceptives.
   Differences in women's participation in health care decisions across
   states remained significantly associated with modern contraceptive use,
   net of individual-level socioeconomic status and other covariates of
   modern contraceptive use.
   Conclusion
   Understanding of state variations in contraceptive use is crucial to the
   design and implementation of family planning programs. The findings
   reinforce the need for state-specific family planning programs in
   Nigeria.

AB Child-welfare-involved youth may lack protective social bonds that could
   reduce their risk of substance use. We investigated whether caregiver,
   school, or peer bonds predict distinct patterns of substance use among
   child-welfare-involved youth. The sample included 720 participants in
   the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being II. Latent class
   analysis (LCA) and the three-step approach to incorporate indicator
   variables onto the latent classes were used. We found the following
   classes: (1) severe polysubstance use; (2) moderate polysubstance use;
   and (3) low use. Youth bonded to primary caregivers were less likely to
   be severe polysubstance drug users, but caregiver bonds did not protect
   against moderate polysubstance use. School bonds protected against
   severe polysubstance and moderate polysubstance. Youth bonded to deviant
   peers were more likely to be in the severe polysubstance use and
   moderate polysubstance use classes. Interventions targeting
   child-welfare-involved youth need to account for social bonds' effect on
   substance use.

AB Ocean and coastal ecosystems provide critical fisheries, coastal
   protection, and cultural benefits to communities worldwide, but these
   services are diminishing due to local and global threats. In response,
   place-based strategies involve communities and resource users in
   management have proliferated. Here, we present a transferable
   community-based approach to assess the social and ecological factors
   affecting resource sustainability and food security in a small-scale,
   coral reef fishery. Our results show that this small-scale fishery
   provides large-scale benefits to communities, including 7,353 +/- 1547
   kg yr(-1) (mean +/- SE) of seafood per year, equating to >30,000 meals
   with an economic value of $78,432. The vast majority of the catch is
   used for subsistence, contributing to community food security: 58% is
   kept, 33.5% is given away, and 8.5% is sold. Our spatial analysis
   assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the
   fishery (the "food shed" for the fishery), and we document that 20% of
   seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that
   are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for
   assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale
   food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with
   significant implications for conservation and management. This
   interdisciplinary effort aims to demonstrate a transferable
   participatory research approach useful for resource-dependent
   communities as they cope with socioeconomic, cultural, and environmental
   change.

AB Hidden fisheries include catfish harvesters who use trotlines and are
   seldom surveyed. We examined trotline fishers to describe fishing habits
   and techniques, trotline fishing knowledge, recreational motivations,
   and opinions of the fishery, regulations, and conflicts with other river
   users. Trotline fishers on the New River, Virginia, were secretive and
   solitary, and some were socioeconomically disadvantaged. They placed
   high importance on catch- and harvest-related factors, in contrast to
   many other angler groups who use highly specialized methods. They relied
   on harvesting catfish for varying degrees of sustenance to their diet or
   income. Trotline fishing appears to be part of a larger way of life for
   some rural individuals, who may also hunt, trap, and garden as part of
   activities to supplement their diet or income. New River trotline
   fishers strongly believed that participation in trotline fishing had
   declined significantly in the New River Valley due to improving
   socioeconomic status of the region, changing recreational values (such
   as focus on catch-and-release fishing and paddle sports), increasing
   recreational boat traffic and law enforcement presence, and decreasing
   participation in trotline fishing by younger generations.

AB Context: A multilevel model of work-life balance (WLB) has been
   established in the sports management literature to explain interactions
   among organizational/structural, individual, and sociocultural factors
   and their effects on individual responses and attitudes toward WLB.
   These factors influence experiences and outcomes related to WLB.
   Objective: To examine individual and sociocultural factors that may
   influence perceptions of female athletic trainers (ATs) employed in the
   National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I setting,
   particularly any sex-specific influences.
   Design: Qualitative study.
   Setting: National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 27 women (14 single with no
   children, 6 married with no children, 7 married with children) currently
   employed as full-time ATs in the Division I setting participated.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Participants responded to a series of
   open-ended questions via reflective journaling. Data were examined using
   a general inductive approach. Trustworthiness was established by
   multiple-analyst triangulation, member interpretive review, and peer
   review.
   Results: Participants recognized that their sex played a role in
   assessing WLB and a long-term career as an AT. In addition, they
   identified various individual-and sociocultural-level factors that
   affected their perceptions of WLB and attitudes toward a career goal.
   Conclusions: Our data suggested that female ATs may hold traditional sex
   ideologies of parenting and family roles, which may influence their
   potential for career longevity.

AB Notions of racial categories as biologically significant remain
   persistently salient to oppressive hegemonic ideas about race, despite
   scientific evidence to the contrary. Biomedical and epidemiological
   researchers are both professionally socialized and institutionally
   mandated to utilize racial categories in their research design,
   implementation, and interpretation processes, under the premise that
   doing so can facilitate the development of measures to combat racial
   disparities in health outcomes and care. However, when aggregate data
   intended to illustrate racial disparities are inappropriately
   extrapolated to the individualized context of biomedical clinical
   practice, essentialist notions of racial difference are reified. This
   paper integrates interdisciplinary perspectives from the fields of
   sociology, medicine, public health, epidemiology, evolutionary biology,
   and biological anthropology to explore the ideological, historical, and
   structural contexts through which the conflation of racial categories as
   indicators of group-level inequities in health outcomes and care
   experiences with essentialized notions of biological differences between
   racial groups may inform disparate care at the level of individual
   patient encounter in biomedical clinical practice.

AB Objectives. We present an applied example of social network diagramming
   from 2010 to 2012 that was used to guide follow-up in a large HCV
   cluster in rural Wisconsin.
   Methods. In addition to collecting standard individual-level attributes,
   we also obtained partner-level information. Both sets of data were input
   into a network diagramming program to create a series of diagrams that
   emphasized variables, such as risk factors, key location in the network,
   and number of partners.
   Results. The visualization and cluster analysis guided testing and
   intervention priorities, were useful in sharing de-identified
   information about the cluster between health departments and community
   organizations and illustrated the key role young females played in
   holding the cluster together.
   Conclusions. Social network diagramming should be considered a practical
   and important public health tool for use in cluster management.

AB Objectives. We examined potential synergistic effects of racial and
   socioeconomic inequality associated with small-for-gestational-age (SGA)
   birth.
   Methods. Electronic medical records from singleton births to White and
   Black women in 10 US states and the District of Columbia (n = 121 758)
   were linked to state-level indicators of structural racism, including
   the ratios of Blacks to Whites who were employed, were incarcerated, and
   had a bachelor's or higher degree. We used state-level Gini coefficients
   to assess income inequality. Generalized estimating equations models
   were used to quantify the adjusted odds of SGA birth associated with
   each indicator and the joint effects of structural racism and income
   inequality.
   Results. Structural racism indicators were associated with higher odds
   of SGA birth, and similar effects were observed for both races. The
   joint effects of racial and income inequality were significantly
   associated with SGA birth only when levels of both were high; in areas
   with high inequality levels, adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.81 to
   2.11 for the 3 structural racism indicators.
   Conclusions. High levels of racial inequality and socioeconomic
   inequality appear to increase the risk of SGA birth, particularly when
   they co-occur.

AB Objectives. We examined how state characteristics in early life are
   associated with individual chronic disease later in life.
   Methods. We assessed early-life state of residence using the first 3
   digits of social security numbers from blue-and white-collar workers
   from a US manufacturing company. Longitudinal data were available from
   1997 to 2012, with 305 936 person-years of observation. Disease was
   assessed using medical claims. We modeled associations using pooled
   logistic regression with inverse probability of censoring weights.
   Results. We found small but statistically significant associations
   between early-state-of-residence characteristics and later life
   hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease. The most consistent
   associations were with income inequality, percentage non-White, and
   education. These associations were similar after statistically
   controlling for individual socioeconomic and demographic characteristics
   and current state characteristics.
   Conclusions. Characteristics of the state in which an individual lives
   early in life are associated with prevalence of chronic disease later in
   life, with a strength of association equivalent to genetic associations
   found for these same health outcomes.

   Methods. We analyzed 2007, 2009, and 2011-2012 California Health
   Interview Survey data to examine the differences in dietary practices
   among Mexican and non-Mexican Latino children and 7 ethnic subgroups of
   Asian children. We used multivariable regression to examine the
   sociodemographic factors associated with specific dietary practices.
   Results. Latino subgroups of children had few differences in obesogenic
   dietary practices, whereas Asian subgroups of children exhibited
   significant differences in several obesogenic dietary practices. Korean
   and Filipino children were more likely than Chinese children to consume
   fast food and have low vegetable intake. Filipino children, followed by
   Japanese children, had the most obesogenic dietary practices compared
   with Chinese children, who along with South Asian children appeared to
   have the least obesogenic dietary practices. In general, income,
   education, and acculturation did not explain the dietary differences
   among Asian groups.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest the need to disaggregate dietary
   profiles of Asian and Latino children and to consider nontraditional
   sociodemographic factors for messaging and counseling on healthy dietary
   practices among Asian populations.

AB Objectives. We examined Hispanic men's recent risky and protective
   sexual behaviors with female partners by acculturation.
   Methods. Using the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, we
   performed bivariate analyses to compare acculturation groups (Hispanic
   Spanish-speaking immigrants, Hispanic English-speaking immigrants,
   Hispanic US natives, and non-Hispanic White men) by demographics and
   recent sexual behaviors with women. Multivariable logistic regression
   models for sexual behaviors by acculturation group were adjusted for
   demographics.
   Results. Compared with Hispanic Spanish-speaking immigrants,
   non-Hispanic White men were less likely to report exchange of money or
   drugs for sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.3; 95% confidence interval
   [CI] = 0.1, 0.9), but were also less likely to report condom use at last
   vaginal (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4, 0.8) and anal sex (AOR = 0.4; 95% CI =
   0.3, 0.7). Hispanic US natives were less likely to report condom use at
   last vaginal sex than were Spanish-speaking immigrants (AOR = 0.6; 95%
   CI = 0.4, 0.8). English-and Spanish-speaking immigrants did not differ
   in risky or protective sexual behaviors.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that targeted interventions focusing
   on unique sexual risks and sociodemographic differences by acculturation
   level, particularly nativity, may be helpful for preventing sexually
   transmitted infections.

AB Objectives. We estimated the prevalence of caregiver hospital food
   insecurity (defined as not getting enough to eat during a child's
   hospitalization), examined associations between food insecurity and
   barriers to food access, and propose a conceptual framework to inform
   remedies to this problem.
   Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 200 caregivers of
   hospitalized children in Chicago, Illinois (June through December 2011).
   A self-administered questionnaire assessed sociodemographic
   characteristics, barriers to food, and caregiver hospital food
   insecurity.
   Results. Caregiver hospital food insecurity was prevalent (32%).
   Caregivers who were aged 18 to 34 years, Black or African American,
   unpartnered, and with less education were more likely to experience
   hospital food insecurity. Not having enough money to buy food at the
   hospital, lack of reliable transportation, and lack of knowledge of
   where to get food at the hospital were associated with hospital food
   insecurity. The proposed conceptual framework posits a bidirectional
   relationship between food insecurity and health, emphasizing the
   interdependencies between caregiver food insecurity and patient
   outcomes.
   Conclusions. Strategies are needed to identify and feed caregivers and
   to eradicate food insecurity in homes of children with serious illness.

AB IMPORTANCE Neighborhood environments may influence the risk for
   developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but, to our knowledge, no
   longitudinal study has evaluated specific neighborhood exposures.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether long-term exposures to neighborhood
   physical and social environments, including the availability of healthy
   food and physical activity resources and levels of social cohesion and
   safety, are associated with incident T2DM during a 10-year period.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the Multi-Ethnic
   Study of Atherosclerosis, a population-based cohort study of adults aged
   45 to 84 years at baseline (July 17, 2000, through August 29, 2002). A
   total of 5124 participants free of T2DM at baseline underwent 5 clinical
   follow-up examinations from July 17, 2000, through February 4, 2012.
   Time-varying measurements of neighborhood healthy food and physical
   activity resources and social environments were linked to individual
   participant addresses. Neighborhood environments were measured using
   geographic information system (GIS)-and survey-based methods and
   combined into a summary score. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of
   incident T2DM associated with cumulative exposure to neighborhood
   resources using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for
   age, sex, income, educational level, race/ethnicity, alcohol use, and
   cigarette smoking. Data were analyzed from December 15, 2013, through
   September 22, 2014.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident T2DM defined as a fasting glucose
   level of at least 126mg/dL or use of insulin or oral antihyperglycemics.
   RESULTS During a median follow-up of 8.9 years (37 394 person-years),
   616 of 5124 participants (12.0%) developed T2DM (crude incidence rate,
   16.47 [95% CI, 15.22-17.83] per 1000 person-years). In adjusted models,
   a lower risk for developing T2DM was associated with greater cumulative
   exposure to indicators of neighborhood healthy food (12%; HR per
   interquartile range [IQR] increase in summary score, 0.88 [95% CI,
   0.79-0.98]) and physical activity resources (21%; HR per IQR increase in
   summary score, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71-0.88]), with associations driven
   primarily by the survey exposure measures. Neighborhood social
   environment was not associated with incident T2DM (HR per IQR increase
   in summary score, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.88-1.07]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Long-term exposure to residential environments
   with greater resources to support physical activity and, to a lesser
   extent, healthy diets was associated with a lower incidence of T2DM,
   although results varied by measurement method. Modifying neighborhood
   environments may represent a complementary, population-based approach to
   prevention of T2DM, although further intervention studies are needed.

AB Among well-known sociologists, Robert Nisbet was almost unique in
   considering himself a "conservative." He defined this orientation not in
   terms of conventional American partisan affiliation but as a
   sociological and anthropological perspective. Nisbet viewed human
   relations as requiring organic relations, which he assumed to be
   hierarchical and communally determined. Such relations seemed to Nisbet
   natural and even beneficial; and his lifelong interest in
   nineteenth-century social theory and his efforts to locate organicist
   positions among social thinkers of the Left, especially Emile Durkheim,
   can be attributed to an attempt to substantiate his understanding of
   basic human relations. Nisbet also significantly viewed contemporary
   America as departing rapidly and perhaps irreversibly from what he
   considered to be a good society. This concern pervades his studies of
   social theory; and it is possible to interpret his emphasis on the
   "conservative" origins of sociology and his attack on leveling public
   administration from the 1950s onward as related reference points.
   Against the social disintegration and social engineering that he already
   criticizes in his early work The Quest for Community, Nisbet (1990)
   poses his vision of personal authority and communal hierarchy. This
   vision is present in Nisbet's writings, from his early studies of French
   counterrevolutionary thinkers through his final assaults on America in
   the present age.

AB Introduction:Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides an important,
   underutilized approach to evaluating Community Academic Partnerships for
   Health (CAPHs). This study examines administrative data from 140 CAPHs
   funded by the Healthier Wisconsin Partnership Program (HWPP).
   Methods:Funder data was normalized to maximize number of
   interconnections between funded projects and 318 non-redundant community
   partner organizations in a dual mode analysis, examining the period from
   2003-2013.Two strategic planning periods, 2003-2008 vs. 2009-2014,
   allowed temporal comparison.
   Results:Connectivity of the network was largely unchanged over time,
   with most projects and partner organizations connected to a single large
   component in both time periods. Inter-partner ties formed in HWPP
   projects were transient. Most community partners were only involved in
   projects during one strategic time period. Community organizations
   participating in both time periods were involved in significantly more
   projects during the first time period than partners participating in the
   first time period only (Cohen's d = 0.93).
   Discussion:This approach represents a significant step toward using
   objective (non-survey) data for large clusters of health partnerships
   and has implications for translational science in community settings.
   Considerations for government, funders, and communities are offered.
   Examining partnerships within health priority areas, orphaned projects,
   and faculty ties to these networks are areas for future research.

AB Development of strong leaders and social stratification in prehistory is
   suitable for a political economy approach to the longue duree. Our goal
   is to encourage archaeologists to formulate prehistoric research that
   draws on historical materialism, the Marxist reasoning for understanding
   political economy. Three prehistoric cases from the Pacific (Lapita,
   Vanuatu, and Hawaii) help us evaluate the steps required to do this.
   Most importantly, we identify economic bottlenecks (constriction points)
   based on property rights for land or on production and trade of prestige
   goods. Resources can be mobilized by emergent elites at such bottlenecks
   to support strategies that enmesh land managers, captains, warriors, and
   priests to centralize power. A political economy approach in prehistory
   can help explain striking parallels observed for independent sequences
   as well as conjunctures and divergences in specific world culture areas.

AB Human life history is unique in the great length of its juvenile, or
   immature, period. This lengthened period(1) is often attributed to the
   time required for youth to master the culture, particularly subsistence
   and survival skills. But studies in increasing number show that children
   become skilled well before they gain complete independence and adult
   status. As children learn through play and participation in the domestic
   economy, they seem to be acquiring a reserve capacity of skills and
   knowledge that may not be fully employed for many years. To resolve this
   paradox, the theory offered here poses that this reserve capacity of
   children, both individually and collectively, can be rapidly activated
   to offset a shortfall in familial resources brought on by crises such as
   the loss of older family members. Additionally, social forces engendered
   by war, disease, famine, and economic change may lead to the wholesale
   recruitment of children into the labor forcewith consequent attenuation
   of the developmental opportunities of an extended juvenility. In effect,
   humans display a primary life history strategy and an accelerated
   strategy with a shortened period of dependency. A wide array of cases
   from anthropology and history will be offered in support of this
   proposal.

AB Background: Fruit and vegetable consumption is a marker of
   higher-quality diets; less is known about the contribution of 100% fruit
   and vegetable juices (FVJ) to diet quality. Objective: To explore FVJ
   consumption patterns in relation to dietary nutrient density among
   French children (aged 3-14 years old) and adults (>= 21 years old).
   Methods: Analyses were based on the nationally representative 2013 CCAF
   (Comportements et Consommations Alimentaires en France) survey of 1930
   respondents, stratified by age group, FVJ consumption, and socioeconomic
   status (SES). Dietary nutrient density was based on the Nutrient Rich
   Food (NRF9.3) index, adjusted for gender and age. Results: Mean total
   consumption of fruits and vegetables was 2.6 servings/day for children
   and 3.8 servings/day for adults. Mean population consumption of FVJ was
   83 mL/day for children and 54.6 mL/day for adults, equivalent to 0.4
   servings/day and 0.3 servings/day respectively. FVJ consumers had higher
   quality diets than did non-consumers, after adjusting for covariates.
   The respective NRF9.3 values were 486.4 +/- 4.3 vs. 428.7 +/- 7.5 for
   children and 460.7 +/- 4.4 vs. 435.4 +/- 4.4 for adults. FVJ consumers
   had similar or higher intakes of fruits and vegetables than did
   non-consumers. The socioeconomic gradient for FVJ consumption was much
   weaker (p < 0.046) than for whole fruit (p < 0.01). Conclusions: In a
   nationally representative sample of French children and adults, fruit
   and vegetable consumption fell short of recommended values. Higher FVJ
   consumption was associated with higher-quality diets and better
   compliance with the French National Plan for Nutrition and Health
   (PNNS).

AB This study assessed the socioecological resilience of family farms in
   three land reform settlements in Mato Grosso, Brazil, located in the
   ecologically threatened Cerrado biome. Using focus groups, a household
   survey, and analysis of soil samples we characterized farming systems
   and quantified indicators of resilience, which we contextualized with a
   qualitative analysis of distributions of power and access to rights and
   resources. In Mato Grosso, where diversified agriculture is a marginal
   presence in an industrialized agricultural landscape, none of the
   communities were achieving participant-defined threshold levels of any
   measured indicator of resilience. However, farmers who were members of a
   marketing cooperative selling produce through a federal public
   procurement program had significantly greater agrobiodiversity,
   plant-available soil phosphorus, household food self-sufficiency, and
   access to stable markets. Our pilot study suggests that the convergence
   of grassroots mobilization and political-institutional change is a
   central leverage point for developing more resilient food systems.

AB In this study the eco-cultural model of parenting (Keller, H. (2007).
   Cultures of infancy. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum) was applied to the study of
   joint attention behavior of children from families with different
   socio-economic status (SES). It was hypothesized that infants' early
   communication styles would differ with SES reflecting more independent
   or interdependent interactions with their caregivers. It was also
   hypothesized that infants would use the same types of behaviors whether
   they have declarative or imperative communication goals. The Early
   Social Communication Scales (ESCS, Mundy et al., 2003) was administered
   to 103 typically developing infants of 12 months (approximately half of
   them siblings of children with autism). A factor analysis, yielding four
   behavioral factors, namely pointing, eye contact, actions and following
   points, confirmed the hypothesis that infants use behaviors consistently
   across situations independent of their communicative intent. MANOVAs
   (comprising parental education and income) revealed that higher SES
   infants showed actions more frequently in the ESCS whereas lower SES
   infants followed experimenter's points more frequently. The results are
   discussed in the context of presumably differing socialization goals for
   infants and the divergent contribution of parental education and income
   that seem to have additive contribution to some factors (actions,
   following points) but divergent contributions to others (pointing, eye
   contact). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, research has provided support for a moderate, inverse

   However, the dynamics of this relationship remain poorly understood. The
   present study evaluates whether certain personality traits and emotion
   regulation variables predict short-term positive affect for individuals
   with social anxiety disorder and healthy controls. Positive affect as
   measured by two self-report instruments was assessed before and after
   two tasks in which the participant conversed with either a friend or a
   romantic partner. Tests of models examining the hypothesized prospective
   predictors revealed that the paths did not differ significantly across
   diagnostic group and both groups showed the hypothesized patterns of
   endorsement for the emotion regulation variables. Further, a variable
   reflecting difficulty redirecting oneself when distressed prospectively
   predicted one measure of positive affect. Additional research is needed
   to explore further the role of emotion regulation strategies on positive
   emotions for individuals higher in social anxiety. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Social behaviors are as diverse as the animals that employ them, with
   some behaviors, like affiliation and aggression, expressed in nearly all
   social species. Whether discussing a "family" of beavers or a "murder"
   of crows, the elaborate language we use to describe social animals
   immediately hints at patterns of behavior typical of each species.
   Neuroscience has now revealed a core network of regions of the brain
   that are essential for the production of social behavior. Like the
   behaviors themselves, neuromodulation and hormonal changes regulate the
   underlying neural circuits on timescales ranging from momentary events
   to an animal's lifetime. Dynamic and heavily interconnected social
   circuits provide a distinct challenge for developing a mechanistic
   understanding of social behavior. However, advances in neuroscience
   continue to generate an explanation of social behavior based on the
   electrical activity and synaptic connections of neurons embedded in
   defined neural circuits.

AB Across invertebrates and vertebrates, steroids are potent signaling
   molecules that affect nearly every cell in the organism, including cells
   of the nervous system. Historically, researchers have focused on the
   genomic (or "nuclear-initiated") effects of steroids. However, all
   classes of steroids also have rapid non-genomic (or
   "membrane-initiated") effects, although there is far less basic
   knowledge of these non-genomic effects. In particular, steroids
   synthesized in the brain ("neurosteroids") have genomic and non-genomic
   effects on behavior. Here, we review evidence that estradiol has rapid
   effects on aggression, an important social behavior, and on
   intracellular signaling cascades in relevant regions of the brain. In
   particular, we focus on studies of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and
   Peromyscus mice, in which estradiol has rapid behavioral effects under
   short photoperiods only. Furthermore, in captive Peromyscus, estrogenic
   compounds (THF-diols) in corncob bedding profoundly alter the rapid
   effects of estradiol. Environmental factors in the laboratory, such as
   photoperiod, diet, and bedding, are critical variables to consider in
   experimental design. These studies are consistent with the hypothesis
   that locally-produced steroids are more likely than systemic steroids to
   act via non-genomic mechanisms. Furthermore, these studies illustrate
   the dynamic balance between genomic and non-genomic signaling for
   estradiol, which is likely to be relevant for other steroids, behaviors,
   and species.

AB BACKGROUND: Studies focusing on hem hemorrhagic presentation of brain
   arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) have largely limited their analysis
   to angiographic features. We report the importance of race/ethnicity as
   a clinical factor associated with hemorrhagic AVM presentation in
   addition to previously reported angiographic features.
   METHODS: Data were prospectively and retrospectively collected on
   patients (N = 194) during the period 1993-2010 who presented with a
   single intracranial AVM, and baseline characteristics were compared for
   hemorrhagic presentation versus nonhemorrhagic presentation. Features
   that were statistically significant in univariate analysis or clinically
   significant were included in a multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 32 years; 372% of patients
   were male. Spetzler-Martin grades were I in 17.5%, II in 371%, III in
   28.9%, IV in 1(9%, and V in 1.5%. Baseline characteristics that differed
   significantly between patients presenting with hemorrhage compared with
   patients without hemorrhage were the following: race (P < 0.01), AVM
   size (P < 0.01), <3 feeding arteries (P = 0.01), absence of middle
   cerebral artery supply to AVM (P < 0.01), and AVM location (P < 0.01).
   Multivariate analysis revealed nonwhite race (odds ratio [011] = 3.09
   [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.52, 6.44], P < 0.01):, smaller AVM
   size (OR = 0.65 [95% CI = 019, 0.861, P < 0.01); and non frontal lobar
   OR = 2.61 [95% CI = 12, 5.591 P = 0.02), basal ganglia OR = 620 [95% CI
   = 1.52, 26.26]. P = 0.01), or brainstem locations (OR = 4.41 [95% CI =
   1.38, 14.92], P = 0.01) as factors associated with hemorrhagic
   presentation brain AVMs.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating
   that race/ethnicity is significantly associated with hemorrhagic
   presentation of AVMs. We also confirmed previous observations that AVM
   size and location are associated with hemorrhagic presentation.

AB Background: One of the most common causes of death among homeless and
   unstably housed women is acute intoxication where cocaine is present.
   While correlates of stimulant use have been determined in prior
   research, few studies have assessed risk factors of use specifically in
   this high-risk population.
   Methods: We sampled biological women with a history of housing
   instability from community-based venues to participate in a cohort
   study. Baseline and 6-month follow-up data were used to determine the
   relative risk of stimulant use (crack cocaine, powder cocaine or
   methamphetamine) among individuals who did not use at baseline.
   Results: Among 260 study participants, the median age was 47 years, 70%
   were women of color; 47% reported having unmet subsistence needs and 53%
   reported abstinence from stimulants at baseline. In analyses adjusting
   for baseline sociodemographics and drug treatment, the risk of using
   stimulants within 6 months was significantly higher among women who
   reported recent sexual violence (Adjusted Relative Risk [ARR] =4.31; 95%
   CI:1.97-9.45), sleeping in a shelter or public place (ARR= 2.75; 95%
   CI:1.15-6.57), and using unprescribed opioid analgesics (ARR= 2.54; 95%
   CI:1.01-6.38).
   Conclusion: We found that almost half of homeless and unstably housed
   women used stimulants at baseline and 14% of those who did not use began
   within 6 months. Addressing homelessness and sexual violence is critical
   to reduce stimulant use among impoverished women. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   (i.e., economic disadvantage, immigrant concentration, residential
   stability) and social (e.g., collective efficacy, social network
   interactions, intolerance of drug use, legal cynicism) factors on the
   likelihood of any adolescent tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use.
   Methods: Analyses drew upon information from the Project on Human
   Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN). Data were obtained from a
   survey of adult residents of 79 Chicago neighborhoods, two waves of
   interviews with 1657 to 1664 care-givers and youth aged 8 to 16 years,
   and information from the 1990 U.S. Census Bureau. Hierarchical Bernoulli
   regression models estimated the impact of neighborhood factors on
   substance use controlling for individual-level demographic
   characteristics and psycho-social risk factors.
   Results: Few neighborhood factors had statistically significant direct
   effects on adolescent tobacco, alcohol or marijuana use, although youth
   living in neighborhoods with greater levels of immigrant concentration
   were less likely to report any drinking.
   Conclusion: Additional theorizing and more empirical research are needed
   to better understand the ways in which contextual influences affect
   adolescent substance use and delinquency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Rapid population growth and coastal development are primary drivers of
   marine habitat degradation. Although shoreline hardening or armoring
   (the addition of concrete structures such as seawalls, jetties, and
   groins), a byproduct of development, can accelerate erosion and loss of
   beaches and tidal wetlands, it is a common practice globally. Here, we
   provide the first estimate of shoreline hardening along US Pacific,
   Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico coasts and predict where future armoring
   may result in tidal wetland loss if coastal management practices remain
   unchanged. Our analysis indicates that 22 842 km of continental US
   shoreline - approximately 14% of the total US coastline - has been
   armored. We also consider how socioeconomic and physical factors relate
   to the pervasiveness of shoreline armoring and show that housing
   density, gross domestic product, storms, and wave height are positively
   correlated with hardening. Over 50% of South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
   coasts are fringed with tidal wetlands that could be threatened by
   future hardening, based on projected population growth, storm frequency,
   and an absence of coastal development restrictions.

AB Development projects must increasingly include mitigation actions to
   offset their negative environmental and social impacts. However, current
   mitigation approaches can exacerbate social inequality by ignoring how
   the spatial location of offsets affects the benefits local people
   receive from ecosystem services (ES). Here, we present a method for
   tracking changes in ES benefits resulting from development and
   mitigation actions. To demonstrate this approach, we use as an example a
   proposed road through the Peruvian Amazon. We assessed the road's ES
   impacts and prioritized offsets in a socially equitable way. We found
   that the road is likely to have a disproportionate negative effect on
   drinking-water quality for nearby indigenous communities, and that
   offsets cannot fully compensate for these impacts. Equity was improved
   by including ES in spatial prioritization of mitigation. Including ES
   information in a "serviceshed"-based approach reduced average remaining,
   unmitigated impacts to drinking-water quality more than fourfold for
   sediment, 16-fold for nitrogen, and 38-fold for phosphorus loads, as
   compared with the impacts seen when offsets were sited based on methods
   relying on ecological processes alone.

AB There is a fundamental difference between the ways in which ecologists
   and lawyers view uncertainty: in the study of ecology, uncertainty
   provides a catalyst for exploration, whereas uncertainty is antithetical
   to the rule of law. This issue is particularly troubling in
   environmental management, where the tensions between law and ecology
   become apparent. Rather than acknowledge uncertainties in management
   actions, legal frameworks often force a false sense of certainty in
   linking cause and effect. While adaptive management has been developed
   to deal with uncertainty, laws and legal wrangling can be obstacles to
   implementation. In this article, we recommend resilience-based
   governance "adaptive governance" as a means to begin bridging the gap
   between law and ecology.

AB The personality trait of extraversion has been linked to problematic
   drinking patterns. Researchers have long hypothesized that such
   associations are attributable to increased alcohol-reward sensitivity
   among extraverted individuals, and surveys suggest that individuals high
   in extraversion gain greater mood enhancement from alcohol than those
   low in extraversion. Surprisingly, however, alcohol administration
   studies have not found individuals high in extraversion to experience
   enhanced mood following alcohol consumption. Of note, prior studies have
   examined extraverted participants-individuals who self-identify as being
   highly social-consuming alcohol in isolation. In the present research,
   we used a group drinking paradigm to examine whether individuals high in
   extraversion gained greater reward from alcohol than did those low in
   extraversion and, further, whether a particular social mechanism
   (partners' Duchenne smiling) might underlie alcohol reward sensitivity
   among extraverted individuals. Social drinkers (n = 720) consumed a
   moderate dose of alcohol, placebo, or control beverage in groups of 3
   over the course of 36 min. This social interaction was video-recorded,
   and Duchenne smiling was coded using the Facial Action Coding System.
   Results indicated that participants high in extraversion reported
   significantly more mood enhancement from alcohol than did those low in
   extraversion. Further, mediated moderation analyses focusing on Duchenne
   smiling of group members indicated that social processes fully and
   uniquely accounted for alcohol reward-sensitivity among individuals high
   in extraversion. Results provide initial experimental evidence that
   individuals high in extraversion experience increased mood-enhancement
   from alcohol and further highlight the importance of considering social
   processes in the etiology of alcohol use disorder.

AB Background: Breastfeeding is an effective intervention to reduce
   pediatric morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of practices and
   predictors of breastfeeding among the poor in Mesoamerica has not been
   well described.
   Objectives: We estimated the prevalence of ever breastfeeding, early
   initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding, and breastfeeding
   between 6 mo and 2 y of age using household survey data for the poorest
   quintile of families living in 6 Mesoamerican countries. We also
   assessed the predictors of breastfeeding behaviors to identify factors
   amenable to policy interventions.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 12,529 children in Guatemala, Honduras,
   Mexico (Chiapas State), Nicaragua, Panama, and El Salvador using
   baseline survey data from the Salud Mesoamerica 2015 Initiative. We
   created multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance
   estimates to calculate adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% CIs for
   breastfeeding outcomes and to control for sociodemographic and
   healthcare-related factors.
   Results: Approximately 97% of women in all countries breastfed their
   child at least once, and 65.1% (Nicaragua) to 79.0% (Panama) continued
   to do so between 6 mo and 2 y of age. Breastfeeding in the first hour of
   life varied by country (P < 0.001), with the highest proportion reported
   in Panama (89.8%) and the lowest in El Salvador (65.6%). Exclusive
   breastfeeding also varied by country (P = 0.037), ranging from 44.5% in
   Panama to 76.8% in Guatemala. For every 20% increase in the proportion
   of peers who exclusively breastfed, there was an 11% (aRR: 1.11, 95% Cl:
   1.04, 1.18) increase in the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed significant variation in the prevalence
   of breastfeeding practices by poor women across countries surveyed by
   the Salud Mesoamerica 2015 initiative. Future interventions to promote
   exclusive breastfeeding should consider ways to leverage the role of the
   community in supporting individual women.

AB Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess (i) prevalence of
   smoking in a population-based cohort of persons with spinal cord injury
   (SCI), (ii) history of quit attempts and (iii) the relationship between
   access to health care, socioeconomic status (SES), smoking status and
   history of quit attempts.
   Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Population-based SCI cohort.
   Methods: A total of 833 adults with SCI of at least 1-year duration were
   identified through a population-based surveillance system. Current
   smoking status, attempts to quit smoking in the past year and seeking
   professional help to quit smoking were assessed.
   Results: Over one-third (35.3%) of the sample were current smokers, of
   whom 75.4% had ever tried to quit, and of these, only 27.9% had ever
   sought professional help. Those with lower SES were more likely to be
   current smokers, as were those with less access to health care. Access
   to care was positively related to likelihood of having sought
   professional help.
   Conclusions: We found rates of smoking among persons with SCI to be well
   above national prevalence rates. We also found poorer access to care
   related to a greater likelihood of being a current smoker, had no
   association with trying to quit smoking, but decreased likelihood of
   using cessation support among those who did attempt to quit.

AB Exposure to racial discrimination has been linked to physiological
   reactivity. This study investigated self-reported exposure to racial
   discrimination and parasympathetic [high-frequency heart rate
   variability (HF-HRV)] and sympathetic (norepinephrine and cortisol)
   activity at baseline and then again after acute laboratory stress.
   Lifetime exposure to racial discrimination was measured with the
   Schedule of Racist Events scale. Thirty-two women (16 Black and 16
   White) with type 2 diabetes performed a public speaking stressor.
   Beat-to-beat intervals were recorded on electrocardiograph recorders,
   and HF-HRV was calculated using spectral analysis and natural log
   transformed. Norepinephrine and cortisol were measured in blood. Higher
   discrimination predicted lower stressor HF-HRV, even after controlling
   for baseline HF-HRV. When race, age, A1c and baseline systolic blood
   pressure were also controlled, racial discrimination remained a
   significant independent predictor of stressor HF-HRV. There was no
   association between lifetime discrimination and sympathetic markers. In
   conclusion, preliminary data suggest that among women with type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM), exposure to racial discrimination is adversely
   associated with parasympathetic, but not sympathetic, reactivity.

AB The performativity thesis is the claim that parts of contemporary
   economics and finance, when carried out into the world by professionals
   and popularizers, reformat and reorganize the phenomena they purport to
   describe, in ways that bring the world into line with theory. Practical
   technologies, calculative devices and portable algorithms give actors
   tools to implement particular models of action. I argue that social
   network analysis is performative in the same sense as the cases studied
   in this literature. Social network analysis and finance theory are
   similar in key aspects of their development and effects. For the case of
   economics, evidence for weaker versions of the performativity thesis is
   quite good, and the strong formulation is circumstantially supported.
   Network theory easily meets the evidential threshold for the weaker
   versions. I offer empirical examples that support the strong (or
   Barnesian) formulation. Whether these parallels are a mark in favor of
   the thesis or a strike against it is an open question. I argue that the
   social network technologies and models now being performed build out
   systems of generalized reciprocity, connectivity, and commons-based
   production. This is in contrast both to an earlier network imagery that
   emphasized self-interest and entrepreneurial exploitation of structural
   opportunities, and to the model of action typically considered to be
   performed by economic technologies.

AB This study assessed feelings of differentness in children with
   phenylketonuria (PKU) and elicited parental coping strategies. A total
   of 22 parents of 7- to 12-year-old patients with PKU completed
   qualitative interviews, which assessed whether they think their children
   feel different from their peers and identified potential solution
   strategies. The results showed that most parents indicated their child
   feels different due to PKU, which is frequently triggered by situations
   surrounding food. PKU community involvement and educating others about
   PKU were perceived by parents as useful coping strategies. Talking to
   children about differences was frequently used but one of the least
   effective strategies. Extended family, clinicians, and teachers also
   attempted to help children cope with feeling different with varying
   degrees of success. We concluded that most parents perceive that their
   child with PKU feels different and have developed strategies to manage
   these feelings. However, a subset struggle with helping their child cope
   and may benefit from assistance from healthcare providers. (C) 2015

AB In many cooperative animal societies, individuals can recognize their
   relatives and preferentially direct helping behaviors towards them.
   However, the ability to learn kin recognition cues may be constrained in
   societies with low relatedness, since group membership alone is not a
   reliable proxy for kinship. Here, we examine kin discrimination in the
   greater ani (Crotophaga major), a communally nesting bird in which
   several unrelated males and females reproduce in a single, shared nest
   and provide parental care to the mixed clutch of young. Each adult,
   therefore, is closely related to some nestlings in the clutch and
   unrelated to others. Food is limited and starvation is a significant
   cause of nestling mortality, suggesting that adults should increase
   their fitness by preferentially feeding their own offspring in the mixed
   clutch. To test this hypothesis, we cross-fostered broods of nestlings
   between pairs of nests, such that none of the nestlings in the
   manipulated nests were related to any of the adults feeding them. We
   found no evidence that adult greater anis discriminate between their own
   and unrelated nestlings: adults at cross-fostered groups fed nestlings
   at the same rates as adults at control (sham-manipulated) nests, and
   rates of nestling starvation were equal at cross-fostered and control
   nests. These results suggest that adult greater anis do not recognize
   their own nestlings, and they are consistent with the hypothesis that
   genetically encoded markers for kin recognition are rare in birds.

AB Objective: A better understanding of the prevalence of service
   provider-imposed barriers to family planning can inform programs
   intended to increase contraceptive use. This study, based on data from
   urban Kenya, describes the frequency of provider self-reported
   restrictions related to clients' age, parity, marital status, and
   third-party consent, and considers the impact of facility type and
   training on restrictive practices.
   Study design: Trained data collectors interviewed 676 service providers
   at 273 health care facilities in five Kenyan cities. Service providers
   were asked questions about their background and training and were also
   asked about age, marital, parity, or consent requirements for providing
   family planning services.
   Results: More than half of providers (58%) reported imposing minimum age
   restrictions on one or more methods. These restrictions were commonly
   imposed on clients seeking injectables, a popular method in urban Kenya,
   with large numbers refusing to offer injectables to women younger than
   20 years. Forty-one percent of providers reported that they would not
   offer one or more methods to nulliparous women and more than one in four
   providers reported that they would not offer the injectable to women
   without at least one child. Providers at private facilities were
   significantly more likely to impose barriers, across all method types,
   and those without in-service training on family planning provision had a
   significantly higher prevalence of imposing parity, marital, and consent
   barriers across most methods.
   Conclusion: Programs need to address provider-imposed barriers that
   reduce access to contraceptive methods particularly among young, lower
   parity, and single women. Promising strategies include targeting private
   facility providers and increasing the prevalence of in-service training.

AB Humans, unlike any other multicellular species in Earth's history, have
   emerged as a global force that is transforming the ecology of an entire
   planet. It is no longer possible to understand, predict, or successfully
   manage ecological pattern, process, or change without understanding why
   and how humans reshape these over the long term. Here, a general causal
   theory is presented to explain why human societies gained the capacity
   to globally alter the patterns, processes, and dynamics of ecology and
   how these anthropogenic alterations unfold over time and space as
   societies themselves change over human generational time. Building on
   existing theories of ecosystem engineering, niche construction,
   inclusive inheritance, cultural evolution, ultrasociality, and social
   change, this theory of anthroecological change holds that sociocultural
   evolution of subsistence regimes based on ecosystem engineering, social
   specialization, and non-kin exchange, or "sociocultural niche
   construction," is the main cause of both the long-term upscaling of
   human societies and their unprecedented transformation of the biosphere.
   Human sociocultural niche construction can explain, where classic
   ecological theory cannot, the sustained transformative effects of human
   societies on biogeography, ecological succession, ecosystem processes,
   and the ecological patterns and processes of landscapes, biomes, and the
   biosphere. Anthroecology theory generates empirically testable
   hypotheses on the forms and trajectories of long-term anthropogenic
   ecological change that have significant theoretical and practical
   implications across the subdisciplines of ecology and conservation.
   Though still at an early stage of development, anthroecology theory
   aligns with and integrates established theoretical frameworks including
   social-ecological systems, social metabolism, countryside biogeography,
   novel ecosystems, and anthromes. The "fluxes of nature" are fast
   becoming "cultures of nature." To investigate, understand, and address
   the ultimate causes of anthropogenic ecological change, not just the
   consequences, human sociocultural processes must become as much a part
   of ecological theory and practice as biological and geophysical
   processes are now. Strategies for achieving this goal and for advancing
   ecological science and conservation in an increasingly anthropogenic
   biosphere are presented.

AB "Heartwarming" social experiences, when one feels interpersonally
   connected to others, have recently been linked with physical warmth.
   According to one theory (Panksepp, 1998), "social warmth" and physical
   warmth may be closely linked because both experiences are supported by
   similar neurobiological mechanisms; however, the neurochemical
   substrates underlying this overlap have not been explored. Here, an
   opioid antagonist, naltrexone, was administered in order to examine the
   role of opioids, previously shown to alter temperature and social
   bonding behavior, on perceived thermal intensity, general positive
   affect, and feelings of social connection from physical warmth.
   Thirty-one participants took both naltrexone and a placebo and completed
   a temperature manipulation task (held a warm pack, cold pack, and
   neutral object) while on each drug. Replicating previous research,
   holding a warm (vs. a cold or neutral) object increased feelings of
   social connection. Moreover, blocking opioids reduced this effect.
   Hence, naltrexone specifically reduced feelings of social connection to
   holding a warm (vs. neutral) object but not to holding a cold (vs.
   neutral) object. These results lend further support to the theory that
   social and physical warmth share neurobiological, opioid receptor
   dependent mechanisms.

AB In a conversation, speakers and listeners will often influence each
   other's memories, and in doing so, promote the formation of a shared, or
   collective, memory. One means by which a mnemonic consensus emerges is
   through socially shared retrieval-induced forgetting (SSRIF). When
   listeners attend to the speakers' selective retrieval of previously
   encountered events, they forget unmentioned but related information more
   than they forget unrelated, unmentioned previously studied information.
   As a consequence, both speaker and listeners come to remember-and
   forget-the event in a similar way. SSRIF appears to be dependent on
   listeners concurrently retrieving the information with the speaker. We
   asked here whether such concurrent retrieval is a function of group
   membership, thereby underscoring the connection between a basic mnemonic
   mechanism-retrieval-induced forgetting-and a social function of
   communicative interaction-building a shared representation. In
   Experiment 1, Princeton students listening to a speaker selectively
   recall previously studied material showed SSRIF when the speaker was
   identified as a fellow Princeton student, but not when he or she was
   identified as a Yale student. In Experiment 2, activating a common
   student identity before the listening task triggered concurrent
   retrieval in Princeton students when listening to both Princeton and
   Yale speakers. Thus, similar patterns of selective forgetting are more
   likely to occur between speakers and listeners if they belong to the
   same social group. Basic mnemonic mechanisms seem to be adapted to
   promote the emergence of shared mnemonic representations that preserve
   group membership and group identity.

TI Money Priming Can Change People's Thoughts, Feelings, Motivations, and

AB Caruso, Vohs, Baxter, and Waytz (2013) posited that because money is
   used in free market exchanges, cues of money would lead people to
   justify and support the systems that allow those exchanges to take
   place. Hence, the authors predicted that money primes would boost system
   justification, social dominance, belief in a just world, and free market
   ideology, and found supportive evidence. Rohrer, Pashler, and Harris
   (2015) failed to replicate those effects. This article discusses the
   factors that predict priming effects, and particularly those pertinent
   to differences between Caruso et al. and Rohrer et al. Variations in a
   prime's meaning, the ease with which primed content comes to mind, the
   prime's motivational importance, and the ambiguity of the outcome
   situation influence the impact of the prime. Money priming experiments
   (totaling 165 to date, from 18 countries) point to at least 2 major
   effects. First, compared to neutral primes, people reminded of money are
   less interpersonally attuned. They are not prosocial, caring, or warm.
   They eschew interdependence. Second, people reminded of money shift into
   professional, business, and work mentality. They exert effort on
   challenging tasks, demonstrate good performance, and feel efficacious.
   Money priming is not the same as priming another popular means of
   exchange, credit cards, and can have bigger effects when there is an
   implied connection between the self and having money. The practical
   benefits of money have been studied by other disciplines for decades,
   and the time is now for psychologists to study the effects of merely
   being reminded of money.

AB BACKGROUND: Differences in antibiotic knowledge and attitudes between
   parents of Medicaid-insured and commercially insured children have been
   previously reported. It is unknown whether understanding has improved
   and whether previously identified differences persist.
   METHODS: A total of 1500 Massachusetts parents with a child,6 years old
   insured by a Medicaid managed care or commercial health plan were
   surveyed in spring 2013. We examined antibiotic-related knowledge and
   attitudes by using x 2 tests. Multivariable modeling was used to assess
   current sociodemographic predictors of knowledge and evaluate changes in
   predictors from a similar survey in 2000.
   RESULTS: Medicaid-insured parents in 2013 (n = 345) were younger, were
   less likely to be white, and had less education than those commercially
   insured (n = 353), P < .01. Fewer Medicaid-insured parents answered
   questions correctly except for one related to bronchitis, for which
   there was no difference (15% Medicaid vs 16% commercial, P < .66). More
   parents understood that green nasal discharge did not require
   antibiotics in 2013 compared with 2000, but this increase was smaller
   among Medicaid-insured (32% vs 22% P = .02) than commercially insured
   (49% vs 23%, P < .01) parents. Medicaid-insured parents were more likely
   to request unnecessary antibiotics in 2013 (P < .01). Multivariable
   models for predictors of knowledge or attitudes demonstrated complex
   relationships between insurance status and sociodemographic variables.
   CONCLUSIONS: Misconceptions about antibiotic use persist and continue to
   be more prevalent among parents of Medicaid-insured children.
   Improvement in understanding has been more pronounced in more advantaged
   populations. Tailored efforts for socioeconomically disadvantaged
   populations remain warranted to decrease parental drivers of unnecessary
   antibiotic prescribing.

AB BACKGROUND: Use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) among
   adolescents has increased since their introduction into the US market in
   2007. Little is known about the role of e-cigarette psychosocial factors
   on risk of e-cigarette or cigarette use in adolescence.
   METHODS: Information on e-cigarette and cigarette psychosocial factors
   (use and attitudes about use in the home and among friends) was
   collected from 11th- and 12th-grade participants in the Southern
   California Children's Health Study during the spring of 2014.
   RESULTS: Of 2084 participants, 499 (24.0%) had used an e-cigarette,
   including 200 (9.6%) current users (past 30 days); 390 participants
   (18.7%) had smoked a combustible cigarette, and 119 (5.7%) were current
   cigarette smokers. Cigarette and e-cigarette use were correlated.
   Nevertheless, 40.5% (n = 81) of current e-cigarette users had never
   smoked a cigarette. Psychosocial factors (home use of each product,
   friends' use of and positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes and
   cigarettes) and participant perception of the harm of e-cigarettes were
   strongly positively associated both with e-cigarette and cigarette use.
   Most youth who reported e-cigarette use had friends who used
   e-cigarettes, and almost half of current users reported that they did
   not believe there were health risks associated with e-cigarette use.
   CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies of adolescents are needed to determine
   whether the strong association of e-cigarette psychosocial factors with
   both e-cigarette and cigarette use will lead to increased cigarette use
   or dual use of cigarettes and e-cigarettes, or whether e-cigarettes will
   serve as a gateway to cigarette use.

AB The ability to adaptively inhibit responses to tempting/distracting
   stimuli in the pursuit of goals is an essential set of skills necessary
   for adult competence and wellbeing. These inhibitory capacities develop
   throughout childhood, with growing evidence of important maturational
   changes occurring in adolescence. There also has been intense interest
   in the role of social adversity on the development of executive
   function, including inhibitory control. We hypothesized that the onset
   of adolescence could be a time of particular opportunity/vulnerability
   in the development of inhibition due to the large degree of maturational
   changes in neural systems involved in regulatory control. We
   investigated this hypothesis in a longitudinal study of adolescents by
   examining the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the maturation of
   inhibition and concurrent brain function. Furthermore, we examined
   gender as a potential moderator of this relationship, given evidence of
   gender-specificity in the developmental pathways of inhibition as well
   as sex differences in adolescent development. Results reveal that lower
   SES is associated with worse behavioral inhibition over time and a
   concurrent increase in anterior cingulate (ACC) activation, but only in
   girls. We also found that lower SES girls exhibited decreased ACC
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) coupling over time. Our findings
   suggest that female adolescents with lower SES appear to develop less
   efficient inhibitory processing in dlPFC, requiring greater and
   relatively unsuccessful compensatory recruitment of ACC. In summary, the
   present study provides a novel window into the neural mechanisms by
   which the influence of SES on inhibition may be transmitted during
   adolescence. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3194-3203, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB Racial discrimination negatively impacts cardiac functioning, but few
   studies examine the more distal cardiac effects of racial discrimination
   experiences. The present study examined the momentary and prolonged
   impact of lab-based intergroup and intragroup racial discrimination on
   heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate (HR) in a sample (N = 42) of
   African American (AA) women across two days. On day one, the women were
   exposed to simulated racial discrimination from either a European
   American (EA) or AA confederate in the lab. On day two, the women
   returned to the lab for additional physiological recording and
   debriefing. Women insulted by the EA confederate exhibited lower HRV on
   day one and marginally lower HRV on day two. These women also exhibited
   marginally higher HR on day two. The HRV and HR effects on day two were
   not mediated by differences in perseveration about the stressor. The
   findings indicate that racial discrimination - particularly intergroup
   racial discrimination - may have both momentary and prolonged effects on
   cardiac activity in AAs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   its causes, and post-diagnostic care. This paper describes the cultural
   adaptation and translation of the Autism Speaks First 100 Days Kit into
   Korean for the purpose of improving autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   diagnosis, assessment, and interventions. The goal of this study is to
   describe a methodology for future cross-cultural adaptations and
   translations of outreach materials on ASD, using the Autism Speaks First
   100 Days Kit as an exemplar. The research involved two stages of
   qualitative interviews: unstructured individual and group interviews
   with 19 Korean child health and education professionals in Queens, NY,
   followed by structured cultural consensus modeling interviews with 23
   Korean mothers, with and without children with ASD, in Queens, NY and
   the greater Washington, DC area. We conclude that a systematic approach
   to cultural translation of outreach materials is feasible. Cultural
   consensus modeling yielded information about numerous barriers to care,
   had a demonstrable effect on the translation of the kit, and was
   efficient when employed with coherent segments of a relatively
   homogeneous population and focused on a single condition.

   with community and social participation outcomes in adulthood. We
   performed a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative
   cohort using the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 and observed a
   significant decrease in community participation from adolescence to
   adulthood (63 to 46 %); social participation remained stable. The
   presence of case management in adolescence was associated with increased
   community and social participation in adulthood. Case management may be
   crucial for optimal levels of participation among adults with ASDs.

AB There is a replication crisis in science, to which psychological
   research has not been immune: Many effects have proven uncomfortably
   difficult to reproduce. Although the reliability of data is a serious
   concern, we argue that there is a deeper and more insidious problem in
   the field: the persistent and dramatic misinterpretation of empirical
   results that replicate easily and consistently. Using a series of four
   highly studied "textbook" examples from different research domains
   (eyewitness memory, deductive reasoning, social psychology, and child
   welfare), we show how simple unrecognized incompatibilities among
   dependent measures, analysis tools, and the properties of data can lead
   to fundamental interpretive errors. These errors, which are not reduced
   by additional data collection, may lead to misguided research efforts
   and policy recommendations. We conclude with a set of recommended
   strategies and research tools to reduce the probability of these
   persistent and largely unrecognized errors. The use of receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves is highlighted as one such
   recommendation.

   of suicide ideation and attempts by sexual orientation, types of social
   connectedness, and their interaction. Among all youth, each type of
   connectedness modeled singly conferred protective effects for suicide
   ideation. Family and other adult connectedness protected against suicide

AB Background. Despite recognition of racial/ethnic surgical disparities,
   few studies have considered the role of surgical residents. This study
   aimed to elucidate whether disparities in postoperative outcomes are
   associated with the presence/level of surgical residents involved in
   procedures.
   Methods. Patients who were classified as having laparoscopic
   cholecystectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy, and open hernia repair' in
   the 2005-2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
   Improvement Program database were compared by level of provider (junior
   residents postgraduate year 1-2, senior residents, attending alone) for
   differences in patient demographics, clinical case-mix, and
   postoperative outcome information by the use of descriptive statistics
   and multivariable logistic regression.
   Results. A total of 196,770 patients met inclusion criteria. Attendings
   performed 43.0% of operations alone (senior residents 37.5%, junior
   residents 20.1%), They operated on 44.1% white, 30.1% black, and 43.9%
   Hispanic patients compared with 35.5%, 48.7%, and 41.3% and 20.4%,
   21.3%, and 14.8% for senior and junior residents, respectively. Compared
   with attendings alone, senior residents were more likely to operate on
   black patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval
   [95% 1.95-2.09) and have major (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21) and minor
   complications (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.31). Junior residents also were
   more likely to operate on black patients but did not experience
   significantly worse outcomes.
   Conclusion. Greater risk-adjusted odds of complications among patients
   treated by senior residents need to be carefully weighed given the
   group's higher likelihood of operating on minority patients.

AB Background. Despite nationwide campaigns to increase the use of helmets
   among pediatric cyclists, many cnildren continue to be injured while
   riding without a helmet. To determine where programs and policies
   intended to promote helmet use should be directed, we surveyed a large
   national dataset to identify variables associated with helmet use.
   Methods. The National Trauma Data Bank was queried during the years
   2007, 2010, and 2011 for children younger than the age of 16 years who
   were involved in a bicycle accident. Children were grouped based on
   whether they had a helmet on during the accident. A multivariable
   logistic mixed-effects model was utilized to determine factors
   associated with helmet use.
   Results. Of the 7,678 children included in the analysis, 1,695 (22.1%)
   were wearing a helmet during their accident. On unadjusted analysis,
   nonhelmeted riders were more likely to be older (median age 11 years vs
   10 years, P < .001), black (10.1% vs 3.7%, P < .001) or insured by
   Medicaid (32.8% vs 14.3%, P < .001). After adjustment, black children
   were still less likely to have had worn a helmet compared with white
   children (adjusted odds ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.28-0.50).
   Children on Medicaid were also less likely to have been wearing a helmet
   compared to children with private insurance (adjusted odds ratio 0.33,
   95% confidence interval 0.28-0.39).
   Conclusion. Children who are black or who are on Medicaid are less
   likely to be wearing a helmet when involved in a bicycle accident than
   white children or children with private insuragce, respectively. Future
   efforts to promote helmet use should be directed towards these groups.
