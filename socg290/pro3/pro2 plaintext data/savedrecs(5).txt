AB Largely based on pre-theory that ties high testosterone (T) to
   masculinity, and low T to femininity, high T is mainly studied in
   relation to aggression, mating, sexuality, and challenge, and low T with
   parenting. Evidence, however, fails to support this, and the social
   variability in T is better accounted for by a competition-nurturance
   trade-off as per the Steroid/Peptide Theory of Social Bonds (van Anders
   et al., 2011). Four key domains are discussed: adult-infant
   interactions, sexual desire, sexual behavior, and partnering. Empirical
   engagements with gender/sex are shown to lead to important insights over
   assumptions about masculinity-femininity. Humans are discussed within a
   comparative framework that attends to crossspecies principles informed
   by human insights alongside human-specific particularities like social
   constructions, which are critical to evolutionary understandings of the
   social role of T. This paper thus integrates seemingly orthogonal
   perspectives to allow for transformative approaches to an
   empirically-supported social phenomenology of T. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper investigates whether substantively distinct moral worldviews
   can help explain why certain people engage in different types of civic
   actions. Based on an analysis of survey data from a nationally
   representative sample of American adults, we find that, controlling for
   other important factors, a moral worldview emphasizing civic
   responsibility is more likely to encourage volunteer efforts that
   benefit the larger community than is one emphasizing personal
   fulfillment. Furthermore, we also find that a worldview emphasizing
   religious duty is less likely to promote involvement in civic activity
   that helps those in the larger community relative to a worldview
   emphasizing civic responsibility. But a religious worldview increases
   the probability of in-group volunteering relative to an individualist
   worldview. The implications of these findings for the broader
   scholarship on civic engagement and social capital and the role of
   culture in action are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine racial and ethnic
   differences in preterm births in infants conceived by in vitro
   fertilization (IVF).
   STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 97,288
   singleton and 40,961 twin pregnancies resulting from fresh, nondonor IVF
   cycles using 2006-2010 data from the Society for Assisted Reproductive
   Technology Clinic Online Reporting System.
   RESULTS: Rates of very early preterm (<28 weeks), early preterm (<32
   weeks), and preterm birth (<37 completed weeks) varied across racial and
   ethnic groups in both singleton and twin pregnancies. In singletons,
   with white women as the referent, after adjustment of confounding
   variables, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals
   (CIs) of very early preterm birth, early preterm birth, and preterm
   birth in black women were 4.8 (95% CI, 4.1-5.7), 3.9 (95% CI, 3.4-4.4),
   and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.9-2.3). Hispanic women had a significantly lower rate
   of preterm births as compared with black women and similar or slightly
   higher rates as compared with white women. Native American women were
   not at an increased risk of any types of preterm births; Asian women
   were at a reduced risk of preterm twin births (adjusted OR, 0.8; 95% CI,
   0.7-0.9).
   CONCLUSION: There exist notable racial and ethnic disparities in preterm
   births in infants conceived by IVF, suggesting that mechanisms other
   than socioeconomic disparities contribute to this difference.

AB Objective. Compelling evidence suggests that socioeconomic status (SES)
   is a determinant of health outcomes among persons with arthritis. SES in
   early life has likewise been associated with various aspects of health,
   but the connection between childhood SES and health among people with
   arthritis remains to be investigated.
   Methods. Data originated from a North Carolina network of primary care
   centers. Participants with self-reported arthritis with complete
   sociodemographic and relevant health information were retained in our
   sample (n = 782). We created summary measures for current and childhood
   SES from indicators of education, occupation, and homeownership, using
   parental SES as a proxy for participants' childhood SES. Linear
   regression models were used to assess the associations between health
   outcomes and SES variables separately and together, adjusting for key
   covariates.
   Results. Lower childhood and current SES scores were associated with
   worse disability and physical health. Current SES was furthermore
   associated with mental health and depressive symptoms. Associations of
   low current and childhood SES with health outcomes remained significant
   when concurrently included in a linear model.
   Conclusion. Childhood and current SES are both determinants of health
   among persons with arthritis.

AB Since the concept of team science gained recognition among biomedical
   researchers, social scientists have been challenged with investigating
   evidence of team mechanisms and functional dynamics within
   transdisciplinary teams. Identification of these mechanisms has lacked
   substantial research using grounded theory models to adequately describe
   their dynamical qualities. Research trends continue to favor the
   measurement of teams by isolating occurrences of production over
   relational mechanistic team tendencies. This study uses a social
   constructionist-grounded multilevel mixed methods approach to identify
   social dynamics and mechanisms within a transdisciplinary team. A
   National Institutes of Healthfunded research team served as a sample.
   Data from observations, interviews, and focus groups were qualitatively
   coded to generate micro/meso level analyses. Social mechanisms operative
   within this biomedical scientific team were identified. Dynamics that
   support such mechanisms were documented and explored. Through
   theoretical and emergent coding, four social mechanisms dominated in the
   analysischange, kinship, tension, and heritage. Each contains relational
   social dynamics. This micro/meso level study suggests such mechanisms
   and dynamics are key features of team science and as such can inform
   problems of integration, praxis, and engagement in teams.

AB Recent theory posits that the emotion of gratitude uniquely functions to
   build a high-quality relationship between a grateful person and the
   target of his or her gratitude, that is, the person who performed a kind
   action (Algoe et al., 2008). Therefore, gratitude is a prime candidate
   for testing the dyadic question of whether one person's grateful emotion
   has consequences for the other half of the relational unit, the person
   who is the target of that gratitude. The current study tests the
   critical hypothesis that being the target of gratitude forecasts one's
   relational growth with the person who expresses gratitude. The study
   employed a novel behavioral task in which members of romantic
   relationships expressed gratitude to one another in a laboratory
   paradigm. As predicted, the target's greater perceptions of the
   expresser's responsiveness after the interaction significantly predicted
   improvements in relationship quality over 6 months. These effects were
   independent from perceptions of responsiveness following two other types
   of relationally important and emotionally evocative social interactions
   in the lab, suggesting the unique weight that gratitude carries in
   cultivating social bonds.

AB People rapidly form impressions from facial appearance, and these
   impressions affect social decisions. We argue that data-driven,
   computational models are the best available tools for identifying the
   source of such impressions. Here we validate seven computational models
   of social judgments of faces: attractiveness, competence, dominance,
   extroversion, likability, threat, and trustworthiness. The models
   manipulate both face shape and reflectance (i.e., cues such as
   pigmentation and skin smoothness). We show that human judgments track
   the models' predictions (Experiment 1) and that the models differentiate
   between different judgments, though this differentiation is constrained
   by the similarity of the models (Experiment 2). We also make the
   validated stimuli available for academic research: seven databases
   containing 25 identities manipulated in the respective model to take on
   seven different dimension values, ranging from -3 SD to +3 SD (175
   stimuli in each database). Finally, we show how the computational models
   can be used to control for shared variance of the models. For example,
   even for highly correlated dimensions (e.g., dominance and threat), we
   can identify cues specific to each dimension and, consequently, generate
   faces that vary only on these cues.

AB We conducted a translational genomic pilot study to evaluate the impact
   of genomic information related to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk on

   participants, 96% opted for testing of three single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) related to CRC risk. Participants averaged 2.5 of 6
   possible SNP risk alleles (10% lifetime risk). At 3-months, participants
   did not report significant increases in cancer worry/distress; over half
   reported physical activity and dietary changes. SNP risk scores were
   unrelated to behavior change at 3-months. Many participants (64%) shared
   their SNP results, including 28% who shared results with a physician. In
   this pilot, genomic risk education, including discussion of other risk
   factors, appeared to impact patients' health behaviors, regardless of
   the level of SNP risk. Future work can compare risk education with and
   without SNP results to evaluate if SNP information adds value to
   existing approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Among the most replicated results in social cognition is the split
   between explicit and implicit attitudes; adults demonstrate weaker
   group-based preferences on explicit rather than implicit measures.
   However, the developmental origins of this pattern remain unclear. If
   implicit attitudes develop over a protracted period of time, children
   should not demonstrate the implicit preferences observed among adults.
   Additionally, unlike adults, children may report group-based preferences
   due to their lesser concern with social desirability. In Study 1,
   Christian adults showed the expected pattern of robust implicit
   preference but no explicit preference. In 4 additional experiments, 6-
   to 8-year-old children whose parents identified them as Christian viewed
   characters described as belonging to 2 starkly different religious
   groups ("strong religious difference") or 2 relatively similar religious
   groups ("weak religious difference"). Participants then completed
   explicit and implicit (IAT) measures of attitude toward Christians and
   either Hindus (Study 2) or Jews (Studies 3-5). Three main results
   emerged. First, like adults, children showed significant implicit
   pro-Christian preferences across all studies. Second, unlike adults,
   children in the "strong religious difference" case reported preferences
   of approximately the same magnitude as their implicit attitudes (i.e.,
   no dissociation). Third, even in the "weak religious difference" case,
   children showed implicit pro-Christian preferences (although, like
   adults, their explicit attitudes were not sensitive to intergroup
   difference). These data suggest that the seeds of implicit religious
   preferences are sown early and that children's explicit preferences are
   influenced by the social distance between groups.

AB Background. Women represent half of medical school graduates in the
   United States. Our aim was to characterize the effects of marriage and
   childbirth on the experiences of surgery residents.
   Methods. This was a prospective, longitudinal study of categorical
   general surgery residents between 2008 and 2010. Outcomes included
   changes in faculty and peer relationships, work-life balance, financial
   security, and career goals over time.
   Results. We included 4,028 residents. Compared with men, women in
   postgraduate years (PGYs) 1 through 5 were less likely to be married
   (28.2% to 47.3% vs 49.6% to 67.6%) or have children (4.6% to 18.0% vs
   19.0% to 45.8%) (P < .001). Women who married during PGY1 to PGY3 became
   worried about performing in front of senior residents (P = .005); men
   who married were more likely to be happy at work (P = .005). Women who
   had a first child during PGY1 to PGY3 were more likely to feel
   overwhelmed (P = .008) and worry about financial security (P = .03) than
   other women. Men who had a child were more likely to feel supported by
   faculty (P = .004), but they experienced more family strain (P = .008)
   compared to childless men.
   Conclusion. Marriage and childbirth are associated with divergent
   changes in career experiences for women and men. Women lag behind their
   male peers in these life events from start to finish of residency.

AB In response to the escalating epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD)

   at understanding the burden of CVD and evaluating cost-effective
   strategies to combat it was recently established. This paper describes
   the rationale and methods of the project MedCHAMPS to disseminate this
   successful experience.
   The framework of MedCHAMPS is exceptional in combining multiple
   disciplines (e.g. epidemiology, anthropology, economics), countries
   [Turkey, Syria, occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), Tunisia, UK,
   Ireland], research methods (situational and policy analysis,
   quantitative and qualitative studies, statistical modeling), and
   involving local stakeholders at all levels to assess trends of
   CVD/diabetes in the society and attributes of the local health care
   systems to provide optimal policy recommendations to reduce the burden
   of CVD/diabetes.
   MedCHAMPS provides policy makers in the MR and beyond needed guidance
   about the burden of CVD, and best cost-effective ways to combat it. Our
   approach of building developed-developing countries collaboration also
   provides a roadmap for other researchers seeking to build research base
   into CVD epidemiology and prevention in developing countries.

AB Community food production in the form of home gardening, community
   gardening, school gardening, and urban farming continues to increase in
   popularity in many parts of the world. This interest has led to public
   and private investment in community food production and increased need
   for urban agricultural planning as a way to manage growth and prioritize
   resource allocation. Municipal planning and thoughtful institutional
   support for the practice will require program evaluation and greater
   attention to the spatial composition and configuration of this widely
   dispersed practice. This article explores the results of
   community-supported landscape socio-ecological research in Madison, WI
   (USA) to assess the spatial and social dynamics of community food
   production. Results indicate that community food production resources
   are unevenly distributed across the study area. Historic community
   garden placement does appear to be consistent with community
   prioritization which dictates placing resources in areas with low median
   household income. However, home garden presence and recent community
   garden placement both occur in areas of higher than average median
   household income. Specific focus is placed on how an understanding of
   landscape placement and pattern has helped inform attempts to meet
   municipal and regional objectives in addressing urban food insecurity.

AB National human rights institutions, defined as domestic but globally
   legitimated agencies charged with promoting and protecting human rights,
   have emerged worldwide. This article examines the effect of these
   organizations on two kinds of human rights outcomes: physical integrity
   rights and civil and political rights. We analyze cross-national
   longitudinal data using regression models that account for the
   endogeneity of organizational formation. Our first main finding is that
   all types of human rights institutions improve long-term physical
   integrity outcomes but not civil and political rights practices. This
   finding may reflect a greater worldwide focus on physical integrity
   violations such as torture, and also many countries' propensity to
   resist Western civil and political rights standards. A second main
   finding is that time matters: in the cases we observe, initial increases
   in rated abuse levels were followed by improvements. These initial
   increases may be due to closer scrutiny or the expanded scope of what
   constitutes human rights abuses. Our results call for rethinking the
   concept of decoupling in the sociology of human rights and other focal
   areas.

   methods for comparing norm curves across contexts, we find significant

   than Turkish respondents. We discuss the role of culture in explaining
   these findings, paying particular attention to Turkey as a traditional

   during late life. Disability was tracked longitudinally over a 4-year
   period in a national sample of 805 Black and White older adults from the
   religion, aging, and health survey. Individuals with more extensive
   disability reported receiving greater amounts of tangible support from
   their congregations. However, receiving higher levels of tangible
   support was also associated with a slower trajectory of increase in
   disability over time. The relationship between congregational support
   and disability did not differ significantly between Blacks and Whites.
   Results support the hypothesis that social support networks based in the

AB Stress is a hypothesized pathway in socioeconomic status (SES)-physical
   health associations, but the available empirical data are inconsistent.
   In part, this may reflect discrepancies in the approach to measuring
   stress across studies, and differences in the nature of SES-stress
   associations across demographic groups. We examined associations of SES
   (education, income) with general and domain-specific chronic stressors,
   stressful life events, perceived stress, and stressful daily experiences
   in 318 Mexican-American women (40-65 years old). Women with higher SES
   reported lower perceived stress and fewer low-control experiences in
   everyday life (ps < .05), but greater chronic stress (education only, p
   < .05). Domain-specific analyses showed negative associations of income
   with chronic housing and financial stress (ps < .05), but positive
   associations of SES with chronic work and caregiving stress (all ps <
   .05 except for income and caregiving stress, p < .10). Sensitivity
   analyses showed that most SES-stress associations were consistent across
   acculturation levels. Future research should adopt a multi-dimensional
   assessment approach to better understand links among SES, stress, and
   physical health, and should consider the sociodemographic context in
   conceptualizing the role of stress in SES-related health inequalities.

AB Prenatal depression has been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes
   including preterm labor and delivery, and low birth weight. Social
   support also has been linked to birth outcomes, and may buffer infants
   from the adverse impact of maternal depression. In this prospective
   study, 235 pregnant women completed questionnaires about depression and
   social support. Clinical interviews were administered to assess for
   DSM-IV axis I disorders. Following delivery, birth outcomes were
   obtained from medical records. Babies of depressed mothers weighed less,
   were born earlier and had lower Apgar scores than babies of nondepressed
   mothers. Depressed women had smaller social support networks and were
   less satisfied with support from social networks. We found no direct
   associations between perceived social support and birth weight. However,
   depressed women who rated their partners as less supportive had babies
   who were born earlier and had lower Apgar scores than depressed mothers
   with higher perceived partner support. Women's perception of partner
   support appears to buffer infants of depressed mothers from potential
   adverse outcomes. These results are notable in light of the low-risk
   nature of our sample and point to the need for continued depression
   screening in pregnant women and a broader view of risk for adverse birth
   outcomes. The results also suggest a possible means of intervention that
   may ultimately lead to reductions in adverse birth outcomes.

AB Background
   Few studies have examined the relationship between sociodemographic
   factors and a population-based measure of developmental delay in US
   children. We identify sociodemographic factors associated with unlikely,
   probable and possible developmental delay in preschool US children using
   nationally representative data.
   Methods
   All children aged 18months to 5years in the 2007 National Survey of
   Children's Health were categorised into three groups based on the
   likelihood of developmental delay (unlikely delay, possible delay and
   probable delay) using a modified survey version of the Parents'
   Evaluation of Developmental Status questionnaire. Bivariate and
   multivariate multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess
   relations between sociodemographic variables and risk of developmental
   delay.
   Results
   Children had increased odds of probable delay (compared with unlikely
   delay) if they were older (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.41/additional year above
   the youngest age group (18months-2years), p<0.001), male (aOR=1.55,
   p<0.001), low birth weight (aOR=2.08, p<0.001), non-Hispanic black
   (aOR=1.50, p<0.01) or Hispanic in a non-English-speaking household
   (aOR=2.53, p<0.001) versus non-Hispanic white, had lower household
   income (aOR=1.33 for each decreasing category of poverty level,
   p<0.001), or received >10h/week of care at another family's home
   (aOR=1.71, p<0.05). Only four characteristics (being older, male, low
   birth weight and Hispanic living in a non-English-speaking household)
   were associated with increased odds of possible delay compared with
   unlikely delay.
   Conclusions
   Multiple factors, including demographic characteristics and indicators
   of social disadvantage, distinguish children with probable developmental
   delay from those unlikely to have developmental delay. Fewer factors
   identify children with possible delay.

   findingsThere has been recent recognition worldwide that SDH affect
   health throughout the life-course. Adolescents are a vulnerable
   population, with health behaviors, access, and outcomes shaped by social
   and environmental contexts. Medical homes have aimed to reduce the
   health inequities by facilitating connections with community resources.
   Interventions have been described in the literature for triaging social
   needs, connecting patients to resources, and utilizing multidisciplinary
   team members.SummarySDH should be incorporated into the routine
   adolescent healthcare. Screening tools and referral programs should be
   developed and evaluated in the adolescent population. Programs utilizing
   multidisciplinary team members would be effective in reaching
   adolescents and facilitating connections to resources.

AB This study investigated the effect of self-reported racial

   stress among post-menopausal women. One-hundred thirteen women (n = 94
   self-identified as White and n = 19 self-identified as racial/ethnic
   minority), 43% with type 2 diabetes, reported lifetime experiences of
   racial/ ethnic discrimination. Repeated assessments of flow-mediated
   dilation were performed at baseline, immediately after 5 min of mental
   arithmetic and at 20-min recovery. Both White and racial/ethnic minority
   women reported lifetime discrimination, with rates significantly higher
   among minorities. Self-reported lifetime discrimination was associated
   with attenuated flow-mediated dilation at recovery. Confounding
   variables, including clinical characteristics, mood, personality traits,
   other life stressors and general distress, did not better account for
   the effect of racial discrimination. Neither race/ethnicity nor diabetes
   status moderated the effect. The perceived stressfulness of the mental
   arithmetic was not associated with the endothelial response. In
   conclusion, self-reported lifetime discrimination is associated with
   attenuated endothelial recovery from acute mental stress. Elucidating
   the effects of discrimination and the biological mechanisms through
   which it affects the vasculature may suggest interventions to improve

   books and articles covered several centuries, and were devoted primarily
   to exposing the emotional undercurrents that animated the thought of
   intellectuals. Feuer tended to be highly suspicious of intellectuals,
   because they were susceptible to the allure of ideologies, which masked
   a dangerous will to power. His greatest achievement was to connect the
   contours of political and social thought to the drives of persons and to
   the context of institutions; his greatest limitation was to miss, at
   least in the United States, the deeper problem of popular hostility to
   science and to knowledge itself.

   corrosive and in tension with the humanist intentions of Berger. I
   largely agree with this critique, but I have doubts that a viable
   alternative could be developed within the framework of the social

AB Neighborhood characteristics, such as healthy food availability, have
   been associated with consumption of healthy food. Little is known about
   the influence of the local food environment on other dietary choices,
   such as the decision to consume organic food. We analyzed the
   associations between organic produce consumption and demographic,
   socioeconomic and neighborhood characteristics in 4,064 participants
   aged 53-94 in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis using
   log-binomial regression models. Participants were classified as
   consuming organic produce if they reported eating organic fruits and
   vegetables either "sometimes" or "often or always". Women were 21% more
   likely to consume organic produce than men (confidence interval [CI]:
   1.12-1.30), and the likelihood of organic produce consumption was 13%
   less with each additional 10 years of age (CI: 0.84-0.91). Participants
   with higher education were significantly more likely to consume organic
   produce (prevalence ratios [PR] were 1.05 with a high school education,
   1.39 with a bachelor's degree and 1.68 with a graduate degree, with less
   than high school as the reference group [1.00]). Per capita household
   income was marginally associated with produce consumption (p = 0.06),
   with the highest income category more likely to consume organic produce.
   After adjustment for these individual factors, organic produce
   consumption was significantly associated with self-reported assessment
   of neighborhood produce availability (PR: 1.07, CI: 1.02-1.11), with an
   aggregated measure of community perception of the local food environment
   (PR: 1.08, CI: 1.00-1.17), and, to a lesser degree, with supermarket
   density (PR: 1.02: CI: 0.99-1.05). This research suggests that both
   individual-level characteristics and qualities of the local food
   environment are associated with having a diet that includes organic
   food.

AB Although self-knowledge is an unquestioned good in many philosophical
   traditions, testing this assumption scientifically has posed a challenge
   because of the difficulty of measuring individual differences in
   self-knowledge. In this study, we used a novel, naturalistic, and
   objective criterion to determine individuals' degree of self-knowledge.
   Specifically, self-knowledge was measured as the congruence between
   people's beliefs about how they typically behave and their actual
   behavior as measured with unobtrusive audio recordings from daily life.
   We found that this measure of self-knowledge was positively correlated
   with informants' perceptions of relationship quality. These results
   suggest that self-knowledge is interpersonally advantageous. Given the
   importance of relationships for our social species, self-knowledge could
   have great social value that has heretofore been overlooked.

AB A classical model for social-influence-driven opinion change is the
   threshold model. Here we study cascades of opinion change driven by
   threshold model dynamics in the case where multiple initiators trigger
   the cascade, and where all nodes possess the same adoption threshold
   phi. Specifically, using empirical and stylized models of social
   networks, we study cascade size as a function of the initiator fraction
   p. We find that even for arbitrarily high value of phi, there exists a
   critical initiator fraction p(c)(phi) beyond which the cascade becomes
   global. Network structure, in particular clustering, plays a significant
   role in this scenario. Similarly to the case of single-node or
   single-clique initiators studied previously, we observe that community
   structure within the network facilitates opinion spread to a larger
   extent than a homogeneous random network. Finally, we study the efficacy
   of different initiator selection strategies on the size of the cascade
   and the cascade window.

   of a new product in a society, we developed a model of word-of-mouth
   diffusion and then applied it to data on social networks and
   participation in a newly available microfinance loan program in 43
   Indian villages. Our model allows us to distinguish information passing
   among neighbors from direct influence of neighbors' participation
   decisions, as well as information passing by participants versus
   nonparticipants. The model estimates suggest that participants are seven
   times as likely to pass information compared to informed
   nonparticipants, but information passed by nonparticipants still
   accounts for roughly one-third of eventual participation. An informed
   household is not more likely to participate if its informed friends
   participate. We then propose two new measures of how effective a given
   household would be as an injection point. We show that the centrality of
   the injection points according to these measures constitutes a strong
   and significant predictor of eventual village-level participation.

AB Objective: To describe the nutritional status of orphaned and separated
   children and adolescents (OSCA) living in households in the community
   (HH), on the street, and those in institutional environments in western
   Kenya.
   Methods: The study enrolled OSCA from 300 randomly selected households
   (HH), 19 Charitable Children's Institutions (CCIs), and 100
   street-involved children. Measures of malnutrition were standardized
   with Z-scores using World Health Organization criteria; Z-scores <=-2
   standard deviations (sd) were moderate-severe malnutrition. Data were
   analyzed using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for child
   age, sex, HIV status, whether the child had been hospitalized in the
   previous year, time living with current guardian, and intra-household
   clustering for adequacy of diet and moderate-severe malnutrition.
   Results: Included are data from 2862 participants (1337 in CCI's, 1425
   in HH's, and 100 street youth). The population was 46% female with
   median age at enrolment of 11.1 years. Only 4.4% of households and
   institutions reported household food security; 93% of children in HH
   reported an adequate diet vs. 95% in CCI's and 99% among street youth.
   After adjustment, OSCA in HH were less likely to have an adequate diet
   compared to those in CCI's (AOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0). After adjustment,
   there were no differences between the categories of children on
   weight-for-age, weight-for-height, or BMI-for-age. Children living in HH
   (AOR 2.6, 95% CI: 2.0-3.4) and street youth (AOR: 5.9, 95% CI: 3.6-9.5)
   were more likely than children in CCI's to be low height-for-age.
   Conclusion: OSCA in HH are less likely to have an adequate diet compared
   to children in CCI's. They and street children are more likely to be
   moderately-severely low height-for-age compared to children in CCI's,
   suggesting chronic malnutrition among them.

AB A traveler visiting Rio, Manila or Caracas does not need a report to
   learn that these cities are unequal; she can see it directly from the
   taxicab window. This is because in most cities inequality is
   conspicuous, but also, because cities express different forms of
   inequality that are evident to casual observers. Cities are highly
   heterogeneous and often unequal with respect to the income of their
   residents, but also with respect to the cleanliness of their
   neighborhoods, the beauty of their architecture, and the liveliness of
   their streets, among many other evaluative dimensions. Until now,
   however, our ability to understand the effect of a city's built
   environment on social and economic outcomes has been limited by the lack
   of quantitative data on urban perception. Here, we build on the
   intuition that inequality is partly conspicuous to create quantitative
   measure of a city's contrasts. Using thousands of geo-tagged images, we
   measure the perception of safety, class and uniqueness; in the cities of
   Boston and New York in the United States, and Linz and Salzburg in
   Austria, finding that the range of perceptions elicited by the images of
   New York and Boston is larger than the range of perceptions elicited by
   images from Linz and Salzburg. We interpret this as evidence that the
   cityscapes of Boston and New York are more contrasting, or unequal, than
   those of Linz and Salzburg. Finally, we validate our measures by
   exploring the connection between them and homicides, finding a
   significant correlation between the perceptions of safety and class and
   the number of homicides in a NYC zip code, after controlling for the
   effects of income, population, area and age. Our results show that
   online images can be used to create reproducible quantitative measures
   of urban perception and characterize the inequality of different cities.

AB Out-of-wedlock childbearing is more common in the U. S. than in other
   countries and becoming more so. A growing share of such non-marital
   births identify the father, which can create a legal entitlement to
   child support. Relatively little is known about individual determinants
   of the decision to establish paternity, in part because of data
   limitations. In this paper, we evaluate all birth records in Michigan
   from 1993 to 2006, which have been merged to the paternity registry. In
   2006, 30,231 Michigan children, almost one quarter of all Michigan
   births, were born to unmarried mothers and had paternity acknowledged.
   We find that births with paternity acknowledged have worse outcomes
   along various health and socioeconomic dimensions relative to births to
   married parents, but better outcomes relative to births to unmarried
   parents without paternity acknowledgement. Furthermore, unmarried men
   who father sons are significantly more likely to acknowledge paternity

AB Using information from research on the neuroplasticity of selective
   attention and on the central role of successful parenting in child
   development, we developed and rigorously assessed a family-based
   training program designed to improve brain systems for selective
   attention in preschool children. One hundred forty-one lower
   socioeconomic status preschoolers enrolled in a Head Start program were
   randomly assigned to the training program, Head Start alone, or an
   active control group. Electrophysiological measures of children's brain
   functions supporting selective attention, standardized measures of
   cognition, and parent-reported child behaviors all favored children in
   the treatment program relative to both control groups. Positive changes
   were also observed in the parents themselves. Effect sizes ranged from
   one-quarter to half of a standard deviation. These results lend impetus
   to the further development and broader implementation of evidence-based
   education programs that target at-risk families.

AB Recent research suggests that social networks may present an avenue for
   intervention against obesity. By using a simulation model in which
   artificial individuals were nested in a social network, we assessed
   whether interventions targeting highly networked individuals could help
   reduce population obesity. We compared the effects of targeting
   antiobesity interventions at the most connected individuals in a network
   with those targeting individuals at random. We tested 2 interventions,
   the first "preventing" obesity among 10% of the population at simulation
   outset and the second "treating" obesity among 10% of the obese
   population yearly, each in 2 separate simulations. One simulation
   featured a literature-based parameter for the network spread of obesity,
   and the other featured an artificially high parameter. Interventions
   that targeted highly networked individuals did not outperform at-random
   interventions in simulations featuring the literature-based parameter.
   However, in simulations featuring the artificially high parameter, the
   targeted prevention intervention outperformed the at-random
   intervention, whereas the treatment intervention implemented at random
   outperformed the targeted treatment intervention. Results were
   qualitatively similar across network topologies and intervention scales.
   Although descriptive studies suggest that social networks influence the
   spread of obesity, policies targeting well-connected individuals in
   social networks may not improve obesity reduction. We highlight and
   discuss the potential applications of counterfactual simulations in
   epidemiology.

AB It is known that the level of HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and the degree
   of condom use varies by socioeconomic status (SES). However, there is
   limited research on the effect of mass media use on HIV/AIDS-related
   cognitive and behavioral outcomes in low-income countries and how it
   might influence the association between SES and HIV-related outcomes. We
   investigated the moderating effect of media use on the relationship
   between SES and HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and condom use in sub-Saharan
   Africa in terms of communication inequalities. Cross-sectional data from
   the Demographic Health Surveys from 13 sub-Saharan countries (2004-10)
   were pooled. Gender-stratified multivariable poisson regression of
   151,209 women and 68,890 men were used to calculate adjusted relative
   ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the associations between SES,
   media use, HIV-related outcomes, and condom use. We found significant
   disparities in mass media use among people from different SES groups as
   well as among countries. Education and wealth are strongly and
   positively associated with awareness of HIV/AIDS and knowledge about
   transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS and are significantly associated
   with condom use. These associations are attenuated when the use of
   various types of mass media is added to the models, with newspapers
   showing the strongest effect. The findings of this study suggest that
   media use has the potential to blunt the impact of socioeconomic status
   though not completely eliminate it. Thus, we need to pay attention to
   reducing communication inequalities among social groups and countries to
   moderate the effect of wealth and SES on HIV/AIDS.

AB People often cooperate with members of their own group, and discriminate
   against members of other groups. Previous research establishes that
   cultural groups can form endogenously, and that these groups demonstrate
   in-group favouritism. Given the presence of cultural groups, the
   previous literature argues that cultural evolution selects for groups
   that exhibit parochial altruism. The source of initial variation in
   these traits, however, remains uninformed. We show here that a group's
   economic production environment may substantially influence parochial
   tendencies, with groups formed around more cooperative production (CP)
   displaying less parochialism than groups formed around more independent
   production (IP) processes. Participants randomized into CP and IP
   production tasks formed cultural groups, and subsequently played
   hidden-action trust games with in-group and out-group trustees. We found
   CP to be associated with significantly greater sharing and exchanging
   behaviours than IP. In trust games, significant parochial altruism
   (in-group favouritism combined with out-group discrimination) was
   displayed by members of IP groups. By contrast, members of CP groups did
   not engage in either in-group favouritism or out-group discrimination.
   Further, we found the absence of out-group discrimination in CP to
   persist even following 'betrayal'. Finally, belief data suggest that
   members of CP are not more intrinsically generous than IP members, but
   rather more likely to believe that out-group trustees will positively
   reciprocate. Our results have important implications for anyone
   interested in building cooperative teams, and shed new light on
   connections between culture and cooperation.

AB Human mobility is differentiated by time scales. While the mechanism for
   long time scales has been studied, the underlying mechanism on the daily
   scale is still unrevealed. Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible
   for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial
   trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the
   concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks
   are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These
   networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per
   cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for
   different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif,
   which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human
   mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for
   Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by
   periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.

AB Global HIV control funding falls short of need. To maximize health
   outcomes, it is critical that national governments sustain reasonable
   commitments, and that international donor assistance be distributed
   according to country needs and funding gaps. We develop a country
   classification framework in terms of actual versus expected national
   domestic funding, considering resource needs and donor financing. With
   UNAIDS and World Bank data, we examine domestic and donor HIV program
   funding in relation to need in 84 low-and middle-income countries. We
   estimate expected domestic contributions per person living with HIV
   (PLWH) as a function of per capita income, relative size of the health
   sector, and per capita foreign debt service. Countries are categorized
   according to levels of actual versus expected domestic contributions,
   and resource gap. Compared to national resource needs (UNAIDS Investment
   Framework), we identify imbalances among countries in actual versus
   expected domestic and donor contributions: 17 countries, with relatively
   high HIV prevalence and GNI per capita, have domestic funding below
   expected (median per PLWH $143 and $376, respectively), yet total
   available funding including from donors would exceed the need ($368 and
   $305, respectively) if domestic contribution equaled expected.
   Conversely, 27 countries have actual domestic funding above the expected
   (medians $294 and $149) but total (domestic+donor) funding does not meet
   estimated need ($685 and $1,173). Across the 84 countries, in 2009,
   estimated resource need totaled $10.3 billion, actual domestic
   contributions $5.1 billion and actual donor contributions $3.7 billion.
   If domestic contributions would increase to the expected level in
   countries where the actual was below expected, total domestic
   contributions would increase to $7.4 billion, turning a funding gap of
   $1.5 billion into a surplus of $0.8 billion. Even with imperfect funding
   and resource-need data, the proposed country classification could help
   improve coherence and efficiency in domestic and international
   allocations.

AB In this paper we explore two contrasting perspectives on individuals'
   participation in associations. On the one hand, some have considered
   participation the byproduct of pre-existing friendship ties - the more
   friends one already has in the association, the more likely he or she is
   to participate. On the other hand, some have considered participation to
   be driven by the association's capacity to form new identities - the
   more new friends one meets in the association, the more likely he or she
   is to participate. We use detailed temporal data from an online
   association to adjudicate between these two mechanisms and explore their
   interplay. Our results show a significant impact of new friendship ties
   on participation, compared to a negligible impact of pre-existing
   friends, defined here as ties to other members formed outside of the
   organization's context. We relate this finding to the sociological
   literature on participation and we explore its implications in the
   discussion.

AB Although inhibited behavior problems are prevalent in childhood,
   relatively little is known about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors
   that predict a child's ability to regulate inhibited behavior during
   fear and anxiety-provoking tasks. Inhibited behavior may be linked to
   both disruptions in avoid ancerelated processing of aversive stimuli and
   in approach-related processing of appetitive stimuli, but previous
   findings are contradictory and rarely integrate consideration of the
   socialization context. The current exploratory study used a novel
   combination of neurophysiological and observation-based methods to
   examine whether an europhysiological measure sensitive to approach- and
   avoidance-oriented emotional processing, the late positive potential
   (LPP), interacted with observed approach (promotion) and avoidance-
   (prevention) oriented parenting practices to predict children's observed
   inhibited behavior. Participants were 5- to 7-year-old (N=32)
   typically-developing children (M = 75.72 months, SD = 6.01).
   Electroencephalography was continuously recorded while children viewed
   aversive, appetitive, or neutral images, and the LPP was generated to
   each picture type separately.

AB Background: There is considerable evidence of racial/ethnic patterning
   of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk in the United States. There
   is also evidence that poorer persons are at increased STI risk. Evidence
   regarding the interaction of race/ethnicity and income is limited,
   particularly nationally at the individual level.
   Methods: We examined the pattern of socioeconomic gradients in STI
   infection among young people in a nationwide US study and determined how
   these gradients varied by race/ethnicity. We estimated the cumulative
   diagnosis prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis (via
   self-report or laboratory confirmation) for young adults (ages, 18-26
   years old) Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and others across
   income quintiles in the Add Health data set. We ran regression models to
   evaluate these relationships adjusting for individual- and school-level
   covariates.
   Results: Sexually transmitted infection diagnosis was independently
   associated with both racial/ethnic identity and with low income,
   although the racial/ethnic disparities were much larger than
   income-based ones. A negative gradient of STI risk with increasing
   income was present within all racial/ethnic categories, but was stronger
   for nonwhites.
   Conclusions: Both economic and racial/ethnic factors should be
   considered in deciding how to target STI prevention efforts in the
   United States. Particular focus may be warranted for poor, racial/ethnic
   minority women.

AB Objectives. We examined racial/ethnic disparities in health care receipt
   among a nationally representative sample of male cancer survivors.
   Methods. We identified men aged 18 years and older from the 2006-2010
   National Health Interview Survey who reported a history of cancer. We
   assessed health care receipt in 4 self-reported measures: primary care
   visit, specialist visit, flu vaccination, and pneumococcal vaccination.
   We used hierarchical logistic regression modeling, stratified by age
   (<65 years vs >= 65 years).
   Results. In adjusted models, older African American and Hispanic
   survivors were approximately twice as likely as were non-Hispanic Whites
   to not see a specialist (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval
   [CI] = 1.19, 2.68 and OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.18, 3.70, respectively), not
   receive the flu vaccine (OR = 2.21; 95% CI = 1.45, 3.37 and OR = 2.20;
   95% CI = 1.21, 4.01, respectively), and not receive the pneumococcal
   vaccine (OR = 2.24; 95% CI = 1.54, 3.24 and OR = 3.10; 95% CI = 1.75,
   5.51, respectively).
   Conclusions. Racial/ethnic disparities in health care receipt are
   evident among older, but not younger, cancer survivors, despite access
   to Medicare. These survivors may be less likely to see specialists,
   including oncologists, and receive basic preventive care.

AB Objectives. Physician recommendation plays a crucial role in receiving
   endoscopic screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). This study explored
   factors associated with racial/ethnic differences in rates of screening
   recommendation.
   Methods. Data on 5900 adults eligible for endoscopic screening were
   obtained from the National Health Interview Survey. Odds ratios of
   receiving an endoscopy recommendation were calculated for selected
   variables. Planned, sequenced logistic regressions were conducted to
   examine the extent to which socioeconomic and health care variables
   account for racial/ethnic disparities in recommendation rates.
   Results. Differential rates were observed for CRC screening and
   screening recommendations among racial/ethnic groups. Compared with
   Whites, Hispanics were 34% less likely (P<.01) and Blacks were 26% less
   likely (P<.05) to receive this recommendation. The main predictors that
   emerged in sequenced analysis were education for Hispanics and Blacks
   and income for Blacks. After accounting for the effects of usual source
   of care, insurance coverage, and education, the disparity reduced and
   became statistically insignificant.
   Conclusions. Socioeconomic status and access to health care may explain
   major racial/ethnic disparities in CRC screening recommendation rates.

   since 2000 that analyzed indicators of friendship influences (e.g.,
   communication about PA, friends' PA, and PA with friends) among persons
   younger than 19 years.
   Children's PA was positively associated with encouragement from friends
   (43 of 55 studies indicating a positive relationship), friends' own PA
   (30/35), and engagement with friends in PA (9/10). These findings are
   consistent with friends influencing PA, but most studies did not isolate
   influence from other factors that could explain similarity.
   Understanding friendship influences in childhood can facilitate the
   promotion of lifelong healthy habits. PA with friends should be
   considered in health promotion programs.

   although data on risk factors for new (incident) infections are limited.
   We examined incidence of HIV infection and risk and protective factors
   among youth in rural Uganda, including the role of gender and social
   transitions.
   Methods: Participants were sexually experienced youth (15-24 years old)
   enrolled in the Rakai Community Cohort Study, 1999-2008 (n = 6741).
   Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to estimate
   incident rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of incident
   HIV infection.
   Results: HIV incidence was greater among young women than young men
   (14.1 vs. 8.3 per 1000 person-years, respectively); this gender
   disparity was greater among teenagers (14.9 vs. 3.6). Beyond behavioral
   (multiple partners and concurrency) and biological factors (sexually
   transmitted infection symptoms), social transitions such as marriage and
   staying in school influenced HIV risk. In multivariate analyses among
   women, HIV incidence was associated with living in a trading village
   (adjusted IRR (aIRR) = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.11), being a student
   (aIRR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.72), current marriage (aIRR = 0.55; 95%

   having multiple partners, and sexually transmitted infection symptoms.
   Among men, new infections were associated with former marriage (aIRR =
   5.57; 95% CI: 2.51 to 12.36), genital ulceration (aIRR = 3.56; 95% CI:
   1.97 to 6.41), and alcohol use (aIRR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.15 to 3.77).
   Conclusions: During the third decade of the HIV epidemic in Uganda, HIV
   incidence remains considerable among youth, with young women
   particularly at risk. The risk for new infections was strongly shaped by
   social transitions such as leaving school, entrance into marriage, and
   marital dissolution; the impact of marriage was different for young men
   than women.

AB Objective: To explore whether primary school entry is associated with
   changes in immune system parameters in HIV-affected children.
   HIV-affected children are vulnerable to psychosocial stressors,
   regardless of their own HIV serological status. Methods: Data from 38
   HIV-positive and 29 HIV-negative children born to seropositive women
   were obtained. Measures included family adversity questionnaires,
   autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity, and enumerative and
   functional changes in peripheral blood immune parameters. Results: In
   comparison with children who were HIV-negative, children who were
   HIV-positive at baseline had fewer CD4(+) T lymphocytes (mean [M] = 916
   versus 1206 cells/mm(3) x 10(3); F = 7.8, p = .007), more CD8(+) cells
   (M = 1046 versus 720 cells/mm(3) x 10(3); F = 7.98, p = .006), and
   diminished natural killer cell cytotoxicity (M=-0.29 versus 0.41; F =
   8.87, p=.004). School entry was associated with changes in immune
   parameters, but HIV status was not associated with the magnitude of
   changes. Changes in immune parameters after school entry were associated
   with family stress and preschool entry ANS reactivity. Highly ANS
   reactive children had either the greatest increase in CD8(+) cells after
   school entry or the greatest decrease, depending on reported levels of
   family adversity (B = 215.35; t = 3.74, p < .001). Changes in functional
   immune assays were significantly associated with the interactions
   between HIV status and ANS reactivity. Conclusions: These results
   suggest that autonomic reactivity is associated with increased
   immunological sensitivity to adverse or challenging social contexts
   among children affected by HIV.

AB Objective: To examine multiple aspects of anger experience and
   expression (frequency, outward expression, suppression, and control) as
   moderators of the association of social inequality, as measured by
   educational status, with inflammation and coagulation markers. Methods:
   After survey assessments via telephone and mail, Midlife in the United
   States respondents (N = 1054) participated in an overnight clinic visit,
   where they completed anger questionnaires and provided a fasting blood
   sample to measure interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and
   fibrinogen. Results: Educational status was linked to higher anger
   control among men (B - 0.14, p - .001). Significant inverse correlations
   emerged between education and IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen (r values >=
   -0.09, p values < .004) and between anger control and IL-6 and CRP (r
   values = -0.07, p values < .03). Controlling for demographic and health
   status covariates, anger-in predicted lower fibrinogen (p = .03).
   Interactions between education and anger measures were significant for
   education and trait anger as related to fibrinogen (p = .02) and
   education and anger-out as related to IL-6 (p = .05) and fibrinogen (p =
   .05). As predicted, the inverse relationships between education and IL-6
   and fibrinogen were stronger among individuals reporting high anger.
   Anger control also moderated the association of education with IL-6 in
   women (p = .026), such that the link between education and IL-6 was
   attenuated among women with high anger control. Conclusions: Varieties
   of anger moderated educational gradients in inflammation: The inverse
   relationships between education and inflammation markers were strongest
   among individuals with high anger and were attenuated among those with
   high anger control.

AB While it is commonly understood that the substance use of peers
   influences an individual's substance use, much less is understood about
   the interplay between substance use and friendship quality. Using a
   sample of 2,148 emerging adults nested within 1,074 dyadic friendships,
   this study separately investigates how concordance and discordance in
   binge drinking and marijuana use between friends is related to each
   friend's perceptions of friendship quality. Because "friendship quality"
   is a complex construct, we employ a measure containing five sub-elements
   - companionship, a lack of conflict, willingness to help a friend,
   relationship security, and closeness. Results for both binge drinking
   and marijuana use reveal that individuals in friendship pairs who are
   concordant in their substance use perceive significantly higher
   perceptions of friendship quality than individuals in dyads who are
   dissimilar in substance use. Specifically, concordant binge drinkers
   estimate significantly higher levels of companionship, relationship
   security, and willingness to help their friend than concordant
   non-users, discordant users, and discordant non-users. However, the
   highest amount of conflict in friendships is found when both friends
   engage in binge drinking and marijuana use. Several interpretations of
   these findings are discussed. Overall, concordance between friends'
   binge drinking and marijuana use appears to help some elements of
   friendship quality and harm others.

   race/ethnicity among White, Black, Black-American Indian,
   Black-Hispanic, and Black-White individuals and associated
   sociodemograhphic correlates.
   Method: We used a subsample of nationally representative data obtained
   from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
   The analytic sample consisted of 15,278 individuals in Wave 1 (ages 11
   to 21 years). The sample consists of adolescents who were in Grades 7-12
   at wave one and who were followed across four waves of data collection
   into adulthood. Respondents could report more than one race/ethnicity.
   Results: We find distinct alcohol trajectories among monoracial and
   biracial/ethnic Blacks with all groups showing a cross-over or catch-up
   effect. Black-White adults demonstrated a cross-over effect by
   surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of Whites in adulthood,
   Black-American Indians showed a within-group catch-up effect by
   surpassing the alcohol drinking rates of monoracial and biracial/ethnic
   Blacks in adulthood, and monoracial Blacks were most likely to be
   non-drinkers in adulthood. We also show gender, socioeconomic status,
   and household structure differences in impact on alcohol use among
   monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks.
   Conclusions: Significant heterogeneity is observed regarding alcohol
   trajectories between monoracial and biracial/ethnic Blacks.

AB The traditional jurisprudential model of law views the application of
   legal sanctions primarily as a function of the facts of the case and the
   rules that govern the proceedings. Sociology of law scholars have
   challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that
   law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader
   considerations of community social organization and collective
   sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and
   severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social
   capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more
   prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find
   that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which
   the public expresses higher levels of fear. Overall, the findings
   provide provocative evidence that legal outcomes in murder cases are
   influenced by several features of the social environments in which they
   are processed.

AB Although research on social embeddedness and social capital confirms the
   value of friendship networks, little has been written about how social
   relations form and are structured by social institutions. Using data
   from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement study and the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors show that
   the odds of a new friendship nomination were 1.77 times greater within
   clusters of high school students taking courses together than between
   them. The estimated effect cannot be attributed to exposure to peers in
   similar grade levels, indirect friendship links, or pair-level course
   overlap, and the finding is robust to alternative model specifications.
   The authors also show how tendencies associated with status hierarchy
   inhering in triadic friendship nominations are neutralized within the
   clusters. These results have implications for the production and
   distribution of social capital within social systems such as schools,
   giving the clusters social salience as local positions.

AB Female entertainment workers (FEWs) in China are at increased risk of
   HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, but correlates of their
   risky sexual behaviour remain poorly understood. Using data from a
   series of four surveys, this paper employs repeated measures analysis to
   identify individual and social correlates of consistent condom use among
   FEWs in Shanghai. Results reveal that both individual cognitive and
   social influence factors are statistically significant in their
   bivariate relationships to consistent condom use with a stable or
   non-stable partner; only prevention motivation and perceived
   self-efficacy in condom use remain significant in the multiple
   regressions. When individual and social correlates are examined
   together, only peer support for condom use remains a significant and
   independent correlate of consistent condom use in sex with a non-stable
   partner. Behavioural intervention is urgently needed and should take a
   multilevel approach, emphasizing individual prevention motivation and
   behavioural skills training and promoting peer/social support.

AB Men who have sex with transgender women (MSTW) currently constitute a
   gap in the research community's understanding of male sexuality and
   sexual desire. In an effort to address this lack of knowledge, an
   ethnographic study of MSTW in New York City was conducted between
   December 2005 and May 2007, including in-depth interviews with MSTW (n =
   15), key informant interviews (n = 13), and ethnographic observation of
   semi-private "tranny" parties held at various venues throughout New York
   City. The specific objectives were to: (1) describe the sex marketplaces
   and the sexual experiences of an ethnographic sample of MSTW in New York
   City and (2) describe the ways MSTW construct their sexual partnering
   practices and the meanings attributed to those practices in relation to
   varying social contexts (in and outside the sex marketplace). In this
   analysis, we described the MSTW sex market landscape in New York and
   identified three major recurrent themes in the ways that MSTW organized
   their sexual desire for TW transitioning from sex marketplaces to social
   spaces in their lives: (1) phallus-centric trade sex market focus; (2)
   relational-companionship market focus; and (3) specialized market focus.
   Although the findings from the study are not representative of the
   broader MSTW population, they represent an important step in amassing a
   body of knowledge about an understudied and underserved sex market upon
   which future research is needed.

AB African American male youth disproportionately report involvement with
   multiple sexual partners, which increases their risk for sexually
   transmitted infections and initiation of unplanned pregnancies. Little
   is known about the developmental precursors of sexual partner
   trajectories among African American male youth. Moreover, few studies
   focus on the many African American youth who evince highly conventional
   sexual partner trajectories, i.e., youth who have only one partner or
   abstain from sexual activity across time. Using four waves of data from
   a longitudinal study, we hypothesized that an accumulation of social and
   economic disadvantages in early adolescence would negatively influence
   youths' conventional sexual partner trajectories in late adolescence. We
   expected these disadvantages to affect youths' receipt of protective
   family processes and their reports of a set of intrapersonal processes
   (self-regulation, hope, and low levels of anger) linked to generally
   conventional behavior. Hypotheses were tested with data from 315 African
   American male youth from 11 to 18.5 years of age and their primary
   caregivers. Our results supported the hypotheses. Socioeconomic
   disadvantages during preadolescence predicted less involvement in
   conventional sexual partner trajectories from ages 16 to 18.5 years.
   This association was mediated by protective family processes and a set
   of interrelated intrapersonal protective processes. Preventive
   interventions designed to promote protective parenting and intrapersonal
   processes can be expected to promote sexual behavior trajectories
   characterized by abstinence or relations with very few partners.

AB Objective: This systematic review was conducted to synthesize the
   existing evidence regarding key considerations influencing African
   Americans' participation in cancer clinical trials (CCTs).
   Methods: The PubMed and PsycINFO databases were searched to identify
   peer-reviewed publications during the last decade (2002-2011) that met
   our inclusionary criteria. Our search utilized Boolean combinations of
   the following terms: "clinical trial"; "cancer"; "neoplasm"; "African
   American"; "Black"; "caregiver"; "decision making"; "recruitment";
   "companion"; "family"; "significant other"; and "social support".
   Results: A total of 267 articles were identified in the database
   searches. Of these articles, a total of 31 were determined to meet the
   inclusion criteria and were retained for review. Key issues that emerged
   as impediments to a successful recruitment of African Americans to CCTs
   included negative attitudes towards clinical trials, low levels of
   knowledge and awareness regarding CCTs, religious beliefs, and
   structural barriers, such as transportation, childcare, and access to
   health care. Recommendations from physicians, family members, and
   friends may promote CCT participation. Multimedia, and
   culturally-appropriate recruitment approaches may also be effective in
   soliciting participation among African Americans.
   Conclusion: Existing research underscores the importance of social
   support from family and friends, cultural appropriateness and
   sensitivity from physicians and in the design of the CCT, and enhanced
   education among African Americans in decision-making processes. As
   African Americans are underrepresented in CCTs, targeted strategies to
   enhance recruitment efforts and improve cancer treatment outcomes are
   essential. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Mosquito populations are largely regulated by processes occurring at the
   larval stage. We sampled mosquito larval microhabitats (mostly
   water-holding containers) in six neighborhoods in the Washington, DC,
   area that varied in socioeconomic status (SES) and housing structure
   (row houses vs. stand-alone houses) to test associations among these
   neighborhood characteristics, microhabitat abundance and parameters, and
   mosquito occurrence and densities. Thirty-four percent (33.9%) of
   sampled microhabitats contained mosquito larvae, and 93.1% of larvae
   were Aedes albopictus Skuse or Culex pipiens L. Five specific container
   types (drains, corrugated flexible drainpipes, planters, garbage cans,
   and buckets) accounted for the majority of water-holding (56.0%) and
   mosquito-positive (50.6%) microhabitats sampled. We found no
   associations between SES or housing structure with total microhabitat
   abundance per yard, mosquito occurrence or mosquito densities per
   microhabitat. In contrast, container purpose varied with SES, with low
   SES neighborhoods having greater numbers of disused containers and lower
   numbers of functional containers than low and medium SES neighborhoods.
   Ae. albopictus were 83% more abundant in disused containers, whereas Cx.
   pipiens were more abundant in structural and functional containers,
   possibly owing to species-specific oviposition and development related
   to water quality. Ae. albopictus densities increased over the summer,
   whereas Cx. pipiens densities remained constant. Ae. albopictus is
   usually the dominant pest in urban areas in the eastern United States;
   therefore, integrated mosquito management programs should incorporate
   the elimination of disused containers to reduce its infestation and
   adult production, especially in low SES neighborhoods where they occur
   most frequently.

AB Adult children who care for aging parents. incur costs along psychic,
   monetary, emotional, and even physical dimensions. What motivates them?
   Is it altruism, guilt, obligation, or gratitude? Perhaps the
   anticipation of a bequest? Familial norms, or desire for recognition?
   Understanding motivation for care is high on the agenda of both
   economics and sociology. A primary focus of economics is the prospect
   that public transfers may supplant or stimulate private transfers,
   depending on the motivation of the private donor. Motives are usually
   inferred indirectly, on the basis of observed behavior. In contrast,
   sociologists focus on how familial bonds and networks might be forged
   and maintained. We depart from each of these approaches to focus on
   direct questions from a special module in the Health and Retirement
   Study, which contains questions on motivations for, and concerns about,
   the provision of familial assistance. Our (deliberately) simple
   descriptive work reveals abundant new information about motivation for
   familial transfers and care. These not always provided free of pressure
   from relatives, for example, and obligations and traditions appear to
   matter. Findings suggest that the standard economic considerations like
   utility interdependence or exchange provide an incomplete account of
   transfer behavior, and that insights from sociological models are
   essential. We also find that women are far more likely to provide care
   and take seriously family obligations. Past experience in the provision
   of financial help and care matters as well, sometimes in intriguingly
   anomalous ways. Though self-reported motivations must be interpreted
   carefully, we nonetheless conclude that "point-blank" questions provide
   a worthwhile complement to conventional methods for unraveling
   motivations for private, intergenerational transfers.

AB Early age at the natural final menstrual period (FMP) or menopause has
   been associated with numerous health outcomes and might be a marker of
   future ill health. However, potentially modifiable factors affecting age
   at menopause have not been examined longitudinally in large, diverse
   populations. The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)
   followed 3,302 initially premenopausal and early perimenopausal women
   from 7 US sites and 5 racial/ethnic groups, using annual data
   (1996-2007) and Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relation
   of time-invariant and time-varying sociodemographic, lifestyle, and
   health factors to age at natural FMP. Median age at the FMP was 52.54
   years (n = 1,483 observed natural FMPs). Controlling for
   sociodemographic, lifestyle, and health factors, we found that
   racial/ethnic groups did not differ in age at the FMP. Higher
   educational level, prior oral contraceptive use, and higher weight at
   baseline, as well as being employed, not smoking, consuming alcohol,
   having less physical activity, and having better self-rated health over
   follow-up, were significantly associated with later age at the FMP.
   These results suggest that age at the natural FMP reflects a complex
   interrelation of health and socioeconomic factors, which could partially

AB ObjectiveTo determine whether there are racial differences in social
   support among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and whether the
   impact of social support on patient preferences for total knee
   replacement (TKR) varies by race and sex.
   MethodsA total of 514 white and 285 African American patients with knee
   OA were surveyed. Logistic regression models were performed to determine
   if the relationship between willingness to undergo TKR and the
   interaction of patient race and sex was mediated by social support.
   ResultsCompared to whites with knee OA, African American patients were
   less likely to be married (P < 0.001), reported less close
   friends/relatives (P < 0.001), and had lower Medical Outcomes Study
   Social Support Scale (MOS-SSS) scores (P < 0.001). African American
   patients were also less willing to undergo TKR (62% versus 80%; P <
   0.001) than whites. The odds of willingness to undergo TKR were less in
   white females compared to white males when adjusted for recruitment
   site, age, income, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
   Osteoarthritis Index score (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence
   interval [95% CI] 0.34-0.96). This difference was no longer significant
   when further adjusted for marital status, number of close
   friends/relatives, and MOS-SSS score, but the effect size remained
   unchanged (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.35-1.02). The odds of willingness to
   undergo TKR remained much less in African American females (OR 0.35, 95%
   CI 0.19-0.64) and African American males (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.14-0.54)
   compared to white males when controlled for sociodemographic, clinical,
   and social support measures.
   ConclusionAfrican American patients reported less structural and
   functional social support than whites. Social support is an important
   determinant of preference for TKR surgery only among whites.

AB Diabetes has become a global pandemic and Chinese Americans are at least
   60% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than White Americans, despite
   having lower body weight, due to a combination of genetic and
   environmental factors. Because of the increased risk, it is vitally
   important to address the issues of treatment adherence and diabetes
   self-management in the Chinese American population. Many factors affect
   an individual's ability to manage diabetes, including cultural beliefs,
   immigration experience, language abilities/health literacy, educational
   background, employment, and accessibility of healthcare services. In
   treating Chinese American patients, these factors must be considered to
   determine appropriate treatment. Eastern cultural and individual beliefs
   differ greatly from Western beliefs and, therefore, may affect the
   presentation of the patients. If left unacknowledged, these differences
   might be misinterpreted by healthcare providers as merely treatment
   non-adherence or unwillingness to change. Suggestions for providing
   culturally competent healthcare are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background Black individuals eligible for an implantable
   cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) are considerably less likely than white
   individuals to receive one. This disparity may, in part, be explained by
   racial differences in patient preferences. We hypothesized that a
   targeted patient-centered educational video could improve knowledge of
   sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and ICDs and reduce racial differences in
   ICD preferences. We conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of
   testing this hypothesis in a randomized trial.
   Methods We created a video that included animation, physician
   commentary, and patient testimonials on SCA and ICDs. The primary
   outcome was the decision to have an ICD implanted as a function of race
   and intervention. Between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011, 59
   patients (37 white and 22 black) were randomized to the video or health
   care provider counseling/usual care.
   Results Relative to white patients, black patients were younger (median
   age, 55 vs 68 years) and more likely to have attended college or
   technical school. Baseline SCA and ICD knowledge was similar and
   improved significantly in both racial groups after the intervention.
   Black patients viewing the video were as likely as white patients to
   want an ICD (60.0% vs 79.2%, P = .20); and among those in the usual care
   arm, black patients were less likely than white patients to want an ICD
   (42.9% vs 84.6% P = .05).
   Conclusion Among individuals eligible for an ICD, a video decision aid
   increased patient knowledge and reduced racial differences in patient
   preference for an ICD.

AB Background: College students identifying as Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual
   (LGB) are at increased risk for substance use. Few studies have assessed
   correlates of concurrent substance use, which increases the risk for
   substance use disorders. Objectives: The current study aimed to (1)
   examine differences in substance use among male and female sexual
   minorities and (2) explore the impact of psychosocial factors on the
   relationship between sexual identity and concurrent substance use.
   Methods: A web-based survey assessing health behavior, psychosocial
   characteristics, attitudes and demographics was administered to students
   from six colleges in the southeastern US. A total of 4840 students
   responded to the survey; 2.9% reported a homosexual identity (n = 111)
   and 3.5% reported a bisexual identity (n = 135). Multivariable modeling
   was used to assess the relationship between sexual identity and the
   number of substances used, adjusting for demographic and psychosocial
   factors. Results: Bisexual females were significantly more likely than
   their homosexual or heterosexual counterparts to report tobacco use
   (p<0.0001), binge drinking (p<0.05) and marijuana use (p<0.0001) in the
   past 30 days. No differences in substances used existed among males.
   Adjusted for age and ethnicity, homosexually-and bisexually-identified
   females were more likely to have concurrent substance use than those who
   identified as heterosexual (p<0.0001 and p<0.0001, respectively).
   Adjusting for psychosocial factors decreased the magnitude and
   significance of the association (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively).
   Conclusion: Female sexual minorities are at high risk for substance use.
   Targeting specific psychosocial factors might be useful in efforts to
   address use of tobacco, alcohol and marijuana among LGB young adults.

   coronary heart disease, including education, physical activity,
   fruit/vegetable intake, and smoking, cluster (i.e., co-occur more than
   expected as the result of chance) in U.S. adults.
   Methods: The study included 4305 male and 4673 female subjects aged >=
   20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Risk
   factors included: <= high school diploma/general educational development
   certificate; <150 minutes of moderate/vigorous physical activity per
   week; <3 or <2 servings of vegetables and fruit, respectively, per day;
   and smoking cigarettes. Indicator variables were summed into a
   sociobehavioral risk index (SRI, range 0 [no risk factors] to 4 [all
   risk factors]). Ratios of observed-to-expected prevalence (under the
   assumption of independence) of the SRI were assessed. Statistical
   significance was evaluated by the use of randomly permuted average
   observed-to-expected SRI ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
   Results: In male subjects, the ratio of observed-to-expected prevalence
   of SRI = 0 was 1.70 (permuted ratio = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.92-1.08), and SRI
   = 4 was 2.10 (permuted ratio = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.86-1.14), demonstrating
   significant clustering. In females, the ratio of observed-to-expected
   prevalence of SRI = 0 was 1.67 (permuted ratio = 1.00, 95% CI:
   0.92-1.08), and SRI = 4 was 1.86 (permuted ratio = 1.00, 95% CI:
   0.85-1.15).

AB Purpose: This study examined how race ethnicity, nativity, and education
   interact to influence disparities in cardiovascular (CV) health, a new
   concept defined by the American Heart Association. We assessed whether
   race ethnicity and nativity disparities in CV health vary by education
   and whether the foreign-born differ in CV health from their U.S.-born
   race ethnic counterparts with comparable education.
   Methods: We used data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey
   to determine the prevalence of optimal CV health metrics (based on
   selected American Heart Association guidelines) among adults ages 25 and
   older (n = 42,014). We examined the interaction between education and
   ethnicity nativity, comparing predicted probabilities of each CV health
   measure between U.S.-born and foreign-born White, Asian, and Latino
   respondents.
   Results: All groups were at high risk of suboptimal physical activity
   levels, fruit and vegetable and fast food consumption, and
   overweight/obesity. Those with greater education were generally better
   off except among Asian respondents. Ethnicity nativity differences were
   more pronounced among those with less than a college degree. The
   foreign-born respondents exhibited both advantages and disadvantages in
   CV health compared with their U.S.-born counterparts that varied by
   ethnicity nativity.
   Conclusions: Education influences ethnicity nativity disparities in CV
   health, with most race ethnic and nativity differences occurring among
   the less educated. Studies of nativity differences in CV health should
   stratify by education in order to adequately address SES differences.

AB Purpose: This study examined progression and improvement of physical
   functioning limitations during the mid-life and whether race-ethnicity,
   economic strain, or body mass index were associated with these changes.
   Methods: Women from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation with
   one or more measure of self-reported physical functioning, categorized
   as no, some, or substantial limitations, between study visits 4 and 12
   were included (n = 2497).
   Results: When women were aged 56-66 years, almost 50% reported
   limitations in functioning. African American women were more likely to
   report substantial (odds ratio, 1.63; 95% confidence interval,
   1.06-2.52) and Chinese women were more likely to report some limitations
   (odds ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.22-3.36) compared with Caucasian women.
   Economic strain and obesity predicted limitations. The probability of
   worsening ranged from 6% to 22% and of improving ranged from 11% to 30%.
   Caucasian and Japanese women had the highest probability of remaining
   fully functional (80% and 84%, respectively) compared with 71% of
   African American women.
   Conclusions: Race-ethnicity, obesity, and economic strain were
   associated with prevalence and onset of physical functioning
   limitations. Functional improvement is common, even among vulnerable
   subgroups of women. Future studies should characterize predictors of
   decline and improvement so that interventions can sustain functioning
   even in the context of many known immutable risk factors. (c) 2013

AB Background: Due to population aging and generational changes in alcohol
   and drug use, substance use disorders and treatment need are projected
   to increase among adults over 50. We analyzed data from two national
   surveys conducted 10 years apart [(NLAES (1991-1992) and NESARC
   (2001-2002)] to explore changes in help-seeking for alcohol and drug
   problems among adults over age 50.
   Methods: Data were pooled on help seeking for substance related
   problems, sociodemographic and clinical variables, and services type
   (i.e., formal and informal). Differences between the surveys were
   assessed, and help seeking among those under age 50 was compared to
   younger individuals; changes in the sociodemographic and clinical
   correlates of help seeking among those over age 50 were examined.
   Results: Among those 50 and older, rates of lifetime help seeking for
   any substance problem were higher in NESARC than NLAES, and percentages
   of those considering but not getting help were also higher in NESARC.
   Among those 50+, rates of past-year help seeking for drug use were
   higher in NESARC, but among those with lifetime substance use disorders,
   help seeking rates for alcohol and any substance were lower in the
   NESARC. Older help seekers in the NESARC were less likely to be White,
   more likely to be low income, and more likely to be current or former
   drug users than NLAES help seekers.
   Conclusions: This study documents increased rates of help seeking for
   substance related problems among those 50 and older and identifies
   cohort differences in profile of past-year help seekers. (C) 2012

AB Background: The current study examined the effects of online social
   evaluations and comparisons on body dissatisfaction and bulimic
   symptoms.
   Methods: We tested the effects of maladaptive Facebook usage (defined as
   the tendency to seek negative social evaluations and/or engage in social
   comparisons via Facebook) on body dissatisfaction and bulimic symptoms
   in a sample of 232 college females followed for approximately 4 weeks.
   Results: Results provided evidence that maladaptive Facebook usage
   significantly predicted increases in bulimic symptoms and episodes of
   over-eating approximately four weeks later. Body dissatisfaction was
   found to fully mediate the relationship between maladaptive Facebook
   usage and increases in over-eating episodes, whereas body
   dissatisfaction partially mediated the relationship between maladaptive
   Facebook usage and increases in bulimic symptoms more broadly.
   Limitations: Limitations include the use of a novel measure of
   maladaptive Facebook usage due to the absence of an existing measure and
   a non-clinical sample.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that reducing maladaptive
   Facebook usage may be a fruitful target for interventions aimed at
   reducing body dissatisfaction and symptoms of eating pathology. (C) 2013

AB Over the last several years, network methods and models from the social
   and physical sciences have gained considerable popularity in
   archaeology. Many of the most common network methods begin with the
   creation of binary networks where links among some set of actors are
   defined as either present or absent. In most archaeological cases,
   however, the presence or absence of a specific kind of relationship
   between actors is not straightforward as we must rely on material
   proxies for assessing connections. A common approach in recent studies
   has been to define some threshold for the presence of a tie by
   partitioning continuous relational data among sites (e.g., artifact
   frequency or similarity data). In this article, using an example from
   the U.S. Southwest, we present a sensitivity analysis focused on the
   potential effects of defining binary networks from continuous relational
   data. We show that many key network properties that are often afforded
   social interpretations are fundamentally influenced by the assumptions
   used to define connections. We suggest that, although network graphs
   provide powerful visualizations of network data, methods for creating
   and analyzing weighted (non-binarized) networks often provide a better
   characterization of specific network properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Observing social interactions between children and adults is a major
   method in the toolkit of psychologists who examine social development
   and social relationships. Although this method has revealed many
   interesting phenomena, it cannot determine the effect of behavior
   independent of other traits. Research on the role of attractiveness in
   social development provides an example of this conundrum: Are attractive
   and unattractive children/adults treated differently because of their
   attractiveness (independent of their behavior), do they behave
   differently and thus elicit differential treatment, or both? Virtual
   world and avatar-based technologies allow researchers to control the
   social behaviors of targets; however, whether children and adults use
   the facial attractiveness of avatars as a social cue in the same way as
   they do with real peers is currently unknown. Using Mii avatars from the
   popular Nintendo Wii video game console, Study 1 found that the facial
   attractiveness ratings of real people strongly predicted the
   attractiveness ratings of avatar faces based on the former group. Study
   2 revealed that adults (n = 46) and children (n = 42) prefer attractive
   avatars as social partners. The results of this set of methodological
   studies may help to clarify future research on the relationship between
   attractiveness and behavior throughout the lifespan. Furthermore, the
   use of avatars may allow studies to experimentally examine the effects
   of attractiveness in situations where such research is not ethical
   (e.g., peer victimization). (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND: In May 2005, the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) became the
   primary method for determining allocation of lungs for organ
   transplantation for those at least 12 years of age in the United States.
   During the pre-LAS period, black patients were more likely than white
   patients to become too sick or die while awaiting transplant. The
   association between gender and lung transplant outcomes has not been
   widely studied.
   METHODS: Black and white patients aged >= 18 years registered on the
   United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) lung transplantation waiting
   list from January 1, 2000, to May 3, 2005 (pre-LAS, n = 8,765), and from
   May 4, 2005, to September 4, 2010 (LAS, n = 8,806), were included.
   Logistic regression analyses were based on smaller cohorts derived from
   patients listed in the first 2 years of each era (2,350 pre-LAS, and
   2,446 LAS) to allow for follow-up time. Lung transplantation was the
   primary outcome measure. Multivariable analyses were performed within
   each interval to determine the odds that a patient would die or receive
   a lung transplant within 3 years of listing.
   RESULTS: In the pre-LAS era, black patients were more likely than white
   patients to become too sick for transplantation or die within 3 years of
   waiting list registration (43.8% vs 30.8%; odds ratio [OR], 1.84; p <
   0.001). Race was not associated with death or becoming too sick while
   listed for transplantation in the LAS era (14.0% vs 13.3%; OR, 0.93; p =
   0.74). Black patients were less likely to undergo transplantation in the
   pre-LAS era (56.3% vs 69.2%; OR, 0.54; p < 0.001) but not in the LAS era
   (86.0% vs 86.7%; OR, 1.07; p = 0.74). Women were more likely than men to
   die or become too sick for transplantation within 3 years of listing in
   the LAS era (16.1% vs 11.3%; OR, 1.58; p < 0.001) compared with the
   pre-LAS era (33.4% vs 30.7%; OR, 1.19; p = 0.08).
   CONCLUSION: Racial disparities in lung transplantation have decreased
   with the implementation of LAS as the method of organ allocation;
   however, gender disparities may have actually increased in the LAS era.

AB Objective: Despite the low overall prevalence of alcohol use among Asian
   Americans, rates of alcohol use disorder are high among Asian American
   young adults. The influence of ethnic drinking cultures on immigrants
   and their descendants has been overlooked in past research. We took an
   integrative approach to examine the influence of ethnic drinking
   culture, acculturation, and socioeconomic disparities on problem
   drinking among Asian American young adults. Method: This study was a
   nationally representative sample of 854 Asian American young adults
   extracted from the Wave 4 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health data. About 48% of the sample was female and 52% male. Several
   multiple logistic regression models were fitted. Results: Controlling
   for other covariates, two dimensions of ethnic drinking culture were
   associated with alcohol outcomes only for the foreign born: (a)
   detrimental drinking pattern with frequent drunkenness and alcohol-abuse
   symptoms and (b) drinking prevalence with alcohol-dependence symptoms.
   Financial hardship was a significant predictor of symptoms of alcohol
   abuse and dependence only for the U.S. born. Asian language use was
   protective against alcohol-abuse symptoms and alcohol-dependence
   symptoms for the foreign born. Conclusions: Cultural and socioeconomic
   factors of problem drinking may be different for U.S.-and foreign-born
   Asian American young adults. Ethnic drinking cultures may significantly
   influence problem drinking of foreign-born Asian American young adults,
   independent of their acculturation into U.S. cultures. To inform
   effective interventions targeted at immigrants and their descendants,
   future research might further investigate the cultural and socioeconomic
   processes in immigrant communities that might significantly influence
   drinking.

AB Scholars argue that the state has facilitated the expansion of the
   financial sector, but focus largely on how politics transforms financial
   markets. I explore a new political mechanism of financialization, by
   drawing upon an ethnographic study of economic development in two Rust
   Belt cities and analyzing usage of tax increment financing (TIF), a
   practice that allows cities to securitize projected increases in
   property tax receipts and create bonds similar to structured
   asset-backed securities (e.g. mortgage-backed securities). Cities
   initially used TIF as a last-resort financing strategy, but the practice
   has transformed urban politics by creating opportunities for economic
   development professionals to exercise jurisdiction over municipal
   budgets. Further, TIF structures other roles that development
   professionals play by giving them incentives to use TIF in ways that are
   not aligned with the citys fiscal outlook and lock them into ever-higher
   rates of TIF spending. This analysis illustrates a recursive
   relationship between financialization and the state: public policies
   have transformed financial markets, but reliance on financial markets
   can also transform political institutions in ways that promote further
   financialization.

AB Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of democratic politics that is at
   least as indebted to civic republicanism as to Marxism. He was familiar
   with the civic republican tradition, and it increasingly influenced both
   his political interventions and sociological work, especially late in
   his career. Bourdieu drew above all on Niccol Machiavelli's version of
   republicanism, though the French republican tradition also influenced
   him via Durkheimian social theory. Three elements of Bourdieu's work in
   particular-his concept of field autonomy, his view of interests and
   universalism, and his understanding of how solidarity is generated and
   sustained-may be understood, at least in part, as sociological
   reformulations of republican ideas. By drawing attention to these
   republican influences, the article aims to show that the conceptual
   resources which some critics, including Jeffrey C. Alexander, consider
   indispensable to an adequate theory of democracy are not entirely absent
   in Bourdieu's work. On the basis of this reassessment, the article
   concludes that Bourdieu and Alexander are not as opposed in their
   thinking about democratic politics as it might first appear.

AB Recent years have witnessed substantially increased research regarding
   sex differences in pain. The expansive body of literature in this area
   clearly suggests that men and women differ in their responses to pain,
   with increased pain sensitivity and risk for clinical pain commonly
   being observed among women. Also, differences in responsivity to
   pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions have been
   observed; however, these effects are not always consistent and appear
   dependent on treatment type and characteristics of both the pain and the
   provider. Although the specific aetiological basis underlying these sex
   differences is unknown, it seems inevitable that multiple biological and
   psychosocial processes are contributing factors. For instance, emerging
   evidence suggests that genotype and endogenous opioid functioning play a
   causal role in these disparities, and considerable literature implicates
   sex hormones as factors influencing pain sensitivity. However, the
   specific modulatory effect of sex hormones on pain among men and women
   requires further exploration. Psychosocial processes such as pain coping
   and early-life exposure to stress may also explain sex differences in
   pain, in addition to stereotypical gender roles that may contribute to
   differences in pain expression. Therefore, this review will provide a
   brief overview of the extant literature examining sex-related
   differences in clinical and experimental pain, and highlights several
   biopsychosocial mechanisms implicated in these malefemale differences.
   The future directions of this field of research are discussed with an
   emphasis aimed towards further elucidation of mechanisms which may
   inform future efforts to develop sex-specific treatments.

AB Background:
   Using Pennsylvania Medicare claims from 1995 to 1996, the authors
   previously reported that anesthesia procedure length appears longer in
   blacks than whites. In a new study using a different and larger data
   set, the authors now examine whether body mass index (BMI), not
   available in Medicare claims, explains this difference. The authors also
   examine the relative contributions of surgical and anesthesia times.
   Methods:
   The Obesity and Surgical Outcomes Study of 47 hospitals throughout
   Illinois, New York, and Texas abstracted chart information including BMI
   on elder Medicare patients (779 blacks and 14,596 whites) undergoing hip
   and knee replacement and repair, colectomy, and thoracotomy between 2002
   and 2006. The authors matched all black Medicare patients to comparable
   whites and compared procedure lengths.
   Results:
   Mean BMI in the black and white populations was 30.24 and 28.96 kg/m(2),
   respectively (P < 0.0001). After matching on age, sex, procedure,
   comorbidities, hospital, and BMI, mean white BMI in the comparison group
   was 30.1 kg/m(2) (P = 0.94). The typical matched pair difference
   (black-white) in anesthesia (induction to recovery room) procedure time
   was 7.0 min (P = 0.0019), of which 6 min reflected the surgical
   (cut-to-close) time difference (P = 0.0032). Within matched pairs, where
   the difference in procedure times was greater than 30 min between
   patients, blacks more commonly had longer procedure times (Odds = 1.39;
   P = 0.0008).
   Conclusions:
   Controlling for patient characteristics, BMI, and hospital, elder black
   Medicare patients experienced slightly but significantly longer
   procedure length than their closely matched white controls. Procedure
   length difference was almost completely due to surgery, not anesthesia.

AB Peer relationships in secondary schools in two different cultural areas
   of India are compared. A general theory of status relations and a
   specification of the distinctive cultural features of each area are used
   to explain the observed differences in peer inequality, clique
   formation, petty deviance, putdowns, fashion consciousness, romantic
   relationships, and gossip. A surprising finding is that the degree of
   status inequality among school peers is inversely related to an
   ideological emphasis on equality and hierarchy: The more egalitarian the
   cultural ideology, the greater the inequality in peer relationships, and
   conversely, the more emphasis on hierarchy, the less the actual peer
   inequality. The apparent paradox is resolved by specifying the
   structural mechanisms through which cultural and ideological differences
   operate. Brief comparisons with the United States suggest that these
   findings are not unique to India.

   (1980-2010) through comprehensive keyword search and filtered by manual
   semantic coding. Exploratory network and content analysis is conducted
   (1) to discover the development of major research themes and the
   relations between them over time; (2) to locate representative core
   publications (the stars) that are highly co-cited with others and those
   (the bridges) connecting more between rather than within subfields or
   disciplines. Structural analysis of the co-citation networks identifies
   a core cluster that contains foundational knowledge of this domain. It
   is well connected to almost all the other clusters and covers a wide
   range of subject categories. The evolutionary path of research themes
   shows trends moving towards (e.g. psychology and business and economics)
   and away from (e.g. language education and communication) the core
   cluster over time. Based on the results, a structural framework of the
   knowledge domain of intercultural relations research is proposed to
   represent thematic relatedness between topical groups and their
   relations.

AB We have recently seen the proliferation of a variety of progressive,
   democratic social movements across the globe. In the wake of various
   contradictions and implosions of capitalism, from the meltdown of the US
   banks to the euro crisis, vast numbers of people have challenged
   neoliberal globalization. In this article the authors offer a
   theoretical frame for the analysis of the most recent challenges posed
   to neoliberal social and economic policies as they were shaped in late
   capitalism. The authors first note Habermas's thesis that legitimation
   crises take place at both the macro and micro levels, and that they
   foster various understandings as well as emotional reactions. The
   authors focus on the emotional aspects that are vital to social
   mobilizations. To do this they draw on theoretical frames from social
   movement and the sociology of emotion perspectives. More particularly
   they see the process of emotional liberation' coined by Flam, as the
   equivalent of McAdam's cognitive liberation' and both as part of the
   process of subjectivation as put forward by Touraine. These formulations
   lead to considerations of the emotions that tie people to authorities
   and/or withdraw legitimacy from authorities, in order to understand
   which emotions need be mobilized in order to liberate people from their
   loyalty to authorities. The authors found a constellation of incongruent
   emotions such as distrust and disrespect for authorities/elites or their
   perceived agents, indignation and righteous anger, humiliation, and in
   turn hope for an alternative future. The value of the authors' proposed
   structure of argument lies in the powerful combination of macro and
   micro processes and the combination of cognition and emotions.

   Resumen
   Recientemente hemos visto la proliferacion de una variedad de
   movimientos sociales progresistas y democraticos a lo largo del planeta.
   En la ola de diversas contradicciones e implosiones del capitalismo,
   desde la fusion de los bancos americanos a la crisis del euro, un gran
   numero de personas ha desafiado la globalizacion liberal. En este
   articulo ofrecemos un marco teorico para el analisis de los desafios mas
   recientes planteados a las politicas social y economica del
   neoliberalismo como han sido formuladas en el capitalismo tardio.
   Senalamos primero la tesis de Habermas de que la crisis de legitimacion
   tiene lugar a nivel macro y micro que favorece diversas interpretaciones
   y reacciones emocionales. Nos centramos en el aspecto emocional que es
   vital para las movilizaciones sociales. Para ello nos basamos en los
   marcos teoricos de los movimientos sociales y la sociologia de las
   emociones. En particular, vemos el proceso de liberacion emocional',
   acunado por Flam, como el equivalente al de liberacion cognitiva' de
   McAdam, y ambos como parte del proceso de subjetivacion propuesto por
   Touraine. Estas formulaciones nos han conducido a tener en cuenta las
   emociones que vinculan a las personas con las autoridades y/o retiran la
   legitimidad a las autoridades de cara a entender que emociones necesitan
   ser movilizadas para liberar a las personas de su lealtad a las
   autoridades. Hemos encontrado una constelacion no congruente de
   emociones como desconfianza y falta de respeto a las autoridades o
   elites o sus agentes, indignacion y colera, humillacion y, al reves,
   esperanza en un futuro alternativo. El valor de la estructura
   argumentativa propuesta descansa en la fuerte combinacion entre procesos
   macro y micro, y la combinacion entre cognicion y emociones.

AB Introductory sociology casts a wide net with regard to its audience and
   plays an important role in capturing the public eye as well as helping
   students to make more informed choices in their lives and communities. I
   ask six questions that help us as sociologists to think about how
   introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students,
   and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our
   students are, how the course fits with university mission and program
   goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can
   build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is
   alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in
   sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and
   curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in
   recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the
   major. Posing such questions will promote further discussion and
   consensus building among sociology colleagues with the aim of improving
   curriculum and student learning.

   surprising how rarely focus group interviewing is taught in the

   instructors who wish to train students to use this technique. This
   article fills the gap in the teaching and learning literature in
   sociology by addressing focus group research. I describe how to
   integrate a complete research project with student-led focus groups into
   a single semester course. I outline the various stages involved in the
   research process and then consider how this approach enhances three
   specific areas: learning, teaching, and scholarship. The effectiveness
   of the focus group project was assessed through a one-group
   pretest-posttest survey of the student-researchers' experiences. I
   conclude with a reflection on the practical limitations as well as the
   considerable advantages of training students to conduct focus group
   research.

   little empirical evidence to verify that it is being taught in courses.
   Using four sections of introductory sociology, we developed an
   experimental design using pretests and posttests to assess students'
   critical thinking skills. Controlling for grade point average,
   cumulative credit hours completed, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
   status, instructor, and initial levels of critical thinking, being in
   the experimental group had a statistically significant impact on
   critical thinking at the end of the semester. Thus, inclusion of writing
   assignments and classroom discussion designed to enhance creative

   from one-dimensional thinking toward more multistructural analysis.

   feminist ones (liberal, socialist, Marxist, radical, separatist,
   cultural, multicultural/black, and postmodern feminism). In this
   article, I discuss the inventory, how I use it in my sociology of gender
   class, and how it could be adapted for use in other classes. I also
   analyze qualitative and quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness
   based on responses from students at two universities (N = 603) and
   pretest and posttest results of its impact on student learning
   immediately following the activity (N = 161) and at the end of the
   semester (N = 33). These data suggest that the GABI increases students'
   understanding of theoretical perspectives on gender, encourages them to
   reflect on their own views and (mis)perceptions of theories, and is an
   engaging exercise for students. Most importantly, this is a valuable
   exercise to aid students in realizing how sociological theory links to
   their everyday lives.

AB Increasingly, colleges and universities are relying on fully online
   classes to teach students. This article investigates how students
   evaluate online courses in comparison to more traditional face-to-face
   courses. Data come from undergraduate student evaluations of 118
   sociology courses, and results of a series of hierarchical linear models
   indicate that students feel they have learned less in online courses,
   believe they are treated with more respect in in-class courses, and rate
   online courses less highly than in-class courses. Findings also suggest
   that the negative effects of teaching online are not universal for
   instructors, as the switch to online classes actually results in better
   evaluations for teachers who typically perform poorly in the classroom.
   These findings caution against the broad use of online sociology classes
   as a strategy for coping with increasing enrollments and shrinking
   budgets and suggest educators should select the course format that best
   complements their teaching strengths and skills.

   practice the skills of synthesis and analysis by developing portfolios
   organized around a topic of their own choosing (relevant to their
   substantive course). We build on prior contributions in four ways.
   First, we offer a project that is indicative of basic skills in the
   sociological toolkit and therefore of potential relevance to students'
   lives and future careers. Second, we provide the first systematic
   assessment of the efficacy of course portfolios by using a controlled,
   pretest-posttest analysis conducted in seven sections of three separate
   sociology courses. Third, we illustrate the conceptual connections
   between active learning pedagogy and identity theory and provide
   evidence that portfolios influence the development of a sociological
   identity and thought among students. Fourth, we offer instructors an
   instructional tool that can be employed in any undergraduate sociology
   course.

AB Objective We examined positive and negative religious coping as
   moderators of the relation between physical limitations, depression, and
   desire for hastened death among male inmates incarcerated primarily for
   murder. Methods Inmates over the age of 45years who passed a cognitive
   screening completed face-to-face interviews (N=94; mean age=57.7years;
   SD=10.68). Multiple regression analyses included age, race/ethnicity,
   parole belief, physical health, positive or negative religious coping,
   and all two-way interactions represented by the product of health and a
   religious coping variable. Results Older inmates and those who reported
   greater levels of positive religious coping endorsed fewer symptoms of
   depression, whereas those who reported greater levels of negative
   religious coping endorsed more symptoms of depression. Inmates who
   reported higher levels of depression endorsed a greater desire for
   hastened death. The effect of physical functioning on desire for
   hastened death is moderated by negative religious coping such that those
   who endorsed higher levels of negative religious coping reported a
   greater desire for hastened death. Conclusions Examinations of
   religious/spiritual practices and mindfulness-based interventions in
   prison research have assumed a positive stance with regard to the
   potential impact of religious/spiritual coping on physical and mental
   health. The current findings provide cautionary information that may
   further assist in selection of inmates for participation in such
   interventions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: One goal in identifying psychosocial risk factors is to
   discover opportunities for intervention. The purpose of this review is
   to examine psychosocial risk factors for disordered eating, placing
   research findings in the larger context of how etiological models for
   eating disorders can be transformed into models for intervention.
   Method: A qualitative literature review was conducted focusing on
   psychological and social factors that increase the risk for developing
   eating disorders, with an emphasis on well-replicated findings from
   prospective longitudinal studies. Results: Epidemiological,
   cross-cultural, and longitudinal studies underscore the importance of
   the idealization of thinness and resulting weight concerns as
   psychosocial risk factors for eating disorders. Personality factors such
   as negative emotionality and perfectionism contribute to the development
   of eating disorders but may do so indirectly by increasing
   susceptibility to internalize the thin ideal or by influencing selection
   of peer environment. During adolescence, peers represent self-selected
   environments that influence risk. Discussion: Peer context may represent
   a key opportunity for intervention, as peer groups represent the nexus
   in which individual differences in psychological risk factors shape the
   social environment and social environment shapes psychological risk
   factors. Thus, peer-based interventions that challenge internalization
   of the thin ideal can protect against the development of eating
   pathology. (c) 2013 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2013;

AB Background. An analysis of income and racial/ethnic disparities on renal
   transplant outcomes in recipients with lupus nephritis (LN) has not been
   reported. We analyzed the United States Renal Data System database to
   assess the impact of these disparities on graft loss and death in the LN
   and non-LN cohorts.
   Methods. We identified 4214 patients with LN as the cause of end-stage
   renal disease in a retrospective cohort of 150,118 patients first
   transplanted from January 1, 1995 to July 1, 2006. We merged data on
   median household income from the United States Census based on the ZIP
   code.
   Results. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, African-Americans (AF)
   recipients with LN (vs. non-AF) had an increased risk of graft loss
   (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.21-1.60) and death (AHR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.09-1.63). Furthermore, there
   were significant associations of lower-income quintiles with higher risk
   for graft loss and death among AF with LN. In comparison, among non-AF
   recipients with LN, income levels did not predict risk for transplant
   outcomes. The racial disparity for both graft loss and death outcomes
   among AF with LN was greater than among AF without LN (AHR, 1.32; 95%
   CI, 1.29-1.36 for graft loss and AHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.99-1.05 for
   death).
   Conclusions. AF kidney transplant recipients with LN were at increased
   risk for graft loss and death compared with non-AF. Income levels were
   associated with the risk of graft loss and death in AF but not in non-AF
   recipients with LN.

   from surveys of a representative sample of parents and guardians of
   girls eligible for HPV vaccine, measuring three-dose coverage achieved
   in demonstration projects in 2008-2010. Univariate and multivariate
   logistic regression analysis calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odds
   of receiving at least one dose of HPV vaccine depending on exposure to
   community influencers; information, education, and communication (IEC)
   channels; and demographic factors. This study found that exposure to
   community influencers was associated with HPV vaccine uptake in a
   multivariate model controlling for other factors. Exposure to
   non-interactive IEC channels was only marginally associated with HPV
   vaccine uptake. These results underscore the need of HPV vaccine
   programs in low- and middle-income countries to involve and utilize key
   community influencers and stakeholders to maximize HPV vaccine uptake.

AB The Tea Party movement, which rose to prominence in the United States
   after the election of President Barack Obama, provides an ideal context
   in which to examine the roles of racial concerns and ideology in
   politics. A three-wave longitudinal study tracked changes in White
   Americans' self-identification with the Tea Party, racial concerns
   (prejudice and racial identification), and ideologies (libertarianism
   and social conservatism) over nine months. Latent Growth Modeling (LGM)
   was used to evaluate potential causal relationships between Tea Party
   identification and these factors. Across time points, racial prejudice
   was indirectly associated with movement identification through Whites'
   assertions of national decline. Although initial levels of White
   identity did not predict change in Tea Party identification, initial
   levels of Tea Party identification predicted increases in White identity
   over the study period. Across the three assessments, support for the Tea
   Party fell among libertarians, but rose among social conservatives.
   Results are discussed in terms of legitimation theories of prejudice,
   the "racializing" power of political judgments, and the ideological
   dynamics of the Tea Party.

AB Prosocial reputations play an important role, from the evolution of
   language to Internet transactions; however, questions remain about their
   behavioural correlates and dynamics. Formal models assume prosocial
   reputations correlate with the number of cooperative acts one performs;
   however, if reputations flow through information networks, then the
   number of individuals one assists may be a better proxy. Formal models
   demonstrate indirect experience must track behaviour with the same
   fidelity as direct experience for reputations to become viable; however,
   research on corporate reputations suggests performance change does not
   always affect reputation change. Debate exists over the cognitive
   mechanisms employed for assessing reputation dynamics. Image scoring
   suggests reputations fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails
   to assist others in need, while standing strategy claims reputations
   fluctuate relative to the number of times one fails to assist others in
   good standing. This study examines the behavioural correlates of
   prosocial reputations and their dynamics over a 20-month period in an
   Afro-Caribbean village. Analyses suggest prosocial reputations: (i) are
   correlated with the number of individuals one assists in economic
   production, not the number of cooperative acts; (ii) track cooperative
   behaviour, but are anchored across time; and (iii) are captured neither
   by image scoring nor standing strategy-type mechanisms.

AB The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), which was introduced in 2008
   in India, is a social health insurance scheme that aims to improve
   healthcare access and provide financial risk protection to the poor. In
   this study, we analyse the determinants of participation and enrolment
   in the scheme at the level of districts. We used official data on RSBY
   enrolment, socioeconomic data from the District Level Household Survey
   2007-2008, and additional state-level information on fiscal health,
   political affiliation, and quality of governance. Results from
   multivariate probit and OLS analyses suggest that political and
   institutional factors are among the strongest determinants explaining
   the variation in participation and enrolment in RSBY. In particular,
   districts in state governments that are politically affiliated with the
   opposition or neutral parties at the centre are more likely to
   participate in RSBY, and have higher levels of enrolment. Districts in
   states with a lower quality of governance, a pre-existing state-level
   health insurance scheme, or with a lower level of fiscal deficit as
   compared to GDP, are significantly less likely to participate, or have
   lower enrolment rates. Among socioeconomic factors, we find some
   evidence of weak or imprecise targeting. Districts with a higher share
   of socioeconomically backward castes are less likely to participate, and
   their enrolment rates are also lower. Finally, districts with more
   non-poor households may be more likely to participate, although with
   lower enrolment rates.

   implications on the likelihood of HIV testing. These effects are tested
   using the 2004 and 2009 Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in
   Lesotho, where HIV/AIDS is a pervasive problem. We find that HIV/AIDS
   stigmatizing attitudes are negatively associated with education and
   wealth and positively correlated with Catholic religion for women and
   traditional circumcision for men. The analysis also shows a negative

AB The Community-Based Care for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CBCO)
   program operated in Kenya during 2006-2010. In Eastern Province, the
   program provided support to approximately 3000 orphans and vulnerable
   children (OVC) living in 1500 households. A primary focus of the program
   was to support savings and loan associations composed of OVC caregivers
   (typically elderly women) to improve household and OVC welfare.
   Cross-sectional data were collected in 2011 from 1500 randomly selected
   households from 3 populations: program participants (CBCO group, n=500),
   households in the same villages as program participants but not in the
   program (the local-community-group = Group L, n=300), and households
   living in nearby villages where the program did not operate (the
   adjacent-community-group, Group A, n=700). Primary welfare outcomes
   evaluated are household food security, as measured by the Household Food
   Insecurity Access instrument, and OVC educational attainment. We
   compared outcomes between the CBCO and the subset of Group L not meeting
   program eligibility criteria (L-N) to investigate disparities within
   local communities. We compared outcomes between the CBCO group and the
   subset of Group A meeting eligibility criteria (A-E) to consider program
   impact. We compared outcomes between households not eligible for the
   program in the local and adjacent community groups (L-N and A-N) to
   consider if the adjacent communities are similar to the local
   communities. In May-June 2011, at the end of the OVC program, the
   majority of CBCO households continued to be severely food insecure, with
   rates similar to other households living in nearby communities.
   Participation rates in primary school are high, reflecting free primary
   education. Among the 18-22 year olds who were children during the
   program years, relatively few children completed secondary school across
   all study groups. Although the CBCO program likely provided useful
   services and benefits to program participants, disparities continued to
   exist in food security and educational outcomes between program
   participants and their non-OVC peers in the local community. Outcomes
   for CBCO households were similar to those observed for OVC households in
   adjacent communities.

AB Rapid population growth in developing cities often outpaces improvements
   to drinking water supplies, and sub-Saharan Africa as a region has the
   highest percentage of urban population without piped water access, a
   figure that continues to grow. Accra, Ghana, implements a rationing
   system to distribute limited piped water resources within the city, and
   privately-vended sachet water-sealed single-use plastic sleeves-has
   filled an important gap in urban drinking water security. This study
   utilizes household survey data from 2,814 Ghanaian women to analyze the
   sociodemographic characteristics of those who resort to sachet water as
   their primary drinking water source. In multilevel analysis, sachet use
   is statistically significantly associated with lower overall
   self-reported health, younger age, and living in a lower-class
   enumeration area. Sachet use is marginally associated with more days of
   neighborhood water rationing, and significantly associated with the
   proportion of vegetated land cover. Cross-level interactions between
   rationing and proxies for poverty are not associated with sachet
   consumption after adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic,
   socioeconomic, health, and environmental factors. These findings are
   generally consistent with two other recent analyses of sachet water in
   Accra and may indicate a recent transition of sachet consumption from
   higher to lower socioeconomic classes. Overall, the allure of sachet
   water displays substantial heterogeneity in Accra and will be an
   important consideration in planning for future drinking water demand
   throughout West Africa.

   indicate that more than one-third of marriages in America now begin

TI Minorities struggle to advance in academic medicine: A 12-y review of

AB Background: Blacks, Hispanics, and women are underrepresented in
   academic medicine. This study sought to identify recent trends in the
   academic appointments of underrepresented groups at all levels of
   academic medicine.
   Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the
   Association of American Medical Colleges' data on faculty at U. S.
   medical schools from 1997 to 2008. The distribution across race and
   gender at different academic ranks (instructor, assistant professor,
   associate professor, and full professor) and the leadership positions of
   chairperson and dean were calculated for each year of the study.
   Results: Averaged over the 12-y study period, whites accounted for
   84.76% of professors, 88.26% of chairpersons, and 91.28% of deans.
   Asians represented 6.66% of professors, 3.52% of chairpersons, and 0% of
   deans. Blacks represented 1.25% of professors, 2.69% of chairpersons,
   and 4.94% of deans. Hispanics represented 2.76% of professors, 3.37% of
   chairpersons, and 2.91% of deans. Women represented 14.7% of professors,
   9.2% of chairpersons, and 9.3% of deans. Overall, there was a net
   positive increase in the percentage of minority academic physicians in
   this study period, but at the current rate, it would take nearly 1000 y
   for the proportion of black physicians to catch up to the percentage of
   African Americans in the general population. Additionally, year-by-year
   analysis demonstrates that there was a reduction in the percentage of
   each minority group for the last 2 y of this study, in 2007 and 2008.
   Conclusions: Minorities, including Asian Americans, and women remain
   grossly underrepresented in academic medicine. Blacks have shown the
   least progress during this 12-y period. The disparity is greatest at the
   highest levels (professor, chairperson, and dean) of our field. We must
   redouble our efforts to recruit, retain, and advance minorities in
   academic medicine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Few studies have examined parent-child resemblance in body
   weight status using nationally representative data for the US.
   Design: We analyzed Body Mass Index (BMI), weight status, and related
   correlates for 4,846 boys, 4,725 girls, and their parents based on US
   nationally representative data from the 2006 and 2007 Medical
   Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Pearson partial correlation
   coefficients, percent agreement, weighted kappa coefficients, and binary
   and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine parent-child
   resemblance, adjusted for complex sampling design.
   Results: Pearson partial correlation coefficients between parent and
   child's BMI measures were 0.15 for father-son pairs, 0.17 for
   father-daughter pairs, 0.20 for mother-son pairs, and 0.23 for
   mother-daughter pairs. The weighted kappa coefficients between BMI
   quintiles of parent and child ranged from -0.02 to 0.25. Odds ratio
   analyses found children were 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6,
   2.8) times more likely to be obese if only their father was obese, 1.9
   (95% CI: 1.5, 2.4) times more likely if only their mother was obese, and
   3.2 (95% CI: 2.5, 4.2) times more likely if both parents were obese.
   Conclusions: Parent-child resemblance in BMI appears weak and may vary
   across parent-child dyad types in the US population. However, parental
   obesity status is associated with children's obesity status. Use of
   different measures of parent-child resemblance in body weight status can
   lead to different conclusions.

AB Despite strong evidence linking patients' social circumstances to their

   institutions on addressing social needs in clinical settings. Current
   approaches to social determinants generally focus on population-level
   and policy interventions; these overlook individual and clinical
   innovations within health care that can address patients' social
   circumstances. This article proposes a framework for how social
   determinants interventions in the health care system can be construed

AB Assessment of landscape change is critical for attainment of regional
   sustainability goals. Urban growth assessments are needed because over
   half the global population now lives in cities, which impact
   biodiversity, ecosystem structure and ecological processes. Open space
   protection is needed to preserve these attributes, and provide the
   resources humans need. The San Francisco Bay Area, California, is
   challenged to accommodate a population increase of 3.07 million while
   maintaining the region's ecosystems and biodiversity. Our analysis of
   9275 km(2) in the Bay Area links historic trends for three measures:
   urban growth, protected open space, and landcover types over the last 70
   years to future 2050 projections of urban growth and open space.
   Protected open space totaled 348 km(2) (3.7% of the area) in 1940, and
   expanded to 2221 km(2) (20.2%) currently. An additional 1038 km(2) of
   protected open space is targeted (35.1%). Urban area historically
   increased from 396.5 km(2) to 2239 km(2) (24.1% of the area). Urban
   growth during this time mostly occurred at the expense of agricultural
   landscapes (62.9%) rather than natural vegetation. Smart Growth
   development has been advanced as a preferred alternative in many
   planning circles, but we found that it conserved only marginally more
   open space than Business-as-usual when using an urban growth model to
   portray policies for future urban growth. Scenarios to 2050 suggest
   urban development on non-urban lands of 1091, 956, or 179 km(2), under
   Business-as-usual, Smart Growth and Infill policy growth scenarios,
   respectively. The Smart Growth policy converts 88% of natural lands and
   agriculture used by Business-as-usual, while Infill used only 40% of
   those lands. Given the historic rate of urban growth, 0.25%/ year, and
   limited space available, the Infill scenario is recommended. While the
   data may differ, the use of an historic and future framework to track
   these three variables can be easily applied to other metropolitan areas.

AB The Brazilian agro-industrial frontier in Mato Grosso rapidly expanded
   in total area of mechanized production and in total value of production
   in the last decade. This article shows the spatial pattern of that
   expansion from 2000 to 2010, based on novel analyses of satellite
   imagery. It then explores quantitatively and qualitatively the
   antecedents and correlates of intensification, the expansion of the area
   under two crops per year. Double cropping is most likely in areas with
   access to transportation networks, previous profitable agricultural
   production, and strong existing ties to national and international
   commodity markets. The article concludes with an exploration of the
   relationship between double cropping and socioeconomic development,
   showing that double cropping is strongly correlated with incomes of all
   residents of a community and with investments in education. We conclude
   that double cropping in Mato Grosso is very closely tied to multiple
   indicators of socioeconomic development.

AB Urban areas consume more than 66% of the world's energy and generate
   more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. With the world's
   population expected to reach 10 billion by 2100, nearly 90% of whom will
   live in urban areas, a critical question for planetary sustainability is
   how the size of cities affects energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. Are larger cities more energy and emissions efficient than
   smaller ones? Do larger cities exhibit gains from economies of scale
   with regard to emissions? Here we examine the relationship between city
   size and CO2 emissions for U.S. metropolitan areas using a production
   accounting allocation of emissions. We find that for the time period of
   1999-2008, CO2 emissions scale proportionally with urban population
   size. Contrary to theoretical expectations, larger cities are not more
   emissions efficient than smaller ones.

AB Many factors must be considered when assessing estimates of prevalence,
   including research methods and quality of the work by the research team.
   Broad social and political forces also influence estimates of
   prevalence, as seen in the case of autism and intellectual disability.
   Indeed, researchers themselves may be influenced by broader
   sociopolitical factors in ways that they do not recognize. To further
   explore the relationship of prevalence to sociopolitical factors, we
   reviewed the historical prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) (as a proxy
   for physical disability) in the late 20th century. We hypothesized that
   increased awareness of physical impairments associated with the
   disability rights movement of the 1970s would increase the prevalence of
   CP, primarily because of changes in case definition. Although prevalence
   of CP did rise slightly in the 1980s, we conclude that this change is
   better explained by increased survival of low birth weight infants,
   which is only indirectly related to the disability rights movement.

AB Background: HIV disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in the
   United States, including recently arrived immigrant Latinos. However,
   the current arsenal of effective approaches to increase adherence to
   risk-reduction strategies and treatment within Latino populations
   remains insufficient.
   Methods: Our community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership
   blends multiple perspectives of community members, organizational
   representatives, local business leaders, and academic researchers to
   explore and intervene on HIV risk within Latino populations. We used
   CBPR to develop, implement, and evaluate 2 interventions that were found
   to be efficacious.
   Results: We identified 7 assumptions of CBPR as an approach to research,
   including more authentic study designs, stronger measurement, and
   improved quality of knowledge gained; increased community capacity to
   tackle other health disparities; the need to focus on community
   priorities; increased participation and retention rates; more successful
   interventions; reduced generalizability; and increased sustainability.
   Conclusions: Despite the advancement of CBPR as an approach to research,
   key assumptions remain. Further research is needed to compare CBPR with
   other more-traditional approaches to research. Such research would move
   us from assuming the value of CBPR to identifying its actual value in
   health disparity reduction. After all, communities carrying a
   disproportionate burden of HIV, including immigrant Latino communities,
   deserve the best science possible.

AB Background: The HIV epidemic has a devastating impact among South
   African women. The current study evaluated the efficacy of SISTA South
   Africa, a culturally congruent HIV intervention for isiXhosa women in
   South Africa, which was adapted from SISTA, an HIV intervention for
   African American women.
   Methods: A randomized-controlled trial recruited 342 isiXhosa women aged
   18-35 years. Participants were randomized to the general health
   comparison or the SISTA South Africa intervention. Xhosa-speaking peer
   health educators tailored the SISTA South Africa curriculum, while
   maintaining the core elements of the original SISTA intervention.
   Participants completed assessments at baseline and 6 months follow-up.
   Results: Relative to participants in the comparison, participants in the
   HIV intervention reduced the frequency of unprotected vaginal
   intercourse acts (adjusted mean difference = 1.06; P = 0.02), were more
   likely to report not desiring dry sex (adjusted odds ratio = 0.229; 95%
   confidence interval = 0.10 to 0.47; P = 0.0001), and were more likely to
   perceive that their main sexual partner did not desire dry sex (adjusted
   odds ratio = 0.24; 95% confidence interval = 0.11 to 0.52; P = 0.0001).
   In addition, women randomized to the intervention also reported an
   increase in HIV knowledge, greater relationship control, and had more
   opposing attitudes toward HIV stigma. The HIV intervention did not
   reduce sexually transmitted infection incidence.
   Conclusions: This trial demonstrates that an HIV intervention, which is
   adapted to enhance its gender and cultural relevance for rural isiXhosa
   women, can reduce self-reported sexual risk behaviors and enhance
   mediators of HIV among this vulnerable population.

AB Objective: To examine the association between sociodemographic factors,
   sexual behaviors, and social factors on potential uptake of preexposure
   prophylaxis (PrEP) among African American and White adult women in the
   United States.
   Methods: Participants were recruited through a nationally
   representative, random-digit dial telephone household survey.
   Participants comprised a nationally representative, random sample of
   unmarried African American (N = 1042) and White women (N = 411) aged
   20-44 years. Interviews were conducted using computer-assisted telephone
   interviewing technology. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined
   the relationship between sociodemographics, sexual behaviors, and social
   influences on women's potential uptake of PrEP.
   Results: In multivariate analyses, women with lower educational status,
   greater lifetime sexual partners, provider recommendations supportive of
   PrEP, and peer norms supportive of PrEP use were more likely to report
   potential PrEP uptake. Racial analyses revealed that compared with White
   women, African American women were significantly more likely to report
   potential use of PrEP [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.76, P <= 0.001],
   more likely to report use of PrEP if recommended by a health-care
   provider (aOR = 1.65, P <= 0.001), less likely to report that they would
   be embarrassed to ask a health-care provider for PrEP (aOR = 0.59, P <=
   0.05), and more likely to report use of PrEP if their female friends
   also used PrEP (aOR = 2.2, P <= 0.001). The potential cost for PrEP was
   identified as a barrier to adoption by both African American and White
   women.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that women at increased risk for HIV,
   including those with less education and greater number of sexual
   partners, may be more likely to use PrEP, although cost may serve as a
   barrier.

AB Objective: To determine whether lower socioeconomic status (SES),
   broadly defined, is associated with increased inflammation in
   adolescence and whether adiposity mediates these relationships. Methods:
   Fasting blood samples from 941 non-Hispanic black and white adolescents
   enrolled in a suburban, Midwestern school district were assayed for
   proinflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor
   alpha soluble receptor 2 fibrinogen). A parent reported objective SES
   (parent education [E-1 <= high school, E-2 = some college, E-3 = college
   graduate, E-4 = professional degree], household income), and youth
   perceived SES (PSES). Multivariable linear regressions assessed the
   relationship of SES measures to biomarkers adjusting for age, race, sex,
   and puberty status. In the final step, body mass index (BMI) z score
   (BMIz) was added to models, and Sobel tests were performed to assess
   mediation by adiposity. Results: Parent education was inversely
   associated with IL-6 (beta(E1) = .11, beta(E2) = .10, beta(E3) = .02; p
   < .001). This association was attenuated but remained significant after
   BMIz adjustment (p = .01). Sobel testing confirmed BMIz's partial
   mediating role (p < .001). Parent education was also inversely
   associated with sTNFR2 (beta(E1) = .03, beta(E2) = .02, beta(E3) = .001;
   p = .01); this relationship was mediated by BMIz. Although no main
   effect was noted for PSES, PSES by race interactions was observed for
   sTNFR2 (p = .02) and IL-6 (p = .06). High PSES was associated with lower
   sTNFR2 and IL-6 for white but not black youth. There were no
   associations with household income. Conclusions: Social disadvantage,
   specifically low parent education, is associated with increased
   inflammation in adolescence. Adiposity explains some but not all
   associations, suggesting that other mechanisms link lower SES to
   inflammation. High PSES is associated with lower inflammation for white
   but not black youth.

AB Background: Social relationship quantity and quality are associated with
   mortality, but it is unclear whether each relationship dimension is
   equally important for longevity and whether these associations are
   sensitive to baseline health status. Methods: This study examined the
   individual and joint associations of relationship quantity (measured
   using a social integration score) and quality (measured by perceived
   social support) with mortality in a representative US sample (n =
   30,574). The study also evaluated whether these associations were
   consistent across individuals with and without diagnosed chronic illness
   and whether they were independent of socioeconomic status (SES;
   education, income, employment, and wealth). Baseline data were collected
   in 2001 and were linked to vital status records 5 years later (1836
   deaths). Results: Both social integration and social support were
   individually related to mortality (hazard ratios [HRs] = 0.83 [95%
   confidence interval {CI} = 0.80-0.85] and HR = 0.94 [95% CI =
   0.89-0.98], respectively). However, in multivariate models including
   demographic and SES variables, social integration (HR = 0.86, 95% CI =
   0.83-0.89) but not social support (HR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.98-1.08) was
   associated with mortality. The social integration association was linear
   and consistent across baseline health status and men and women.
   Conclusions: Social integration but not social support was independently
   associated with mortality in the US sample. This association was
   consistent across baseline health status and not accounted for by SES.

AB Why do advocacy organizations focus on some issues rather than others?
   Issue selection is an important area of study given that advocacy
   organizations have limited time and resources and thus many potentially
   important issues go ignored. Yet issue selection remains an understudied
   question in the scholarly study of advocacy organizations. In this
   article, the author draws on historical data, interviews, and a database
   of statements by major human rights advocacy organizations to examine
   one particular historical puzzle regarding issue selection: why advocacy
   organizations have focused on the recent conflict in the Darfur region
   of Sudan rather than the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
   even though more people have died in the Congo. The author finds that
   advocacy organizations select issues not based on their severity but
   based on framing, political opportunities, and organizational resources.

AB Postgraduate physician assistant (PA) programs designed to train
   individuals for the workplace have existed since the advent of the
   profession itself. These residency programs continue to grow in number
   despite the lack of outcome data supporting improvements in PA learning,
   effects on career development, or improved patient care. Leadership
   bodies of the PA profession in the US have been at odds regarding the
   meaning and ramification of postgraduate programs on specialty
   credentialing, accreditation standards, insurance reimbursement, and
   employment. Using Bourdieu's cultural conflict theory as a framework, we
   analyze the issues confronting postgraduate PA training programs. Our
   paper discusses implications related to shifts in power amongst the
   different stakeholders concluding that, although formal postgraduate PA
   training can be beneficial to both the PA and the medicine,
   considerations related to underlying agendas need attention.

   individual-level dyadic interactions (number of acquaintances, volume of

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between blood lead levels (BLLs)
   and reading readiness at kindergarten entry, an early marker of school
   performance, in a diverse urban school population.
   METHODS: Kindergarten reading readiness test scores for children
   attending public kindergarten in Providence, Rhode Island, were linked
   to state health department records of blood lead testing by using
   individual identifiers. The study population (N = 3406) was 59%
   Hispanic. For each child, the geometric mean BLL was estimated by using
   all previously reported BLLs. Analyses were adjusted for gender, age,
   year enrolled, race, child language, and free/reduced lunch status as a
   measure of socioeconomic status.
   RESULTS: The median geometric mean BLL was 4.2 mu g/dL; 20% of children
   had at least 1 venous BLL >= 10 mu g/dL. Compared with children with
   BLLs <5 mu g/dL, the adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval
   [CI]) for failing to achieve the national benchmark for reading
   readiness were 1.21 (1.19 to 1.23) and 1.56 (1.51 to 1.60) for children
   with BLLs of 5 to 9 and >= 10 mu g/dL, respectively. On average, reading
   readiness scores decreased by 4.5 (95% CI: -2.9 to -6.2) and 10.0 (95%
   CI: -7.0 to -13.3) points for children with BLLs of 5 to 9 and >= 10 mu
   g/dL, respectively, compared with BLLs <5 mu g/dL.
   CONCLUSIONS: BLLs well below 10 mu g/dL were associated with lower
   reading readiness at kindergarten entry. The high prevalence of elevated
   BLLs warrants additional investigation in other high-risk US
   populations. Results suggest benefits from additional collaboration
   between public health, public education, and community data providers.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the extent of disability in multiple areas of
   functioning after mild, moderate, and severe traumatic brain injury
   (TBI) between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white (NHW) children.
   METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of children aged <18 years
   treated for a TBI between March 1, 2007, and September 30, 2008.
   Hispanic (n = 74) and NHW (n = 457) children were included in the study.
   Outcome measures were disability in health-related quality of life,
   adaptive skills, and participation in activities 3, 12, 24, and 36
   months after injury compared with preinjury functioning. We compared
   change in outcome scores between Hispanic and NHW children at each
   follow-up time. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, severity and
   intent of injury, insurance, family function at baseline, parental
   education, and income.
   RESULTS: The health-related quality of life for all children was lower
   at all follow-up times compared with baseline. Although NHW children
   showed some improvement during the first 3 years after injury, Hispanic
   children remained significantly impaired. Significant differences were
   also observed in the domains of communication and self-care abilities
   after TBI. Differences between groups in scores for participation in
   activities were also present but were only significant 3 months after
   injury.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hispanic children with TBI report larger and long-term
   reductions in their quality of life, participation in activities,
   communication, and self-care abilities compared with NHW children. The
   reasons for these differences need to be better understood and
   interventions implemented to improve the outcomes of these children.

AB This paper proposes several promising future directions for neighborhood
   research to address health inequalities. First, there is a need to apply
   a Geography of Opportunity framework to understand how vast spatial
   (neighborhood, regional) inequality translates into health inequality.
   Such a framework highlights inequality that unfolds across an entire
   region, as well as the continuing significance of race/ethnicity for
   producing disparities in health and in the social determinants of
   health. The Geography of Opportunity framework also points to some of
   the methodological limitations of current neighborhood-health studies,
   given the structure of neighborhood racial inequality in the US for
   estimating how important neighborhoods are for producing racial health
   disparities. Second, there is a need to incorporate life-course
   concepts, data, and methods, including to model residential histories,
   neighborhood temporal change and residential mobility, starting early in
   life. A life-course focus would help inform when in life neighborhoods
   matter most for health and health inequalities, as well as improve
   exposure assessment of residential contexts. Third, we must model
   mechanisms linking neighborhoods and health, including the role of
   individual and household socioeconomic status. Lastly, we need to more
   meaningfully integrate social determinants of health, including drawing
   on policy evaluations that aim to improve neighborhood environments or
   that aim to expand household neighborhood choice. Doing so would inform
   how specific modifiable neighborhood exposures stimulated by policy may
   influence health and health disparities. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Information processing in individuals with autism is marked by a unique
   interplay of strengths and weaknesses that in concert distinguishes
   social cognition in autism from individuals with typical-functioning
   brains. In autism, difficulties with higher cognitive processing and
   enhancement of low-level visuospatial processing, such as in visual
   search tasks, may lead to diminished central coherence, which has the
   potential to hinder how an individual functions in social interactions
   where integration of components such as intention, emotion, and context
   paints the global picture necessary for social processing. A more
   thorough understanding of the cognitive and neural processes in autism
   is important for the advancement of intervention programs. The intention
   of this review is to discuss the implications of neuroimaging and
   behavioral studies that have analyzed the higher cognitive functions in
   individuals with high-functioning autism, with a particular emphasis on
   studies that have investigated visuospatial processing.

   Models of emotion socialization have been primarily developed using
   samples of European American parents and children. As such, current
   categorizations of "adaptive" and "maladaptive" emotion socialization
   practices may not be applicable to individuals from different ethnic
   backgrounds. The review examines current models of emotion
   socialization, with particular attention paid to the demographic
   breakdown of the studies used to develop these models. Additionally, the
   review highlights studies examining emotion socialization practices in

   way partnership between middle schools in a poor largely Latino school
   district, the local University, and local after-school care providers.
   This paper assesses the project and situates it theoretically using
   Foucault's microphysics of power and Bourdieu's concepts of capital to
   analyze the refusal of most students and teachers to engage in the
   program and the standardized testing required by the state. We further
   articulate a new form of Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence based
   on position in the consumer hierarchy. We conclude with a critique of
   grant mechanisms as a means of addressing health issues, and situate the
   obesity epidemic as a social construction that perpetuates inequality
   and discourses of power.

   presence of a spouse or intimate partner, religious/social ties,
   volunteering, and numbers of close friends and relatives), social
   support (tangible support, emotional/informational support, affection,
   positive social interaction), and QOL, measured by the FACT-B,
   approximately 2 months post diagnosis. We used logistic models to
   evaluate associations between social network size, social support, and
   lower versus higher than median QOL scores. We further stratified by
   stage at diagnosis and treatment. In multivariate-adjusted analyses,
   women who were characterized as socially isolated had significantly
   lower FACT-B (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI: 1.72-2.77), physical well-being (WB)
   (OR = 1.61, 95 % CI: 1.27-2.03), functional WB (OR = 2.08, 95 % CI:
   1.65-2.63), social WB (OR = 3.46, 95 % CI: 2.73-4.39), and emotional
   WB(OR = 1.67, 95 % CI: 1.33-2.11) scores and higher breast cancer
   symptoms (OR = 1.48, 95 % CI: 1.18-1.87) compared with socially
   integrated women. Each social network member independently predicted
   higher QOL. Simultaneous adjustment for social networks and social
   support partially attenuated associations between social networks and
   QOL. The strongest mediator and type of social support that was most
   predictive of QOL outcomes was "positive social interaction.'' However,
   each type of support was important depending on outcome, stage, and
   treatment status. Larger social networks and greater social support were
   related to higher QOL after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Effective
   social support interventions need to evolve beyond social-emotional
   interventions and need to account for disease severity and treatment
   status.

AB For this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we assessed
   the impact of early social experiences on the social regulation of
   neural threat responding in a sample of 22 individuals that have been
   followed for over a decade. At 13 years old, a multidimensional measure
   of neighborhood quality was derived from parental reports. Three
   measures of neighborhood quality were used to estimate social
   capital-the level of trust, reciprocity, cooperation, and shared
   resources within a community. At 16 years old, an observational measure
   of maternal emotional support behavior was derived from a mother/child
   social interaction task. At 24 years old, participants were asked to
   visit our neuroimaging facility with an opposite-sex platonic friend.
   During their MRI visit, participants were subjected to the threat of
   electric shock while holding their friend's hand, the hand of an
   anonymous opposite-sex experimenter, or no hand at all. Higher
   adolescent maternal support corresponded with less threat-related
   activation during friend handholding, but not during the stranger or
   alone conditions, in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior
   frontal gyrus and left insula. Higher neighborhood social capital
   corresponded with less threat-related activation during friend
   hand-holding in the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex,
   insula, putamen and thalamus; but low childhood capital corresponded
   with less threat-related activation during stranger handholding in the
   same regions. Exploratory analyses suggest that this latter result is
   due to the increased threat responsiveness during stranger handholding
   among low social capital individuals, even during safety cues. Overall,
   early maternal support behavior and high neighborhood quality may
   potentiate soothing by relational partners, and low neighborhood quality
   may decrease the overall regulatory impact of access to social resources
   in adulthood. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Perceived support has been related to lower cardiovascular morbidity and
   mortality. However, little is known about the specific functional
   components of support responsible for such links. We tested if
   emotional, informational, tangible, and belonging support predicted
   ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and interpersonal interactions (e.g.,
   responsiveness), and if such links were moderated by gender. In this
   study, 94 married couples underwent 12 h of ABP monitoring during daily
   life which included a night at home with their spouse. They completed a
   short-form of the interpersonal support evaluation list that provides
   information on total (global) support, as well as specific dimensions of
   support. Results revealed that global support scores did not predict ABP
   during daily life. However, separating out distinct support components
   revealed that emotional support was a significant predictor of lower
   ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure, primarily for women.
   Finally, emotional support predicted greater partner responsiveness and
   self-disclosure, along with less perceived partner negativity although
   these results were not moderated by gender. These data are discussed in
   terms of the importance of considering specific support components and
   the contextual processes that might influence such links. (C) 2012

AB Over a million children are subjected to some form of trauma in the
   United States every year. Early trauma has been shown to have
   deleterious effects on cardiovascular health in adulthood. However, the
   presence of strong social relationships as an adult can buffer an
   individual against many of the harmful effects of early trauma.
   Furthermore, the perception of social isolation has been shown to be a
   significant risk factor for the development, of cardiovascular disease
   and is a strong predictor of all cause mortality. One likely mechanism
   thought to underlie the influence of perceived isolation on health is
   changes in arterial stiffness. One of the more widely used measures of
   arterial stiffness in older individuals is pulse pressure. The goal of
   the present study was to determine whether early childhood trauma is
   associated with elevations on pulse pressure. Furthermore, this study
   sought to determine whether perceived social isolation moderates the
   relationship between early trauma and pulse pressure. Results revealed
   that individuals with low perceived social iscilation displayed no
   significant relationship between early trauma and pulse pressure.
   However, individuals who reported higher levels of perceived isolation
   showed a significant positive association between early trauma and pulse
   pressure. Therefore, the detrimental effects of early trauma may be
   partially dependent upon the quality of social relationships as an
   adult. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The United States has more than 1.5 million immigrants from countries in
   Africa and the Middle East where female genital cutting (FGC) is known
   to occur. Often, FGC occurs in infancy and childhood in the countries
   where it is practiced, but patients of any age can present with
   complications. Lack of understanding of this common problem can
   potentially alienate and lower quality of care for this patient
   population. We provide an introduction to the practice of FGC and
   practice guidelines for the primary care physician. We reviewed original
   research, population-based studies, and legal research from PubMed,
   Scopus, CINAHL plus, PsycINFO, and Legal Trac. The terms searched
   included female genital cutting, female genital circumcision, and female
   genital mutilation alone and with the term complications or health
   consequences; no limit on date published. Legal databases were searched
   using the above terms, as well as international law and immigration law.
   Editorials and review articles were excluded. This review discusses the
   different types of FGC, important cultural considerations for physicians
   caring for patients with FGC, the common early and late medical
   complications and their management, and psychosocial issues associated
   with FGC. Current laws pertaining to FGC are briefly reviewed, as well
   as implications for patients seeking asylum status in the United States
   because of FGC. Finally, the article presents evidence-based, culturally
   sensitive approaches to discussions of FGC with girls and women for whom
   this is an issue. (C) 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and

AB Male rejuvenation, defined as a process in men to both limit the impact
   of aging on body image and experience greater virility, is growing among
   middle-aged and older men. While rejuvenation was primarily in the
   domain of the younger male athlete with the use of performance enhancing
   hormones or in the aging woman through the use of cosmetic surgery, it
   is now more common among middle-aged and older men. Male rejuvenation
   can occur both through aesthetic surgical means and hormonal
   manipulation through anabolic steroid use. In this article, the authors
   review the psychological issues and perceptions surrounding male
   aesthetic surgeries and the resulting alteration of perception by peers
   and family; highlight the motives and desires behind the use of anabolic
   hormones at often supra-physiologic levels, and the intent to improve
   body image; and clarify the needs that remain to be examined in future
   research in this field. ((c) 2013 by American Society for Reproductive

AB Objective. To measure the associations between self-reported race and
   ethnicity and disease outcomes, including joint damage, pain, and
   functional ability, in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis
   (JIA).
   Methods. A cross-sectional analysis of children with JIA enrolled in the
   Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) Registry
   between May 2010 and March 2012. Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square
   testing were used to compare patient characteristics between race
   (white, African American, or Asian) and ethnicity (Non-Hispanic and
   Non-Latino; Hispanic or Latino) categories. Logistic regression was used
   to measure the associations between each race or ethnicity category and
   the outcome of interest.
   Results. Race category was available for 4292 of 4682 children (93%
   white, 5% African American, Asian 3%). Ethnicity data were available for
   4644 (11% Hispanic or Latino). African American children with
   polyarticular-course JIA had an elevated OR for joint damage on
   radiographic imaging compared to white children (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.1;
   p = 0.04). Hispanic/Latino children had increased odds of having
   disability scores > 75th percentile (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1-2.1; p < 0.01)
   compared to non-Hispanic/Latino children; however, these odds were no
   longer significant when the cohort was limited to children with
   polyarticular-course JIA. Asian children had decreased odds of higher
   pain and functional disability compared to white children (p < 0.05).,
   Conclusion. Race and ethnicity were variably associated with joint
   damage, pain, and functional ability. Understanding outcome variation
   between different race and ethnicity groups may help to optimize care
   for children with JIA.

AB Classic sociological theory emphasizing human ecology and the
   convergence of persons in time and space motivated the routine
   activities approach in criminological research. Empirical work in this
   tradition focuses on predatory offending, and it has rarely been
   considered as a theoretical basis for the study of more common,
   low-level (mostly nonviolent) deviance. Using commonplace automotive
   incivility as a test case, the present work draws on the routine
   activities approach in precisely this manner to answer recent
   theoretical calls for an empirical sociology of familiar encounters and
   situations. Using data from a nationally representative sample of
   Australians, this article looks at the time/space distribution,
   situational commonalities, and emotional consequences of vehicular
   incivilities. Risk factors consistent with the routine activities
   paradigm include everyday driving activity and microsituations involving
   mixed speeds, crowded conditions, and blocked flows. Results also
   suggest that automotive incivility is more likely than other types of
   incivility to incite feelings of fear and anger.

AB Objectives: After laryngectomy, pulmonary protection is mostly acquired
   by means of a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) that is placed on an
   airtight seal around the stoma. The effects of HMEs on the tracheal
   climate have been well described, and the filtration effect of an HME
   with an electrostatic filter has been described in vitro. The effects of
   HME use in patients have been documented in several trials in different
   countries. The follow-up time of the patients in these trials, however,
   is limited. Less is known about long-term use of HMEs, and studies
   describing long-term compliance with HME use are scarce. This study
   investigated the long-term use of HMEs in laryngectomees.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to 195 laryngectomees, and 75
   questionnaires were returned.
   Results: More than 85% of the respondents used an HME, of whom 77% were
   compliant users (ie, use for more than 20 hours per day). The incidence
   of pulmonary illnesses (either before or after surgery) was about 25%.
   More than 90% of the respondents were heavy smokers before laryngectomy.
   One third of the respondents are regularly exposed to dusty
   environments. Compliant HME users tend to make less use of external
   humidifiers and vaporizers, and have better pulmonary status and lower
   health-care costs. Regarding quality of life, patients who use a
   FreeHands device tended to have more frequent social contacts (r =
   0.251; p = 0.030). The prevalence of depression is high, pointing to an
   urgent need to recognize and treat psychiatric problems such as
   depression and suicidal ideation in this patient group.
   Conclusions: These findings have implications for any postlaryngectomy
   research that uses pulmonary parameters.

AB I compare the evolutionary dynamics of two success-biased social
   learning strategies, which, by definition, use the success of others to
   inform one's social learning decisions. The first, "Compare Means",
   causes a learner to adopt cultural variants with highest mean payoff in
   her sample. The second, "Imitate the Best", causes a learner to imitate
   the single most successful individual in her sample. I summarize
   conditions under which each strategy performs well or poorly, and
   investigate their evolution via a gene-culture coevolutionary model.
   Despite the adaptive appeal of these strategies, both encounter
   conditions under which they systematically perform worse than simply
   imitating at random. Compare Means performs worst when the optimal
   cultural variant is usually at high frequency, while Imitate the Best
   performs worst when suboptimal variants sometimes produce high payoffs.
   The extent to which it is optimal to use success-biased social learning
   depends strongly on the payoff distributions and environmental
   conditions that human social learners face. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Hypotheses were tested as explanations for why men and women have
   specific hair color preferences for mates. Traditional evolutionary
   psychology approaches suggest that men should prefer light hair on women
   because it signals youth and health, while women should desire dark hair
   on men because it signals maturity and stability. Repeated exposure
   predicts people prefer the hair color on mates they are exposed to most
   frequently. Uniqueness implies that men and women should desire the
   least prevalent hair colors on potential mates because of its scarcity
   and rarity. Findings primarily support traditional evolutionary
   psychology predictions and occasionally the repeated exposure
   hypothesis, but not uniqueness predictions. Sex and regional differences
   indicate that social and evolutionary processes combine to influence
   hair color preferences.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine approach and avoidance coping
   strategies in the context of a natural disaster as antecedents of
   justice and organizational citizenship behavior. Using a multi-focal
   perspective of social exchange theory, the study uses both reciprocity
   and rationality to enhance the theoretical underpinnings of behavior in
   a justice context. Survey data was collected from full-time employees
   who had experienced a hurricane three weeks earlier (n = 255). The
   differences between approach and avoidance coping are clear in the
   results suggesting that coping strategy helps account for individual
   differences in justice perceptions. Findings demonstrated that employees
   who use approach coping strategies had higher perceptions of justice and
   higher levels of organizational citizenship behavior while employees who
   use avoidance coping strategies had lower perceptions of justice and
   lower levels of organizational citizenship behavior. This has
   implications for employers who could introduce coping skills training as
   a practical means of assisting employees in a disaster situation.

AB Discomfort during interracial interactions is common among Whites in the
   U. S. and is linked to avoidance of interracial encounters. While the
   negative consequences of interracial discomfort are well-documented,
   understanding of its causes is still incomplete. Alcohol consumption has
   been shown to decrease negative emotions caused by self-presentational
   concern but increase negative emotions associated with racial prejudice.
   Using novel behavioral-expressive measures of emotion, we examined the
   impact of alcohol on displays of discomfort among 92 White individuals
   interacting in all-White or interracial groups. We used the Facial
   Action Coding System and comprehensive content-free speech analyses to
   examine affective and behavioral dynamics during these 36-min exchanges
   (7.9 million frames of video data). Among Whites consuming nonalcoholic
   beverages, those assigned to interracial groups evidenced more facial
   and speech displays of discomfort than those in all-White groups. In
   contrast, among intoxicated Whites there were no differences in displays
   of discomfort between interracial and all-White groups. Results
   highlight the central role of self-presentational concerns in
   interracial discomfort and offer new directions for applying theory and
   methods from emotion science to the examination of intergroup relations.

AB The relationship between racial and socioeconomic status (SES)
   disparities and the quality of epithelial ovarian cancer care and
   survival outcome are unclear.
   A population-based analysis of National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) records
   for invasive primary epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed in the period
   from 1998 to 2002 was done using data from patients classified as white
   or black. Adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
   guideline care was defined by stage-appropriate surgical procedures and
   recommended chemotherapy. The main outcome measures were differences in
   adherence to NCCN guidelines and overall survival according to race and
   SES and were analyzed using binomial logistic regression and multilevel
   survival analysis.
   A total of 47 160 patients (white 43 995; black 3165) were identified.
   Non-NCCN-guideline-adherent care was an independent predictor of
   inferior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.43, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] 1.38 to 1.47). Demographic characteristics independently
   associated with a higher likelihood of not receiving NCCN
   guideline-adherent care were black race (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95% CI
   1.25 to 1.48), Medicare payer status (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.28), and
   not insured payer status (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.49). After
   controlling for disease and treatment-related variables, independent
   racial and SES predictors of survival were black race (HR 1.29, 95% CI
   1.22 to 1.36), Medicaid payer status (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.38), not
   insured payer status (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.44), and median
   household income less than $35 000 (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11).
   These data highlight statistically and clinically significant
   disparities in the quality of ovarian cancer care and overall survival,
   independent of NCCN guidelines, along racial and SES parameters.
   Increased efforts are needed to more precisely define the patient,
   provider, health-care system, and societal factors leading to these
   observed disparities and guide targeted interventions.

AB BACKGROUND: Studies analyzing motivation factors that lead to blood
   donation have found altruism to be the primary motivation factor;
   however, social capital has not been analyzed in this context. Our study
   examines the association between motivation factors (altruism,
   self-interest, and response to direct appeal) and social capital
   (cognitive and structural) across three large blood centers in Brazil.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 7635
   donor candidates from October 15 through November 20, 2009. Participants
   completed self-administered questionnaires on demographics, previous
   blood donation, human immunodeficiency virus testing and knowledge,
   social capital, and donor motivations. Enrollment was determined before
   the donor screening process. RESULTS: Among participants, 43.5 and 41.7%
   expressed high levels of altruism and response to direct appeal,
   respectively, while only 26.9% expressed high levels of self-interest.
   More high self-interest was observed at Hemope-Recife (41.7%). Of
   participants, 37.4% expressed high levels of cognitive social capital
   while 19.2% expressed high levels of structural social capital. More
   high cognitive and structural social capital was observed at
   Hemope-Recife (47.3 and 21.3%, respectively). High cognitive social
   capital was associated with high levels of altruism, self-interest, and
   response to direct appeal. Philanthropic and high social altruism were
   associated with high levels of altruism and response to direct appeal.
   CONCLUSION: Cognitive and structural social capital and social altruism
   are associated with altruism and response to direct appeal, while only
   cognitive social capital is associated with self-interest. Designing
   marketing campaigns with these aspects in mind may help blood banks
   attract potential blood donors more efficiently.

AB Background The effects of sibship size and structure on delinquency are
   well established. Specifically, having a large family and many brothers
   has been shown to predict offending. However, despite strong links
   between delinquency and alcohol use, the contribution of sibship factors
   to drinking behaviors remains largely unexplored. The current study
   investigated the impact of sibship size and composition on younger
   brothers' and sisters' ages of drinking and intoxication onset. Methods
   We employed a sample of 4,281 same-sex twins from the Australian Twin
   Register to examine whether (i) large sibship size facilitates earlier
   age at first drink (AFD) and age at first intoxication (AFI) in males
   and females, (ii) having many older brothers predicts earlier ages of
   AFD and AFI in males, and (iii) having many older brothers results in
   later AFD and AFI in females. We tested whether effects were moderated
   by parental divorce and alcohol misuse and mediated by familial
   religion. Results Sibling effects were minimal before accounting for
   family context. However, when parental divorce and excessive parental
   drinking were included as moderators, sibling effects were significantly
   amplified among individuals from homes of divorce, and effects were
   strongest when siblings were close in age. Conclusions Strong close in
   age older sibling effects indicate that proximal sibling attitudes and
   behaviors about alcohol likely interact with structural factors to
   influence younger siblings' drinking. Sibship factors were much more
   influential in one population (individuals from homes of divorce) than
   another (respondents with a parental history of excessive drinking),
   suggesting that sibling effects vary depending on the type of
   co-occurring familial risk. Prevention efforts performed at the family
   level, and introduced before first use of alcohol, are likely to delay
   drinking initiation and help prevent future alcohol problems.

   and decrease social solidarity. Additionally, they may be a source of
   stigma or discrimination, promote dependence, and be unfair for those
   already engaged in targeted health behaviors or those who cannot fulfill
   the incentivized behaviors. Incentive programs need to incorporate
   appropriate safeguards to monitor these risks and support fairness in
   offering economic incentives to promote healthy behavior. (C) 2013

AB Background: Over the past two decades, China has experienced a dramatic
   increase in methamphetamine (MA) abuse. This study examined
   gender-specific socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of MA use
   among Han Chinese, which has previously received little systematic
   study.
   Methods: This analysis described MA-related socio-demographic and
   clinical characteristics in a broad cross-sectional sample (n = 1464;
   male/female = 1185/279), and examined differences between males and
   females in MA use history, MA initiation, MA-related subjective feelings
   and behaviors, and withdrawal symptoms.
   Results: Most MA abusers (about 72%) were young (in their 20s or 30s),
   with women being 5 years younger than men on average. More males (33.2%)
   were married than females (21.9%). The average body mass index (BMI) was
   significantly lower in this MA abuser sample compared to the age-matched
   healthy controls. Moreover, the BMI of females was significantly lower
   than that of males. The laboratory tests showed that the blood levels of
   glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride were all significantly higher in
   males than females. Females used MA at a younger age compared to males.
   The most frequent route of MA use was smoking (90.9%). Males were more
   likely to use another drug, and more likely to be hospitalized. However,
   many characteristics and behaviors of MA use are similar for males and
   females, including the route, the dose and duration of MA use, and
   relapse status.
   Conclusion: Although there were some male-female similarities in MA use
   parameters, significant differences do exist that may have implications
   for gender-specific research as well as for prevention and treatment
   strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: To examine gender differences among individuals diagnosed
   with DSM-IV lifetime cannabis use disorder (CUD).
   Methods: A nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged 18 years
   or older that were diagnosed with lifetime CUD (n = 3297): Men (n =
   2080), Women (n = 1217). Data were drawn from the 2001-2002 National
   Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC,
   n=43,093). The survey response rate was 81%.
   Results: Nearly all individuals with CUD had a psychiatric comorbidity
   (95.6% of men, 94.1% of women). Men with lifetime CUD were more likely
   than women to be diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder, any substance
   use disorder and antisocial personality disorder, whereas women with CUD
   had more mood and anxiety disorders. After adjusting for gender
   differences in sociodemographic correlates and the prevalence of
   psychiatric disorders in the general population, women with CUD were at
   greater risk for externalizing disorders. Men with CUD met more criteria
   for cannabis abuse, had longer episodes of CUD, smoked more joints, and
   were older at remission when compared to women with CUD. Women
   experienced telescoping to CUD. Treatment-seeking rates were very low
   for both genders, and there were no gender differences in types of
   services used or reasons for not seeking treatment.
   Conclusions: There are important gender differences in the clinical
   characteristics and psychiatric comorbidities among individuals with
   CUD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Climatic fluctuations that occurred in North Africa during the early and
   middle Holocene had a profound impact on the environment of the region
   and would have required human populations in the area to adapt their
   subsistence and economic strategies in equally significant ways. Capsian
   groups, located in eastern Algeria and southern Tunisia from
   approximately 10,000 to 6000 cal. BP, were among the last North African
   foragers at a time when other groups were abandoning food collection to
   engage in food production in the form of pastoralism. Capsian foragers
   relied heavily on land snails, but we have little information on their
   use of plant resources, which can be an important indicator of economic
   adaptation to environmental change. In this study we use phytolith
   analyses at the Capsian site of Ain Misteheyia in eastern Algeria to
   track the changes in subsistence strategies throughout much of the
   middle-Holocene climatic transitions. Our results show that Capsian
   foragers exploited plants such as sedges and small-seeded grasses from
   wetland microenvironments within their home ranges which allowed them to
   demonstrate robust and resilient resource procurement strategies, and
   maintain a foraging lifestyle resistant to major fluctuations in
   climate.

   The Stony Brook Guidelines, based on a community dialogue process with
   affected individuals, families and professionals, identify and discuss
   the following topics: treatment goals and happiness, distributive
   justice, managing the hopes for a cure, sibling responsibilities,
   intimacy and sex, diagnostic ethics, and research ethics. Our
   guidelines, based not on "top-down" imposition of professional expertise
   but rather on "bottom-up" grass roots attention to the voices of
   affected individuals and families speaking from experience, can inform
   clinical practice and are also meaningful for the wider social
   conversation emerging over the treatment of individuals with ASD.

AB The collection of articles in this supplement issue provides insight
   into the association of various covariates with concentrations of
   biochemical indicators of diet and nutrition (biomarkers), beyond age,
   race, and sex, using linear regression. We studied 10 specific
   sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates in combination with 29
   biomarkers from NHANES 2003-2006 for persons aged >= 20y. The covariates
   were organized into 2 sets or "chunks": sociodemographic (age, sex,
   race-ethnicity, education, and income) and lifestyle (dietary supplement
   use, smoking, alcohol consumption, BM I, and physical activity) and fit
   in hierarchical fashion by using each category or set of related
   variables to determine how covariates, jointly, are related to biomarker
   concentrations. In contrast to many regression modeling applications,
   all variables were retained in a full regression model regardless of
   significance to preserve the interpretation of the statistical
   properties of beta coefficients, P values, and CIs and to keep the
   interpretation consistent across a set of biomarkers. The variables were
   preselected before data analysis, and the data analysis plan was
   designed at the outset to minimize the reporting of false-positive
   findings by limiting the amount of preliminary hypothesis testing.
   Although we generally found that demographic differences seen in
   biomarkers were over- or underestimated when ignoring other key
   covariates, the demographic differences generally remained significant
   after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. These
   articles are intended to provide a foundation to researchers to help
   them generate hypotheses for future studies or data analyses and/or
   develop predictive regression models using the wealth of NHANES data.

AB Biochemical indicators of water-soluble vitamin (WSV) status were
   measured in a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population in
   NHANES 2003-2006. To examine whether demographic differentials in
   nutritional status were related to and confounded by certain variables,
   we assessed the association of sociodemographic (age, sex,
   race-ethnicity, education, income) and lifestyle (dietary supplement
   use, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity) variables
   with biomarkers of WSV status in adults (aged >= 20 y): serum and RBC
   folate, serum pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP), serum 4-pyridoxic acid,
   serum total cobalamin (vitamin B-12), plasma total homocysteine (tHcy),
   plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA), and serum ascorbic acid. Age (except
   for PLP) and smoking (except for M MA) were generally the strongest
   significant correlates of these biomarkers (vertical bar r vertical bar
   <= 0.43) and together with supplement use explained more of the
   variability compared with the other covariates in bivariate analysis. In
   multiple regression models, sociodemographic and lifestyle variables
   together explained from 7 (vitamin B-12) to 29% (tHcy) of the biomarker
   variability. We observed significant associations for most biomarkers
   (>= 6 of 8) with age, sex, race-ethnicity, supplement use, smoking, and
   BMI and for some biomarkers with FIR (5 of 8), education (1 of 8),
   alcohol consumption (4 of 8), and physical activity (5 of 8). We noted
   large estimated percentage changes in biomarker concentrations between
   race-ethnic groups (from -24 to 20%), between supplement users and
   nonusers (from -12 to 104%), and between smokers and nonsmokers (from
   -28 to 8%). In summary, age, sex, and race-ethnic differentials in
   biomarker concentrations remained significant after adjusting for
   sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. Supplement use and smoking
   were important correlates of biomarkers of WSV status.

AB Sociodemographic and lifestyle factors exert important influences on
   nutritional status; however, information on their association with
   biomarkers of fat-soluble nutrients is limited, particularly in a
   representative sample of adults. Serum or plasma concentrations of
   vitamin A, vitamin E, carotenes, xanthophylls, 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   [25(OH)D], SFAs, MUFAs, PUFAs, and total fatty acids (tFAs) were
   measured in adults (aged >= 20y) during all or part of NHANES 2003-2006.
   Simple and multiple linear regression models were used to assess 5
   sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and
   income) and 5 lifestyle behaviors (smoking, alcohol consumption, BM I,
   physical activity, and supplement use) and their relation to biomarker
   concentrations. Adjustment for total serum cholesterol and
   lipid-altering drug use was added to the full regression model.
   Adjustment for latitude and season was added to the full model for
   25(OH)D. Based on simple linear regression, race-ethnicity, BMI, and
   supplement use were significantly related to all fat-soluble biomarkers.
   Sociodemographic variables as a group explained 5-17% of biomarker
   variability, whereas together, sociodemographic and lifestyle variables
   explained 22-23% [25(OH)D, vitamin E, xanthophylls], 17% (vitamin A),
   15% (MUFAs), 10-11% (SFAs, carotenes, tFAs), and 6% (PUFAs) of biomarker
   variability. Although lipid adjustment explained additional variability
   for all biomarkers except for 25(OH)D, it appeared to be largely
   independent of sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. After adjusting
   for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and lipid-related variables, major
   differences in biomarkers were associated with race-ethnicity (from -44
   to 57%), smoking (up to -25%), supplement use (up to 21%), and BM I (up
   to -15%). Latitude and season attenuated some race-ethnicity
   differences. Of the sociodemographic and lifestyle variables examined,
   with or without lipid adjustment, most fat-soluble nutrient biomarkers
   were significantly associated with race-ethnicity.

AB The NHANES 2003-2006 has assessed iron and iodine status, 2 trace

   population. We investigated associations of sociodemographic (age, sex,
   race-ethnicity, education, income) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol
   consumption, BM I, physical activity, dietary supplement use) variables
   with the iron status indicators serum ferritin, soluble transferrin
   receptor (sTfR), and body iron in women aged 20-49 y (n = 2539, 2513,
   and 2509, respectively) and with urine iodine, a biomarker of iodine
   intake, in adults aged y (n = 3066). Significant correlations between
   the study variables and biomarkers were weak (vertical bar r vertical
   bar <= 0.24). Urine creatinine (uCr) was Moderately significantly
   correlated with urine iodine (r= 0.52). The individual variables
   explained <= 5% of the variability in biomarker concentrations in
   bivariate analysis. In multiple regression models, sociodemographic and,
   lifestyle variables together explained 4-13% of the variability in iron
   indicators and 41% of the variability in urine iodine (uCr in the
   model). The adjusted estimated body iron was similar to 1 unit (mg/kg)
   lower in non-Hispanic black vs. non-Hispanic white women and similar to
   1 unit higher in women who smoked vs. those who did not and in women
   consuming 1 vs. 0 alcoholic drinks/d. The adjusted estimated urine
   iodine concentration (uCr in the model) was 34% lower in non-Hispanic
   blacks vs. non-Hispanic whites, 22% higher in supplement users vs.
   nonusers, and 11% higher with every 10-y increase in age. In summary,
   after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables (and uCr in
   the iodine model), race-ethnicity retained a strong association wilt
   sTfR, body iron, end urine iodine; smoking and alcohol consumption with
   iron biomarkers; and supplement use and age with urine iodine.

AB Isoflavones and lignans are plant-derived dietary compounds generally
   believed to be beneficial to human health. We investigated the extent to
   which sociodemographic (age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and income)
   and lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical
   activity, and dietary supplement use) were correlates of spot urine
   concentration for daidzein, genistein, O-desmethylangolensin (DMA),
   equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone in the U.S. population aged >= 20 y
   (NHANES 2003-2006). We performed correlation analyses with continuous
   variables and calculated stratified unadjusted geometric means for each
   sociodemographic and lifestyle variable. We used bivariate significance
   testing and covariate adjustment by use of multiple regression models to
   identify influential variables and used beta coefficients to estimate
   relative effects. Urine creatinine was also included in our analyses
   because of its use in correcting for variable dilution in spot urine
   samples. We observed many significant (P < 0.05) associations with the
   sociodemographic and lifestyle variables that withstood covariate
   adjustment. Smoking was a significant correlate of urine DMA and
   enterolactone, with concentrations at least 25% lower in smokers vs.
   nonsmokers. Consumers of 1 daily alcoholic drink vs. none were estimated
   to have 18-21% lower urine equol and DMA concentrations. A 25% increase
   in BMI was associated with a 21% lower urine enterolactone
   concentration, and increasing physical activity was associated with a
   >6% higher urine enterolactone concentration. Dietary supplement use was
   not significantly associated with any of the urine phytoestrogens.
   Overall, we found that relationships between sociodemographic and
   lifestyle variables and urine phytoestrogen concentration were highly
   compound and class specific.

AB Hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide (HbAA) and glycidamide (HbGA) have been
   measured as biomarkers of acrylamide exposure and metabolism in a

   2003-2004. We assessed the association of sociodemographic (age, sex,
   race-ethnicity, education, and income) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol
   consumption, BMI, physical activity, and dietary supplement use)
   variables with these biomarkers in U.S. adults (aged >= 20 y). We used
   bivariate and multiple regression models and assessed the magnitude of
   an estimated change in biomarker concentration with change in a
   covariable for 2 biomarkers of acrylamide exposure. Smoking was strongly
   and significantly correlated with HbAA and HbGA concentrations (r(s) =
   0.51 and 0.42, respectively), with biomarker concentrations being 126
   and 101% higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers after adjusting for
   sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates. Age was moderately and
   significantly correlated with both biomarkers (r(s) = -0.21 and -0.22,
   respectively). BMI (r(s) = -0.11) and alcohol consumption (r(s) = 0.13)
   were weakly yet significantly correlated with HbAA concentrations only.
   The estimated percentage change in biomarker concentration was <= 20%
   for all variables other than smoking after adjusting for
   sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates. Using multiple regression
   models, the sociodemographic variables explained 9 and 7% whereas the
   sociodemographic and lifestyle variables together explained 46 and 25%
   of the variability in HbAA and HbGA, respectively, showing the
   importance of considering and adequately controlling for these variables
   in future studies. Our findings will be useful in the design and
   analysis of future studies that assess and evaluate exposure to
   acrylamide and its metabolism to glycidamide.

AB This study examined the influence of peers in meeting DSM-IV symptom

   Hurricane Georges. Participants included a representative community
   sample of 905 youth (n = 476 boys) ages 11-17, residing in Puerto Rico.
   Data were gathered on hurricane exposure, symptoms of internalizing
   disorders, peer social support, peer violence, and peer substance use
   through in-person structured interviews with adolescents and caretakers
   from 1999 to 2000 in Puerto Rico, 12-27 months after Hurricane Georges.
   Hurricane exposure, peer violence, and peer substance use predicted
   whether adolescents met DSM-IV symptom criteria for a measured
   internalizing disorder. An interaction was found between hurricane
   exposure and peer violence, which indicated that hurricane exposure was
   significantly related to meeting DSM-IV symptom criteria for an
   internalizing disorder among adolescents who do not report associating
   with violent peers. However, for participants who reported high levels
   of peer violence, hurricane exposure did not convey additional risk for
   meeting DSM-IV symptom criteria for an internalizing disorder. With the
   increasing role peers play in adolescents' lives, understanding the
   influence of peers on the development of internalizing symptoms
   following hurricane exposure may assist in planning developmentally
   sensitive response plans.

AB Purpose: To explore demographic and regional factors associated with the
   use of positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with non-small
   cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to determine whether their associations
   with PET use has changed over time.
   Materials and Methods: The Office of Human Research Ethics at the
   University of North Carolina and the institutional review board of the
   Duke University Health System approved (with waiver of informed consent)
   this retrospective analysis of Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results
   Medicare data for Medicare beneficiaries given a diagnosis of NSCLC
   between 1998 and 2007. The primary outcome was change in the number of
   PET examinations 2 months before to 4 months after diagnosis, examined
   according to year and sociodemographic subgroup. PET use was compared
   between demographic and geographic subgroups and between early
   (1998-2000) and late (2005-2007) cohorts by using chi(2) tests. Factors
   associated with use of PET during the study period were further examined
   by using logit and linear probability multivariable regression analyses.
   Results: The final cohort included 46544 patients with 46935 cases of
   NSCLC. By 2005, more than half of patients underwent one or more PET
   examinations, regardless of demographic subgroup. In multivariable
   logistic regression analysis, patients who underwent PET were more
   likely to be married, nonblack, and younger than 80 years and to live in
   census tracts with higher education levels or in the Northeast (P < .001
   for all). Living within 40 miles of a PET facility was initially
   associated with undergoing PET (P < .001), but this association
   disappeared by 2007. Imaging rates increased more rapidly in patients
   who were nonblack (P <= .01), patients who were younger than 81 years (P
   < .001), and patients who lived in the Northeast and South (P < .001).
   Conclusion: PET imaging among Medicare beneficiaries with NSCLC was
   initially concentrated among nonblack patients younger than 81 years.
   Despite widespread adoption among all subgroups, differences within
   demographic subgroups remained.

AB The biophysical environment is not tangential to the social; it is only
   tangential to conventional sociological thought. Environmental sociology
   arose in the 1970s based on this presupposition, but over time theory
   and empirical research have generally adopted a social constructionist
   or natural realist approach. Despite rejection of the Durkheimian dictum
   of explaining social facts through the invocation of other social facts,
   and thus refusal to presuppose human exemptionalism from ecological
   constraints, scholarship continues to reflect this nature/culture
   divide. When environmental sociologists focus on one side or the other
   of the nature/culture divide, the intertwining and conjoint constitution
   of the social and the biophysical-material is obscured. The intent of
   the present essay is to articulate a co-constructionist ontological
   position sensitive to the temporal emergence of hybridity between the
   social and the natural and amenable to recognition of salient dynamics
   not readily envisioned from either side of the nature/culture divide. In
   doing so, the argument builds upon prior metatheoretical scholarship in
   environmental sociology and science and technology studies and
   highlights ontological conundrums that must be confronted in order to
   further the move toward a viable co-constructionist posture.

AB Background Head and neck cancer and its treatment can have considerable
   impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The present study
   investigated whether social support, assessed before treatment,
   predicted HRQOL outcomes up to 12 months later in head and neck cancer
   survivors. Methods Using a prospective longitudinal design, patients (n
   = 364) were assessed on several clinical and psychosocial
   characteristics at diagnosis and then at 3- and 12-month follow-up
   appointments. HRQOL was assessed with the Short Form Health Survey
   (SF-36) and the Head and Neck Cancer Inventory (HNCI). Results
   Hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that greater
   perceived support present at diagnosis significantly predicted more
   favorable global and head and neck cancer-specific HRQOL at 3- and
   12-month follow-up. Conclusion Results suggest that adequate social
   support at diagnosis can have a significant, positive impact on HRQOL in
   head and neck cancer survivors. Thus, it may be useful to evaluate
   support resources at diagnosis in order to identify individuals at risk
   for poor HRQOL outcomes. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 35:

AB Compared to white women, premenopausal Chinese-American women have more
   plate-like trabecular (Tb) bone. It is unclear whether these findings
   are relevant to postmenopausal women and if there are racial differences
   in the deterioration of bone microarchitecture with aging. We applied
   individual trabecula segmentation and finite element analysis to
   high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography images in
   premenopausal and postmenopausal Chinese-American and white women to
   quantify within-race age-related differences in Tb plate-versus-rod
   microarchitecture and bone stiffness. Racemenopause status interactions
   were assessed. Comparisons between races within menopause status were
   adjusted for age, height and weight. Comparisons between premenopausal
   and postmenopausal women were adjusted for height and weight. Adjusted
   analyses at the radius indicated that premenopausal Chinese-Americans
   had a higher plate bone volume fraction (pBV/TV), Tb plate-to-rod ratio
   (P-R ratio), and greater plate-plate junction densities (P-P Junc.D)
   versus white women (all p<0.01), resulting in 27% higher Tb stiffness
   (p<0.05). Greater cortical thickness and density (Ct.Th and Dcort) and
   more Tb plates led to 19% greater whole bone stiffness (p<0.05).
   Postmenopausal Chinese-Americans had similar pBV/TV and P-P Junc.D, yet
   a higher P-R ratio versus white women. Postmenopausal Chinese-American
   versus white women had greater Ct.Th, Dcort, and relatively intact Tb
   plates, resulting in similar Tb stiffness but 12% greater whole bone
   stiffness (p<0.05). In both races, Ct.Th and Dcort were lower in
   postmenopausal versus premenopausal women and there were no differences
   between races. Tb plate parameters were also lower in postmenopausal
   versus premenopausal women, but age-related differences in pBV/TV, P-R
   ratio, and P-P Junc D were greater (p<0.05) in Chinese-Americans versus
   white women. There are advantages in cortical and Tb bone in
   premenopausal Chinese-American women. Within-race cross-sectional
   differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women suggest
   greater loss of plate-like Tb bone with aging in Chinese-Americans,
   though thicker cortices and more plate-like Tb bone persists.

AB Background: Aggression is one of the more stable characteristics of
   child and adolescent development, and violent behavior in early
   adulthood is often foreshadowed by aggressive behavior in childhood and
   early adolescence. Considerable evidence has linked coercive family
   interactions to aggressive behavior in childhood, but less research has
   been conducted on the joint role of family and peer interaction in the
   escalation of aggression to violence in adulthood. Methods: We coded
   family interactions at age 1213 and friendship interaction at age 1617
   in a multiethnic sample of youth and families. Violence in young
   adulthood (age 2223) was measured using self-report, criminal records,
   and parent report. We tested the hypothesis that a process of coercive
   joining' in friendship interactions mediated the relationship between
   coercive family interactions and serious violence. Results: We found
   that observed coercive joining in friendships at age 1617 predicted
   early-adulthood violent behavior over and above an established tendency
   toward antisocial behavior. We also found that observed coercive family
   interactions at age 12 predicted early-adulthood violence, and that
   coercive joining with friends fully mediated this link. Conclusions:
   These results significantly extend coercion theory by suggesting that
   coercive joining in the context of peer groups is an additional
   mechanism by which coercive processes in the family are extended and
   amplified to violent behavior in early adulthood. Our findings suggest
   the importance of addressing both individual interpersonal skills and
   self-organizing peer groups when intervening to prevent violent
   behavior.

AB Background: Despite significant advances in pharmacological and
   nonpharmacological treatment of heart failure (HF), there are more than
   1 million HF visits annually to the emergency department. Studies
   indicate that HF clinical outcome is affected not only by medical
   interventions but also by social factors such as marital status.
   Objectives: This study aimed to determine the effect of marital status
   of HF patients on clinical outcome of HF in a high-risk population.
   Methods: We reviewed data collected for The Joint Commission in patients
   admitted with HF at a university hospital serving a high-risk population
   in Louisiana during the period from June 2003 to September 2004 and
   followed up until December 2008. Patients were divided into 2 groups,
   namely, married patients and unmarried patients (including single,
   divorced, and widowed) based on self-reporting. Primary outcome measures
   were in-hospital survival and time to readmission. Secondary outcome
   measures were HF admission rate, average B-type natriuretic peptide, and
   average troponin-I levels throughout the follow-up period.
   Results: Of 646 reviewed records, 542, representing 357 patients, were
   included in the analysis. Of these, 105 patients were married and 245
   were unmarried; marital status was missing for 7 patients. Mean (SD) of
   follow-up period was 2.39 (1.6) years. Marital status was not a
   significant variable for in-hospital death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.35-1.49), or for time to readmission for HF
   (hazard ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-1.56); multiple
   linear regression analysis identified married status as an independent
   variable for average B-type natriuretic peptide (parameter estimate =
   -0.26, P = 0.02) but not for HF admission rate or average troponin-I
   levels.
   Conclusions: Married status was not associated with better clinical
   outcome in HF patients in a high-risk population.

AB We analyze a new effort at collective political mobilization, sponsored
   by the Catholic Church in Central America following the demobilization
   of church-linked liberationist movements since the early 1990s. The
   current effort strives to re-project social Catholicism into the public
   arena by drawing on traditional Catholic structures, the cultural legacy
   of liberationist Catholicism, and a model of democratic organizing
   promoted by the PICO National Network in the United States. Drawing
   primarily on ethnographic and interview data, we explain the initial
   success of the effort in the light of the literature on resource
   mobilization, mobilizing structures, and the cultural dynamics of social
   movements, then assess the ongoing and future challenges that
   PICO-Central America is likely to face. We argue that despite PICO's
   challenges in Central America, the movement represents a rebirth of
   Catholic activism in the region and holds significant promise as one
   element in the consolidation of democratic politics in Central America.

AB Background: The residential segregation of black populations, often in
   areas of high-economic disadvantage and low social status, may play a
   crucial role in the observed racial inequities in sexually transmitted
   disease rates.
   Methods: An ecological analysis of 2005 to 2009 average gonorrhea rates
   was performed across 277 US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). The
   black isolation index and Gini index of income inequality were used as
   proxy measures for racial and economic residential segregation
   respectively, derived from 2005 to 2009 US Census estimates. We used
   logistic regression modeling to produce estimates of odds ratios (ORs)
   and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between the
   segregation indices, both independently and in combination, on gonorrhea
   rates in MSAs. Effect measure modification was assessed by calculating
   the relative excess risk due to interaction between the 2 indices.
   Results: Compared with MSAs with low levels of racial segregation, MSAs
   with high levels of racial segregation had increased odds of high
   gonorrhea rates (adjusted OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.23-9.21). Similarly,
   higher levels of income inequality predicted higher gonorrhea rates,
   although this association did not persist after adjustment for potential
   confounders (adjusted OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.74-3.24). In combined models,
   the influence of racial residential segregation on gonorrhea rates was
   stronger than that of income inequality-based segregation; there was no
   evidence of additivity or a multiplicative interaction.
   Conclusions: Residential segregation by race or income equality may be a
   key component in the perpetuation of high rates of gonorrhea and other
   sexually transmitted diseases among black populations in the United
   States.

AB The commercialization of academic science has come to be understood as
   economically desirable for institutions, individual researchers, and the
   public. Not surprisingly, commercial activity, particularly that which
   results from patenting, appears to be producing changes in the standards
   used to evaluate scientists' performance and contributions. In this
   context, concerns about a gender gap in patenting activity have arisen
   and some have argued for the need to encourage women to seek more
   patents. They believe that because academic advancement is mainly
   dependent on productivity (Stuart and Ding in American Journal of
   Sociology 112:97-144, 2006; Azoulay et al. in Journal of Economic
   Behavior & Organization 63:599-623, 2007), differences in research
   output have the power to negatively impact women's careers. Moreover, in
   the case of patenting activity, they claim that the gender gap also has
   the potential to negatively affect society. This is so because
   scientific and technological advancement and innovation play a crucial
   role in contemporary societies. Thus, women's more limited involvement
   in the commercialization of science and technology can also be
   detrimental to innovation itself. Nevertheless, calls to encourage women
   to patent on grounds that such activity is likely to play a significant
   role in the betterment of both women's careers and society seem to be
   based on two problematic assumptions: (1) that the methods to determine
   women's productivity in patenting activities are an appropriate way to
   measure their research efforts and the impact of their work, and (2)
   that patenting, particularly in academia, benefits society. The purpose
   of this paper is to call into question these two assumptions.

AB Stage at diagnosis is an important prognostic factor for the majority of
   cancers; it may be an indicator for quality of access to health care and
   is usually correlated with socioeconomic status (SES) and
   ethnicity/race. We aimed to investigate the association between stage of
   cancer at diagnosis with neighborhood of residence (as proxy for SES)
   and ethnicity/race, while controlling for each other, in selected areas
   of New York City (NYC).
   The cancer summary data (1999-2008) were provided by the New York State
   Cancer Registry. Multinomial logistic regression models were applied to
   calculate risk estimates for being diagnosed with late- or unknown-stage
   (versus early-stage) cancers in two low-SES and two high-SES
   neighborhoods of NYC and among several ethnic/racial groups for all
   cancers combined and cancers of the female breast, lung, colorectum, and
   prostate, with additional adjustments for sex (for all cancers
   combined), age, and year of diagnosis.
   A total of 34,981 cancer cases were included in this study. There were
   significant and independent ethnic/racial and neighborhood disparities
   in stage of cancer at diagnosis of most of the cancers studied. The
   effect of ethnicity/race on the disparity appeared stronger than the
   effect of neighborhood. There was an overall decreasing trend in the
   proportion of late-stage cancers, particularly for colorectal cancer,
   and to a greater extent in the proportion of cancers without staging
   information.
   In this population, ethnicity/race seems to be a stronger predictor for
   late stage at diagnosis than SES, stressing the need for
   ethnicity/race-oriented programs for cancer screening and improved
   access to care.

AB Adherence to behavioral weight management programs is often limited,
   especially among ethnic minority populations. The current study examined
   whether attitudinal familism, or attention to the needs of family above
   those of the self, predicted poorer adherence to a behavioral weight
   management program in Mexican-American women. One-hundred overweight or
   obese Mexican-American women from the southwestern United States were
   enrolled in a group-based weight loss treatment. Zero-order correlations
   indicated that general commitment to attitudinal familism, as measured
   by the Attitudinal Familism Scale, was significantly negatively
   associated with calorie and physical activity goal completion and
   marginally negatively associated with session attendance. The results of
   the current study indicate that researchers may consider addressing
   familism when developing tailored weight management interventions for
   Mexican-American women.

AB Background Structural interventions focused on community mobilisation to
   engender an enabling social context have reduced sexual risk behaviours
   among sex workers. Interventions to date have increased social
   participation and shown an association between participation and safer
   sex. Social participation could modify risk for other health behaviours,
   particularly drug use. We assessed social participation and drug use
   before and after implementation of a clinical, social and structural
   intervention with sex workers intended to prevent sexually transmitted
   infections/HIV infection.
   Methods We followed 420 sex workers participating in the Encontros
   intervention in Corumba, Brazil, between 2003 and 2005. We estimated the
   association of participation in external social groups with drug use at
   baseline and follow-up using logistic regression and marginal modelling.
   Follow-up analyses of preintervention/postintervention change in drug
   use employed inverse probability weighting to account for censoring and
   were stratified by exposure to the intervention.
   Results Social participation showed a protective association with drug
   use at baseline (1 SD higher level of social participation associated
   with 3.8% lower prevalence of drug use, 95% CI -0.1 to 8.3). Among
   individuals exposed to Encontros, higher social participation was
   associated with an 8.6% lower level of drug use (95% CI 0.1 to 23.3). No
   significant association was found among the unexposed.
   Conclusions A structural intervention that modified sex workers' social
   environment, specifically participation in external social groups, was
   associated with reduced drug use. These findings suggest that sexual

AB The friendships of children displaying symptoms of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been understudied,
   particularly in comparison to the domain of peer rejection. This study
   tested whether friendship intimacy exchange buffers the prospective
   relation between ADHD symptoms and social problems 1 year later in a
   sample of children attending a community-based after-school program.
   Children (N = 131; 53 % boys; 66 % African American) ranging from 5 to
   13 years of age participated in this study. At baseline, children
   reported on friendship intimacy exchange with their identified best
   friend, and program staff rated children on ADHD symptoms and social
   problems. Staff ratings of children's social problems were collected
   again 1 year later. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after
   controlling for demographic variables and baseline social problems,
   friendship intimacy exchange significantly moderated the association
   between ADHD symptoms and social problems at the one-year follow-up.
   Specifically, the relation between ADHD and social problems was no
   longer significant for children reporting high levels of friendship
   intimacy exchange. This moderation was not further qualified by either
   child age or sex, although boys were more likely than girls to report
   low rates of friendship intimacy exchange. These findings indicate the
   importance of friendship intimacy for children displaying ADHD symptoms,
   who often experience significant peer problems. Friendship quality may
   be a promising target for prevention and intervention efforts in
   mitigating some of the long-term social problems associated with ADHD
   symptomatology, and future research is needed to extend these findings
   to other domains of friendship quality and clinical samples of children
   with ADHD.

AB Previous studies have shown that sexual minorities and heterosexuals
   differ in the level of success in educational attainment. Because these
   studies treated sexual orientation as a static trait, they could not
   address how the dynamic aspect of sexual orientation impacts educational
   attainment. This study seeks to answer this question while focusing on
   sexual contact as an indicator of sexual orientation and highest
   educational degree obtained by young adulthood as an attainment outcome.
   Ordered logistic regression analysis was conducted using US data (the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health or "Add Health," Waves
   1-4). Among women, those who report same-sex contact obtain lower
   educational degrees than those without such contact regardless of its
   timing and continuity. Among men, those who report their first same-sex
   contact in young adulthood obtain higher degrees than others. These
   associations are explained by self-exploratory attitudes, depressive
   symptoms, and academic performance and expectations. These results help
   understand how same-sex sexual development creates opportunities and
   constraints in the educational attainment process, thereby extending the
   existing attainment literature, which concentrates on implications of
   heterosexual development. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd Background and Objective Age is
   highly related to oral health status. The higher prevalence of oral
   disease within subgroups of the population may reflect a tendency
   towards early aging and dysregulation of multiple physiological systems.
   This study examines whether the association between periodontal disease
   and demographic factors is mediated by physiological measures of health.
   Material and Methods Logistic regression was used to examine whether
   biomarkers and demographic factors, such as socio-economic status (SES)
   and race/ethnicity, were associated with periodontal disease, and then
   whether the strength of these relationships could be attributed to
   associations between demographic variables and physiological measures of
   systemic health. Results Periodontal disease was associated with
   measures of SES and race/ethnicity. Furthermore, 1-unit increases in
   cytomegalovirus (CMV), optical density, C-reactive protein (CRP) and
   glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were associated with a 25% [odds ratio
   (OR)=1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.141.36], 13% (OR = 1.13; 95%
   CI = 1.031.24) and 19% (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.121.27) increased
   likelihood of periodontal disease, respectively. However, when
   biomarkers and socio-demographic variables were both included in the
   model, their associations with periodontal disease were significantly
   reduced or eliminated. Conclusions The risk of periodontal disease is
   higher among black and/or low-income individuals; however, these
   associations appear to be partly due to the greater probability of
   elevated levels of CRP, CMV or HbA1c among these groups.

AB Objectives: Biventricular pacing (BiV) is an important therapy for
   symptomatic heart failure (HF) patients with reduced left ventricular
   (LV) ejection fraction (EF). The aim of our study was to determine if
   ethnic disparities in use of BiV in HE patients with LV systolic
   dysfunction are independent of socioeconomic status.
   Design, Setting, Participants: Data collected on 32,911 hospitalized HF
   patients with EF <= 35% from Pennsylvania hospitals that implanted BiVs
   in 2004 and 2005 were submitted to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost
   Containment Council. Multivariate analysis used patient clinical,
   insurance and hospital characteristics to identify independent
   predictors of BiV in symptomatic HE patitents with EF <= 35%.
   Main Outcome Measures: Use of BiV in symptomatic HE patients with LV
   systolic dysfunction.
   Results: BiV was implanted in 2,065/15,861(13%) Whites, 182/3107(5.9%)
   African Americans and 175/1301(13.5%) others. Older age, male sex,
   intraventricular conduction delay and prior myocardial infarction or
   bypass surgery (all P<.001) were positively associated with BiV while
   diabetes (P<.01), higher EF or higher Mediqual (TM) Atlas severity score
   (both P<.0001) were negatively associated with BiV. Adjusting for these
   variables, African American ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] .56, 95%
   CI,.46-68, P<.0001) and poverty, comparing the poorest quintile to other
   quintiles (OR .86, 95% Cl, .76-98, P<.02), were associated with less
   BiV, independent of fixed effects of hospitals (P<.0001) and a positive
   association of BiV with Medicare vs Medicaid (P<.01).
   Conclusions: In a large statewide sample, BiV was implanted less
   frequently in African Americans and in lower-income patients,
   independent of clinical, hospital and insurance characteristics,
   identifying persisting disparities in use of advanced cardiac
   technology.

PY 2013
AB Background: Hepatectomy is an accepted standard of care for patients
   with resectable colorectal liver metastases (CLM). Given that it is
   unclear whether disparities exist between different patient populations,
   a population-based analysis was performed to analyze this issue with
   regards to resection rates and surgical mortality in patients with CLM.
   Methods: Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, characteristics and
   outcomes of adult patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer and
   colorectal metastases that subsequently underwent a liver resection
   during the years 1993-2007 were identified.
   Multivariate analysis was used to determine the effects of demographic
   and clinical covariables on resection rates and in-hospital mortality,
   Results: Incident colorectal and liver metastases were identified in
   138,565 patients; 3,528 patients (2.6%) underwent subsequent resection.
   African American and Hispanic race were associated with lower resection
   rates compared to Caucasian patients (adjusted OR 0.61 (0.52 - 0.71) and
   0.81 (0.68 - 0.96) respectively). Medicaid insurance was associated with
   decreased resection rates compared to private insurance (AOR 0.47 (0.40
   - 0.56)). The overall inpatient mortality rate was 3.1%. Multivariate
   analysis determined that mortality rate was correlated to both insurance
   status and geographic region.
   Conclusions: The national resection rate is significantly lower than has
   been reported by most case series. Race and insurance status appear to
   be correlated to the likelihood of surgical resection. In-hospital
   mortality is equivalent to the rates reported elsewhere, but is
   correlated to Insurance status and region.

AB Background: The benefits of racial/ethnic physician-patient concordance
   have been cited to support increasing the number of minority pysicians.
   Few studies have examined the rates at which physicians of different
   race/ethnicity groups or specialties see concordant visits. We aim to
   determine wheather differences exist in rates at which physicians of
   different race/ethnicity groups and physician specialties see visits by
   patients of concordant race/ethnicity.
   Methods: We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,
   2001-2006, a nationally representative survey of visits to private
   physician's offices. For physicians of each race/ethnicity group, the
   percentage of visits by patients in each race/ethnicity group was
   calculated. A concordant visit was defined as one in which a physician
   in a particular race/ethnicity group saw a patient of the same
   race/ethnicity group. Concordance rates were calculated overall, and for
   visits to primary care, medical specialties, and surgical specialties
   individually.
   Results: White physicians see a higher percentage of concordant visits
   than any other race/ethnicity of physician (84.3% p<0.001 vs. all
   others). followed by Hispanic physicians and non-Hispanic black
   physicians, who had statistically similar rates (50.0%, and 46.8%,
   p<0.05 for comparision). with non-Hispanic Asian physicians having the
   lowest rate of concordant visits (14.5%, p<0.001 vs. all others).
   Minority surgical and medical specialists have significantly lower rates
   of concordant visits (33.4% and 33.6% respectively) compared to minority
   primary care physicians (49.5%, p<0.001 for both comparisions).
   Conclusion: Concordance rates from the physician perspective differ by
   physician race/ethnicity and by physician specialty.

AB Objectives: Gender- and ethnicity-specific groups face different risks
   for obesity, but little is understood about the factors that predict
   group-specific risks. We evaluated individual and neighborhood factors,
   in relation to obesity.
   Design: Cross-sectional surveys of adults (ages 18-100 years) from
   southeastern Pennsylvania were analyzed. Individual- and
   neighborhood-level factors were included in fully-adjusted regression
   models to estimate relationships with obesity for specific gender-ethnic
   groups. The study included 679 Asian women, 655 Asian men, 4190
   African-American women, 1568 African-American men, 1248 Hispanic women,
   586 Hispanic men, 11791 European American women, and 6547 European
   American men.
   Results: There were significant differences in the predictors of obesity
   by gender-ethnic groups. Obesity was differentially associated with age
   (p<0.001, positively associated with middle age in African-American men
   and in all women except Asian; positively associated with older age in
   European American women but inversely in African-American men and
   European American men), employment (p<0.01, positively associated in
   African-American men and European American men) and poverty (p<0.001,
   positively associated in Asian men, African-American women, and European
   American women). Reporting good/excellent health was differentially
   associated with less obesity (p<0.01, no association for
   African-American men and Asians). Interestingly, neighborhood-level
   effects, however, did not differ significantly by gender-ethnic group.
   Inverse neighborhood effects on obesity prevalence were observed in most
   groups for higher neighborhood education and family income. Direct
   associations with obesity were observed for neighborhood poverty and
   neighborhood smoking.
   Conclusions: We observed that individual- and neighborhood-level
   variables are associated with obesity. Several individual-level effects
   differ by gender-ethnic group.

   theory and data models. A theory model shows relationships and their
   logical implications that structure a cultural idea system. A data model
   expresses patterning found in ethnographic observations regarding the
   behavioral implementation of cultural idea systems. An example of this
   duality for modeling cultural idea systems is illustrated with Arabic
   proverbs that structurally link friend and enemy as concepts through a
   culturally defined computational system. Computational systems also
   generate new concepts, as will be illustrated through a theory model for
   the structure of a kinship terminology system. This examples accounts
   for what otherwise appears to be an anomaly in the terminology thereby
   illustrating the constructive role that modeling of cultural constructs
   can play in ethnographic research.Language is ... a symbolic,

AB Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that
   affects social behavior and language acquisition. ASD exhibits great
   variability in outcomes, with some individuals remaining nonverbal and
   others exhibiting average or above average function. Cognitive ability
   contributes to heterogeneity in autism and serves as a modest predictor
   of later function. We show that a brain measure (event-related
   potentials, ERPs) of word processing in children with ASD, assessed at
   the age of 2 years (N = 24), is a broad and robust predictor of
   receptive language, cognitive ability, and adaptive behavior at ages 4
   and 6 years, regardless of the form of intensive clinical treatment
   during the intervening years. The predictive strength of this brain
   measure increases over time, and exceeds the predictive strength of a
   measure of cognitive ability, used here for comparison. These findings
   have theoretical implications and may eventually lead to neural measures
   that allow early prediction of developmental outcomes as well as more
   individually tailored clinical interventions, with the potential for
   greater effectiveness in treating children with ASD.

AB Understanding the linkages between ecosystem services (ES) and human

   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) provided a state-of-the-art
   synthesis of such knowledge. However, due to the complexity of the
   linkages between ES and HWB, there are still many knowledge gaps, and in
   particular a lack of quantitative indicators and integrated models based
   on the MA framework. To fill some of these research needs, we developed
   a quantitative index system to measure HWB, and assessed the impacts of
   an external driver - the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake - on HWB. Our results
   suggest that our proposed index system of HWB is well-designed, valid
   and could be useful for better understanding the linkages between ES and
   HWB. The earthquake significantly affected households' well-being in our
   demonstration sites. Such impacts differed across space and across the
   five dimensions of the sub-index (i.e., the basic material for good
   life, security, health, good social relations, and freedom of choice and
   action). Since the conceptual framework is based on the generalizable MA
   framework, our methods should also be applicable to other study areas.

AB Background: Socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors in
   childhood have been linked with cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood;
   however the mechanisms underlying these observed associations and the
   timing of their emergence are unclear. The aim of this review was to
   evaluate research that examined relationships between socioeconomic
   disadvantage and other social stressors in relation to less-studied
   cardiometabolic risk factors among youth, including carbohydrate
   metabolism-related factors, lipids, and central adiposity.
   Methods: We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Science to identify relevant
   publications between 2001 and 2013. Studies were selected based on 4
   criteria: (1) the study examined an association between at least one
   social or economic stressor and one relevant outcome prior to age 21;
   (2) the sample originated from a high-income country; (3) the sample was
   not selected based on a health condition; and (4) a central aim was to
   evaluate the effect of the social or economic stressor on at least one
   relevant outcome. Abstracts were screened and relevant publications were
   obtained and evaluated for inclusion criteria. We abstracted data from
   selected articles, summarized them by exposures and outcomes, and
   assigned an evidence grade.
   Results: Our search identified 37 publications from 31 studies.
   Socioeconomic disadvantage was consistently associated with greater
   central adiposity. Research to date does not provide clear evidence of
   an association between childhood stressors and lipids or carbohydrate
   metabolism-related factors.
   Conclusions: This review demonstrates a paucity of research on the
   relationship of socioeconomic disadvantage and other social stressors to
   lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related factors in youth. Accordingly,
   it is not possible to form strong conclusions, particularly with regard
   to stressors other than socioeconomic disadvantage. Findings are used to
   inform priorities for future research. An improved understanding of
   these pathways is critical for identifying novel prevention targets and
   intervention opportunities to protect the long-term health of children
   and adolescents.

   Design: Cross-sectional analysis of 5,087 respondents to the Health

   sample of US adults. Multivariate regression models were computed to
   assess the association between quartiles of TV viewing and BMI,
   stratified by race/ethnicity, educational attainment, employment and
   health insurance status.
   Results: Findings indicate that increased TV viewing was associated with
   higher odds for being overweight/obese in the entire sample, while
   adjusting for physical activity and other confounders. After
   stratification by race/ethnicity, increased odds for overweight/obesity
   in the 3rd and 4th quartiles of TV viewing (e.g., 3rd
   quartile-cumulative OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.07-1.92) was observed in
   non-Hispanic whites, with statistical significance. In non-Hispanic
   blacks and Hispanics, the odds were similar to whites, but did not reach
   statistical significance. Significant relations between greater TV

AB Objective: We examined associations between neighborhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage, perceived neighborhood safety and cardiometabolic risk
   factors, adjusting for health behaviors and socioeconomic status (SES)
   among African Americans.
   Methods: Study participants were non-diabetic African Americans (n =
   3,909) in the baseline examination (2000-2004) of the Jackson Heart
   Study. We measured eight risk factors: the metabolic syndrome, its five
   components, insulin resistance and cardiovascular inflammation. We
   assessed neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage with US Census 2000
   data. We assessed perceived neighborhood safety, health behaviors and
   SES via survey. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate
   associations with a random intercept model for neighborhood effects.
   Results: After adjustment for health behaviors and SES, neighborhood
   socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with the metabolic syndrome in
   women (PR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01, 1.27). Lack of perceived safety was
   associated with elevated glucose (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.03, 1.80) and waist
   circumference (PR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02, 1.11) among women, and with
   elevated glucose (PR 1.30, 95% CI 1.02, 1.66) and insulin resistance (PR
   1.25, 95% CI 1.08, 1.46) among men.
   Conclusions: Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and perceived
   safety should be considered as targets for intervention to reduce
   cardiometabolic risks among African Americans.

   Objective: The objective of this study was to translate, culturally
   adapt and validate the Simple Shoulder Test into Brazilian Portuguese.
   Also we test the stability of factor analysis across different cultures.
   Methods: The Simple Shoulder Test was translated from English into
   Brazilian Portuguese, translated back into English, and evaluated for
   accuracy by an expert committee. It was then administered to 100
   patients with shoulder conditions. Psychometric properties were analyzed
   including factor analysis, internal reliability, test-retest reliability
   at seven days, and construct validity in relation to the Short Form 36
   health survey (SF-36).
   Results: Factor analysis demonstrated a three factor solution.
   Cronbach's alpha was 0.82. Test-retest reliability index as measured by
   intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.84. Associations were
   observed in the hypothesized direction with all subscales of SF-36
   questionnaire.
   Conclusion: The Simple Shoulder Test translation and cultural adaptation
   to Brazilian-Portuguese demonstrated adequate factor structure, internal
   reliability, and validity, ultimately allowing for its use in the
   comparison with international patient samples.

AB Early psychosocial deprivation can negatively impact the development of
   executive functions (EFs). Here we explore the impact of early
   psychosocial deprivation on behavioral and physiological measures (i.e.,
   event-related potentials; ERPs) of two facets of EF, inhibitory control
   and response monitoring, and their associations with internalizing and
   externalizing outcomes in the Bucharest Early Intervention Project
   (BEIP; Zeanah et al., 2003). This project focuses on two groups of
   children placed in institutions shortly after birth and then randomly
   assigned in infancy to either a foster care intervention or to remain in
   their current institutional setting. A group of community controls was
   recruited for comparison. The current study assesses these children at
   8-years of age examining the effects of early adversity, the potential
   effects of the intervention on EF and the role of EF skills in
   socio-emotional outcomes. Results reveal exposure to early psychosocial
   deprivation was associated with impaired inhibitory control on a flanker
   task. Children in the foster care intervention exhibited better response
   monitoring compared to children who remained in the institution on the
   error-related positivity (Pe). Moreover, among children in the foster
   care intervention those who exhibited larger error-related negativity
   (ERN) responses had lower levels of socio-emotional behavior problems.
   Overall, these data identify specific aspects of EF that contribute to
   adaptive and maladaptive socio-emotional outcomes among children
   experiencing early psychosocial deprivation.

AB Our preferences are influenced by what other people like, but depend
   critically on how we feel about those people, a classical psychological
   effect called "cognitive balance." Here, we manipulated preferences for
   goods by telling participants the preferences of strongly liked or
   disliked groups of other people. Participants' preferences converged to
   those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group.
   Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) tracked the
   discrepancy between one's own preference and its social ideal and was
   associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away
   from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study
   found overlapping activation in this same region of dmPFC with negative
   monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by
   response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in
   long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits dmPFC and that
   may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance.

AB Low body mass index (BMI) at the time of enrollment into HIV care has
   been shown to be a strong predictor of mortality independent of CD4
   count. This study investigated socio-demographic associations with
   underweight (BMI < 18.5) among adults in Nyanza Province, Kenya, upon
   enrollment into HIV care. BMI, socio-demographic, and health data from a
   cross-sectional sample of 8254 women and 3533 men were gathered upon
   enrollment in the Family AIDS Care and Education Services (FACES)
   program in Nyanza Province, Kenya, between January 2005 and March 2010.
   Overall, 27.4% of adults were underweight upon enrollment in HIV care.
   Among each women [W] and men [M], being underweight was associated with
   younger age (W: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.90; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.85-4.55; M: AOR, 5.87; 95% CI, 2.80-12.32 for those aged 15-19
   compared to 50 years old), less education (W: AOR, 2.92; 95% CI,
   1.83-4.65; M: AOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04-2.31 for primary education
   compared to some college/university), low CD4 count (W: AOR, 2.13; 95%
   CI, 1.50-3.03; M: AOR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.76-2.70 for 0-250 compared to 750

   CI, 0.89-3.33; M: AOR, 9.78; 95% CI, 1.26-75.73 for poor compared to
   excellent). Among all enrollees to HIV care, low BMI was associated with
   male gender, lower educational attainment, younger age, and poor
   self-reported health. HIV care and treatment programs should consider
   using socio-demographic and health risk factors associated with low BMI
   to target and recruit patients with the goal of preventing late

AB Despite the increased interest in HIV/AIDS stigma and its negative
   effects on the health and social support of people living with HIV/AIDS
   (PLWHA), little attention has been given to its assessment among Latino
   gay/ bisexual men and transgender women (GBT) living with HIV/AIDS. The
   purpose of this paper is twofold: to develop a multidimensional
   assessment of HIV/AIDS stigma for Latino GBT living with HIV/AIDS, and
   to test whether such stigma is related to self-esteem, safe sex
   self-efficacy, social support, and alcohol, and drug use. The sample
   included 170 HIV+ Latino GBT persons. The results revealed three
   dimensions of stigma: internalized, perceived, and enacted HIV/AIDS
   stigma. Enacted HIV/AIDS stigma comprised two domains: generalized and
   romantic and sexual. Generalized enacted HIV/AIDS stigma was related to
   most outcomes. Internalized HIV/AIDS stigma mediated the associations
   between generalized enacted HIV/AIDS stigma and self-esteem and safe sex
   self-efficacy. In addition, romantic and sexual enacted HIV/AIDS stigma
   significantly predicted drug use. Perceived HIV/AIDS stigma was not
   associated with any outcome. These findings expand the understanding of
   the multidimensionality of stigma and the manner in which various
   features impact marginalized PLWHA.

AB The probability distribution of number of ties of an individual in a

   distribution arises has not been conclusively demonstrated in direct
   analyses of people's actions in social networks. Here, we perform a
   causal inference analysis and find an underlying cause for this
   phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that heavy-tailed degree distribution
   is causally determined by similarly skewed distribution of human
   activity. Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random -
   following a "maximum entropy attachment" model - except for its mean
   value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users'
   activity. This relation cannot be explained by interactive models, like
   preferential attachment, since the observed actions are not likely to be
   caused by interactions with other people.

AB Some researchers have proposed that natural selection has given rise in
   humans to one or more adaptations for altruistically punishing on behalf
   of other individuals who have been treated unfairly, even when the
   punisher has no chance of benefiting via reciprocity or benefits to kin.
   However, empirical support for the altruistic punishment hypothesis
   depends on results from experiments that are vulnerable to potentially
   important experimental artefacts. Here, we searched for evidence of
   altruistic punishment in an experiment that precluded these artefacts.
   In so doing, we found that victims of unfairness punished transgressors,
   whereas witnesses of unfairness did not. Furthermore, witnesses'
   emotional reactions to unfairness were characterized by envy of the
   unfair individual's selfish gains rather than by moralistic anger
   towards the unfair behaviour. In a second experiment run independently
   in two separate samples, we found that previous evidence for altruistic
   punishment plausibly resulted from affective forecasting error-that is,
   limitations on humans' abilities to accurately simulate how they would
   feel in hypothetical situations. Together, these findings suggest that
   the case for altruistic punishment in humans-a view that has gained
   increasing attention in the biological and social sciences-has been
   overstated.

AB As in biological evolution, multiple forces are involved in cultural
   evolution. One force is analogous to selection, and acts on differences
   in the fitness of aspects of culture by influencing who people choose to
   learn from. Another force is analogous to mutation, and influences how
   culture changes over time owing to errors in learning and the effects of
   cognitive biases. Which of these forces need to be appealed to in
   explaining any particular aspect of human cultures is an open question.
   We present a study that explores this question empirically, examining
   the role that the cognitive biases that influence cultural transmission
   might play in universals of colour naming. In a large-scale laboratory
   experiment, participants were shown labelled examples from novel
   artificial systems of colour terms and were asked to classify other
   colours on the basis of those examples. The responses of each
   participant were used to generate the examples seen by subsequent
   participants. By simulating cultural transmission in the laboratory, we
   were able to isolate a single evolutionary force-the effects of
   cognitive biases, analogous to mutation-and examine its consequences.
   Our results show that this process produces convergence towards systems
   of colour terms similar to those seen across human languages, providing
   support for the conclusion that the effects of cognitive biases, brought
   out through cultural transmission, can account for universals in colour
   naming.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance among the homeless is not supported by

   Texas. The average incidence per 100 000 was 411 among homeless and 9.5
   among housed persons. The homeless were more likely than the housed to
   be US-born, clustered, and in a larger-sized cluster. Multivariate
   analysis revealed that TB rates among the homeless were driven not by
   comorbidities but by social determinants. Homeless patients were
   hospitalized more days than the housed and required more follow-up time.
   Reporting of TB rates for populations with known health disparities

AB Objectives. We examined the effectiveness of peer ethnography to gain
   insider views on substance use and sex among a diverse range of
   high-risk substance-using Black and Latino young men who have sex with
   men.
   Methods. We recruited 9 peer ethnographers aged 21 to 24 years from
   youth programs for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community
   in Los Angeles, California, and trained them in ethnography, study
   protocol, and human participant protection. Peer ethnographers collected
   137 single-spaced pages of field notes in 2009 and 2010 derived from
   observation of 150 members of the target population.
   Results. Peer ethnography revealed local language and phrasing and
   provided a window into new and different social contexts. Peers provided
   valuable information on current trends in substance use, revealing
   themes that needed to be addressed in further research, such as the use
   of substances during sex to "clock coin" (exchange sex for money and
   substances). These data enabled us to refine our recruitment strategies
   and ask more culturally relevant questions in a later phase of the
   study.
   Conclusions. The peer ethnography method can provide a sound basis for
   further research phases in multistage studies on numerous other social
   issues and with other hard-to-reach populations.

AB Objectives. I examined how sexual minority status, as indicated by sex
   of sexual partners, is associated with self-rated health and how
   socioeconomic status suppresses and age and sex moderate this
   association.
   Methods. I used multinomial logistic regression to analyze aggregated
   data from the 1991 to 2010 General Social Survey, a population-based
   data set (n = 13 480).
   Results. Respondents with only different-sex partners or with any
   same-sex partners reported similar levels of health. With socioeconomic
   status added to the model, respondents with any same-sex partners
   reported worse health than those with only different-sex partners, but
   only if sexual intercourse with same-sex partners occurred in the
   previous 5 years. Age and sex moderated this relationship: having any
   same-sex partners was associated with worse health for women but not men
   and among younger adults only.
   Conclusions. The relationship between sexual minority status and
   self-rated health varies across sociodemographic groups. Future research
   should use population-level data to examine other health outcomes and
   continue to explore how the intersection of sexual minority status and
   other sociodemographic indicators shapes health.

   social factors with unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among young men
   who have sex with men in New York City.
   Methods. Using baseline assessment data from 592 young men who have sex
   with men participating in an ongoing prospective cohort study, we
   conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the
   associations between covariates and likelihood of recently engaging in
   UAI with same-sex partners.
   Results. Nineteen percent reported recent UAI with a same-sex partner.
   In multivariable models, being in a current relationship with another
   man (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 4.87), an arrest history (AOR = 2.01),
   greater residential instability (AOR = 1.75), and unstable housing or
   homelessness (AOR = 3.10) was associated with recent UAI. Although high
   levels of gay community affinity and low internalized homophobia were
   associated with engaging in UAI in bivariate analyses, these
   associations did not persist in multivariable analyses.
   Conclusions. Associations of psychosocial and socially produced
   conditions with UAI among a new generation of young men who have sex
   with men warrant that HIV prevention programs and policies address
   structural factors that predispose sexual risk behaviors.

AB Objectives. We determined the acceptability, participants' receptivity,
   and effectiveness of a culturally adapted version of Real Men Are Safe
   (REMAS-CA), an HIV prevention intervention for men in substance abuse
   treatment.
   Methods. In 2010 and 2011, we compared participants who attended at
   least 1 (of 5) REMAS-CA session (n = 66) with participants in the
   original REMAS study (n = 136). Participants completed an assessment
   battery at baseline and at 3-month follow-up with measures of substance
   abuse, HIV risk behaviors, perceived condom barriers, and demographics.
   We conducted postintervention focus groups at each clinic.
   Results. Minority REMAS-CA participants were more likely to have
   attended 3 or more sessions (87.0%), meeting our definition of
   intervention completion, than were minority participants in the REMAS
   study (75.1%; odds ratio = 2.1). For REMAS-CA participants with casual
   partners (n = 25), the number of unprotected sexual occasions in the
   past 90 days declined (6.2 vs 1.6). Among minority men in the REMAS
   study (n = 36), the number of unprotected sexual occasions with casual
   partners changed little (9.4 vs 8.4; relative risk = 4.56).
   Conclusions. REMAS-CA was effective across ethnic groups, a benefit for
   HIV risk reduction programs that serve a diverse clientele.

AB Objectives. We examined the association between neighborhood
   incarceration rate and asthma prevalence and morbidity among New York
   City adults.
   Methods. We used multilevel modeling techniques and data from the New
   York City Community Health Survey (2004) to analyze the association
   between neighborhood incarceration rate and asthma prevalence, adjusting
   for individual-level sociodemographic, behavioral, and environmental
   characteristics. We examined interactions between neighborhood
   incarceration rate, respondent incarceration history, and
   race/ethnicity.
   Results. The mean neighborhood rate of incarceration was 5.4% (range =
   2.1%-12.8%). Neighborhood incarceration rate was associated with
   individual-level asthma prevalence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.10) in unadjusted models but not
   after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (OR = 1.01; 95% CI
   = 0.98, 1.04). This association did not differ according to respondent
   race/ethnicity.
   Conclusions. Among New York City adults, the association between
   neighborhood incarceration rate and asthma prevalence is explained by
   the sociodemographic composition of neighborhoods and disparities in
   asthma prevalence at the individual level. Public health practitioners
   should further engage with criminal justice professionals and
   correctional health care providers to target asthma outreach efforts
   toward both correctional facilities and neighborhoods with high rates of
   incarceration.

AB Ten early Upper Paleolithic layers in Ucagizli Cave I(41-29 uncalibrated
   ky BP) on the Hatay coast of southern Turkey preserve a rich and varied
   record of early Upper Paleolithic life, including the production and use
   of large numbers of shell ornaments. This study examines shell bead
   production, use, and discard in relation to site function and the
   diversity of on-site human activities. Four factors are expected to
   contribute to variation in the ornament assemblages, one environmental
   and three behavioral. The behavioral factors relate to winnowing for
   quality as a function of distance from the raw material source, changes
   in the size of user groups, and symbol standardization. The accumulation
   rates for shell beads, bones, and stone tools paralleled one another
   through time, indicating that ornament discard followed the pulse of
   daily life at this site. All stages of manufacture and use are well
   represented in each assemblage, and half or more of the ornaments show
   evidence of extended use. Changes in the local marine environment do not
   explain much of the variation in the assemblages, pointing instead to
   behavioral causes. The richness of shell types that were collected as
   raw material correlates to greater exploitation of edible marine
   shellfish and greater occupation intensity. Much of this variation in
   the ornament raw material was eliminated during the manufacture stage,
   almost certainly reflecting the influence of cultural norms. A focus on
   basket-shaped shells changed remarkably little over thousands of years,
   despite significant changes in other domains of technology. This last
   result suggests that beads were the most irreducible and conservative
   elements of more complex design traditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB This Special Issue of Evolutionary Anthropology grew out of a symposium
   at the 2012 Society for American Archaeology (SAA) meeting in Memphis,
   Tennessee (April 18-22). The goal of the symposium was to explore what
   we will argue is one of the most important and promising opportunities
   in the global archeological enterprise. In late prehistoric North
   America, the initial rise of cultures of strikingly enhanced complexity
   and the local introduction of a novel weapon technology, the bow,
   apparently correlate intimately in a diverse set of independent cases
   across the continent, as originally pointed out by Blitz. If this
   empirical relationship ultimately proves robust, it gives us an
   unprecedented opportunity to evaluate hypotheses for the causal
   processes producing social complexity and, by extension, to assess the
   possibility of a universal theory of history. The rise of comparably
   complex cultures was much more recent in North America than it was
   elsewhere and the resulting fresher archeological record is relatively
   well explored. These and other features make prehistoric North America a
   unique empirical environment. Together, the symposium and this issue
   have brought together outstanding investigators with both empirical and
   theoretical expertise. The strong cross-feeding and extended
   interactions between these investigators have given us all the
   opportunity to advance the promising exploration of what we call the
   North American Neolithic transitions. Our goal in this paper is to
   contextualize this issue.

AB Bingham and Souza have presented an evolutionary theory that specifies a
   causal relationship between the advent of powerful projectile weapons
   such as the bow and radical rearrangements in social relations and
   histories. They propose that the acquisition of weapons that permitted
   humans to kill at ever-increasing distances provided the coercive means
   to suppress conflicts of interest among nonkin, self-interested
   individuals in social groups, thus paving the way for greater social
   complexity. An unprecedented reduction in projectile point size
   identifies the arrival of the bow ca. A.D. 300 in the Eastern Woodlands
   of North America, which initiated a causal chain of cultural changes. In
   the Midwest, the bow, combined with food production, precipitated the
   decline of Hopewell by conferring household autonomy and dispersal,
   which at first suppressed social complexity, but later created
   conditions favorable to maize intensification. In the lower Southeast,
   where food production was unimportant, populations aggregated at
   concentrated wild-food sources, and the bow did not confer household
   autonomy. The relationship between the bow and social complexity varied
   under different environmental, social, and historical conditions.

AB As recently as the 1980s, archeologists focusing on prehistoric eastern
   North America paid little attention to intergroup conflict. Today the
   situation is quite different, as indicated by this Special Issue.
   Archeologists now face three principal challenges: to document the
   temporal and spatial distribution of evidence of conflict; to identify
   the cultural and environmental conditions associated with variation in
   the nature and frequency of warfare over long periods of time and large
   geographical areas; and to determine the extent to which intergroup
   tensions contributed to or resulted from changes in sociopolitical
   complexity, economic systems, and population size and distribution. We
   present data from habitation and mortuary sites in the Eastern
   Woodlands, notably the midcontinent, that touch on all three issues.
   Palisaded sites and victims of attacks indicate the intensity of
   conflicts varied over time and space. Centuries-long intervals of either
   high or low intergroup tensions can be attributed to an intensification
   or relaxation of pressure on resources that arose in several ways, such
   as changes in local population density; technological innovations,
   including subsistence practices; and the natural environment.

AB The evolution of sociopolitical complexity, including heightened
   relations of cooperation and competition among large nonkin groups, has
   long been a central focus of anthropological research. Anthropologists
   suggest any number of variables that affect the waxing and waning of
   complexity and define the precise trajectories that groups take,
   including population density, subsistence strategies, warfare, the
   distribution of resources, and trade relationships. Changes in weaponry,
   here the introduction of the bow and arrow, can have profound
   implications for population aggregation and density, subsistence and
   settlement strategies, and access to resources, trade, and
   warfare.Bingham and Souza provide a general conceptual model for the
   relationship between complexity and the bow and arrow, arguing that this
   compound weapon system, whereby smaller projectiles travel at higher
   speed and are capable of hitting targets more accurately and at greater
   distances than hand-thrown darts, fundamentally favors the formation of
   larger groups because it allows for cost-effective means of dealing with
   conflicts of interest through social coercion, thereby dramatically
   transforming kin-based social relations. Here we consider the impacts
   the introduction of the bow and arrow had on sociopolitical complexity
   in the North American Southwest.

AB The bow more than doubled, likely tripled, the success of individuals
   bent on killing animal or human targets (Box ). The advent of this
   revolutionary technology generated different responses in western North
   America depending on subsistence and sociopolitical organization at the
   time of its arrival, roughly 2300 - 1300 B.P. Its effect was substantial
   in California and the Great Basin, particularly on group size, which in
   many places diminished as a consequence of the bow's reliability. The
   counter-intuitive result was to increase within group-relatedness enough
   to encourage intensification of plant resources, previously considered
   too costly. The bow rose to greatest direct economic importance with the
   arrival of the horse, and was put to most effective use by former Great
   Basin groups who maintained the family band system that had developed
   around intensive Great Basin plant procurement, adapting the same
   organization to a lifestyle centered on the equestrian pursuit of
   buffalo and warfare.

AB Bow and arrow technology spread across California between approximate to
   AD 250 and 1200, first appearing in the intermountain deserts of the
   Great Basin and later spreading to the coast. We critically evaluate the
   available data for the initial spread in bow and arrow technology and
   examine its societal effects on the well-studied Northern Channel
   Islands off the coast of Southern California. The introduction of this
   technology to these islands between AD 650 and 900 appears to predate
   the appearance of hereditary inequality between AD 900 and 1300. We
   conclude, based on the available data, that this technology did not
   immediately trigger intergroup warfare. We argue that the introduction
   of the bow and arrow contributed to sociopolitical instabilities that
   were on the rise within the context of increasing population levels and
   unstable climatic conditions, which stimulated intergroup conflict and
   favored the development of hereditary inequality. Population aggregation
   and economic intensification did occur with the introduction of the bow
   and arrow. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that
   social coercion via intra-group law enforcement contributed to changes
   in societal scale that ultimately resulted in larger groups that were
   favored in inter-group conflict. We argue that the interplay between
   intra-group law enforcement and inter-group warfare were both essential
   for the ultimate emergence of social inequality between AD 900 and 1300.

AB This paper has several interconnected goals. First and most generally,
   we will review the project represented by the papers in this dedicated
   issue and the SAA Symposium (2012) on Social Complexity and the Bow.
   This project centers on the ever-stronger and broader theory testing now
   becoming feasible in archeology and anthropology, in this case
   exploiting the unique natural laboratory represented by what we refer to
   as the North American Neolithic transitions. Second, we will strive to
   synopsize the papers in this issue as opportunities to falsify two
   general theories of the cause of increases in social complexity
   associated with the North American Neolithic: warfare and social
   coercion theories.1 We argue that, though much work remains to be done,
   the current evidence supports one of the central predictions of both
   these theories, that the local arrival of elite bow technology was a
   central driver of local transitions to increased social complexity. This
   conclusion, if ultimately verified, has profound implications for the
   possibility of general theories of history. Third, we will argue that
   several important details of this evidence falsify warfare theory and
   support (fail to falsify) social coercion theory (the authors' favored
   perspective). Moreover, several potential falsifications of social
   coercion theory are amenable to alternative interpretations, leading to
   new falsifiable predictions. Finally, we discuss how interactions with
   our colleagues in this project produced new insights into several
   details of the predictions of social coercion theory, improving our
   interpretative capacity.

AB Online social networking usage is growing rapidly, especially among
   at-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). However,
   little research has studied the relationship between online social
   networking usage and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk populations.
   One hundred and eighteen Facebook-registered MSM (60.1% Latino, 28%
   African American; 11.9% other) were recruited from online (social
   networking websites and banner advertisements) and offline (local
   clinics, restaurants and organizations) venues frequented by minority
   MSM. Inclusion criteria required participants to be men who were 18
   years of age or older, had had sex with a man in the past 12 months,
   were living in Los Angeles, and had a Facebook account. Participants
   completed an online survey on their social media usage and sexual risk
   behaviors. Results from a multivariable regression suggest that number
   of sexual partners met from online social networking technologies is
   associated with increased: 1) likelihood of having exchanged sex for
   food, drugs, or a place to stay within the past 3 months; 2) number of
   new partners within the past 3 months; 3) number of male sex partners
   within the past 3 months; and 4) frequency of engaging in oral sex
   within the past 3 months, controlling for age, race, education, and
   total number of sexual partners. Understanding the relationship between
   social media sex-seeking and sexual risk behaviors among at-risk
   populations will help inform population-focused HIV prevention and
   treatment interventions.

AB Benton County, in north-central Indiana, USA has successfully sited more
   than 500 turbines. To understand Benton County's acceptance of wind
   farms, a holistic case study was conducted that included a document
   review, a survey of local residents and interviews with key
   stakeholders. Survey questionnaires were sent to 750 residents asking
   questions about attitudes toward the wind farms, perceived benefits and
   impacts from the wind farms, environmental attitudes, and demographic
   information. Key stakeholders were also interviewed for a deeper
   understanding of the historical timeline and community acceptance of the
   wind farm development. While there is limited opposition to the
   turbines, on the whole the community presents a front of acceptance.
   Financial, rather than environmental, benefits are the main reason for
   the acceptance. Although significant in other case studies, transparency
   and participation do not play a large role in Benton County's
   acceptance. Most residents are not concerned with either visual impacts
   or noise from the wind turbines. More concrete benefits to the
   community, such as reduced energy bills for county residents, could help
   to extend acceptance even further within the community. Although there
   are concerns about the acceptance of wind farms and the impacts of those
   farms on local residents in both peer-reviewed literature and popular
   media, we found little evidence of those concerns in Benton County.
   Instead, we found Benton County to be a community largely accepting of
   wind farms.

   initiative was to eliminate health disparities. We evaluate trends in
   children vaccination coverage disparities by socio-demographic
   characteristics in the United States from 2001 through 2010.
   Methods: Disparities in vaccination coverage for the 4:3:1:3:3:1 vaccine
   series was assessed with National Immunization Survey (NIS) 2001-2010
   data. The disparities between two categories of population were
   independently evaluated yearly from 2001 through 2010.
   Results: In 2001, 10 out of 12 disparities were significant (P-value
   <0.05). Six disparities were reduced from statistically significant in
   2001 to not significant in 2010. Across 2001-2010,8 disparities narrowed
   significantly; the average change in disparities per year were negative
   and ranged from -0.30% to -0.64% (P-value <0.05).
   Conclusions: Significant success has been achieved in reducing
   disparities in vaccination coverage for young children among most of the
   major socio-demographic subpopulations in the United States by 2010.

   cultural tastes co-constitute each other in meaningful patterns and how
   these patterns reveal the racialized meanings of cultural objects. Using
   correspondence analysis, I identify taste clusters and then compare
   these patterns across three racial classification schemas in Brazil.
   Across all schemas, there is a distinction between blackness and
   whiteness in terms of the cultural tastes that constitute identities.
   This holds across symbols of national identity, foreign-influenced
   genres and Brazilian popular culture. The strength of underlying racial
   meaning offers a second axis of variation between strong' (primordial,
   fixed, strictly bounded) versus soft' (descriptive, ambiguous, porous)
   racial identities. Some symbols of national identity carry more
   primordially laden and invariable racial meaning than do others and thus
   associate with two distinct types of black identity.

AB Drawing from semistructured interviews with gay, celibate Christians or
   Side B individuals, I explore the emotion of desire. I specifically
   attend to these questions: How do Side Bs interpret and communicate
   feeling rules connected to desire? How do these individuals manage
   desire? How might feeling rules and conceptualizations of this feeling
   serve as an important source of boundary heightening? Finally, how might
   shared feeling rules create connection with others who do not identify
   as Side B? By attending to these questions, I illustrate the
   relationship between the conceptualization of an emotion and a set of
   feeling rules and emotion management strategies. I also highlight how
   such rules and strategies can serve as a source of boundary heightening,
   or alternatively, as a bridge between seemingly disparate groups.

AB Objectives: to investigate whether psychosocial pathways mediate the
   association between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and stroke.
   Methods: prospective cohort study with a follow-up of 11.5 years.
   Setting: the Cardiovascular Health Study, a longitudinal
   population-based cohort study of older adults >= 65 years.
   Measurements: the primary outcome was adjudicated incident ischaemic
   stroke. Neighbourhood socioeconomic status (NSES) was measured using a
   composite of six census-tract variables. Psychosocial factors were
   assessed with standard measures for depression, social support and
   social networks.
   Results: of the 3,834 white participants with no prior stroke, 548 had
   an incident ischaemic stroke over the 11.5-year follow-up. Among whites,
   the incident stroke hazard ratio (HR) associated with living in the
   lowest relative to highest NSES quartile was 1.32 (95% CI = 1.01-1.73),
   in models adjusted for individual SES. Additional adjustment for
   psychosocial factors had a minimal effect on hazard of incident stroke
   (HR = 1.31, CI = 1.00-1.71). Associations between NSES and stroke
   incidence were not found among African-Americans (n = 785) in either
   partially or fully adjusted models.
   Conclusions: psychosocial factors played a minimal role in mediating the
   effect of NSES on stroke incidence among white older adults.

AB Although socioeconomic position is conceptualized by social
   epidemiologists as a multidimensional construct, most research on
   socioeconomic disparities in health uses a limited set of observable
   indicators (e.g., educational attainment, household income, or
   occupational class) and typically analyzes and reports gradients in
   relation to one measure at a time. Societal changes in economic
   structures over time, however, can lead to changes in distributions of
   and associations between socioeconomic indicators, as has occurred with
   income returns to education in the United States over the last 50 years.
   Consequently, temporal comparisons of socioeconomic disparities from
   repeated cross-sectional surveys can be affected, particularly when
   salient dimensions of socioeconomic position are unobserved. We discuss
   this phenomenon within the framework of measurement error and identify
   sources of variation that can make identification of socioeconomic
   change difficult. Using simulations, we explore the utility of the
   quantile, slope index of inequality, and relative distribution
   approaches to minimizing bias in temporal comparisons and find that
   these methods yield correct inferences about temporal change only under
   limited conditions. We contrast these approaches with the use of an
   imputation model when validation data for the unobserved socioeconomic
   indicator exist. We discuss implications for analyzing changing
   socioeconomic health disparities over time.

AB Despite a revolution in therapeutics, the ability to control chronic
   diseases remains elusive. We present here a conceptual model of the
   potential role of behavioral tools in chronic disease control.
   Clinicians implicitly accept the assumption that patients will act
   rationally to maximize their self-interest. However, patients may not
   always be the rational actors that we imagine. Major behavioral barriers
   to optimal health behavior include patients' fear of threats to health,
   unwillingness to think about problems when risks are known or data are
   ambiguous, the discounting of risks that are far in the future, failure
   to act due to lack of motivation, insufficient confidence in the ability
   to overcome a health problem, and inattention due to pressures of
   everyday life. Financial incentives can stimulate initiation of
   health-promoting behaviors by reducing or eliminating financial
   barriers, but may not produce long-term behavior change without
   additional interventions. Strategies have been developed by behavioral
   economists and social psychologists to address each of these barriers to
   better decision-making. These include: labeling positive behaviors in
   ways consistent with patient life goals and priorities; greater focus on
   more immediate risks of chronic diseases; intermediate subgoals as steps
   to a large health goal; and implementation of specific plans as to when,
   where, and how an action will be taken. Such strategies hold promise for
   improving health behaviors and disease control, but most have not been
   studied in medical settings. The effectiveness of these approaches
   should be evaluated for their potential as tools for the clinician.

AB Military installations typically rely on noise complaints to indicate
   adverse noise environments and often restrict the firing of certain
   weapons to reduce the number of noise complaints. Using complaints in
   this manner may also imply that the absence of complaints is an
   indicator of low community annoyance. The relationship between
   individual complaints and general community annoyance, however, is
   currently not established, and it is unknown whether implementing
   restrictions in reaction to individual complaints is an appropriate or
   necessary way to reduce community annoyance. This paper looks at whether
   there are significant differences in reported annoyance to
   complaint-referenced blast events and general military noise annoyance
   between those who complain and their non-complaining neighbors. Those
   who complained were significantly more annoyed to both
   complaint-referenced blast events and general military noise in
   comparison to their non-complaining neighbors. The implications of these
   findings are discussed in terms of range management.

AB The evolution of social traits may not only depend on but also change
   the social structure of the population. In particular, the evolution of
   pairwise cooperation, such as biparental care, depends on the
   pair-matching distribution of the population, and the latter often
   emerges as a collective outcome of individual pair-bonding traits, which
   are also under selection. Here, we develop an analytical model and
   individual-based simulations to study the coevolution of long-term pair
   bonds and cooperation in parental care, where partners play a Snowdrift
   game in each breeding season. We illustrate that long-term pair bonds
   may coevolve with cooperation when bonding cost is below a threshold. As
   long-term pair bonds lead to assortative interactions through
   pair-matching dynamics, they may promote the prevalence of cooperation.
   In addition to the pay-off matrix of a single game, the evolutionarily
   stable equilibrium also depends on bonding cost and accidental divorce
   rate, and it is determined by a form of balancing selection because the
   benefit from pair-bond maintenance diminishes as the frequency of
   cooperators increases. Our findings highlight the importance of
   ecological factors affecting social bonding cost and stability in
   understanding the coevolution of social behaviour and social structures,
   which may lead to the diversity of biological social systems.

AB Objectives: The primary objective of the study was to assess whether the
   Availability, Responsiveness and Continuity (ARC) organizational
   intervention improved youth outcomes in community based mental health
   programs. The second objective was to assess whether programs with more
   improved organizational social contexts following the 18-month ARC
   intervention had better youth outcomes than programs with less improved
   social contexts. Method: Eighteen community mental health programs that
   serve youth between the ages of 5 and 18 were randomly assigned to ARC
   or control conditions. Clinicians (n = 154) in the participating
   programs completed the Organizational Social Context (OSC) measure at
   baseline and following the 18-month ARC organizational intervention.
   Caregivers of 393 youth who were served by the 18 programs (9 in ARC and
   9 in control) completed the Shortforrn Assessment for Children (SAC)
   once a month for six months beginning at intake. Results: Hierarchical
   linear models (HLM) analyses indicated that youth outcomes were
   significantly better in the programs that completed the 18 month ARC
   intervention. HLM analyses also showed that youth outcomes were best in
   the programs with the most improved organizational social contexts
   following the 18 month ARC intervention. Conclusions: Youth outcomes in
   community mental health programs can be improved with the ARC
   organizational intervention and outcomes are best in programs that make
   the most improvements in organizational social context. The
   relationships linking ARC, organizational social context, and youth
   outcomes suggest that service improvement efforts will be more
   successful if those efforts include strategies to improve the
   organizational social contexts in which the services are embedded. J.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of an early childhood,
   family-centered, school-based intervention on children's kindergarten
   academic achievement.
   METHODS: This was a cluster (school) randomized controlled trial with
   assessments from pre-kindergarten (pre-k) entry through the end of
   kindergarten. The setting was 10 public elementary schools with 26 pre-k
   classes in 2 school districts in urban disadvantaged neighborhoods
   serving a largely black, low-income population. Participants were 1050
   black and Latino, low-income children (age 4; 88% of pre-k population)
   enrolled in 10 schools over 4 years. Universal intervention aimed to
   promote self-regulation and early learning by strengthening positive
   behavior support and effective behavior management at home and school,
   and increasing parent involvement in education. Intervention included
   after-school group sessions for families of pre-k students (13 2-hour
   sessions; co-led by pre-k teachers) and professional development for
   pre-k and kindergarten teachers. The outcome measures were standardized
   test scores of kindergarten reading, writing, and math achievement by
   independent evaluators masked to intervention condition (primary
   outcome); developmental trajectories of teacher-rated academic
   performance from pre-k through kindergarten (secondary outcome).
   RESULTS: Relative to children in control schools, children in
   intervention schools had higher kindergarten achievement test scores
   (Cohen's d = 0.18, mean difference = 2.64, SE = 0.90, P = .03) and
   higher teacher-rated academic performance (Cohen's d = 0.25, mean
   difference = 5.65, SE = 2.34, P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood population-level intervention that enhances
   both home and school environments shows promise to advance academic
   achievement among minority children from disadvantaged, urban
   neighborhoods.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parents decide whether their children are
   vaccinated, but they rarely reach these decisions on their own. Instead
   parents are influenced by their social networks, broadly defined as the
   people and sources they go to for information, direction, and advice.
   This study used social network analysis to formally examine parents'
   social networks (people networks and source networks) related to their
   vaccination decision-making. In addition to providing descriptions of
   typical networks of parents who conform to the recommended vaccination
   schedule (conformers) and those who do not (nonconformers), this study
   also quantified the effect of network variables on parents' vaccination
   choices.
   METHODS: This study took place in King County, Washington. Participation
   was limited to US-born, first-time parents with children aged <= 18
   months. Data were collected via an online survey. Logistic regression
   was used to analyze the resulting data.
   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-six conformers and 70 nonconformers
   completed the survey. Although people networks were reported by 95% of
   parents in both groups, nonconformers were significantly more likely to
   report source networks (100% vs 80%, P < .001). Model comparisons of
   parent, people, and source network characteristics indicated that people
   network variables were better predictors of parents' vaccination choices
   than parents' own characteristics or the characteristics of their source
   networks. In fact, the variable most predictive of parents' vaccination
   decisions was the percent of parents' people networks recommending
   nonconformity.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that social networks, and
   particularly parents' people networks, play an important role in
   parents' vaccination decision-making.

AB Purpose Evaluating disparities in health care is an important aspect of
   understanding differences in disease risk. The purpose of this study is
   to describe the methodology for estimating such disparities, with
   application to a large multi-ethnic cohort study. Methods The
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis includes 6814 participants aged
   4584years free of cardiovascular disease. Prevalence ratio (PR)
   regression was used to model baseline lipid lowering medication (LLM) or
   anti-hypertensive medication use at baseline as a function of gender,
   race, risk factors, and estimated pre-treatment biomarker values.
   Results Hispanics and African Americans had lower prevalence of
   medication use than did non-Hispanic whites, even at the same risk
   factor profile. This became non-significant after adjusting for
   socioeconomic status. Although gender did not influence the prevalence
   of LLM use (PR=1.09, 95%CI 0.951.25), there were differences in the
   association of diabetes and HDL with LLM use by gender. Men were
   significantly less likely to be on anti-hypertensive medications than
   women (PR=0.86, 95%CI 0.800.92, p<0.001), and this was not explained by
   risk factors or socioeconomic status. Lack of health insurance strongly
   influenced medication use, controlling for risk factors and other
   markers of socioeconomic status. Conclusions Disparities exist in the
   treatment of cholesterol and hypertension. Hispanics and African
   Americans had less use of LLM; men had less use of anti-hypertensives.
   Risk factors have differential associations with medication use
   depending on gender. Methods described in this paper can provide
   improved disparity estimation in observational cohort studies. Copyright

AB Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among teens in the
   United States. Graduated driver licensing (GDL) programs allow new
   drivers to gain driving experience while protecting them from high-risk
   situations. North Dakota was one of the last states to implement GDL,
   and the current program does not meet all of the best practice
   recommendations. This study used qualitative techniques to explore
   parents' perceptions of the role teen driving plays in the daily lives
   of rural North Dakota families, their understanding of the risks faced
   by their novice teen drivers, and their support for GDL. A total of 28
   interviews with parents of teens aged 13-16 years were conducted in four
   separate rural areas of the state. During the face-to-face interviews,
   parents described their teens' daily lives as busy, filled with school,
   sports, and other activities that often required traveling considerable
   distances. Participation in school-sponsored sports and other
   school-related activities was highly valued. There was nearly unanimous
   support for licensing teens at age 14 1/2, as was permitted by law at
   the time of the interviews. Parents expressed that they were comfortable
   supervising their teen's practice driving, and few reported using
   resources to assist them in this role. Although few parents expressed
   concerns over nighttime driving, most parents supported a nighttime
   driving restriction with exemptions for school, work or sports-related
   activities. Despite many parents expressing concern over distracted
   driving, there was less consistent support among parents for passenger
   restrictions, especially if there would be no exemptions for family
   members or school activities. These findings can assist in planning
   policies and programs to reduce crashes among novice, teen drivers,
   while taking into account the unique perspectives and lifestyles of
   families living in rural North Dakota. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   National Violent Death Reporting System. The study focused on the
   sociodemographic and toxicological information of 59,384 male and female
   suicide decedents for 16 states of the United States. Acute alcohol
   intoxication was defined as having a blood alcohol content (BAC)
   0.08g/dl. Overall, 76% of decedents were tested for the presence of
   alcohol. Results The proportion of suicide decedents with a positive BAC
   ranged from 47% among American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIs/ANs) to 23%
   among Asians/Pacific Islanders (PIs). Average BAC was highest among
   AIs/ANs. Among those who were tested for BAC, the proportion of
   decedents legally intoxicated prior to suicide was as follows: Blacks,
   15%; AIs/ANs, 36%; Asians/PIs, 13%; and Hispanics, 28%. Bivariate
   associations showed that most suicide decedents who were legally
   intoxicated were male, younger than 30years of age, with a high school
   education, not married, nonveterans, lived in metropolitan areas, and
   used a firearm to complete suicide. However, with the exception of
   Whites, most of these associations became not statistically significant
   in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Alcohol use and legal intoxication
   prior to completing suicide are common among U.S. ethnic groups,
   especially among men and those who are younger than 30years of age. The
   AI/AN group had the highest mean BAC, the highest rate of legal
   intoxication and decedents who were particularly young. Suicide
   prevention strategies should address alcohol use as a risk factor.
   Alcohol problems prevention strategies should focus on suicide as a
   consequence of alcohol use, especially among AI/AN youth and young
   adults.

AB Background This paper examines the prevalence, the symptom profile, and
   the drinking and sociodemographic predictors of current (past 12months)
   DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence among Mexican Americans living along
   the U.S.Mexico border and those living in metropolitan areas away from
   the border. Methods Respondents in the non-border areas (primarily
   Houston and Los Angeles) constitute a multistage probability sample
   (N=1,288) of these areas, interviewed as part of the 2006 Hispanic
   Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS). Respondents in the border
   area (N=1,307) constitute a household probability sample of Mexican
   Americans living on the border. In both surveys, data were collected
   during computer-assisted interviews conducted in respondents' homes. The
   HABLAS and the border sample response rates were 76 and 67%,
   respectively. Results Although bivariate analyses revealed no overall
   differences between border and non-border locations, (negative) age
   trends were more pronounced on the border for male abuse and for
   dependence among both genders. Among females aged 18 to 29, border
   residence was linked to significantly higher rates of dependence. In
   multivariable analyses, the prevalence of male abuse declined more
   rapidly with age on the border than off the border. Other unique
   predictors of male abuse were Jewish/other religion and weekly volume of
   alcohol consumption. Being married or out of the workforce, attaining a
   higher education, having no religious preference, and weekly volume
   uniquely predicted female dependence. Age and weekly volume uniquely
   predicted male dependence. Conclusions The prevalence of alcohol use
   disorders among Mexican Americans on and off the U.S.Mexico border
   largely mirrors previously documented patterns of alcohol consumption in
   these areas. For young Mexican American women in particular, border
   residence is linked to heightened vulnerability to alcohol dependence.

AB The present research tested whether incidental exposure to money affects
   people's endorsement of social systems that legitimize social
   inequality. We found that subtle reminders of the concept of money,
   relative to nonmoney concepts, led participants to endorse more strongly
   the existing social system in the United States in general (Experiment
   1) and free-market capitalism in particular (Experiment 4), to assert
   more strongly that victims deserve their fate (Experiment 2), and to
   believe more strongly that socially advantaged groups should dominate
   socially disadvantaged groups (Experiment 3). We further found that
   reminders of money increased preference for a free-market system of
   organ transplants that benefited the wealthy at the expense of the poor
   even though this was not the prevailing system (Experiment 5) and that
   this effect was moderated by participants' nationality. These results
   demonstrate how merely thinking about money can influence beliefs about
   the social order and the extent to which people deserve their station in
   life.

   U.S. children and adolescents. We examined 30-y changes in the
   association of dietary and meal behaviors with family income and
   education to understand the possible contribution of these trends to SES
   trends in obesity rates in 2- to 19-y-old Americans. We used dietary and
   SES data for 2- to 19-y olds from the NHANES 1971-1974 to 2003-2008 (n =
   39,822). The secular changes in the independent association of family
   income and education with 24-h dietary behaviors [energy intake (kcal),
   amount of foods and beverages (g), percent energy from all beverages and
   from nutritive beverages, and energy density of foods] and 24-h meal
   behaviors [number of eating occasions, energy from snack episodes (%),
   and mention of breakfast] were examined using multivariable regression
   methods. The secular increase in energy intake and food and beverage
   amount was significant in the lowest family SES categories. The positive
   association of family income and education with intakes of energy, food
   amounts, and beverage energy, noted in 1971-1974 or 1976-1980, was not
   observed in later surveys. There was an age gradient in changes in most
   diet and SES associations over time, with largest adverse changes in 12-
   to 19-y olds. Higher education was associated with lower energy from
   snack episodes, breakfast skipping, and energy density of foods and
   these associations did not change overtime. Overall, these results
   suggest both income and education differentials in secular increases in
   food amounts and energy intakes. J. Nutr. 143: 690-700, 2013.

AB While early theory and research on cosmopolitanism have been criticized
   for their European focus, a number of works have incorporated
   non-Eurocentric perspectives. This article contributes to this
   literature by examining the colonial production of cosmopolitan
   orientations as evidenced in the writings of Frantz Fanon. Colonialism
   has been treated as a deviation in the historical sociology of
   cosmopolitanism, but Fanon helps disclose how colonialism has also
   contributed to a particular form of cosmopolitanism that has been
   overlooked in existing theory and research: postcolonial
   cosmopolitanism. This form of cosmopolitanism, forged from the spaces of
   colonialism's contradictions, emphasizes global citizenship and humanism
   but strives to remember rather than repress the history of modern
   empire. It seeks to negate colonialism's contradictions and thus realize
   the ideals which Europe had initially pronounced but which it failed to
   institute.

AB The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of the Internet for
   health-related purposes and whether this usage is part of larger pattern
   of health-promoting behaviors, or health lifestyle. Pierre Bourdieu's
   concept of habitus provides the key theoretical concept that links
   health lifestyle and the digital inequality framework to explain how
   social conditions (i.e. social status and quality of Internet access)
   influence attitudes and behaviors. Path analysis is used to examine the
   relationship between key endogenous variables on attitudes, health
   behavior, health status, and online health-related activities, while
   controlling for demographics and other factors. Data comes from the
   National Cancer Institute's 2007 Health Information National Trends
   Survey. The results demonstrate that online health behaviors can be
   usefully conceptualized as elements of health lifestyle. The combination
   of health lifestyle and digital inequality provides a broader
   theoretical framework that highlights the importance of social
   conditions to influence people's Internet habitus and routine
   health-promoting behaviors. The combination of health lifestyle and
   digital inequality provides a useful theoretical framework for future
   research investigating persistent social disparities in health and the
   potential for the growing reliance on information and communication
   technologies to contribute to socially patterned health outcomes.

   thinking to American election data, it is possible to detect a

   without reference to external numerical indicators of rank. It is
   possible to detect and verify sensible and suggestive relative social
   positions for categories of income, education, gender, age, religion,

   The special contribution of the structural analysis is its simultaneous

AB Recently, the number of indirect female sex workers (FSWs) who work at
   bars/clubs and massage parlors is substantially increasing in Thailand;
   however, there are huge gaps in knowledge about HIV risk behaviors among
   indirect FSWs. This study aimed to describe and understand HIV risk
   behaviors among Thai FSWs in Bangkok in relation to sociocultural
   factors and work environment (e.g., bars/clubs, massage parlors,
   brothels, and street). Based on venue-based purposive sampling methods,
   Thai FSWs were recruited for qualitative interviews (n=50) and survey
   interviews (n=205). Based on mixed methods, the study revealed that HIV
   risk and substance use behaviors among FSWs significantly differed
   depending on work venues, although there were no significant differences
   between work venues on some key risk behaviors (e.g., inconsistent
   condom use with primary partners and customers; willingness to engage in
   unsafe sex with customers). A multiple linear regression analysis
   revealed that FSWs who had used illicit drugs, were young, had low
   levels of self-esteem, or reported STIs had frequently engaged in
   unprotected vaginal sex with customers. Also, FSWs who worked at
   bars/clubs, were young, had higher income, or reported STIs had
   frequently engaged in sex with customers under the influence of alcohol.
   Qualitative interviews illustrated FSWs' alcohol and drug use due to
   their stressful life (e.g., long working hours and a large number of
   customers) and easy access to alcohol and drugs. FSWs had shown
   inaccurate knowledge about HIV prevention methods and engaged in risky
   behaviors, such as washing vagina with water or toothpaste after having
   had sex with customers. The HIV prevention strategies in Thailand need
   to be re-structured through implementing evidence-based HIV prevention
   intervention programs for FSWs, which must address sociocultural factors
   (e.g., self-esteem) and alcohol and drug use specific to work venues.

AB BACKGROUND
   Little information is available about the relationship of socioeconomic
   status (SES) to blunted nocturnal ambulatory blood pressure (ABP)
   dipping among Hispanics and whether this relationship differs by race.
   We sought to characterize ABP nondipping and its determinants in a
   sample of Hispanics.
   METHODS
   We enrolled 180 Hispanic participants not on antihypertensive
   medications. SES was defined by years of educational attainment. All
   participants underwent 24-hour ABP monitoring. A decrease of <10% in the
   ratio between average awake and average asleep systolic BP was
   considered nondipping.
   RESULTS
   The mean age of the cohort was 67.1 +/- 8.7, mean educational level was
   9.4 +/- 4.4 years, and 58.9% of the cohort was female. The cohort was
   comprised of 78.3% Caribbean Hispanics with the rest from Mexico and
   Central/South America; 41.4% self-identified as white Hispanic, 34.4%
   self-identified as black Hispanic, and 24.4% did not racially
   self-identify. The percentage of nondippers was 57.8%. Educational
   attainment (10.5 years vs. 8.6 years; P <0.01) was significantly higher
   among dippers than nondippers. In multivariable analyses, each 1-year
   increase in education was associated with a 9% reduction in the
   likelihood of being a nondipper (odds ratio [OR] 0.91; 95% confidence
   interval [CI], 0.84-0.98; P = 0.01). There were significantly greater
   odds of being a nondipper for black Hispanics than for white Hispanics
   (OR, 2.83, 95% CI, 1.29-6.23; P = 0.005). Higher SES was significantly
   protective of nondipping in white Hispanics but not black Hispanics.
   CONCLUSIONS
   These results document a substantial prevalence of nondipping in a
   cohort of predominantly normotensive Hispanics. Dipping status varied
   significantly by race. Lower SES is significantly associated with
   nondipping status, and race potentially impacts on this relation.

AB Viewing visual sexual stimuli (VSS) has been documented to have both
   positive (e.g., increased sexual arousal and sexual behaviors) and
   negative (e.g., higher anxiety, devaluing of partner attractiveness)
   effects. Excitation transfer and social comparison theories were used to
   generate hypotheses that could explain these mixed findings. Forty-four
   monogamous, heterosexual couples viewed erotic, exciting (non-erotic
   films), and nature films both alone and together. They rated their
   feelings of general arousal and relationship satisfaction as well as
   perceptions of self and partner sexual behaviors and attractiveness.
   Participants viewing both the erotic and exciting films reported
   equivalent increases in excitement; however, the erotic film was rated
   as slightly more generally arousing and increased participant's desire
   to be close to their partner. Viewing the erotic films also induced
   greater reports of negative affect, guilt, and anxiety. These findings
   moderately support a transfer of excitation interpretation. No effects
   of partner presence or absence while viewing the films was found.
   Viewing erotic films led to more positive evaluations of one's own
   sexual behaviors. These findings provide mixed support in regard to self
   and partner social comparisons. Co-occurring positive and negative
   emotional reactions were explored as possible explanation to the complex
   reactions to VSS.

AB Typically, "non-romantic" sexual relationships are assumed to be casual;
   however, the emotional and social distinctions between romantic and
   non-romantic contexts are not well understood, particularly in
   adolescence. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health (Add Health) was used to compare shared emotional (e.g., telling
   partner that they love her/him) and social (e.g., going out in a group)
   activities within romantic and non-romantic sexual relationships.
   Adolescents who reported exclusively romantic sexual relationships (n =
   1,891) shared more emotional, but not social, activities with their
   partners than adolescents who were in non-romantic sexual relationships
   (n = 315; small effect size, r = .07-.13), akin to adolescents who
   experienced both relationship types (n = 519; small-to-medium effect
   size, r = .18-.38). Girls shared more emotional and social activities
   with their partners than boys when in romantic relationships (small
   effect size, r = .06-.10); there were no significant gender differences
   within non-romantic sexual relationships. Findings suggest that gendered
   scripts remain for sexual relationships that are romantic but not for
   those that are non-romantic. Notably, for the majority of adolescents,
   non-romantic relationships still held many emotional and social
   dimensions typical of romantic relationships and differences between
   relationship types were small. Although non-romantic relationships were
   less intimate than romantic sexual relationships, there was remarkable
   heterogeneity within this relationship type. Caution is advised when
   working with adolescents engaged in "casual" sexual relationships.
   Understanding the complexity of adolescent sexual relationships is
   critical for the advancement of effective sex education programming.

AB The concept of the axial age, initially proposed by the philosopher Karl
   Jaspers to refer to a period in the first millennium BCE that saw the
   rise of major religious and philosophical figures and ideas throughout
   Eurasia, has gained an established position in a number of fields,
   including historical sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of
   religion. We explore whether the notion of an "axial age" has historical
   and intellectual cogency, or whether the authors who use the label of a
   more free-floating "axiality" to connote varied "breakthroughs" in human
   experience may have a more compelling case. Throughout, we draw
   attention to ways in which uses of the axial age concept in contemporary
   social science vary in these and other respects. In the conclusion, we
   reflect on the value of the concept and its current uses and their
   utility in making sense of human experience.

AB Objective: This study extends previous examinations of social influences
   and marijuana use in considering how heavy marijuana users view
   themselves relative to their peers. We were specifically interested in
   evaluating whether (a) heavy-using marijuana users would identify more
   strongly with other users than with typical students, (b) identification
   with other marijuana users would be more strongly associated with own
   use, and (c) the association between perceived norms and marijuana use
   would be moderated by identification with peers. Method: Participants
   were 107 heavy (five or more times per month) marijuana users who
   completed an online survey assessing perceived norms for marijuana use,
   identification with typical students and other marijuana-using students,
   and marijuana use (frequency of use, joints per week, and hours high).
   Results: Participants unexpectedly identified more strongly with typical
   students rather than with other marijuana-using students. Identification
   with other marijuana users was, however, associated with more use. In
   addition, perceived norms were associated with more use but primarily
   among those who identified more with other users but not with typical
   students. Conclusions: Heavy marijuana users may be reluctant to
   identify themselves as users and may prefer to think of themselves as
   typical students. This may provide clinical opportunities to highlight
   discrepancies. In addition, identification with other users and lack of
   identification with typical students may be risk factors for heavier use
   and good indicators of candidacy for norms-based interventions. In sum,
   the present findings extend our understanding of the influence of social
   identity among young adult marijuana users and suggest novel directions
   for intervention strategies. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 74, 479-483, 2013)

AB Background There is evidence of an association between poor oral health
   and mortality. This association is usually attributed to inflammatory
   and nutrition pathways. However, the role of health behaviours and
   socioeconomic position has not been adequately examined. The aims of
   this study were to examine the association between oral health and
   premature death among middle-aged men and to test whether it was
   explained by socioeconomic position and behaviours.
   Methods Data were from the Vietnam Experience Study, a prospective
   cohort study of Vietnam War-era (1965-1971), American male army
   personnel. The authors examined risk of cause-specific and all-cause
   mortality in relation to poor oral health in middle age, adjusting for
   age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, IQ, behavioural factors and
   systemic conditions.
   Results Men with poor oral health experienced a higher risk of
   cause-specific and all-cause mortality. HRs for all-cause mortality were
   2.94 (95% CI 2.11 to 4.08) among individuals with poor oral health and
   3.98 (95% CI 2.43 to 6.49) among edentates compared with those with good
   oral health after adjusting for ethnicity and age. The association
   attenuated but remained significant after further adjustment for
   systemic conditions, socioeconomic position and behaviours.
   Socioeconomic and behavioural factors explained 52% and 44% of mortality
   risks attributed to poor oral health and being edentate, respectively.
   Conclusion The findings suggest that oral health-mortality relation is
   partly due to measured covariates in the present study. Oral health
   appears to be a marker of socioeconomic

AB Background: Repetitive element DNA methylation is related to prominent
   obesity-related chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular
   disease; yet, little is known of its relation with weight status. We
   examined associations of LINE-1 DNA methylation with changes in
   adiposity and linear growth in a longitudinal study of school-age
   children from Bogota, Colombia.
   Methods: We quantified methylation of LINE-1 elements from peripheral
   leukocytes of 553 children aged 5-12 years at baseline using
   pyrosequencing technology. Anthropometric characteristics were measured
   periodically for a median of 30 months. We estimated mean change in
   three age-and sex-standardized indicators of adiposity: body mass index
   (BMI)-for-age Z-score, waist circumference Z-score, and
   subscapular-to-triceps skinfold thickness ratio Z-score according to
   quartiles of LINE-1 methylation using mixed effects regression models.
   We also examined associations with height-for-age Z-score.
   Results: There were non-linear, inverse relations of LINE-1 methylation
   with BMI-for-age Z-score and the skinfold thickness ratio Z-score. After
   adjustment for baseline age and socioeconomic status, boys in the lowest
   quartile of LINE-1 methylation experienced annual gains in BMI-for-age
   Z-score and skinfold thickness ratio Z-score that were 0.06 Z/year (P =
   0.04) and 0.07 Z/year (P = 0.03), respectively, higher than those in the
   upper three quartiles. The relation of LINE-1 methylation and annual
   change in waist circumference followed a decreasing monotonic trend
   across the four quartiles (P trend = 0.02). DNA methylation was not
   related to any of the adiposity indicators in girls. There were no
   associations between LINE-1 methylation and linear growth in either sex.
   Conclusions: Lower LINE-1 DNA methylation is related to development of
   adiposity in boys.

AB Social contexts exert structural effects on individuals' social
   relationships, including interracial friendships. In this study, we
   posit that, net of group composition, total context size has a distinct
   effect on interracial friendship. Under the assumptions of (i)
   maximization of preference in choosing a friend, (ii)
   multidimensionality of preference, and (iii) preference for same-race
   friends, we conducted analyses using microsimulation that yielded three
   main findings. First, increased context size decreases the likelihood of
   forming an interracial friendship. Second, the size effect increases
   with the number of preference dimensions. Third, the size effect is
   diluted by noise, i. e., the random component affecting friendship
   formation. Analysis of actual friendship data among 4,745 American high
   school students yielded results consistent with the main conclusion that
   increased context size promotes racial segregation and discourages
   interracial friendship.

AB People are often called upon to witness, and to empathize with, the pain
   and suffering of others. In the current study, we directly compared
   neural responses to others' physical pain and emotional suffering by
   presenting participants (n = 41) with 96 verbal stories, each describing
   a protagonist's physical and/or emotional experience, ranging from
   neutral to extremely negative. A separate group of participants rated
   "how much physical pain", and "how much emotional suffering" the
   protagonist experienced in each story, as well as how "vivid and
   movie-like" the story was. Although ratings of Pain, Suffering and
   Vividness were positively correlated with each other across stories,
   item-analyses revealed that each scale was correlated with activity in
   distinct brain regions. Even within regions of the "Shared Pain network"
   identified using a separate data set, responses to others' physical pain
   and emotional suffering were distinct. More broadly, item analyses with
   continuous predictors provided a high-powered method for identifying
   brain regions associated with specific aspects of complex stimuli - like
   verbal descriptions of physical and emotional events.

PY 2013
AB Cooperation in a large society of self-interested individuals is
   notoriously difficult to achieve when the externality of one
   individual's action is spread thin and wide on the whole society. This
   leads to the 'tragedy of the commons' in which rational action will
   ultimately make everyone worse-off. Traditional policies to promote
   cooperation involve Pigouvian taxation or subsidies that make
   individuals internalize the externality they incur. We introduce a new
   approach to achieving global cooperation by localizing externalities to
   one's peers in a social network, thus leveraging the power of
   peer-pressure to regulate behavior. The mechanism relies on a joint
   model of externalities and peer-pressure. Surprisingly, this mechanism
   can require a lower budget to operate than the Pigouvian mechanism, even
   when accounting for the social cost of peer pressure. Even when the
   available budget is very low, the social mechanisms achieve greater
   improvement in the outcome.

AB Self-evaluations undergo significant transformation during early
   adolescence, developing in parallel with the heightened complexity of
   teenagers' social worlds. Intuitive theories of adolescent development,
   based in part on animal work, suggest that puberty is associated with
   neural-level changes that facilitate a "social reorientation" (Nelson et
   al., 2005). However, direct tests of this hypothesis using neuroimaging
   are limited in humans. This longitudinal fMRI study examined
   neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with puberty,
   self-evaluations, and the presumed social reorientation during the
   transition from childhood to adolescence. Participants (N = 27, mean age
   = 10.1 and 13.1 years at time points one and two, respectively) engaged
   in trait evaluations of two targets (the self and a familiar fictional
   other), across two domains of competence (social and academic).
   Responses in ventromedial PFC increased with both age and pubertal
   development during self-evaluations in the social domain, but not in the
   academic domain. These results suggest that changes in social
   self-evaluations are intimately connected with biology, not just peer
   contexts, and provide important empirical support for the relationship
   between neurodevelopment, puberty, and social functioning.

TI The Impact of Clinical Social Franchising on Health Services in Low- and

AB Background: The private sector plays a large role in health services
   delivery in low- and middle-income countries; yet significant gaps
   remain in the quality and accessibility of private sector services.
   Clinical social franchising, which applies the commercial franchising
   model to achieve social goals and improve health care, is increasingly
   used in developing countries to respond to these limitations. Despite
   the growth of this approach, limited evidence documents the effect of
   social franchising on improving health care quality and access.
   Objectives and Methods: We examined peer-reviewed and grey literature to
   evaluate the effect of social franchising on health care quality,
   equity, cost-effectiveness, and health outcomes. We included all studies
   of clinical social franchise programs located in low- and middle-income
   countries. We assessed study bias using the WHO-Johns Hopkins Rigour
   Scale and used narrative synthesis to evaluate the findings.
   Results: Of 113 identified articles, 23 were included in this review;
   these evaluated a small sample of franchises globally and focused on
   reproductive health franchises. Results varied widely across outcomes
   and programs. Social franchising was positively associated with
   increased client volume and client satisfaction. The findings on health
   care utilization and health impact were mixed; some studies find that
   franchises significantly outperform other models of health care, while
   others show franchises are equivalent to or worse than other private or
   public clinics. In two areas, cost-effectiveness and equity, social
   franchises were generally found to have poorer outcomes.
   Conclusions: Our review indicates that social franchising may strengthen
   some elements of private sector health care. However, gaps in the
   evidence remain. Additional research should include: further
   documentation of the effect of social franchising, evaluating the equity
   and cost-effectiveness of this intervention, and assessing the role of
   franchising within the context of the greater healthcare delivery
   system.

AB While the evolution of cooperation has been widely studied, little
   attention has been devoted to adversarial settings wherein one actor can
   directly harm another. Recent theoretical work addresses this issue,
   introducing an adversarial game in which the emergence of cooperation is
   heavily reliant on the presence of "Informants," actors who defect at
   first-order by harming others, but who cooperate at second-order by
   punishing other defectors. We experimentally study this adversarial
   environment in the laboratory with human subjects to test whether
   Informants are indeed critical for the emergence of cooperation. We find
   in these experiments that, even more so than predicted by theory,
   Informants are crucial for the emergence and sustenance of a high
   cooperation state. A key lesson is that successfully reaching and
   maintaining a low defection society may require the cultivation of
   criminals who will also aid in the punishment of others.

AB People often avoid information and situations that have the potential to
   contradict previously held beliefs and attitudes (i.e., situations that
   arouse cognitive dissonance). According to the motivated social
   cognition model of political ideology, conservatives tend to have
   stronger epistemic needs to attain certainty and closure than liberals.
   This implies that there may be differences in how liberals and
   conservatives respond to dissonance-arousing situations. In two
   experiments, we investigated the possibility that conservatives would be
   more strongly motivated to avoid dissonance-arousing tasks than
   liberals. Indeed, U. S. residents who preferred more conservative
   presidents (George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan) complied less than
   Americans who preferred more liberal presidents (Barack Obama and Bill
   Clinton) with the request to write a counter-attitudinal essay about who
   made a "better president." This difference was not observed under
   circumstances of low perceived choice or when the topic of the
   counter-attitudinal essay was non-political (i.e., when it pertained to
   computer or beverage preferences). The results of these experiments
   provide initial evidence of ideological differences in dissonance
   avoidance. Future work would do well to determine whether such
   differences are specific to political issues or topics that are
   personally important. Implications for political behavior are discussed.

PY 2013
AB We consider hundreds of thousands of individual economic transactions to
   ask: how predictable are consumers in their merchant visitation
   patterns? Our results suggest that, in the long-run, much of our
   seemingly elective activity is actually highly predictable.
   Notwithstanding a wide range of individual preferences, shoppers share
   regularities in how they visit merchant locations over time. Yet while
   aggregate behavior is largely predictable, the interleaving of shopping
   events introduces important stochastic elements at short time scales.
   These short- and long-scale patterns suggest a theoretical upper bound
   on predictability, and describe the accuracy of a Markov model in
   predicting a person's next location. We incorporate population-level
   transition probabilities in the predictive models, and find that in many
   cases these improve accuracy. While our results point to the elusiveness
   of precise predictions about where a person will go next, they suggest
   the existence, at large time-scales, of regularities across the
   population.

AB Objectives: To establish the prevalence of female genital mutilation
   (FGM) and force feeding (gavage) practices among children in Mauritania;
   to investigate factors related to FGM and gavage practices and attitude
   in Mauritania; and to explore implications related to the protection of
   children's rights and welfare.
   Methods: Data from the Mauritania 2000-2001 DHS were used in this
   analysis. Data were collected from men and women about their attitude
   toward the continuation of FGM and gavage; women only were asked if they
   ever experienced one of these practices. Chi-square statistics were used
   to investigate differences in attitude and practice of FGM and gavage by
   demographic characteristics. Binary logistic regression was used to
   identify socio-demographic factors related to FGM and gavage outcomes.
   Findings: The overall prevalence of FGM was 77% but varied depending on
   ethnicity. The majority of both female and male respondents favored the
   continuation of the practice (64% and 70%, respectively). Almost a
   quarter (23%) of women reported being force fed as a child and 32% of
   women and 29% of men approved the continuation of the practice. Gavage
   is almost exclusively practiced among Arabs.
   Conclusion: The practice of both FGM and gavage is ongoing, although the
   prevalence and attitude towards both appears to vary as a function of
   ethnicity, wealth, education, marital status, and age. Contextually
   relevant intervention and enforcement strategies are needed to challenge
   these cultural norms and protect the rights and welfare of children in
   Mauritania.

AB The late pre-Hispanic period in the US Southwest (A.D. 1200-1450) was
   characterized by large-scale demographic changes, including
   long-distance migration and population aggregation. To reconstruct how
   these processes reshaped social networks, we compiled a comprehensive
   artifact database from major sites dating to this interval in the
   western Southwest. We combine social network analysis with geographic
   information systems approaches to reconstruct network dynamics over 250
   y. We show how social networks were transformed across the region at
   previously undocumented spatial, temporal, and social scales. Using
   well-dated decorated ceramics, we track changes in network topology at
   50-y intervals to show a dramatic shift in network density and
   settlement centrality from the northern to the southern Southwest after
   A.D. 1300. Both obsidian sourcing and ceramic data demonstrate that
   long-distance network relationships also shifted from north to south
   after migration. Surprisingly, social distance does not always correlate
   with spatial distance because of the presence of network relationships
   spanning long geographic distances. Our research shows how a large
   network in the southern Southwest grew and then collapsed, whereas
   networks became more fragmented in the northern Southwest but persisted.
   The study also illustrates how formal social network analysis may be
   applied to large-scale databases of material culture to illustrate
   multigenerational changes in network structure.

AB We study the issue of polarization in society through a model of opinion
   formation. We say an opinion formation process is polarizing if it
   results in increased divergence of opinions. Empirical studies have
   shown that homophily, i.e., greater interaction between like-minded
   individuals, results in polarization. However, we show that De Groot's
   well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can
   never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We
   generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well known in
   social psychology as biased assimilation: When presented with mixed or
   inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support
   for their initial position, thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion.
   We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased
   opinion formation process results in polarization if individuals are
   sufficiently biased. In other words, homophily alone, without biased
   assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite
   interestingly, biased assimilation also provides a framework to analyze
   the polarizing effect of Internet-based recommender systems that show us
   personalized content.

AB Empiric quantification of human mobility patterns is paramount for
   better urban planning, understanding social network structure and
   responding to infectious disease threats, especially in light of rapid
   growth in urbanization and globalization. This need is of particular
   relevance for developing countries, since they host the majority of the
   global urban population and are disproportionally affected by the burden
   of disease. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) data-loggers to
   track the fine-scale (within city) mobility patterns of 582 residents
   from two neighborhoods from the city of Iquitos, Peru. We used similar
   to 2.3 million GPS data-points to quantify age-specific mobility
   parameters and dynamic co-location networks among all tracked
   individuals. Geographic space significantly affected human mobility,
   giving rise to highly local mobility kernels. Most (similar to 80%)
   movements occurred within 1 km of an individual's home. Potential hourly
   contacts among individuals were highly irregular and temporally
   unstructured. Only up to 38% of the tracked participants showed a
   regular and predictable mobility routine, a sharp contrast to the
   situation in the developed world. As a case study, we quantified the
   impact of spatially and temporally unstructured routines on the dynamics
   of transmission of an influenza-like pathogen within an Iquitos
   neighborhood. Temporally unstructured daily routines (e.g., not
   dominated by a single location, such as a workplace, where an individual
   repeatedly spent significant amount of time) increased an epidemic's
   final size and effective reproduction number by 20% in comparison to
   scenarios modeling temporally structured contacts. Our findings provide
   a mechanistic description of the basic rules that shape human mobility
   within a resource-poor urban center, and contribute to the understanding
   of the role of fine-scale patterns of individual movement and
   co-location in infectious disease dynamics. More generally, this study
   emphasizes the need for careful consideration of human social
   interactions when designing infectious disease mitigation strategies,
   particularly within resource-poor urban environments.

AB Mobile phone data are increasingly being used to quantify the movements
   of human populations for a wide range of social, scientific and public
   health research. However, making population-level inferences using these
   data is complicated by differential ownership of phones among different
   demographic groups that may exhibit variable mobility. Here, we quantify
   the effects of ownership bias on mobility estimates by coupling two data
   sources from the same country during the same time frame. We analyse
   mobility patterns from one of the largest mobile phone datasets studied,
   representing the daily movements of nearly 15 million individuals in
   Kenya over the course of a year. We couple this analysis with the
   results from a survey of socioeconomic status, mobile phone ownership
   and usage patterns across the country, providing regional estimates of
   population distributions of income, reported airtime expenditure and
   actual airtime expenditure across the country. We match the two data
   sources and show that mobility estimates are surprisingly robust to the
   substantial biases in phone ownership across different geographical and
   socioeconomic groups.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between state-level income
   inequality and alcohol outcomes and sought to determine whether
   associations of inequality with alcohol consumption and problems would
   be more evident with between-race inequality measures than with the Gini
   coefficient. We also sought to determine whether inequality would be
   most detrimental for disadvantaged individuals.
   Methods. Data from 2 nationally representative samples of adults (n = 13
   997) from the 2000 and 2005 National Alcohol Surveys were merged with
   state-level inequality and neighborhood disadvantage indicators from the
   2000 US Census. We measured income inequality using the Gini coefficient
   and between-race poverty ratios (Black-White and Hispanic-White).
   Multilevel models accounted for clustering of respondents within states.
   Results. Inequality measured by poverty ratios was positively associated
   with light and heavy drinking. Associations between poverty ratios and
   alcohol problems were strongest for Blacks and Hispanics compared with
   Whites. Household poverty did not moderate associations with income
   inequality.
   Conclusions. Poverty ratios were associated with alcohol use and
   problems, whereas overall income inequality was not. Higher levels of
   alcohol problems in high-inequality states may be partly due to social
   context.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between alcohol outlets, drug
   markets (approximated by arrests for possession and trafficking), and
   violence in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2006. We analyzed geographic and
   environmental versus individual factors related to violence and
   identified areas high in violent crime.
   Methods. We used data from the Boston Police Department, US Census, and
   Massachusetts State Alcohol Beverage Control Commission. Spatial
   modeling was employed at the block group level, and violent crime,
   alcohol outlets, and drug markets were mapped.
   Results. Relative to other block groups, block groups in the highest
   decile of violent crime (n = 55) were found to be poorer (e. g., lower
   incomes, higher percentages of vacant homes), and they had greater
   numbers of alcohol outlets and higher drug arrest rates. Alcohol outlets
   and drug possession and trafficking arrests were predictive of violent
   crime. Also, spatial effects resulting from neighboring block groups
   were related to violent crime. Both alcohol outlet density and type were
   associated with violent crime in a differentiated and complex way.
   Conclusions. With drug possession and trafficking arrests as a proxy for
   drug markets, spatial relationships between alcohol outlets and violence
   were found in addition to typical sociodemographic predictors.

AB Objectives. We assessed the spatial distribution of subsidized housing
   units provided through 2 federally supported, low-income housing
   programs in Orange County, California, in relation to neighborhood
   walkability, transit access, and traffic exposure.
   Methods. We used data from multiple sources to examine land-use and
   health-related built environment factors near housing subsidized through
   the Housing Choice Voucher Program and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit
   (LIHTC) program, and to determine these patterns' associations with
   traffic exposure.
   Results. Subsidized projects or units in walkable, poorer neighborhoods
   were associated with lower traffic exposure; higher traffic exposure was
   associated with more transit service, a Hispanic majority, and mixed-use
   areas. Voucher units are more likely than LIHTC projects to be located
   in high-traffic areas.
   Conclusions. Housing program design may affect the location of
   subsidized units, resulting in differential traffic exposure for
   households by program type. Further research is needed to better
   understand the relationships among subsidized housing locations,
   characteristics of the built environment, and health concerns such as
   traffic exposure, as well as which populations are most affected by
   these relationships.

AB Objectives. We examined and compared the changing neighborhood
   characteristics of a group of homeless adults over time.
   Methods. We collected the addresses of previous housing and sleep
   locations from a longitudinal study of 400 homeless adults in the St.
   Louis, Missouri, region and compared census measures of housing and
   economic opportunities at different points along individual pathways
   from housing to homelessness and at 1- and 2-year follow-up interviews.
   Results. Sleep locations of homeless adults were much more concentrated
   in the urban core at baseline than were their previous housed and
   follow-up locations. These core areas had higher poverty, unemployment,
   and rent-to-income ratios and lower median incomes.
   Conclusions. The spatial concentration of homeless adults in areas with
   fewer opportunities and more economic and housing distress may present
   additional barriers to regaining stable housing and employment. A
   big-picture spatial and time-course viewpoint is critical for both
   policymakers and future homelessness researchers.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the influence of socioeconomic status (SES) on
   hospital admissions for respiratory conditions associated with ambient
   particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less in aerodynamic
   diameter (PM2.5) in children aged 1 to 9 years in 12 California
   counties, from 2000 to 2005.
   Methods. We linked daily hospital admissions for respiratory conditions
   (acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, and asthma) to meteorological,
   air pollution, and census data.
   Results. In San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Los Angeles
   counties, the admission rates for children associated with PM2.5 ranged
   from 1.03 to 1.07 for combined respiratory conditions and 1.03 to 1.08
   for asthma in regions with lower SES. We observed 2 distinct patterns of
   the influence of the composite SES Townsend index. In lower-SES South
   Coast areas, PM2.5-associated hospital admission rates for all
   respiratory outcomes were predominantly positive whereas results in the
   Central Valley were variable, often tending toward the null.
   Conclusions. These distinct patterns could be attributed to the
   heterogeneity of regional confounders as well as the seasonal variation
   of emission sources of PM2.5. Composite SES is one potential factor for
   increasing susceptibility to air pollution.

AB Objectives. We described the racial/ethnic disparities in survival among
   people diagnosed with AIDS in Florida from 1993 to 2004, as the
   availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) became
   widespread. We determined whether these disparities decreased after
   controlling for measures of community-level socioeconomic status.
   Methods. We compared survival from all causes between non-Hispanic
   Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites vis-a-vis survival curves and Cox
   proportional hazards models controlling for demographic, clinical, and
   area-level poverty factors.
   Results. Racial/ethnic disparities in survival peaked for those
   diagnosed during the early implementation of HAART (1996-1998) with a
   Black-to-White hazard ratio (HR) of 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] =
   1.62, 1.83) for males and 1.40 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.59) for females. These
   HRs declined significantly to 1.48 (95% CI = 1.35, 1.64) for males and
   nonsignificantly to 1.25 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.48) for females in the 2002
   to 2004 diagnosis cohort. Disparities decreased significantly for males
   but not females when controlling for baseline demographic factors and
   CD4 count and percentage, and became nonsignificant in the 2002 to 2004
   cohort after controlling for area poverty.
   Conclusions. Area poverty appears to play a role in racial/ethnic
   disparities even after controlling for demographic factors and CD4 count
   and percentage.

AB Objectives. We examined the association between environmental quality
   measures and health outcomes by using the County Health Rankings data,
   and tested whether a revised environmental quality measure for 1 state
   could improve the models.
   Methods. We conducted state-by-state, county-level linear regression
   analyses to determine how often the model's 4 health determinants
   (social and economic factors, health behaviors, clinical care, and
   physical environment) were associated with mortality and morbidity
   outcomes. We then developed a revised measure of environmental quality
   for West Virginia, and tested whether the revised measure was superior
   to the original measure.
   Results. Measures of social and economic conditions, and health
   behaviors, were related to health outcomes in 58% to 88% of state
   models; measures of environmental quality were related to outcomes in 0%
   to 8% of models. In West Virginia, the original measure of environmental
   quality was unrelated to any of the 8 health outcome measures, but the
   revised measure was significantly related to all 8.
   Conclusions. The County Health Rankings model underestimates the impact
   of the physical environment on public health outcomes. Suggestions for
   other data sources that may contribute to improved measurement of the
   physical environment are provided.

AB Objectives. We tested the hypothesis that neighborhood-level social
   capital and individual-level neighborhood attachment are positively
   associated with adult dental care use.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2000-2001 Los Angeles Family and
   Neighborhood Survey that were linked to US Census Bureau data from 2000
   (n = 1800 adults aged 18-64 years across 65 neighborhoods). We used
   2-level hierarchical logistic regression models to estimate the odds of
   dental use associated with each of 4 forms of social capital and
   neighborhood attachment.
   Results. After adjusting for confounders, the odds of dental use were
   significantly associated with only 1 form of social capital: social
   support (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]
   = 0.72, 0.99). Individual-level neighborhood attachment was positively
   associated with dental care use (AOR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.10).
   Conclusions. Contrary to our hypothesis, adults in neighborhoods with
   higher levels of social capital, particularly social support, were
   significantly less likely to use dental care. Future research should
   identify the oral health-related attitudes, beliefs, norms, and
   practices in neighborhoods and other behavioral and cultural factors
   that moderate and mediate the relationship between social capital and
   dental care use.

   sample of textbooks from 2003 through 2010, we explore 24 introductory
   sociology textbooks to determine the relationship between categories of
   gender, race, and class and levels of analysis. Previous research found
   that textbooks primarily discuss gender at the micro level, race at the
   meso level, and class at the macro level. Replicating previous
   approaches by using index citations, we find evidence that gender is
   linked to socialization much more than race and class, and there is
   evidence that class is still more likely to be discussed at a macro
   level. Our content analysis findings show a similar pattern, but also
   some evidence for the increased inclusion of theories and examples that
   examine gender, race, and class at multiple levels of analysis.
   Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for
   race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in
   colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a
   pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian
   world than exists in reality and includes claims that U.S. society is
   now "post-racial." Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an
   era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social
   distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider
   "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white
   supremacy and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume
   exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must
   employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify
   their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain
   racial inequality at the systemic level. I introduce one successful
   approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial
   inequality by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital
   acquisition and transfer.

   created an image-based learning model to address this disconnect. I used
   discussion board image selection, posting and critique exercises
   (image-posts), and personal meaning maps (PMMs) as core assignments.
   This combination increased student comprehension, challenged and altered
   perceptions of key topics, and gave them a greater sense of agency
   through reflexive learning. Additionally, students' reception of this
   model was favorable, with 97 percent reporting that the course met or

AB Scholarship on teaching undergraduates increasingly emphasizes the
   benefits of providing students with an active role in their education
   whereby instructors are more aptly described as facilitators of
   knowledge rather than merely providers of it. Additionally,
   recommendations from the American Sociological Association aimed
   specifically at the undergraduate sociology curriculum argue that
   students must engage as practitioners of sociology at each level of
   their program development. In short, undergraduates should do
   sociology-not just read or write sociology. Applying this recommendation
   to teaching statistics, I suggest organizing a course around a
   student-led research project in which students generate the topics,
   questions, and data that are then used to complete a substantive
   research paper. Students are given the opportunity to be actively
   engaged in all stages of the research and data-gathering process.
   Students also present their work in student roundtables, further

AB Humans are especially tuned to the movements of other people. Neural
   correlates of this social attunement have been proposed to lie in and
   around the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region, which
   robustly responds to biological motion in contrast to a variety of
   non-biological motions. This response persists even when no form
   information is provided, as in point-light displays (PLDs). The aim of
   the current study was to assess the ability of functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reliably measure brain responses to PLDs of
   biological motion, and determine the sensitivity of these responses to
   interpersonal contextual factors. To establish reliability, we measured
   brain activation to biological motion with fNIRS and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during two separate sessions in an identical
   group of 12 participants. To establish sensitivity, brain responses to
   biological motion measured with fNIRS were subjected to an additional
   social manipulation where participants were either socially included or
   excluded before viewing PLDs of biological motion. Results revealed
   comparable brain responses to biological motion using fMRI and fNIRS in
   the right supramarginal gyrus. Further, social inclusion increased brain
   responses to biological motion in right supramarginal gyrus and
   posterior STS. Thus, fNIRS can reliably measure brain responses to
   biological motion and can detect social experience-dependent modulations
   of these brain responses.

   hypothesis - common third-party contact(s) mediate information flows
   between two otherwise disconnected actors, thereby encouraging direct
   dyadic interactions between them and the structural hole hypothesis -
   such contact inhibits dyadic trade. Our longitudinal analyses of

AB Importance: It is reasonable to hypothesize that for 2 patients with
   similar degrees of integrated binocular visual field (BVF) loss, the
   patient with a history of faster disease progression will report worse
   vision-related quality of life (VRQOL) than the patient with slowly
   progressing damage. However, to our knowledge, this hypothesis has not
   been investigated in the literature.
   Objective: To evaluate the association between binocular rates of visual
   field change and VRQOL in patients with glaucoma.
   Design: Observational cohort study.
   Setting: Patients were recruited from the Diagnostic Innovations in
   Glaucoma Study and the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study.
   Participants: The study included 796 eyes of 398 patients with diagnosed
   or suspected glaucoma followed up from October 1, 1998, until January
   31, 2012, for a mean (SD) of 7.3(2.0) years.
   Main Outcome Measures: The VRQOL was evaluated using the 25-item
   National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) at the
   last follow-up visit. The NEI VFQ-25 was completed for all patients
   during the period extending from December 1, 2009, through January 31,
   2012. Integrated BVFs were calculated from the monocular fields of each
   patient. Linear regression of mean deviation values was used to evaluate
   rates of BVF change during the follow-up period. Logistic regression
   models were used to investigate the association between abnormal VRQOL
   and rates of BVF change, while adjusting for potentially confounding
   socioeconomic and demographic variables.
   Results: Thirty-two patients (8.0%) had abnormal VRQOL as determined by
   the results of the NEI VFQ-25. Patients with abnormal VRQOL had
   significantly faster rates of BVF change than those with normal VRQOL
   (-0.18 vs -0.06 dB/y; P<.001). Rates of BVF change were significantly
   associated with abnormality in VRQOL (odds ratio=1.31 per 0.1 dB/y
   faster; P=.04), after adjustment for confounding variables.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with faster rates of BVF change were
   at higher risk of reporting abnormal VRQOL. Assessment of rates of BVF
   change may provide useful information in determining risk of functional
   impairment in glaucoma.

AB While the personality trait of extraversion has been linked to enhanced
   reward sensitivity and its putative neural correlates, little is known
   about whether extraverts' neural circuits are particularly sensitive to
   social rewards, given their preference for social engagement and social
   interactions. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), this study examined
   the relationship between the variation on the extraversion spectrum and
   a feedback-related ERP component (the error-related negativity or ERN)
   known to be sensitive to the value placed on errors and reward.
   Participants completed a forced-choice task, in which either rewarding
   or punitive feedback regarding their performance was provided, through
   either social (facial expressions) or non-social (verbal written) mode.
   The ERNs elicited by error trials in the social - but not in non-social
   - blocks were found to be associated with the extent of one's
   extraversion. However, the directionality of the effect was in contrast
   with the original prediction: namely, extraverts exhibited smaller ERNs
   than introverts during social blocks, whereas all participants produced
   similar ERNs in the non-social, verbal feedback condition. This finding
   suggests that extraverts exhibit diminished engagement in response
   monitoring - or find errors to be less salient - in the context of
   social feedback, perhaps because they find social contexts more
   predictable and thus more pleasant and less anxiety provoking. (C) 2013

AB Aims: The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to determine
   the impact of a culturally tailored diabetes education program led by a
   community health worker (CHW) on the HbA1c, blood pressure, body mass
   index (BMI) and lipid status of uninsured Mexican Americans with
   diabetes.
   Methods: Adult patients were recruited from a community clinic and
   randomized into intervention (n = 90) and control (n = 90) groups. Both
   groups received usual medical care from clinic physicians. The
   intervention group participated in the Community Diabetes Education
   (CoDE) program over 12 months. The primary outcome of interest was
   HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, BMI and lipid status.
   Variations in outcomes over time were assessed within groups and between
   groups using linear mixed-models and an intention-to-treat approach.
   Assessment of changes in HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid status over 12
   months included variables to control for modifications made to
   antidiabetic, antihypertensive and lipid lowering medications.
   Results: There was no difference in baseline characteristics between the
   intervention and control groups. Mean changes of HbA1c over 12 months
   showed a significant intervention effect (-.7%, p = .02) in the CoDE
   group compared with controls. HbA1c decreased significantly from
   baseline to 12 months within the intervention (-1.6%, p < .001) and
   control (-.9%, p < .001) groups. No differences between groups for
   secondary outcomes were found.
   Conclusions: This study supports the effectiveness of CHWs as diabetes
   educators/case managers functioning as integral members of the health
   care team in community clinic settings serving uninsured Mexican
   Americans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   from 467 students in business courses at a large university in the
   northeastern part of the United States (N = 467). Analyses were
   conducted using principal component analysis and structural equation
   modeling. Using AMOS, multiple models of the relationship among these
   intelligences were developed to determine, as hypothesized, if social
   intelligence was superordinate to emotional and cultural intelligences,
   which are presented as distinct but overlapping constructs. Results did
   not support social intelligence being superordinate to emotional

AB Individuals differ in the strategies they use to regulate their emotions
   (e. g., suppression, reappraisal), and these regulatory strategies can
   differentially influence social outcomes. However, the mechanisms
   underlying these social effects remain to be specified. We examined one
   potential mediator that arises directly from emotion-regulatory effort
   (expression of positive emotion), and another mediator that does not
   involve emotion processes per se, but instead results from the link
   between regulation and self-processes (subjective inauthenticity).
   Across three studies, only inauthenticity mediated the link between
   habitual use of suppression and poor social functioning (lower
   relationship satisfaction, lower social support). These findings
   replicated across individuals socialized in Western and East Asian
   cultural contexts, younger and older adults, when predicting social
   functioning concurrently and a decade later, and even when broader
   adjustment was controlled. Thus, the social costs of suppression do not
   seem to be due to reduced positive emotion expression but rather the
   incongruence between inner-self and outer-behavior. Reappraisal was not
   consistently related to social functioning. Implications of these
   findings for emotion processes, self processes, and interpersonal
   relationships are discussed.

AB Background Only a limited number of studies have investigated the
   correlation between haematocrit (HCT) and mortality in the general
   population, and few of those studies have had data on a wide range of
   low and high levels of HCT. We investigated the association between
   baseline HCT and mortality in a prospective cohort study of 49 983 adult
   subjects in Iran with a broad spectrum of HCT values.
   Methods Data on socio-demographic and life-style factors, past medical
   history, and levels of HCT were collected at enrollment. During a mean
   follow-up of 5 years (follow-up success rate similar to 99%), 2262
   deaths were reported. Cox proportional hazards regression models were
   used to estimate hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence
   intervals.
   Results There was a U-shaped relationship between categories of HCT and
   mortality in both sexes: both low and high levels of HCT were associated
   with increased overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular
   disease. The U-shaped relationship persisted after several sensitivity
   analyses were done, including analyses restricted to non-smokers and
   non-users of opium; analyses excluding deaths from accidents and other
   external causes as well as deaths of persons with self-reported ischemic
   heart disease at the baseline interview for the study; and analyses
   excluding the first 2 years of follow-up. Self-reported past medical
   history and lack of data about lipids and other cellular blood
   components were the major limitations of the study.
   Conclusions Low and high levels of HCT are associated with increased
   mortality in the general population. The findings in the present study
   can be of particular importance for low-and middle-income countries in
   which a substantial proportion of the population lives with suboptimal
   levels of HCT.

AB Recent work in ecology suggests that the diversity of responses to
   environmental change among species contributing to the same ecosystem
   function can strongly influence ecosystem resilience. To render this
   important realization more useful for understanding coupled
   human-natural systems, we broaden the concept of response diversity to
   include heterogeneity in human decisions and action. Simply put, not all
   actors respond the same way to challenges, opportunities, and risks. The
   range, prevalence, and spatial and temporal distributions of different
   responses may be crucial to the resilience or the transformation of a
   social-ecological system and thus have a bearing on human vulnerability
   and well-being in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and
   political change. Response diversity can be seen at multiple scales (e.
   g., household, village, region), and response diversity at one scale may
   act synergistically with or contrary to the effects of diversity at
   another scale. Although considerable research on the sources of response
   diversity has been done, our argument is that the consequences of
   response diversity warrant closer attention. We illustrate this argument
   with examples drawn from our studies of two East African pastoral
   populations and discuss the relationship of response diversity to
   characteristics of social-ecological systems that can promote or
   diminish resilience.

AB Economic game experiments have become a prominent method among social
   scientists developing and testing theories of cooperation. These games
   provide a valuable opportunity to generate measures of cooperation that
   can be compared from one place to the next, yet challenges remain in how
   to interpret cross-cultural differences in these experiments and connect
   them to cooperation in naturally occurring contexts. I address these
   challenges by examining framing effects in public goods games (PGGs)
   with salmon fishers and reindeer herders in Kamchatka, Russia. Combining
   standard versions of the game with versions that refer to post-Soviet
   institutions coordinating fishing and herding, I show that (1) average
   contributions in the PGG in Kamchatka are substantially higher than
   reported elsewhere and (2) framing the PGG alters the relationship
   between contributions and expectations, shifting strategies away from
   unconditional generosity and toward conditional cooperation. My
   analysis, by synthesizing quantitative analysis of PGG data with
   long-term qualitative ethnography, including extensive postgame
   interviews with participants, supports the notion that cooperation in
   economic games increases along with cultural norms, values, and
   institutions that emerge from economic interdependence. Framing effects
   suggest that researchers should devote more attention to investigating
   the relationship between contributions and expectations.

AB Examination of 206 Neolithic and Chalcolithic bifaces from the southern
   Levant revealed that changes in form during the emergence of
   agropastoralism correlated with evolving land use practices, but new
   biface types also expressed altered social identities and perceptions of
   the environment. Nonfunctional groundstone pre-pottery Neolithic A
   (PPNA) bifaces seem to have served as social and status symbols, while
   flaked flint PPNA tranchet axes and chisels were used for carpentry
   rather than tree-felling. This pattern continued during the following
   early pre-pottery Neolithic B (EPPNB) period, but a new sharpening
   method, polishing, was used on a unique flint tranchet ax to strengthen
   its edge. By the MPPNB and LPPNB, heavier polished flint axes were used
   to clear forests for fields, grazing lands, wood fuel, and lumber.
   Sustainable forest management continued until the cumulative effects of
   tree-felling may have led to landscape degradation at the end of the
   PPNC. Adzes replace axes as heavy woodworking tools during the pottery
   Neolithic A (PNA) period, but by the PNB period, once again there are
   more carpentry tools than tree-felling bifaces. The trend is reversed
   again during the Chalcolithic, when the demand for fire wood, lumber,
   and cleared land seems to have increased during a time of emerging
   socioeconomic complexity.

AB Human kin cooperation is universal, leading researchers to label humans
   as "cooperative breeders." Despite widespread interest in human
   cooperation, there has been no systematic study of how household
   economic decision making occurs. We document age and sex profiles of
   task delegation by parents to children ages 4-18 among Bolivian
   forager-horticulturalists. We test for sex differences in the
   probability of delegation and examine whether tasks are more likely
   delegated as household labor demand increases. We also test whether food
   acquisition tasks are more likely delegated to higher producers. We find
   mixed support for the prediction that girls are more likely delegated
   domestic and alloparenting tasks than boys (n = 173 children). Both
   sexes are more likely delegated tasks during rice harvest months; number
   of coresident young children is also associated with greater probability
   of delegated allocare, although the effect retains significance for
   girls only. For both sexes, father absence is associated with greater
   probability of delegation, particularly for food acquisition tasks.
   Children delegated rice harvesting achieve 45% higher mean daily caloric
   returns from harvesting than children not delegated harvesting. Our
   results therefore suggest that delegation increases household economic
   efficiency. We find mixed support for the hypothesis that delegation
   prepares children for sex-specific adult roles.

AB Background: Despite growing concern over potential health effects
   associated with exposures to the endocrine disruptor, bisphenol A (BPA),
   insufficient information is available on determinants of BPA
   concentrations among minority populations in the US.
   Objectives: To describe concentrations and predictors of BPA in an
   inner-city longitudinal birth cohort.
   Methods: We analyzed spot urines for total BPA collected during
   pregnancy and child ages 3, 5, and 7 years from African Americans and
   Dominicans (n=568) enrolled in the Columbia Center for Children's
   Environmental Health birth cohort and residing in Northern Manhattan and
   the South Bronx. Adjusting for specific gravity, generalized estimating
   equations were used to compare BPA concentrations across paired samples
   and linear regression analyses were used to determine relationships
   between BPA, season of sample collection, soda-demographic variables and
   urinary, concentrations of phthalate metabolites.
   Results: BPA was detected in >= 94% of samples. Prenatal concentrations
   were significantly lower than postnatal concentrations. Geometric means
   were higher among African Americans compared to Dominicans in prenatal
   (p=0.008), 5 year (p<0.001) and 7 year (p=0.017) samples. Geometric
   means at 5 and 7 years were higher (p=0.021, p=0.041 respectively) for
   children of mothers never married compared to mothers ever married at
   enrollment. BPA concentrations were correlated with phthalate metabolite
   concentrations at prenatal, 3, 5 and 7 years (p-values <0.05). Postnatal
   BPA concentrations were higher in samples collected during the summer.
   Conclusions: This study shows widespread BPA exposure in an inner-city
   minority population. BPA concentration variations were associated with
   socio-demographic characteristics and other xenobiotics. (C) 2012

AB In many cities, dry cleaners using perchloroethylene are frequently
   located in multifamily residential buildings and often cause elevated
   indoor air levels of perchloroethylene throughout the building. To
   assess individual perchloroethylene exposures associated with co-located
   dry cleaners, we measured perchloroethylene in residential indoor air,
   and in blood and breath of adults and children residing in buildings
   with a dry cleaner as part of the New York City (NYC) Perc Project We
   also measured perchloroethylene in indoor air, and in blood and breath
   of residents of buildings without a dry cleaner for comparison. Here, we
   evaluate whether an environmental disparity in perchloroethylene
   exposures is present. Study participants are stratified by residential
   building type (dry cleaner or reference) and socioeconomic
   characteristics (race/ethnicity and income); measures of
   perchloroethylene exposure are examined; and, the influence of
   stratified variables and other factors on perchloroethylene exposure is
   assessed using multivariate regression. All measures of
   perchloroethylene exposure for residents of buildings with a dry cleaner
   indicated a socioeconomic disparity. Mean indoor air perchloroethylene
   levels were about five times higher in minority (82.5 ug/m(3)) than in
   non-minority (16.5 ug/m(3)) households, and about six times higher in
   low-income (105.5 ug/m(3)) than in high income (17.8 ug/m(3))
   households. Mean blood perchloroethylene levels in minority children
   (0.27 ng/mL) and adults (0.46 ng/mL) were about two and three times
   higher than in non-minority children (0.12 ng/mL) and adults (0.15
   ng/mL), respectively. Mean blood perchloroethylene levels in low income
   children (0.34 ng/mL) and adults (0.62 ng/mL) were about three and four
   times higher than in high income children (0.11 ng/mL) and adults (0.14
   ng/mL), respectively. A less marked socioeconomic disparity was observed
   in perchloroethylene breath levels with minority and low income
   residents having slightly higher levels than non-minority and high
   income residents. Multivariate regression affirmed that indoor air
   perchloroethylene level in dry cleaner buildings was the single most
   important factor determining perchloroethylene in blood and breath.
   Neither age, gender, nor socioeconomic status significantly influenced
   perchloroethylene levels in breath or blood. We previously reported that
   increased indoor air, breath, and blood perchloroethylene levels among
   NYC Perc Project child participants were associated with an increased
   risk for slightly altered vision. Thus, the disproportionately elevated
   perchloroethylene exposures of minority and low-income child residents
   of buildings with a dry cleaner shown here constitutes an environmental
   exposure disparity with potential public health consequences. Among
   residents of buildings without a dry cleaner, we observed some small
   increases in perchloroethylene breath and blood levels among
   non-minority or high income residents compared to minority or low income
   residents. These differences were not attributable to differences in
   indoor air levels of perchloroethylene which did not differ across
   socioeconomic categories, but appear to be associated with more frequent
   exposures dry cleaned garments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   the Cleveland Clinic and by the Society for Vascular Surgery into their
   approach to patient care and physician communication. Overall,
   integration of social networking technology has current and future
   potential to be used to promote goals, patient awareness, recruitment
   for clinical trials, and professionalism within the specialty of

AB The most common adult chronic diseases affect 1 in 3 adults and account
   for more than three-quarters of US health care spending. The major
   childhood drivers of adult disease are distinctly nonmedical: poverty,
   poor educational outcomes, unhealthy social and physical environments,
   and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Ideally, well-child care (WCC) would
   address these drivers and help create healthier adults with more
   productive lives and lower health care costs. For children without
   serious acute and chronic medical problems, however, traditional
   pediatric preventive services may be largely ineffective in addressing
   the outcomes that really matter; that is, improving lifelong health and
   reducing the burden of adult chronic disease. In this article, we
   examine what role WCC has in addressing the major childhood drivers of
   adult disease and consider various models for the future of WCC within
   pediatrics. Pediatrics 2013; 131: S149-S159

AB Is the field of pediatrics doing all that it can for the health of
   children? Many think that the field has gone off track and that we could
   do better. These articles highlight some different ways of judging the
   successes and failures of pediatrics in the United States today. The
   choices that we face are stark. To change the system, we would need to
   recalibrate the balance between utilitarian approaches to resource
   allocation, such as might be dictated by cost-effectiveness analyses,
   and deontologic approaches that prioritize unbreakable commitments or
   promises to individuals. These changes would entail large-scale social
   engineering projects to reshape our health care system, our educational
   system, and our public health system. A failure to change, however,
   might perpetuate a system that is not doing all it can for the health of
   America's children and the society they will form. Pediatrics 2013; 131:

AB Few US studies have assessed racial disparities in viral respiratory
   hospitalizations among children. This study enrolled black and white
   children under 5 years of age who were hospitalized for acute
   respiratory illness (ARI) in 3 US counties during October May 2002-2009.
   Population-based rates of hospitalization were calculated by race for
   ARI and laboratory-confirmed influenza and respiratory syncytial virus
   (RSV), using US Census denominators. Relative rates of hospitalization
   between racial groups were estimated. Of 1,415 hospitalized black
   children and 1,824 hospitalized white children with ARI enrolled in the
   study, 108 (8%) black children and 111(6%) white children had influenza
   and 230 (19%) black children and 441 (29%) white children had RSV.
   Hospitalization rates were higher among black children than among white
   children for ARI (relative rate (RR) = 1.7, 95% confidence interval
   (CI): 1.6, 1.8) and influenza (RR = 2.1, 95% Cl: 1.6, 2.9). For RSV,
   rates were similar among black and white children under age 12 months
   but higher for black children aged 12 months or more (for ages 12-23
   months, RR = 1.7, 95% Cl: 1.1, 2.5; for ages 24-59 months, RR = 2.2, 95%
   Cl: 1.3, 3.6). Black children versus white children were significantly
   more likely to have public insurance or no insurance (85% vs. 43%) and a
   history of asthma/wheezing (28% vs. 18%) but not more severe illness.
   The observed racial disparities require further study.

AB OBJECTIVE: Most studies suggest that hysterectomies are more common in
   African American women than in other ethnic groups. To assess this
   ethnic surgical disparity in a novel way, our main goal was to determine
   whether admixture (the proportion of sub-Saharan African or European
   origin in individuals) is associated with hysterectomy frequency in
   African American women in the Women's Health Initiative.
   STUDY DESIGN: In this retrospective study, we used ancestry informative
   single nucleotide polymorphisms to estimate admixture proportions in >
   10,000 African American women from the Women's Health Initiative.
   Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between
   admixture and self-reported history of hysterectomy with and without
   controls for relevant covariates. Multinomial logistic regression models
   were used to assess the association between admixture and self-reported
   age of hysterectomy. We also considered other potential risk factors
   (adiposity, hypertension, and education) for hysterectomy accounting for
   admixture.
   RESULTS: African admixture was a strong risk factor after the adjustment
   for multiple covariates (odds ratio, 1.85; P < .0001). The admixture
   risk for hysterectomy was highest for those procedures that were
   performed in the 35-39 age range (odds ratio, 3.08; P < .0001) and least
   evident in oldest ages (>= 45 years old). Our analyses also suggest that
   adiposity, hypertension, and education were associated independently
   with hysterectomy in this population group.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that higher African admixture is
   associated with higher frequencies of hysterectomy and that genetic
   studies that specifically target African American women and diseases
   that are associated with hysterectomy may be especially useful in
   understanding the pathogenesis and underlying cause of this disparity in
   health outcome.

AR 274.e1
DI 10.1016/j.ajog.2012.12.038

AB OBJECTIVE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last estimated
   a national ectopic pregnancy rate in 1992, when it was 1.97% of all
   reported pregnancies. Since then rates have been reported among
   privately insured women and regional health care provider populations,
   ranging from 1.6-2.45%. This study assessed the rate of ectopic
   pregnancy among Medicaid beneficiaries ( New York, California, and
   Illinois, 2000-03), a previously unstudied population.
   STUDY DESIGN: We identified Medicaid administrative claims records for
   inpatient and outpatient encounters with a principal International
   Classification of Diseases 9th Revision diagnosis code for ectopic
   pregnancy. We calculated the ectopic pregnancy rate among female
   beneficiaries aged 15-44 as the number of ectopic pregnancies divided by
   the number of total pregnancies, which included spontaneous abortions,
   induced abortions, ectopic pregnancies, and all births. We used Poisson
   regression to assess the risk of ectopic pregnancy by age and race.
   RESULTS: Four-year Medicaid ectopic pregnancy rates were 2.38% of
   pregnancies in New York, 2.07% in California, and 2.43% in Illinois.
   Risk was higher among black women compared with whites in all states (
   relative risk, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.28; P < .0001), and
   among older women compared with younger women ( trend for age, P <
   .001).
   CONCLUSION: Medicaid beneficiaries in these 3 states experienced higher
   rates of ectopic pregnancy than reported for privately insured women
   nationwide in the same years. Relying on private insurance databases may
   underestimate ectopic pregnancy's burden in the United States
   population. Furthermore, within this low-income population racial
   disparities exist.

AB Purpose: Life course models suggest that socioeconomic mobility is
   associated with decreased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk.
   We examined adult socioeconomic mobility measured by household income in
   relation to CVD mortality risk among older adults.
   Methods: Data from 2691 (n(men) = 1157; n(women) = 1534) Alameda County
   Study respondents in 1994 were used in these analyses. Latent growth
   curve models were used to identify income patterns from 1965 to 1994.
   Results: Income patterns were categorized as consistently low,
   moderately low, increasing, and high. Bivariate models showed that
   membership in the increasing compared with high pattern was associated
   with decreased hazards of CVD mortality (hazard ratio, 0.15; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 0.04-0.53). Controlling for age,
   race/ethnicity, marital status, and gender, respondents in the
   consistently low (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-3.1) and high pattern (HR, 2.2;
   95% CI, 1.1-4.2) had increased hazards of CVD mortality than those in
   the moderately low income group.
   Conclusions: Patterns of association were consistent with social
   mobility models of socioeconomic position, indicating lower CVD
   mortality risk for those with increasing or higher incomes. Future work
   should continue to investigate measures that capture the variation in
   social mobility over the life course, and how these patterns shape
   chronic disease risk in later life. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Purpose: Chronic health conditions are common and increasing among U.S.
   children and youth. We examined whether chronic health conditions are
   associated with low school performance.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study of 22,730 children and youth
   (grades 2-11) in San Jose, California, was conducted from 2007 through
   2010. Health conditions were defined as chronic if reported in each of
   the first 2 years, and school performance was measured using
   standardized English language arts (ELA) and math assessments.
   Results: Chronic health conditions were independently associated with
   low ELA and math performance, irrespective of ethnicity, socioeconomic
   status, or grade level. Adjusted odds ratios for the association between
   any chronic health condition and low ("basic or below") performance were
   1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.36; P < .001) for ELA and
   1.28 (95% CI, 1.18-1.38; P < .001) for math, relative to students
   without reported health conditions. Further adjustment for absenteeism
   had little effect on these results. The strongest associations were
   found for ADHD, autism, and seizure disorders, whereas a weak
   association was found for asthma before but not after adjusting for
   absenteeism, and no associations were found for cardiovascular disorders
   or diabetes.
   Conclusions: Chronic neurodevelopmental and seizure disorders, but not
   cardiovascular disorders or diabetes, were independently associated with
   low school performance among children and youth. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: We examined whether quality of mammography interpretation as
   performed by the original reading radiologist varied by patient
   sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods: For 149 patients residing in Chicago and diagnosed in
   2005-2008, we obtained the original index mammogram that detected the
   breast cancer and at least one prior mammogram that did not detect the
   cancer performed within 2 years of the index mammogram. A single breast
   imaging specialist performed a blinded review of the prior mammogram.
   Potentially missed detection (PMD) was defined as an actionable lesion
   seen during a blinded review of the prior mammogram that was in the same
   quadrant as the cancer on the index mammogram.
   Results: Of 149 prior mammograms originally read as nonmalignant, 46% (N
   = 68) had a potentially detectable lesion. In unadjusted analyses, PMD
   was greater among minority patients (54% vs. 39%, P = .07) and for
   patients with incomes below $30,000 (65% vs. 36%, P < .01), less
   education (58% vs. 39%, P = .02), and lacking private health insurance
   (63% vs. 40%, P = .02). Likelihood ratio tests for the inclusion of
   socioeconomic variables in multivariable logistic regression models were
   highly significant (P <= .02).
   Conclusions: Disadvantaged socioeconomic status appears to be associated
   with PMD of breast cancer at mammography screening. (c) 2013 Elsevier

AB In a national US sample of pregnant women (n=311), we investigated the
   question of who becomes highly anxious about pregnancy by examining
   putative sociodemographic, pregnancy- and mental health-related
   predictors of pregnancy anxiety. We also assessed the contribution of
   pregnancy anxiety to the risk of significant alcohol consumption during
   pregnancy. English-speaking pregnant women aged 18+years were recruited
   online. Results indicated that sociodemographic factors (younger age,
   white, unmarried, lower education, lower household income, no previous
   children), feelings about current pregnancy (unwanted), and general
   anxiety (higher general and state anxiety) predicted higher
   pregnancy-related anxiety, whereas age, religiosity, number of weeks
   pregnant, unplanned pregnancy, and maternal depressive symptoms did not.
   Pregnancy anxiety was the single strongest predictor of alcohol drinking
   risk during pregnancy (p<.001, Delta R-2=.10) a relationship that held
   after controlling for other significant predictors. Pregnancy anxiety
   also represented the strongest predictor of screening positively for
   drinking risk during pregnancy at the total T-ACE (an alcohol risk
   screener for pregnancy) level of 3+ (odds ratio 95% CI=1.61-4.14,
   p<.001), though not at the level of 2+ (odds ratio 95% CI=0.98-1.68,

AB Purpose: The goal of this first-of-its-kind qualitative study was to
   examine the awareness, attitudes, and experiences among parents of
   autistic children regarding autism genetic testing.
   Methods: We conducted in-depth, individual, and semistructured
   interviews with 42 parents of autistic children with diverse
   racial/ethnic backgrounds. All interviews were audio-taped, transcribed,
   and coded into major themes and subthemes.
   Results: Approximately one-quarter of participants had two or more
   autistic children, and about half of them were ethnic/racial minorities.
   The majority of participants postulated favorable attitudes toward
   autism genetic testing for three main reasons: early intervention and
   treatment, identifying the etiology of autism, and informed family
   planning. Nevertheless, among parents who had taken their children for
   genetic testing, some expressed frustration and questioned the
   competency of their providers in interpreting test results. Asian
   parents and those with a low socioeconomic status expressed lower
   awareness and tended to have more limited access to autism genetic
   testing.
   Conclusion: As health-care providers play a vital role in providing
   genetic services and education, these professionals should be educated
   and be sensitive to the needs of parents with autistic children. Further
   quantitative research is required to examine the effects of
   socio-demographic factors on parents' awareness, attitudes, and

AB Objective. To examine racial/ethnic differences in treatment and
   survival in women diagnosed with invasive vulvar cancer in the United
   States.
   Methods. Women with invasive vulvar cancer were identified from the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 1/1/92 to
   12/31/02. Statistical analysis using Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Test,
   Kaplan-Meier survival methods, and Cox regression proportional hazards
   models was performed.
   Results. Of the 2357 cases of invasive vulvar cancer included in this
   study, 1974 (83.8%) were non-Hispanic white, 209 (8.9%) were
   non-Hispanic black, 119 (5.0%) were Hispanic, and 55 (2.3%) women were
   of another race/ethnicity. After adjustment for stage, black women were
   half as likely (OR=0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0. 74) to undergo surgery and 1.7
   times more likely (OR=1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.36) to receive radiation than
   white women. In multivariable analysis, surgical treatment reduced the
   risk of death from vulvar cancer by 46% (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43-0.67),
   whereas radiation was not shown to impact the risk of death (HR 0.99,
   95% CI 0.84-1.19), after adjusting for age, race, stage, and grade.
   There was no significant difference in risk of death by race/ethnicity
   group after adjusting for the previously described variables.
   Conclusions. Based on this study, race/ethnicity is not an independent
   risk factor for poor prognosis in women diagnosed with invasive vulvar
   cancer, despite differences in treatment modality by race/ethnicity.
   Further research to define the factors contributing to differences in
   treatment selection according to race/ethnicity and the resulting impact
   on quality of life is warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Objective. The objective of this article is to broadly review the
   scientific literature and summarize the most up-to-date findings on
   ovarian cancer health disparities worldwide and in the United States
   (U.S.).
   Methods. The present literature on disparities in ovarian cancer was
   reviewed. Original research and relevant review articles were included.
   Results. Ovarian cancer health disparities exist worldwide and in the
   U.S. Ovarian cancer disproportionately affect African American women at
   all stages of the disease, from presentation through treatment, and
   ultimately increased mortality and decreased survival, compared to
   non-Hispanic White women. Increased mortality is likely to be explained
   by unequal access to care and non-standard treatment regimens frequently
   administered to African American women, but may also be attributed to
   genetic susceptibility, acquired co-morbid conditions and increased
   frequency of modifiable risk factors, albeit to substantially lesser
   extent. Unequal access to care is, in turn, largely a consequence of
   lower socioeconomic status and lack of private health insurance coverage
   among the African American population.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest the need for policy changes aimed at
   facilitating equal access to quality medical care. At the same time,
   further research is necessary to fully resolve racial disparities in
   ovarian cancer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Koenig (J Nerv Ment Dis 196: 349-355, 2008) and others have asserted
   that measures of spirituality used to investigate its association with
   health seem to present a misleading picture of the relationship because
   of evidence suggesting that spirituality has become conceptually
   confounded with wellbeing. To evaluate this claim, the present study
   used a sample of 247 university students to explore the relation of a
   multidimensional model of spirituality with several different forms of
   well-being and the association of both with a two-factor model of social
   desirability. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that,
   although there is some evidence of an association, it is generally of
   low effect size and seems to differ as a function of how spirituality is
   defined. More importantly, however, there was the finding that
   existential well-being, a concept often incorporated into definitions of
   spirituality and a part of the measurement model used in this study, is
   virtually uncorrelated with explicitly spiritual and religious variables
   but shows a pattern of association with measures of well-being and
   social desirability, which suggests that it would be better
   conceptualized as a form of well-being and not spirituality. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the meaning of the findings for
   understanding the spirituality-health literature and suggestions for
   future research.

AB To examine the longitudinal relationship between past-year
   problem-gambling severity and incident Axis I psychopathology among
   older adults (aged 55-90), analyses were conducted on data from the
   National Epidemiologic Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC).
   This nationally-representative population-based survey was conducted in
   two waves (Wave 1, 2000-2001; and Wave 2, 2004-2005). Past-year
   problem-gambling severity at Wave 1 and incident Axis 1 psychopathology
   at Wave 2 were evaluated with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated
   Disabilities Interview Schedule Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders Fourth Edition. Multivariate logistic regression
   modeling was conducted on groups categorized into low-frequency
   gambling/non-gambling (LFG/NG), low-risk gambling (LRG), and
   at-risk/problem/pathological gambling (ARPG) based on DSM-IV criteria
   for pathological gambling. Relative to LFG/NG, ARPG at Wave 1 was
   positively associated with the incidence of generalized anxiety disorder
   (OR = 2.51; p = .011) and any substance use disorder (OR = 2.61; p =
   .0036); LRG was negatively associated with the incidence of hypomania
   (OR = 0.33; p = .017). Models were adjusted for demographic
   characteristics, psychiatric comorbidity, health behaviors, physical
   health, and stressful life events assessed at baseline. While gambling
   may represent a positive activity for some older adults, data suggest
   that risky/problematic gambling behavior may be associated with the
   development of psychiatric problems in this population. Older-adult
   gamblers, as well as their clinicians, friends, and family, should be
   aware of potential risks associated with gambling, adopt strategies to
   prevent the onset of secondary disorders, and monitor themselves and
   others for signs of problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Sociocultural phenomena, such as exogamy or phylopatry, can largely
   determine human sex-specific demography. In Central Africa, diverging
   patterns of sex-specific genetic variation have been observed between
   mobile hunter-gatherer Pygmies and sedentary agricultural non-Pygmies.
   However, their sex-specific demography remains largely unknown. Using
   population genetics and approximate Bayesian computation approaches, we
   inferred male and female effective population sizes, sex-specific
   migration, and admixture rates in 23 Central African Pygmy and non-Pygmy
   populations, genotyped for autosomal, X-linked, Y-linked, and
   mitochondrial markers. We found much larger effective population sizes
   and migration rates among non-Pygmy populations than among Pygmies, in
   agreement with the recent expansions and migrations of non-Pygmies and,
   conversely, the isolation and stationary demography of Pygmy groups. We
   found larger effective sizes and migration rates for males than for
   females for Pygmies, and vice versa for non-Pygmies. Thus, although most
   Pygmy populations have patrilocal customs, their sex-specific genetic
   patterns resemble those of matrilocal populations. In fact, our results
   are consistent with a lower prevalence of polygyny and patrilocality in
   Pygmies compared with non-Pygmies and a potential female transmission of
   reproductive success in Pygmies. Finally, Pygmy populations showed
   variable admixture levels with the non-Pygmies, with often much larger
   introgression from male than from female lineages. Social discrimination
   against Pygmies triggering complex movements of spouses in
   intermarriages can explain these male-biased admixture patterns in a
   patrilocal context. We show how gender-related sociocultural phenomena
   can determine highly variable sex-specific demography among populations,
   and how population genetic approaches contrasting chromosomal types
   allow inferring detailed human sex-specific demographic history.

AB Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and
   disparities in healthcare access and the factors associated with them in
   an urban population.
   Methods: Eligible patients were consented and enrolled randomly from the
   inpatient internal medicine unit at Truman Medical Center, Kansas City,
   Missouri, a 250-bed hospital recognized for its broad range of acute and
   chronic diseases seen in its inpatient and outpatient care. They had one
   or more of the following chronic medical conditions (CMCs): congestive
   heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus,
   hypertension, chest pain, or cirrhosis. One hundred patients were
   interviewed regarding challenges they have encountered as consumers and
   their understanding of CMCs.
   Results: Interview results indicate patients' understanding of their
   CMC, the associated needs for self-management, and the potential health
   consequences are contributing factors leading to repeated visits to the
   emergency department.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that access to the following
   health-focused services has the potential to reduce the rate of
   emergency department visits and hospitalizations, morbidity, mortality,
   and the burden of cost. These services include adequate access to and
   utilization of primary care characterized by preventive care, early
   detection of acute illness, ongoing chronic disease management through
   easy access to primary providers, and adequate health literacy about
   CMC.

   socio-economic and biophysical determinants using an eco-region based
   spatial framework. Results show population density as a major
   determinant during the nineteenth century, and biophysical suitability
   as the major determinant during the twentieth century. We further
   examine the role of technological innovations, socio-economic and
   socio-ecological feedbacks that have either sustained or altered the
   cropland trajectories in different eco-regions. The cropland
   trajectories for each of the 84 level-III eco-regions were analyzed
   using a nonlinear bi-analytical model. In the Eastern United States, low
   biophysically suitable eco-regions, e.g., New England, have shown
   continual decline in the cropland after reaching peak levels. The
   cropland trajectories in high biophysically suitable regions, e.g., Corn
   Belt, have stabilized after reaching peak levels. In the Western United
   States, low-intensity crop cover (< 10 %) is sustained with irrigation
   support. A slower rate of land conversion was found in the industrial
   period. Significant effect of Conservation Reserve Program on planted
   crop area is found in last two decades (1990-2010).

AB It has long been proposed that cooperation should increase in harsh
   environments, but this claim still lacks theoretical underpinnings. We
   modeled a scenario in which benefiting from altruistic behavior was
   essential to survival and reproduction. We used a spatial agent-based
   model to represent mutual cooperation enforced by environmental
   adversity. We studied two factors, the cost of unreciprocated
   cooperation and the environmental cost of living, which highlight a
   conflict between the short- and long-term rewards of cooperation. In the
   long run, cooperation is favored because only groups with a sufficient
   number of cooperators will survive. In the short run, however, harsh
   environmental costs increase the advantage of defectors in
   cooperator-defector interactions because the loss of resources leads to
   death. Our analysis sheds new light on the evolution of cooperation via
   interdependence and illustrates how selfish groups can incur short-term
   benefits at the cost of their eventual demise. We demonstrate how harsh
   environments select for cooperative phenotypes and suggest an
   explanation for the adoption of cooperative breeding strategies in human
   evolution. We also highlight the importance of variable population size
   and the role of socio-spatial organization in harsh environments.

AB Social epidemiologists Marmot and Wilkinson argue that relative
   deprivation is the dominant mechanism through which socioeconomic status
   (SES) affects mortality. If such an argument is valid, we would expect
   to consistently see the influence of relative deprivation in situations
   where two or more highly qualified and very similar individuals are
   nominated in a status competition, but only one receives the status
   boost conferred by winning. We studied mortality experiences of Emmy
   Award winners, Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, and presidents and vice
   presidents-comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition.
   Our findings and results of similar studies fail to show consistent
   advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is
   sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent. We
   conclude that the critical processes determining the strength and
   direction of any status effect on longevity are changes in life
   circumstances that result from winning or losing, rather than the
   processes that inexorably flow from one's relative position in a status
   hierarchy.

AB Contemporary scholarship has conceptualized modern fame as an open
   system in which people continually move in and out of celebrity status.
   This model stands in stark contrast to the traditional notion in the
   sociology of stratification that depicts stable hierarchies sustained
   through classic forces such as social structure and cumulative
   advantage. We investigate the mobility of fame using a unique data
   source containing daily records of references to person names in a large
   corpus of English-language media sources. These data reveal that only at
   the bottom of the public attention hierarchy do names exhibit fast
   turnover; at upper tiers, stable coverage persists around a fixed level
   and rank for decades. Fame exhibits strong continuity even in
   entertainment, on television, and on blogs, where it has been thought to
   be most ephemeral. We conclude that once a person's name is decoupled
   from the initial event that lent it momentary attention,
   self-reinforcing processes, career structures, and commemorative
   practices perpetuate fame.

AB Black women tend to be diagnosed with breast cancer at a more advanced
   stage than whites and subsequently experience elevated breast cancer
   mortality. We sought to determine whether there are racial differences
   in tumor natural history that contribute to these disparities. We used
   the University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Simulation Model, a validated
   member of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and
   Surveillance Modeling Network, to evaluate the contribution of racial
   differences in tumor natural history to observed disparities in breast
   cancer incidence. We fit eight natural history parameters in
   race-specific models by calibrating to the observed race- and
   stage-specific 1975-2000 U.S. incidence rates, while accounting for
   known racial variation in population structure, underlying risk of
   breast cancer, screening mammography utilization, and mortality from
   other causes. The best fit models indicated that a number of natural
   history parameters must vary between blacks and whites to reproduce the
   observed stage-specific incidence patterns. The mean of the tumor growth
   rate parameter was 63.6 % higher for blacks than whites (0.18, SE 0.04
   vs. 0.11, SE 0.02). The fraction of tumors considered highly aggressive
   based on their tendency to metastasize at a small size was 2.2 times
   greater among blacks than whites (0.41, SE 0.009 vs. 0.019, SE 0.008).
   Based on our simulation model, breast tumors in blacks grow faster and
   are more likely to metastasize earlier than tumors in whites. These
   differences suggest that targeted prevention and detection strategies
   that go beyond equalizing access to mammography may be needed to
   eliminate breast cancer disparities.

AB Using pooled cross-sectional time-series data for the 50 U.S. states

   groups of social correlates-demographic, economic, social, and cultural
   factors-are associated with the 1976-2000 patterns in overall suicide
   rates and suicide by firearms and other means. Unlike past research that
   typically considers only one dimension, this analysis differentiates
   between spatial and temporal variation in suicide rates to determine
   whether and how social correlates operate differently in these two
   contexts. Results indicate that suicide rates correspond closely to
   social correlates. Within U.S. states, lower overall suicide rates
   between 1976 and 2000 were associated with demographic change (e.g.,
   larger numbers of foreign-born) as well as with fewer numbers of
   Episcopalians. Across U.S. states, variation in overall suicide rates
   over the period was related to demographic (percentage male), economic
   (per capita income), social (percentage divorced), and cultural (alcohol
   consumption and gun ownership) factors. However, findings differ
   importantly by type of suicide, and across time and space. Reasons for
   these distinct patterns are discussed.

   co-exist as central cultural elements shaping the ways in which people
   interpret and interact with the world. Despite centuries of
   co-existence, the relationship between shamanism and Christianity has
   entered an especially dynamic era as many of Amazonia's indigenous
   peoples abandon Catholicism for Evangelical and Sabbatarian churches.
   Testing the relationship between Christian church affiliation and
   shamanism in 23 Makushi and Wapishana communities in southern Guyana, we
   found that Evangelicals and Sabbatarians are less likely to visit
   shamans or accept their legitimacy than are Anglicans and Catholics.
   However, conversion does not necessarily imply a complete rejection of
   indigenous religious systems as many self-identified Evangelicals and
   Sabbatarians continue to adhere to some indigenous beliefs and
   practices. We conclude by positing possible implications of religious
   conversion for natural resource use on indigenous lands.

AB Background Researchers focused on mental health of conflict-affected
   children are increasingly interested in the concept of resilience.
   Knowledge on resilience may assist in developing interventions aimed at
   improving positive outcomes or reducing negative outcomes, termed
   promotive or protective interventions. Methods We performed a systematic
   review of peer-reviewed qualitative and quantitative studies focused on
   resilience and mental health in children and adolescents affected by
   armed conflict in low- and middle-income countries. Results Altogether
   53 studies were identified: 15 qualitative and mixed methods studies and
   38 quantitative, mostly cross-sectional studies focused on school-aged
   children and adolescents. Qualitative studies identified variation
   across socio-cultural settings of relevant resilience outcomes, and
   report contextually unique processes contributing to such outcomes.
   Quantitative studies focused on promotive and protective factors at
   different socio-ecological levels (individual, family-, peer-, school-,
   and community-levels). Generally, promotive and protective factors
   showed gender-, symptom-, and phase of conflict-specific effects on
   mental health outcomes. Conclusions Although limited by its
   predominantly cross-sectional nature and focus on protective outcomes,
   this body of knowledge supports a perspective of resilience as a complex
   dynamic process driven by time- and context-dependent variables, rather
   than the balance between risk- and protective factors with known impacts
   on mental health. Given the complexity of findings in this population,
   we conclude that resilience-focused interventions will need to be highly
   tailored to specific contexts, rather than the application of a
   universal model that may be expected to have similar effects on mental
   health across contexts.

AB Aims and method Drawing on empirical studies and literature reviews,
   this paper aims to clarify and qualify the relevance of resilience to
   youth experiencing political conflict. It focuses on the discordance
   between expectations of widespread dysfunction among conflict-affected
   youth and a body of empirical evidence that does not confirm these
   expectations. Findings The expectation for widespread dysfunction
   appears exaggerated, relying as it does on low correlations and on
   presumptions of universal response to adversity. Such a position ignores
   cultural differences in understanding and responding to adversity, and
   in the specific case of political conflict, it does not account for the
   critical role of ideologies and meaning systems that underlie the
   political conflict and shape a young people's interpretation of the
   conflict, and their exposure, participation, and processing of
   experiences. With respect to empirical evidence, the findings must be
   viewed as tentative given the primitive nature of research designs:
   namely, concentration on violence exposure as the primary risk factor,
   at the expense of recognizing war's impact on the broader ecology of
   youth's lives, including disruptions to key economic, social, and
   political resources; priority given to psychopathology in the assessment
   of youth functioning, rather than holistic assessments that would
   include social and institutional functioning and fit with cultural and
   normative expectations and transitions; and heavy reliance on
   cross-sectional, rather than longitudinal, studies. Conclusions
   Researchers and practitioners interested in employing resilience as a
   guiding construct will face such questions: Is resilience predicated on
   evidence of competent functioning across the breadth of risks associated
   with political conflict, across most or all domains of functioning,
   and/or across time? In reality, youth resilience amidst political
   conflict is likely a complex package of better and poorer functioning
   that varies over time and in direct relationship to social, economic,
   and political opportunities. Addressing this complexity will complicate
   the definition of resilience, but it confronts the ambiguities and
   limitations of work in cross-cultural contexts.

AB Engaging in prosocial behaviors (acts that benefit others) is associated
   with many positive outcomes in children, including the development of
   positive peer relationships, academic achievement, and good
   psychological functioning. This study examined the social learning
   mechanisms toddlers use to acquire prosocial behaviors. This brief
   report presents a new experimental procedure in which 2-year-olds (28-32
   months, N = 30) saw a video of an adult performing a novel prosocial
   behavior in response to another person's distress. Children then had the
   opportunity to imitate and implement the behavior in response to their
   own parent's physical distress. Children who saw the video were more
   likely to perform the novel action and to display non-demonstrated
   prosocial behaviors relative to (a) children who did not view the video
   but saw a parent in distress and (b) children who saw the video but
   witnessed their mother engage in a neutral activity. These results
   suggest that toddlers imitate and emulate prosocial behaviors for social
   interaction and that children can apply such behaviors in appropriate
   situations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can affect many areas of
   psychosocial functioning, and comprehensive medical care includes
   consideration of psychosocial issues as well as disease factors. The
   purpose of this clinical report is to review research on psychosocial
   functioning in pediatric IBD and to provide recommendations for care
   providers in the areas of psychopathology, health-related quality of
   life, and social, family, and school functioning. Youth with IBD are at
   increased risk for difficulty in all areas reviewed, and many
   psychosocial factors are associated with disease activity, which
   highlights the importance of monitoring psychosocial functioning as part
   of clinical care. Several interventions have empirical support or show
   promise for addressing psychosocial difficulty, and recommendations for
   monitoring and treating these issues are provided.

AB This study evaluated self-consciousness as a moderator of the
   relationship between social drinking motives and alcohol use.
   Participants included 243 undergraduate students who reported alcohol
   use, alcohol-related problems, self-consciousness, and social motives.
   We expected that social drinking motives, private self-consciousness,
   and public self-consciousness would be positively associated with
   drinking and that this relationship would be moderated by
   self-consciousness. Specifically, we expected this relationship to be
   stronger for people lower in private self-consciousness, based on
   decreased awareness about their internal states. In addition, we
   expected that the relationship between social motives and drinking would
   be stronger among those who were higher in public self-consciousness,
   given their focus on the self as a social object. Consistent with
   expectations, the associations between social motives and peak drinking
   and drinks per week were more strongly associated among those lower in
   private self-consciousness. However, inconsistent with expectations, the
   relationship between social motives and drinking was stronger among
   those who were lower, rather than higher, in public self-consciousness.
   Overall implications of these research findings extend previous research
   emphasizing the importance of considering social influences in etiology
   and prevention of drinking. Moreover, while social motives are a
   consistent predictor of drinking among young adults, this is not
   universally true. This study contributes to social cognitive literature
   seeking to understand and identify individual factors related to
   drinking and their application to the adaptation of existing
   intervention approaches. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nagpur is an industrial hub in Maharashtra, a state in Central India
   that has the second highest HIV prevalence in the country. Approximately
   3000 brothel-based female sex workers (FSWs) are estimated to be working
   in Nagpur's Ganga-Jamuna red light district. The extent to which brothel
   madams, known as gharwalis, support HIV/STI prevention for FSWs has not
   been examined. The present study sought to identify personal, social,
   and behavioral characteristics of gharwalis in Nagpur as well as enhance
   our understanding of the gharwali's role in shaping the sexual practices
   of brothel-based FSWs. Thirty gharwalis participated in a survey that
   covered personal, social, behavioral, and environmental characteristics.
   Respondents ranged in age from 29 to 50 years (M = 38.9) and had worked
   as a gharwali for an average of 5.3 years; 80% had no formal education,
   43% had never married, and 30% were divorced or separated, and 93%
   earned money from their own sex work. Gharwalis managed an average of
   4.2 FSWs (range 210). Overall, gharwalis reported positive attitudes
   toward condoms, promoted use of condoms by their FSWs with clients,
   taught FSWs how to use condoms, knew where to obtain condoms for free,
   and required HIV testing for their FSWs; however, levels of HIV
   prevention knowledge were low. Gharwalis also reported providing a range
   of support services to FSWs who lived in their brothels, including
   shelter, protection from drunk and aggressive clients and police,
   emotional support, caring and love, and health care. These data suggest
   the feasibility of involving gharwalis in brothel-based HIV prevention
   programs.

AB Due to stigma and the psychosocial repercussions of past trauma and
   abuse, survivors of sex trafficking may experience increased
   susceptibility to violence, revictimization, and various harmful health
   outcomes, including HIV infection. Given the paucity of research
   characterizing the experiences of formerly trafficked female sex workers
   (FSWs), we set out to describe and contextualize perceptions of HIV risk
   among women who have experienced past episodes of sex trafficking and
   who are currently engaged in sex work in Tijuana, Mexico. Based on
   semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, we describe the
   following interrelated themes as influencing formerly trafficked FSWs'
   perceptions and experiences of HIV risk: economic vulnerability;
   susceptibility to violence; and psychological trauma. Our findings
   highlight the need for HIV prevention efforts to incorporate broader
   structural and social interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to
   violence and human rights abuses among this population and improving
   their general economic, psychological, and social well-being.

AB Background Like other types of care for disabled or elderly adults,
   consumer-directed personal assistance services may present
   multi-factorial risks for work-related musculoskeletal disorders
   (WRMSDs). Methods Using survey data, we compared providers experiencing
   WRMSDs in the previous year to those who did not, seeking to identify
   functional, temporal, physical, and relationship risk factors for
   transient and chronic conditions. Results Longer work experience with
   the recipient and more frequent bending increased the risk of being in
   the most chronic group (12 painful episodes), whereas predictable work
   hours with rest breaks and greater social support from the recipient
   appeared protective. For transient conditions (one to two episodes),
   longer work experience with the recipient and predictable hours with
   rest breaks appeared protective. Conclusions We offer recommendations to
   improve hazard assessment as well as training and information
   distribution related to home care programs. With the population aging,
   home care jobs require increasing oversight to prevent WRMSDs. Am. J.

AB Considerable work has shown the benefits for psychological health of
   being gender typed (i.e., perceiving oneself in ways that are consistent
   with one's sex). Nevertheless, little is known about the reasons for the
   link. In two studies of young adults (total N = 673), we studied (1) the
   ways in which gender typing is predicted from gender-related interests
   and personal qualities, and (2) links between gender typing and
   adjustment (self-esteem and negative emotionality). In the first study,
   gender typicality was positively predicted by a variety of
   gender-related characteristics and by communal traits, a female-typed
   characteristic; gender typicality was also positively associated with
   adjustment. To clarify the role of communality in predicting gender
   typicality and its link with adjustment, we conducted a follow-up study
   examining both gender typicality and "university typicality." Gender
   typicality was again predicted by gender-related characteristics and
   communality, and associated with adjustment. Further, university
   typicality was also predicted by communality and associated with
   adjustment. Mediation analyses showed that feelings of communality were
   partly responsible for the links between gender/university typicality
   and adjustment. Thus, the psychological benefits suggested to accrue
   from gender typicality may not be specific to gender, but rather may
   reflect the benefits of normativity in general. These findings were
   discussed in relation to the broader literature on the relation between
   identity and adjustment.

   Recent advances are both conceptual and methodological, and include
   analysis of some consequences of climate change that were heretofore
   intractable. In this article, I review a selection of these developments
   and represent them through a handful of illustrative cases. A key
   characteristic of the emerging areas of interest is a focus on
   understanding how human responses to direct impacts of climate change
   may cause important indirect and sometimes distant impacts. This
   realization underscores the need to develop integrated approaches for
   assessing and modeling impacts in an evolving socioeconomic and policy
   context.

AB Most research on future climate change discusses mitigation and

   implications for impacts and adaptation. Similarly, impacts and
   adaptation will affect mitigation. This paper begins to explore these
   two veins of research simultaneously using an integrated assessment
   model. We begin by discussing the types of interactions one might expect
   by impact sector. Then, we develop a numerical experiment in the
   agriculture sector to illustrate the importance of considering
   mitigation, impacts, and adaptation at the same time. In our experiment,
   we find that climate change can reduce crop yields, resulting in an
   expansion of cropland to feed a growing population and a reduction in
   bioenergy production. These two effects, in combination, result in an
   increase in the cost of mitigation.

AB Little is known about the health impact of helping behaviors among
   individuals with high-risk chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
   disease (CVD). Using a nationally representative, longitudinal survey,
   we examined the subsequent health of adults with CVD (n = 4,491) who
   spent time providing non-paid assistance to family and friends outside
   of their households compared with those who had provided no assistance.
   After both adjusting for baseline characteristics and using propensity
   score matching methods, spending up to 200 h over the prior 12 months
   helping others was associated with lower odds of experiencing a new CVD
   event or dying in the subsequent 2 years. Providing up to 100 h of
   assistance was associated with reporting fewer depressive symptoms. This
   threshold effect raises the question of whether assistance beyond a
   certain number of hours may impose a burden that mitigates health
   benefits from helping others. Health care providers could play an
   important role exploring ways that patients with CVD can provide
   beneficial levels of assistance to others in their own social networks
   or communities, thereby possibly also improving their own health.

AB Background Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important determinant of
   health, but SES measures are frequently unavailable in commonly used
   datasets. Area-level SES measures are used as proxy measures of
   individual SES when the individual measures are lacking. Little is known
   about the agreement between individual-level versus area-level SES
   measures in mixed urban-rural settings.
   Methods We identified SES agreement by comparing information from
   telephone self-reported SES levels and SES calculated from area-level
   SES measures. We assessed the impact of this agreement on reported
   associations between SES and rates of childhood obesity, low birth
   weight < 2500 g and smoking within the household in a mixed urban-rural
   setting.
   Results 750 households were surveyed with a response rate of 62%: 51%
   male, 89% Caucasian; mean child age 9.5 years. Individual-level
   self-reported income was more strongly associated with all three
   childhood health outcomes compared to area-level SES. We found
   significant disagreement rates of 22-31%. The weighted Cohen's. indices
   ranged from 0.15 to 0.22, suggesting poor agreement between
   individual-level and area-level measures.
   Conclusion In a mixed urban-rural setting comprised of both rural and
   urbanised areas, area-level SES proxy measures significantly disagree
   with individual SES measures, and have different patterns of association
   with health outcomes from individual-level SES measures. Area-level SES
   may be an unsuitable proxy for SES when individual rather than community
   characteristics are of primary concern.

AB Evidence suggests that people with autism rely less on holistic visual
   information than typical adults. The current studies examine this by
   investigating core visual processes that contribute to holistic
   processing namely, individuation and element grouping and how they
   develop in participants with autism and typically developing (TD)
   participants matched for age, IQ, and gender. Individuation refers to
   the ability to "see" approximately four elements simultaneously;
   grouping elements can modify how many elements can be individuated. We
   examined these processes using two well-established paradigms, rapid
   enumeration and multiple object tracking (MOT). In both tasks, a
   performance limit of four elements in typical adults is thought to
   reflect individuation capacity. Participants with autism displayed a
   smaller individuation capacity than TD controls, regardless of whether
   they were enumerating static elements or tracking moving ones. To
   manipulate the holistic information available via element grouping,
   elements were arranged into a design in rapid enumeration, or moved
   together in MOT. Performance in participants with autism was affected to
   a similar degree as TD participants by element grouping, whether the
   manipulation helped or hurt performance, consistent with evidence that
   some types of gestalt/grouping information are processed typically in
   autism. There was substantial development from childhood to adolescence
   in the speed of individuation in those with autism, but not from
   adolescence to adulthood, a pattern distinct from TD participants. These
   results reveal how core visual processes function in autism, and provide
   insight into the architecture of vision (i.e., individuation appears
   distinct from visual strengths in autism, such as visual search).

AB The advent of public sociology over the past decade represents the end
   of a string of crisis moments in sociology. Since the 1950s and,
   especially, the 1960s, sociology was argued to be in a crisis because
   the discipline was thought to be conservative and contributing to
   sustain the status quo. As a result, the 1970s witnessed a
   radicalization of sociology, but the 1980s saw a general decline of
   sociology. Upon a resurgence during the 1990s, the crisis advocates have
   come back with a vengeance in the form of a renewed commitment to a
   heavily politicized sociology under the heading of public sociology, a
   perspective that is now thoroughly institutionalized and widely
   embraced. In sociology, the effects of the 1960s thus began to be felt
   in earnest some 40 years late.

AB Social-learning theories of substance use propose that members of peer
   groups influence the drug use of other members by selectively modeling,
   reinforcing, and punishing either abstinence-related or drug-related
   behaviors. The objective of the present study was to examine the social
   influences on cocaine self-administration in isolated and socially
   housed rats, under conditions where the socially housed rats were tested
   simultaneously with their partner in the same chamber. To this end, male
   rats were obtained at weaning and housed in isolated or pair-housed
   conditions for 6 weeks. Rats were then implanted with intravenous
   catheters and cocaine self-administration was examined in custom-built
   operant conditioning chambers that allowed two rats to be tested
   simultaneously. For some socially housed subjects, both rats had
   simultaneous access to cocaine; for others, only one rat of the pair had
   access to cocaine. An econometric analysis was applied to the data, and
   the reinforcing strength of cocaine was measured by examining
   consumption (i.e. quantity demanded) and elasticity of demand as a
   function of price, which was manipulated by varying the dose and ratio
   requirements on a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. Cocaine
   consumption decreased as a function of price in all groups. Elasticity
   of demand did not vary across groups, but consumption was significantly
   lower in socially housed rats paired with a rat without access to
   cocaine. These data suggest that the presence of an abstaining peer
   decreases the reinforcing strength of cocaine, thus supporting the
   development of social interventions in drug abuse prevention and
   treatment programs. Behavioural Pharmacology 24:114-123 (C) 2013 Wolters

AB Undernutrition during critical or sensitive prenatal periods may
   'program' the fetus for increased chronic disease and mortality in later
   life. Using birth cohorts that were or were not exposed to severe food
   shortage in Utah in the mid-19th century, this study examines how in
   utero exposure to undernutrition is associated with mortality after age
   50. The Utah Population Database is used to identify 1392 prenatally
   exposed individuals and 29,022 individuals from subsequent, unexposed
   birth cohorts. Gompertz hazards with parametric frailty show that males
   born between April and June of the famine period (and hence exposed
   during critical periods in utero during the winter months) have higher
   mortality risks compared with post-famine cohorts. Alternative Cox
   non-proportional hazard models suggest that females born during the same
   period have higher initial mortality risks (starting at age 50) that
   decline over time creating a mortality crossover with unexposed women at
   approximately age 70, a result not found for men. An ancillary sibling
   analysis that uses shared frailty survival models to compare individuals
   with prenatal exposure to undernutrition to their younger (post-famine)
   same-sex siblings finds no significant differences in adult mortality
   for males but the pattern for females support the findings from the
   previous analysis. Although findings are sensitive to model choice, this
   study presents evidence that is consistent with an association between
   undernutrition in utero and adult mortality, shows that effects may be
   sensitive to the duration and gestational period of exposure, and
   illustrates the differential exposure effects between genders.

AB We previously developed and validated an index of socioeconomic status
   (SES) termed HOUSES (housing-based index of socioeconomic status) based
   on real property data. In this study, we assessed whether HOUSES
   overcomes the absence of SES measures in medical records and is
   associated with risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children.
   We conducted a population-based case-control study of children in
   Olmsted County, MN, diagnosed with IPD (1995-2005). Each case was
   age-and gender-matched to two controls. HOUSES was derived using a
   previously reported algorithm from publicly available housing attributes
   (the higher HOUSES, the higher the SES). HOUSES was available for 92.3%
   (n=97) and maternal education level for 43% (n=45). HOUSES was inversely
   associated with risk of IPD in unmatched analysis [odds ratio (OR) 0.22,
   95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.89, P=0.034], whereas maternal
   education was not (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.50-1.19, P=0.24). HOUSES may be
   useful for overcoming a paucity of conventional SES measures in commonly
   used datasets in epidemiological research.

AB The most important proximal outcomes for residents of therapeutic
   communities (TCs) are retention and successful completion of the
   program. At this point there has been no quantitative analysis of the
   relationship between the exchange of corrective reminders, or pull-ups,
   between peers in TCs and graduation. This study draws on a database of
   pull-ups exchanged between 5464 residents of three midwestem TCs.
   Residents who send more pull-ups to peers and who reciprocate pull-ups
   with a larger percentage of peers are more likely to graduate. Residents
   who receive more pull-ups from peers and staff and a larger percentage
   of whose peers reciprocate pull-ups that they send are less likely to
   graduate. Implications of these findings for program theory and program

AB Though the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Southeastern Europe is one of low
   reported prevalence, numerous studies have described the pervasiveness
   of medical providers' lack of knowledge of HIV/AIDS in the Balkans. This
   study sought to culturally adapt an instrument to assess medical
   providers' knowledge of and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS in Albania.
   Cultural adaptation was completed through development of a survey from
   previously validated instruments, translation of the survey into
   Albanian, blinded back translation, expert committee review of the draft
   instrument, focus group pre-testing with community- and University
   Hospital Center of Tirana-based physicians and nurses, and test-retest
   reliability testing. Blinded back translation of the instrument
   supported the initial translation with slight changes to the idiomatic
   and conceptual equivalences. Focus group pre-testing generally supported
   the instrument, yet some experiential and idiomatic changes were
   implemented. Based on unweighted kappa and/or prevalence adjusted bias
   adjusted kappa (PABAK), 20 of the 43 questions were deemed statistically
   significant at kappa and/or PABAK >= 0.5, while 12 others did not cross
   zero on the 95% confidence interval for kappa, indicating their probable
   significance. Subsequently, an instrument to assess medical providers'
   knowledge of and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS for an Albanian population
   was developed which can be expanded within Albania and potentially to
   other countries within the Balkans, which have an Albanian-speaking
   population.

AB Social life is regulated by norms of fairness that constrain selfish
   behavior. While a substantial body of scholarship on prosocial behavior
   has provided evidence of such norms, large inter- and intra-personal
   variation in prosocial behavior still needs to be explained. The article
   identifies two social-structural dimensions along which people's
   generosity varies systematically: group attachment and social position.
   We conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 2,597 members of
   producer organizations in rural Uganda. Using different variants of the
   dictator game, we demonstrate that group attachment positively affects
   prosocial behavior, and that this effect is not simply the by-product of
   the degree of proximity between individuals. Second, we show that
   occupying a formal position in an organization or community leads to
   greater generosity toward in-group members. Taken together, our findings
   show that prosocial behavior is not an invariant social trait; rather,
   it varies according to individuals' relative position in the social
   structure.

AB Background: The United States Department of Defense participates in more
   than 500 missions every year, including humanitarian assistance and
   disaster relief, as part of medical stability operations. This study
   assessed perceptions of active-duty physicians regarding these
   activities and related these findings to the retention and overall
   satisfaction of healthcare professionals.
   Methods and Findings: An Internet-based survey was developed and
   validated. Of the 667 physicians who responded to the survey, 47% had
   participated in at least one mission. On a 7-point, Likert-type response
   scale, physicians reported favorable overall satisfaction with their
   participation in these missions (mean = 5.74). Perceived benefit was
   greatest for the United States (mean = 5.56) and self (mean = 5.39)
   compared to the target population (mean = 4.82). These perceptions were
   related to participants' intentions to extend their military medical
   service (total model R-2 =.37), with the strongest predictors being
   perceived benefit to self (beta =.21, p <.01), the U. S. (beta =.19, p
   <.01), and satisfaction (beta =.18, p <.05). In addition, Air Force
   physicians reported higher levels of satisfaction (mean = 6.10) than
   either Army (mean = 5.27, Cohen's d = 0.75, p <.001) or Navy (mean =
   5.60, Cohen's d = 0.46, p <.01) physicians.
   Conclusions: Military physicians are largely satisfied with humanitarian
   missions, reporting the greatest benefit of such activities for
   themselves and the United States. Elucidation of factors that may
   increase the perceived benefit to the target populations is warranted.
   Satisfaction and perceived benefits of humanitarian missions were
   positively correlated with intentions to extend time in service. These
   findings could inform the larger humanitarian community as well as
   military medical practices for both recruiting and retaining medical
   professionals.

AB The psychological capacity to recognize that others may hold and act on
   false beliefs has been proposed to reflect an evolved, species-typical
   adaptation for social reasoning in humans; however, controversy
   surrounds the developmental timing and universality of this trait.
   Cross-cultural studies using elicited-response tasks indicate that the
   age at which children begin to understand false beliefs ranges from 4 to
   7 years across societies, whereas studies using spontaneous-response
   tasks with Western children indicate that false-belief understanding
   emerges much earlier, consistent with the hypothesis that false-belief
   understanding is a psychological adaptation that is universally present
   in early childhood. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used three
   spontaneous-response tasks that have revealed early false-belief
   understanding in the West to test young children in three traditional,
   non-Western societies: Salar (China), Shuar/Colono (Ecuador) and Yasawan
   (Fiji). Results were comparable with those from the West, supporting the
   hypothesis that false-belief understanding reflects an adaptation that
   is universally present early in development.

AB We set out to examine the material, psychological, and sociological
   pathways mediating the income gradient in health and mortality. We used
   the 2008 General Social Survey-National Death Index dataset (N =
   26,870), which contains three decades of social survey data in the US
   linked to thirty years of mortality follow-up. We grouped a large number
   of variables into 3 domains: material, psychological, and sociological
   using factor analysis. We then employed discrete-time hazard models to
   examine the extent to which these three domains mediated the
   income-mortality association among men and women. Overall, the gradient
   was weaker for females than for males. While psychological and material
   factors explained mortality hazards among females, hazards among males
   were explained only by social capital. Poor health significantly
   predicted both income and mortality, particularly among females,
   suggesting a strong role for reverse causation. We also find that many
   traditional associations between income and mortality are absent in this
   dataset, such as perceived social status.

AB Background: Previous research has identified elevated social adjustment
   and frequent religious attendance as protective against depression. The
   present study aims to examine the association of frequency of religious
   services attendance with subsequent depression, while accounting for the
   effects of social adjustment.
   Method: Participants were 173 adult offspring of depressed and
   nondepressed parents, followed longitudinally over 25 years. Diagnosis
   was assessed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
   Lifetime Version. The Social Adjustment Scale Self Report (SAS-SR) was
   used to assess social adjustment and frequency of religious services
   attendance was self-reported. In a logistic regression analysis, major
   depression at 20 years was used as the outcome measure and the frequency
   of religious services attendance and social adjustment variables at 10
   years as predictors.
   Results: Frequent religious services attendance was found to protect
   against subsequent depression at a trend level. High functioning social
   adjustment was found to protect against subsequent depression,
   especially within the immediate and extended family. Adults without a
   depressed parent who reported attending religious services atleast once
   a month had a lower likelihood of subsequent depression. Among adults
   with a depressed parent, those with high functioning social adjustment
   had a lower likelihood of subsequent depression.
   Limitations: Measurement of social adjustment was non-specific to
   religious services.
   Conclusions: Frequent religious attendance may protect against major
   depression, independent from the effects of social adjustment. This
   protective quality may be attenuated in adults with a depressed parent.
   High functioning social adjustment may be protective only among
   offspring of depressed parents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Background: High technology in the field of interventional cardiology
   applied in tertiary hospitals has brought enormous benefits in the
   treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD). However, IHD mortality rates
   remain high. We analyzed the relationship between IHD mortality rate and
   the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic conditions in 399 cities
   in Parana state, Brazil, from 2006 to 2010.
   Methods and Results: Data were obtained from the Mortality Information
   System and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and
   evaluated through Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis. GeoDa (TM) was used
   to analyze 29.351 deaths across 399 cities. We found a positive spatial
   autocorrelation regarding IHD mortality (I = 0.5913, p = 0.001). There
   was a significant positive association between each of three
   socioeconomic and demographic indicators and IHD mortality rate:
   Population Elderly Index (I = 0.3436), Illiteracy Rate (I = 0.1873) and
   City Development Index (I = 0.0900). In addition, two indicators
   presented significant negative association with IHD mortality rate:
   Adjusted Population Size (I = -0.1216) and Gross Domestic Product (I =
   -0.0864). We also found a positive association between IHD mortality
   rates and the geographic distances between patients' city of residence
   and their corresponding regional referral centers in interventional
   cardiology (I = 0.3368). Cities located within Regional Health Units
   with Reference Interventional Cardiology Center presented a
   significantly lower average specific mortality rate by IHD. The high
   mortality rate by IHD within the Regional Health Units was not
   restricted to socioeconomic and demographic variables, but dependent on
   the distance between each city and their reference interventional
   cardiology center.
   Conclusions: We conclude that geographic factors play a significant role
   in IHD mortality within cities. These findings have important policy
   implications regarding the geographic distribution of cardiac health
   care networks in Latin America and in other emerging countries.

AB A diagnosis of cancer and subsequent treatments place demands on
   psychological adaptation. Behavioral research suggests the importance of
   cognitive, behavioral, and social factors in facilitating adaptation
   during active treatment and throughout cancer survivorship, which forms
   the rationale for the use of many psychosocial interventions in cancer
   patients. This cancer experience may also affect physiological
   adaptation systems (e.g., neuroendocrine) in parallel with psychological
   adaptation changes (negative affect). Changes in adaptation may alter
   tumor growth-promoting processes (increased angiogenesis, migration and
   invasion, and inflammation) and tumor defense processes (decreased
   cellular immunity) relevant for cancer progression and the quality of
   life of cancer patients. Some evidence suggests that psychosocial
   intervention can improve psychological and physiological adaptation
   indicators in cancer patients. However, less is known about whether
   these interventions can influence tumor activity and tumor
   growth-promoting processes and whether changes in these processes could
   explain the psychosocial intervention effects on recurrence and survival
   documented to date. Documenting that psychosocial interventions can
   modulate molecular activities (e.g., transcriptional indicators of cell
   signaling) that govern tumor promoting and tumor defense processes on
   the one hand, and clinical disease course on the other is a key
   challenge for biobehavioral oncology research. This mini-review will
   summarize current knowledge on psychological and physiological
   adaptation processes affected throughout the stress of the cancer
   experience, and the effects of psychosocial interventions on
   psychological adaptation, cancer disease progression, and changes in
   stress-related biobehavioral processes that may mediate intervention
   effects on clinical cancer outcomes. Very recent intervention work in
   breast cancer will be used to illuminate emerging trends in molecular
   probes of interest in the hope of highlighting future paths that could
   move the field of biobehavioral oncology intervention research forward.

AB Research in animals has shown that early life experience, particularly
   parenting behaviors, influences later-life stress reactivity. Despite
   the tremendous relevance of this finding to human development and brain
   function, it has not been tested prospectively in humans. In this study
   two aspects of parenting were measured at age 4 in a sample of healthy,
   low socioeconomic status, African American children, and stress
   reactivity was measured in the same children 11-14 years later using a
   modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (n = 55). Salivary
   cortisol was measured before, during and after the stressor and data
   were analyzed using piecewise hierarchical linear modeling. Parental
   responsivity, independent of the use of physical discipline, was
   positively related to cortisol reactivity. Effects were independent of
   subjective appraisals of the stressor and were also independent of other
   environmental risk factors and current psychosocial functioning.
   Therefore this study demonstrates in a novel and precise fashion that
   early childhood parental responsivity prospectively and independently
   predicts stress reactivity in adolescence.

AB Importance: Surveillance systems for elucidating the burden of
   hypoglycemia are limited.
   Objective: To quantify experiences of hypoglycemia and related harms,
   members of an international online diabetes social network with
   insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were polled through a software
   application ("app"). Aggregate results were returned to participants
   through network channels.
   Design: The study period was from March 2011 through April 2012, during
   which time retrospective reports about experiences with hypoglycemia and
   related harms were collected from participants using the app.
   Setting: The study was undertaken within the TuDiabetes.org
   international online diabetes social network.
   Participants: Eligibility criteria included TuDiabetes membership, age
   13 years or older, a self-reported diagnosis of diabetes mellitus,
   ability to read and write English, and Internet access. Of 2827 app
   users, 687 (response rate, 24.3%) opted in to the volunteer sample.
   Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes included the following:
   frequency of "going low" (having a low glucose value in the past 2
   weeks) and episodes of severe hypoglycemia (in the past 12 months), and,
   for respondents reporting recent and/or severe hypoglycemia, lifetime
   experience of vehicle crashes or severe medical injury, daily
   debilitating worry, and withdrawal from driving, exercise, sex, and
   going outside of the home to avoid hypoglycemia and consequences.
   Secondary outcomes included measures of research engagement.
   Results: Of 613 respondents (24.3% of app users), 49.1% reported more
   than 4 episodes of "going low" in the past 2 weeks and 29.2% reported 1
   or more severe low in the past year; 16.6% reported both more than 4
   recent low episodes and 1 or more severe event in the past year. Harms
   were common, including daily debilitating worry (45.8%), vehicle crash
   or injury (15.0%), and withdrawal from exercise, driving, leaving home,
   and having sex (54.0%, 37.4%, 24.8%, and 22.7%, respectively). Of all
   respondents, 54.2% reported multiple harms, the risks for which were
   highest (73.7%) among respondents with a past-year severe event (odds
   ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.60-3.58; P < .001 controlling for frequent recent
   low episodes and demographic and disease factors). Engagement was high,
   with 96.6% of the sample permitting re-ontact for research and 31.7%
   posting personal study data on their app profile page; 40.5% of 2825
   unique page views of research-related materials published on the
   community site involved views of returned research results.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Participatory surveillance of hypoglycemia in
   an online diabetes social network enables characterization of
   patient-centered harms in a community sample and bidirectional
   communication with affected persons, augmenting traditional
   surveillance.

AB Objective: Differences between women and men in political and economic
   empowerment, education, and health risks are well-documented. Similar
   gender inequities in access to care and medicines have been hypothesized
   but evidence is lacking.
   Methods: We analyzed 2002 World Health Survey data for 257,922 adult
   respondents and 80,932 children less than 5 years old from 53 mostly low
   and middle-income countries. We constructed indicators of need for,
   access to, and perceptions of care, and we described the number of
   countries with equal and statistically different proportions of women
   and men for each indicator. Using multivariate logistic regression
   models, we estimated effects of gender on our study outcomes, overall
   and by household poverty.
   Findings: Women reported significantly more need for care for three of
   six chronic conditions surveyed, and they were more likely to have at
   least one of the conditions (OR 1.41 [95% CI 1.38, 1.44]). Among those
   with reported need for care, there were no consistent differences in
   access to care between women and men overall (e. g., treatment for all
   reported chronic conditions, OR 1.00 [0.96, 1.04]) or by household
   poverty. Of concern, access to care for chronic conditions was
   distressingly low among both men and women in many countries, as was
   access to preventive services among boys and girls less than 5 years
   old.
   Conclusions: These cross-country results do not suggest a systematic
   disadvantage of women in access to curative care and medicines for
   treating selected chronic conditions or acute symptoms, or to preventive
   services among boys and girls.

AB Social movements rely in large measure on networked communication
   technologies to organize and disseminate information relating to the
   movements' objectives. In this work we seek to understand how the goals
   and needs of a protest movement are reflected in the geographic patterns
   of its communication network, and how these patterns differ from those
   of stable political communication. To this end, we examine an online
   communication network reconstructed from over 600,000 tweets from a
   thirty-six week period covering the birth and maturation of the American
   anticapitalist movement, Occupy Wall Street. We find that, compared to a
   network of stable domestic political communication, the Occupy Wall
   Street network exhibits higher levels of locality and a hub and spoke
   structure, in which the majority of non-local attention is allocated to
   high-profile locations such as New York, California, and Washington D.
   C. Moreover, we observe that information flows across state boundaries
   are more likely to contain framing language and references to the media,
   while communication among individuals in the same state is more likely
   to reference protest action and specific places and times. Tying these
   results to social movement theory, we propose that these features
   reflect the movement's efforts to mobilize resources at the local level
   and to develop narrative frames that reinforce collective purpose at the
   national level.

AB The surprising social phenomena of the Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall

   committed groups may produce political changes of significant
   importance. Under what conditions are the convictions of a minority
   going to dominate the future direction of a society? We address this
   question with the help of a Cooperative Decision Making model (CDMM)
   which has been shown to generate consensus through a phase-transition
   process. We observe that in a system of a finite size the global
   consensus state is not permanent and times of crisis occur when there is
   an ambiguity concerning a given social issue. The correlation function
   within the cooperative system becomes similarly extended as it is
   observed at criticality. This combination of independence (free will)
   and long-range correlation makes it possible for very small but
   committed minorities to produce substantial changes in social consensus.

AB In the last decade, progressive Christians have been mounting an
   increasingly perceptible challenge to the 'Christian right' in the
   United States. New organizations and websites are cropping up, a
   wellspring of books are being published, and long-standing progressive
   writers and theologians are garnering more attention and support than
   ever before. Despite significant advances, however, the impact of the
   'religious left' in the American public sphere is still limited. In this
   paper, I ask why. Based on participant observation, discourse analysis,
   and in-depth interviews, and using a multidimensional culturalist
   perspective rooted in Durkheimian and Weberian ideas, I explore the
   symbolic dynamics of the Christian 'left'. I argue that in addition to
   their structural disadvantages, progressive Christians face thorny
   dilemmas regarding authority/legitimacy, rationalization,
   demystification, disenchantment, charisma (or the lack thereof), and
   profanation that, though not insurmountable, are not easily resolved.

AB This paper examines three discussions in the American public sphere
   between 1998 and 2008 about whether irony is good for America: the
   response to a 1999 book against irony, the declared 'death of irony'
   after the events of September 11, 2001, and concerns about the ironic
   nature of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. After reviewing the
   literature on irony from various academic disciplines, the author shows
   how 'knockers' worried that irony was a counter-narrative that would
   distract from romantic progress, while 'boosters' claimed irony was a
   trope that could only strengthen the romantic story of the nation.
   Rather than answering the title question, the author uses the evidence
   of these 'ironic crises' to show how such questions reveal the cultural
   forms and reflexivity that structure the American public sphere.

AB The concept of the national is often perceived, both in public and
   academic discourse as the central obstacle for the realization of
   cosmopolitan orientations. Consequently, debates about the nation tend
   to revolve around its persistence or its demise. We depart from this
   either-or perspective by investigating the formation of the
   'cosmopolitan nation' as a facet of world risk society. Modern
   collectivities are increasingly preoccupied with debating, preventing
   and managing risks. However, unlike earlier manifestations of risk
   characterized by daring actions or predictability models, global risks
   can no longer be calculated or forecast. Accordingly, more influence
   accrues to the perception of risk, largely constructed by media
   representations. Cosmopolitanized risk collectivities are engendered
   through the anticipation of endangered futures which are, for the most
   part, communicated through an increasingly global media scape. While
   global media events produce shared exposure, risk conceptions retain
   distinctive political-cultural features as their respective meanings are
   prefigured by path-dependent pasts. Nevertheless, the promulgation of
   risk societies, we argue, results in a reimagination of nationhood which
   takes place in the context of: global norms (e. g. human rights);
   globalized markets; transnational migrations; global generations and
   their embeddedness in civil society movements; and the local
   interpenetration of world religions to name but a few of the global
   backdrops shaping new associational intersections. We develop our
   argument in four interrelated steps. Contrary to essentialized notions
   of nationalism or universal versions of cosmopolitanism, we address the
   cosmopolitan reconfiguration of nationhood by differentiating between
   presumptions of thick belonging and the actual proliferation of
   cosmopolitan affiliations. In a second step we overcome the territorial
   fixation of the social sciences by shifting our attention to temporal
   dimensions, with a particular focus on competing conceptions of the
   future. In a third step we demonstrate how these cosmopolitan
   transformations of nationhood are taking place in the context of a world
   risk society regime that marshals a set of cosmopolitan imperatives
   situating the global other in our midst. In a fourth step we illustrate
   these developments by exploring how the mediatization of risk, and
   concomitant notions of the future, contribute to the reimagination of
   cosmopolitan risk collectivities.

   companies commercialising these tests and the social expectations they
   feed on? From a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the websites
   offering such tests for health, it appears that these companies have
   based their expansion on a triple-branch market: 'healthism',
   contemporary claims revolving around the individuation of 'biopolitics',
   and biosocial bonding. Each of these three marketing strategies raises a
   number of socio-ethical issues that require careful consideration in the
   face of an unprecedented surge of the genetic testing market.

   what we will need in an era of health-care reform to promote health
   across the life course. We address this imperative by offering a
   relevant curriculum through a public-health lens, designed especially
   for university undergraduate students. Unlike the traditional
   educational focus on graduate students who are already committed to a
   career in the health professions, the students in our sights have little
   prior exposure to the course content and are still largely uncertain of
   their career plans. We believe this proposed course will help students
   understand aging processes as these evolve over time, understand the

   promote their own health, and make a social contract to do so for

   stimulate long-term changes in beliefs and norms, creating and

   It is often the short-term acceptability of potential policies, rather
   than their longer-term efficacy, that determines their scope and
   deployment. The policy process should include a consideration of both
   timescales. The academy, however, has provided insufficient insight on
   the coevolution of social norms and different policy instruments, thus
   compromising the ability of decisionmakers to craft effective solutions
   to the society's most intractable environmental problems. Life
   scientists could make fundamental contributions to this agenda through

   Student Health Survey (GSHS) in Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia
   between 2006 and 2008, was conducted using multiple logistic regression
   models. About 60% of students in Egypt and one-third of students in
   Libya, Morocco and Tunisia reported having been bullied in the past
   month. In all 4 countries, boys reported more peer victimization than
   girls. In Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, students who reported that their
   parents checked their homework, were understanding, and knew how the
   student spent free time had a reduced likelihood of peer victimization
   but this association was not significant in Libya. Interventions for
   reducing bullying should consider the positive impact of involved
   parents.

AB In the latter half of the 20th century, countries abolished the death
   penalty en masse. What factors help to explain this global trend?
   Conventional analyses explain abolition by focusing primarily on state
   level political processes. This article contributes to these studies by
   analyzing world cultural factors that lend to the abolition trend. The
   main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto
   cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of
   the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights
   regime, represents a significant driver of states' abolition. Countries'
   predominant religion is also found to significantly affect the
   probability of abolition: predominantly Catholic nation-states are most
   likely to abolish the death penalty, and predominantly Muslim
   nation-states are least likely to abolish. These findings provide
   evidence for world cultural factors that structure the abolition trend
   globally.

AB Comparative historical methods are used to explain the transformation of
   the U. S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The
   analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level
   narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but
   interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex
   interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps
   explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically,
   over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy,
   and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political
   innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to
   increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to
   respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In
   turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime
   control politics and policies at the national level that reflected
   historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.

AB Faces convey important information about the social environment, and
   even very young infants are preferentially attentive to face-like over
   non-face stimuli. Eye-tracking studies have allowed researchers to
   examine which features of faces infants find most salient across
   development, and the present study examined scanning of familiar (i.e.,
   mother) and unfamiliar (i.e., stranger) static faces at 6, 9, and 12
   months of age. Infants showed a preference for scanning their mother's
   face as compared to a stranger's face, and displayed increased attention
   to the eye region as compared to the mouth region. Infants also showed
   patterns of decreased attention to eyes and increased attention to
   mouths between 6 and 12 months. Associations between visual attention at
   6, 9, and 12 months and the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales
   DP (CSBS-DP) at 18 months were also examined, and a significant positive
   relation between attention to eyes at 6 months and the social subscale
   of the CSBS-DP at 18 months was found. This effect was driven by
   infants' attention to their mother's eyes. No relations between face
   scanning in 9- and 12-month-olds and social outcome at 18 months were
   found. The potential for using individual differences in early infant
   face processing to predict later social outcome is discussed.

AB Demand for public games of chance was examined over a 24-year period,
   across various contexts of the prevailing gaming environment that
   included significant political and economic events. Lottery sales trends
   revealed devaluation of large jackpots beyond that due to inflation as
   they became more common, with the steepest discounting in the largest
   prizes. At the highest levels, jackpots continued to induce demand in
   games after they were claimed. The 2009 recession correlated with
   decreased demand for some gambling options but not for others; together
   with departures from matching between game odds and sales, this suggests
   that different games served different functions for their players. There
   was no evidence that public gambling baselines in Oregon were disrupted
   by the 2001 terrorist attacks. Despite several limitations, these data
   implicate behavioral influences, including habituation, induction,
   motivating operations, and matching within public gambling, consistent
   with the Behavioral Perspective Model of consumer choice.

AB In this paper, we examine the implementation and difficulties when
   conducting genetics research in a rural, traditional West African
   culture within the frame of the United States' grounded research ethics.
   Research challenges are highlighted by Western researchers following
   U.S. Institutional Review Board (IRB dagger) guidelines and practices in
   a non-Western country. IRB concepts are culture bound in Western ideals
   that may not have synchronicity and compatibility with non-Western
   cultures. Differences in sociocultural norms, traditions, language, and
   geography were influencing factors that can affect application of IRB
   principles. Suggestions for change are offered, which will potentially
   aid researchers considering application of IRB requirements when
   conducting research in non-Westernized, non-industrialized countries.

AB Mexican policymakers instituted community-based health programs in the
   1940s and 1950s to encourage rural participation in state-sponsored
   health and economic development initiatives. The Tepalcatepec Commission
   (1947-1961) united previously independent government programs into a
   multi-tiered collaboration that addressed regional development through
   national, state, and local networks. While national policymakers and
   state officials designed plans to improve agricultural production,
   promote industrialization, utilize the area's natural resources, and
   expand communication channels, health workers established unprecedented
   relationships with indigenous community members by introducing the
   Commission's projects in culturally relevant ways. They used their
   on-the-ground experiences to learn local languages, customs, and
   beliefs, and incorporated these factors into their health education and
   disease treatment campaigns. The result serves as an example of
   short-term cooperative relationships between healthcare workers and
   indigenous groups that not only reduced the major health risks in the
   area, but also paved the way for collective economic development.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although children living in Puerto Rico have
   the highest asthma prevalence of all US children, little is known
   regarding the quality-of-care disparities they experience nor the
   adaptability of existing asthma evidence-based interventions to reduce
   these disparities. The objective of this study was to describe our
   experience in reducing quality-of-care disparities among Puerto Rican
   children with asthma by adapting 2 existing evidence-based asthma
   interventions.
   METHODS: We describe our experience in adapting and implementing 2
   previously tested asthma evidence-based interventions: the Yes We Can
   program and the Inner-City Asthma Study intervention. We assessed the
   feasibility of combining key components of the 2 interventions to reduce
   asthma symptoms and estimated the potential cost savings associated with
   reductions in asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency department
   visits. A total of 117 children with moderate and severe asthma
   participated in the 12-month intervention in 2 housing projects in San
   Juan, Puerto Rico. A community-academic team with the necessary
   technical and cultural competences adapted and implemented the
   intervention.
   RESULTS: Our case study revealed the feasibility of implementing the
   combined intervention, henceforth referred to as La Red intervention, in
   the selected Puerto Rican communities experiencing a disproportionately
   high level of asthma burden. After 1-year follow-up, La Red intervention
   significantly reduced asthma symptoms and exceeded reductions of the
   original interventions. Asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency
   department use, and their associated high costs, were also significantly
   reduced.
   CONCLUSIONS: Asthma evidence-based interventions can be adapted to
   improve quality of care for children with asthma in a different cultural
   community setting. Pediatrics 2013; 131:S26-S37

AB Background: A study from Scotland reported that the p53 mutation
   frequency in breast tumors is associated with socioeconomic deprivation.
   Methods: We analyzed the association of the tumor p53 mutational status
   with tumor characteristics, education, and self-reported annual
   household income (HI) among 173 breast cancer patients from the greater
   Baltimore area, United States.
   Results: p53 mutational frequency was significantly associated with HI.
   Patients with < $15,000 HI had the highest p53 mutation frequency (21%),
   followed by the income group between $15,000 and $60,000 (18%), while
   those above $60,000 HI had the fewest mutations (5%). When dichotomized
   at $60,000, 26 out of 135 patients in the low income category had
   acquired a p53 mutation, while only 2 out of 38 with a high income
   carried a mutation (P<0.05). In the adjusted logistic regression
   analysis with 3 income categories (trend test), the association between
   HI and p53 mutational status was independent of tumor characteristics,
   age, race/ethnicity, tobacco smoking and body mass. Further analyses
   revealed that HI may impact the p53 mutational frequency preferentially
   in patients who develop an estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease.
   Within this group, 42% of the low income patients (<$15,000 HI) carried
   a mutation, followed by the middle income group (21%), while those above
   $60,000 HI did not carry mutations (P-trend < 0.05).
   Conclusions: HI is associated with the p53 mutational frequency in
   patients who develop an ER-negative disease. Furthermore, high income
   patients may acquire fewer p53 mutations than other patients, suggesting
   that lifetime exposures associated with socio-economic status may impact
   breast cancer biology.

AB This study provides an analysis for the development of the intercultural
   relations (IR) discipline by using the references of the highest cited
   IR records in Thompson Reuter's Web of Science (WoS) database. Using
   comprehensive searching and manual coding, a highly specific dataset
   representing the IR discipline is constructed and described. In terms of
   authors, citations to John Berry's and Colleen Ward's works are on the
   rise while citations to William Gudykunst and Richard Brislin are
   declining. The International Journal of Intercultural Relations (IJIR)
   is found to be the most cited journal in the past 30 years. The classic
   texts such as Culture's Consequences (Hofstede, 1980, 2001) and Beyond
   Culture (Hall, 1976) are still highly cited in the field after many
   decades. Psychology, communication, and sociology are found to be highly
   influential disciplines. Psychology continues to contribute the majority
   of references. References are decreasing in the field of communication
   and increasing in the fields of medicine and business. The trend of this
   change over time is quantified and shown to be statistically
   significant. The analysis also shows that the top six influential
   disciplines are psychology, business, the biomedical sciences,
   sociology, communication and anthropology. The groups studied in the top
   cited articles in WoS are biased toward those in the United States.
   Lastly, this study uses co-citation analysis to show that IR
   publications bridge multiple disciplines as expected for this
   interdisciplinary field. The caveats of this type of bibliometric study
   on a field such as IR are discussed, and plans for more comprehensive
   approaches are developed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A perennial concern among scholars of globalization is the relationship
   between global social formations and national and subnational political
   and economic developments. While sociological understanding of "the
   global" has become increasingly rich, stressing the complex relationship
   between material and cultural pressures, an undertheorized nation state
   often sits on the receiving end of the sociologist's model of
   globalization. The goal of this article is to help move the sociology of
   globalization out of the analytical trap of global-national dualism by
   developing an account of the transnationalization of political
   authority. Building on neo-Marxist and Weberian theories of the
   transnational, or global state, which explicate the macro-structural
   dynamics that have led to the transnationalization of the state as such,
   I look at the process of the transnationalization of political authority
   from an institutional perspective, one that focuses on processes of
   transnationalization within, and across, specific state agencies. These
   theoretical points are empirically motivated through an historical
   investigation of the transnationalization of monetary authority and its
   relationship to the international diffusion of policies of austerity
   from the era of the classical gold standard through the economic crisis
   of 2008.

AB While new scholarship on Pierre Bourdieu has recovered his early work on
   Algeria, this essay excavates his early thoughts on colonialism.
   Contrary to received wisdom, Bourdieu did in fact offer a theory of
   colonialism and a systematic understanding of its effects and logics.
   Bourdieu portrayed colonialism as a racialized system of domination,
   backed by force, which restructures social relations and creates hybrid
   cultures. His theory entailed insights on the limits and promises of
   colonial reform, anticolonial revolution, and postcolonial liberation.
   Bourdieu's early thinking on colonialism drew upon but extended French
   colonial studies of the time. It also contains the seeds of later
   concepts like habitus, field, and reflexive sociology while prefiguring
   more recent disciplinary postcolonial studies. Bourdieusian sociology in
   this sense originates not just as a study of Algeria but more
   specifically a critique of colonialism. It can be seen as contributing
   to the larger project of postcolonial sociology.

AB A large body of research has revealed that social support helps buffer
   the negative consequences of stressful life events. Yet research also
   suggests that social support exchanges involve complex interpersonal
   dynamics. Using in-depth interview data from 76 parents of paediatric
   cancer patients in the US, the findings demonstrate that parents
   experienced difficulty sustaining support after the diagnosis crisis,
   uncertainty about how to ask for the support they needed and challenges
   managing support efforts. Given these complexities in negotiating social
   support, this article examines the mechanics of effective social support
   exchanges. The findings show the importance of the nature of the
   pre-existing relationship between the support recipient and provider, as
   well as the interactions throughout the period of support. For example,
   parents found support efforts that involved frequent interactions and
   involvement in families' daily lives (such as help with childcare) most
   effective when the support provider was a close network member. In
   contrast, support offered from members of extended networks was most
   effective when the effort required little marshalling from the parents,
   did not need to be asked for and did not intrude in the families'
   private lives. These findings contribute to the medical sociology and
   social support literature by analysing the conditions under which
   effective support efforts are marshalled.

AB In the twenty-first century, the goals of mankind are evolving from
   rising prosperity to attaining long-range sustainable survival in an
   acceptable state. Such change will lead to a paradigm shift predicted by
   Thomas Kuhn. This situation motivates two novel generalized systems,
   Risk-Constrained Optimization (RCO) and its derivative, Risk-Constrained
   Optimization/Decision Network (RCO/DN). RCO aims for flexible and robust
   strategies across large ranges of scenarios and risks. It assumes that
   for any "serious'' (complex and long-range) planning and decision-making
   problem, externalities are important and uncertainty is radical.
   Therefore, it rejects the very concept of the correct or the best
   strategy, replacing it with a strategy that is the most acceptable to
   decision-maker(s). RCO considers decision-support systems, models, and
   algorithms to be tools of analysis, rather than methods of selection of
   the best. It replaces the artificial and risky paradigm of maximization
   by a cautious natural and evolutionary paradigm of catastrophe
   avoidance. RCO filters out the worst and riskiest candidate strategies,
   leaving for judgmental selection a small set of flexible, robust, and
   reasonably safe strategies. For that purpose, RCO employs enhanced
   stochastic multiscenario (ESMS) models, transforming them into
   optimizing filters. It is important that this operation is achieved in
   accordance with a new principle-changing the overall solution by
   affecting the values of scenario-specific, rather than general, outcome
   variables. Furthermore, RCO screens decisions and strategies by several
   synthetic criteria in a framework of novel strategic frontiers. Thus,
   RCO embeds ESMS into an ensemble of mutually supporting risk management
   techniques, legitimizing high-level analytical use of a computer plus
   optimization model combination.

AB Perceived failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has prompted
   interest in avoiding the harms of climate change via geoengineering,
   that is, the intentional manipulation of Earth system processes. Perhaps
   the most promising geoengineering technique is stratospheric aerosol
   injection (SAI), which reflects incoming solar radiation, thereby
   lowering surface temperatures. This paper analyzes a scenario in which
   SAI brings great harm on its own. The scenario is based on the issue of
   SAI intermittency, in which aerosol injection is halted, sending
   temperatures rapidly back toward where they would have been without SAI.
   The rapid temperature increase could be quite damaging, which in turn
   creates a strong incentive to avoid intermittency. In the scenario, a
   catastrophic societal collapse eliminates society's ability to continue
   SAI, despite the incentive. The collapse could be caused by a pandemic,
   nuclear war, or other global catastrophe. The ensuing intermittency hits
   a population that is already vulnerable from the initial collapse,
   making for a double catastrophe. While the outcomes of the double
   catastrophe are difficult to predict, plausible worst-case scenarios
   include human extinction. The decision to implement SAI is found to
   depend on whether global catastrophe is more likely from double
   catastrophe or from climate change alone. The SAI double catastrophe
   scenario also strengthens arguments for greenhouse gas emissions
   reductions and against SAI, as well as for building communities that
   could be self-sufficient during global catastrophes. Finally, the paper
   demonstrates the value of integrative, systems-based global catastrophic
   risk analysis.

   evaluated factors associated with time to initiation of adjuvant
   chemotherapy and chemotherapy completion and examined outcomes data
   among women with breast cancer. Patients who initiated chemotherapy
   later than 3 months after surgery were 1.8 times more likely to die of
   breast cancer ( 95 % CI 1.3-2.5) compared with those who initiated
   chemotherapy less than a month after surgery, even after controlling for
   known confounders or controlling for race/ethnicity. Women who completed
   chemotherapy had significantly higher survival compared with those who
   have not completed chemotherapy. Despite correcting for chemotherapy
   initiation and completion and known predictors of outcome, African
   American women still had worse disease-specific survival than their
   Caucasian counterparts. While a complete and timely adjuvant treatment
   among various ethnic populations would help to reduce racial disparities
   in survival, there are still other factors to be identified that may
   explain the remaining differences in survival between ethnic women with

   consistently been attributed to cohort replacement, indicated by age
   differences, as a result of changes in Catholic religious culture,
   despite a recognition in recent sociology of religion of the importance
   of institutional agency. I test (1) whether changes in priest's beliefs
   and values are due to cultural trends (indicated by birth cohort) or
   institutional selection (indicated by ordination cohort); and (2)
   whether they are related to liberalism/conservatism generally or to
   specific conformity to Catholic moral positions. Data are from the 2002
   Los Angeles Times priest survey (N = 1,854). Results are mixed: I find
   support for the thesis of institutional selection for conformity since
   1969, but not before. Prior to the 1960s, clergy (and lay) Catholic
   dissent increased linearly by birth cohort; since 1969, institutional
   selection, not cultural change, accounts for declining clergy dissent
   (while lay dissent has continued to increase). Implications for
   understanding changes in the Catholic Church and for religious theory
   are discussed.

AB Historical scholarship suggests that a robust cult of the saints may
   have helped some European regions to resist inroads by Protestantism.
   Based on a neo-Durkheimian theory of rituals and social order, I propose
   that locally based cults of the saints that included public veneration
   lowered the odds that Protestantism would displace Catholicism in
   sixteenth-century German cities. To evaluate this proposition, I first
   turn to historical and theoretical reflection on the role of the cult of
   the saints in late medieval history. I then test the hypothesis with a
   data set of sixteenth-century German cities. Statistical analysis
   provides additional support for the ritual and social order thesis
   because even when several important variables identified by materialist
   accounts of the Reformation in the social scientific literature the
   presence of shrines as an indicator for the cult of the saints remains
   large and significant. Although large-scale social change is usually
   assumed to have politico-economic sources, this analysis suggests that
   cultural factors may be of equal or greater importance.

   respondents) and sociodemographic differences in endorsement of barriers
   and motivations.
   Results: The two most common barriers to quitting were perceiving it to
   be too difficult and not wanting to quit. Financial costs, social
   support, and social influence were themes endorsed highly across both
   barriers and motivations to quitting. Sociodemographic differences were
   found, such as women and Black participants being more likely to be
   interested in a free quitline or quit website; women and Latinos being
   more likely to be afraid of gaining weight; and women, participants with
   less education, and older participants being more likely to be concerned
   about the cost of cessation products.
   Conclusions: Understanding barriers and motivations to quitting among
   disadvantaged populations is crucial. Financial issues, social support,
   and social norms should be targeted in promoting cessation among
   disadvantaged, urban populations. Programs, interventions, and policies
   can also use research about specific barriers and motivations for
   sociodemographic sub-groups to be tailored, targeted, and more
   effective. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Subjective social status (captured by the MacArthur Scale of Subjective
   Social Status) is in many cases a stronger predictor of health outcomes
   than objective socioeconomic status (SES).
   The study aims to test whether implicit beliefs about social class
   moderate the relationship between subjective social status and
   inflammation.
   We measured implicit social class bias, subjective social status, SES,
   and baseline levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a marker of inflammation,
   in 209 healthy adults.
   Implicit social class bias significantly moderated the relationship
   between subjective social status and levels of IL-6, with a stronger
   implicit association between the concepts "lower class" and "bad"
   predicting greater levels of IL-6.
   Implicit social class bias moderates the relationship between subjective
   social status and health outcomes via regulation of levels of the
   inflammatory cytokine IL-6. High implicit social class bias,
   particularly when one perceives oneself as having low social standing,
   may increase vulnerability to inflammatory processes.

AB Low socioeconomic status (SES) exacerbates the high rate of smoking
   relapse in women following childbirth.
   This study examined multiple models of potential mechanisms linking SES
   and postpartum smoking relapse among women who quit smoking due to
   pregnancy.
   Participants were 251 women enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of a
   new postpartum smoking relapse prevention intervention. Four models of
   the prepartum mechanisms linking SES and postpartum smoking relapse were
   evaluated using a latent variable modeling approach.
   Each of the hypothesized models were a good fit for the data. As
   hypothesized, SES indirectly influenced postpartum smoking relapse
   through increased prepartum negative affect/stress, reduced sense of
   agency, and increased craving for cigarettes. However, the model that
   included craving as the sole final pathway between SES and relapse
   demonstrated superior fit when compared with all other models.
   Findings have implications for future interventions that aim to reduce
   postpartum relapse.

AB Metastatic breast cancer patients experience significance distress.
   Although talking with close others about cancer-related concerns may
   help to alleviate distress, patients often avoid such discussions, and
   their partners can engage in social constraints that may limit
   subsequent patient disclosures and exacerbate distress.
   We examined how partner constraints unfold, how they influence patient
   affect, and whether they exacerbate patient avoidance of cancer-related
   disclosures.
   Fifty-four patients and 48 of their partners completed electronic diary
   assessments for 14 days.
   Partners' social constraints carried over from one day to the next, but
   patients' avoidance of discussing cancer-related concerns did not. When
   partners engaged in more social constraints one day, patients reported
   greater negative affect the following day (p < 0.05).
   Findings suggest a temporal link between partner constraints and patient
   momentary affect. Helping partners to become aware of their constraining
   behaviors and teaching them skills to overcome this may facilitate
   patient adjustment to metastatic breast cancer.

AB Social cohesion, the self-reported trust and connectedness between

   Relations between individual perceptions of social cohesion and smoking
   cessation were examined among 397 Black treatment-seeking smokers.
   Continuation ratio logit models examined the relation of social cohesion
   and biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence through 6
   months post-quit. Indirect effects were examined in single mediator
   models using a nonparametric bootstrapping procedure. All analyses
   controlled for sociodemographics, tobacco dependence, and treatment.
   The total effect of social cohesion on continuous abstinence was
   non-significant (beta = 0.05, p = 0.10). However, social cohesion was
   associated with social support, positive affect, negative affect, and
   stress, which, in turn, were each associated with abstinence in adjusted
   models (ps < 0.05).
   Results suggest that social cohesion may facilitate smoking cessation
   among Black smokers through desirable effects on psychosocial mechanisms
   that can result from living in a community with strong interpersonal
   connections.

AB Social structure emerges from the patterning of interactions between
   individuals and plays a critical role in shaping some of the main
   characteristics of animal populations. The topological features of
   social structure, such as the extent to which individuals interact in
   clusters, can influence many biologically important factors, including
   the persistence of cooperation, and the rate of spread of disease. Yet,
   the extent to which social structure topology fluctuates over relatively
   short periods of time in relation to social, demographic, or
   environmental events remains unclear. Here, we use social network
   analysis to examine seasonal changes in the topology of social
   structures that emerge from socio-positive associations in adult female
   rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Behavioral data for two different
   association types (grooming and spatial proximity) were collected for
   females in two free-ranging groups during two seasons: the mating and
   birth seasons. Stronger dyadic bonds resulted in social structures that
   were more tightly connected (i.e., of greater density) in the mating
   season compared to the birth season. Social structures were also more
   centralized around a subset of individuals and more clustered in the
   mating season than those in the birth season, although the latter
   differences were mostly driven by differences in density alone. Our
   results suggest a degree of temporal variation in the topological
   features of social structure in this population. Such variation may feed
   back on interactions, hence affecting the behaviors of individuals, and
   may therefore be important to take into account in studies of animal
   behavior.

AB Coalitionary aggression occurs when at least two individuals jointly
   direct aggression at one or more conspecific targets. Scientists have
   long argued that this common form of cooperation has positive fitness
   consequences. Nevertheless, despite evidence that social bond strength
   (which is thought to promote coalition formation) is correlated with
   fitness in primates, cetaceans, and ungulates, few studies have directly
   examined whether coalitionary aggression improves reproductive success.
   We tested the hypothesis that among free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan
   troglodytes schweinfurthii), participation in coalitionary aggression
   increases reproductive output. Using 14 years of genetic and behavioral
   data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found that coalitionary
   aggression increased a male's chances of (A) siring offspring, compared
   to other males of similar dominance rank, and (B) ascending in rank, a
   correlate of future reproductive output. Because male chimpanzees form
   coalitions with many others within a complex network, we used social
   network analysis to identify the types of connections correlated with
   these fitness benefits. The beneficiaries of coalitionary aggression
   were males with the highest "betweenness"aEuro"that is, those who tended
   to have coalition partners who themselves did not form coalitions with
   each other. This suggests that beyond simply recognizing third-party
   relationships, chimpanzees may use this knowledge to choose coalition
   partners. If so, this is a significant step forward in our knowledge of
   the adaptive value of social intelligence. Regardless of mechanism,
   however, this is the first evidence of genetic benefits of coalitionary
   aggression in this species, and therefore has important implications for
   understanding the evolution of cooperation.

AB Evidence from close ethnographic observations, photos, videos, and
   interviews show that persons in violence-threatening situations
   experience the emotional state of confrontational tension/fear (ct/f).
   This emotion constitutes a barrier that makes most violence abort. Given
   one of several interactional patterns that allow violence to proceed
   past this barrier, violence is largely clumsy, imprecise, and
   uncontrolled. Moments of violence are often experienced as perceptual
   distortions in the flow of time, vision, sound, and sense of self, an
   altered state of violent consciousness that the author refers to by the
   metaphor, the tunnel of violence. The latter part of the article
   extrapolates the theory to consider mechanisms by which this emotional
   tunnel is prolonged into episodes lasting longer than a few seconds.
   These mechanisms include: self-entrainment in one's own bodily rhythms;
   reciprocal micro-coordination between attacker and victim; audience or
   team entrainment. Some experienced individuals learn techniques to
   manipulate the emotional processes of the tunnel of violence for their
   own advantage. Greater awareness of micro-sociological processes hold
   out the prospect of heading off violence in the local situation itself.

AB Objective: Major amputation is associated with increased short-term
   healthcare resource utilization (RU), early mortality, and socioeconomic
   status (SES) disparities. Our objective is to study patient-specific and
   SES-related predictors of long-term RU and survival after amputation.
   Methods: This retrospective analysis identified 364 adult patients who
   underwent index major amputation for critical limb ischemia from January
   1995 through December 2000 at two tertiary centers with outcomes through
   December 2010. Age, gender, SES (race, income, insurance, and marital
   status), comorbidities (congestive heart failure [CHF], diabetes,
   diabetes with complications, and renal failure [RF]), subsequent
   procedures, cumulative length of stay (cLOS), and mortality were
   analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression for subsequent
   procedures and cLOS and Cox proportional hazard modeling for all-cause
   mortality were undertaken.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 3.25 years, amputation patients had
   mean cLOS of 71.2 days per person-year (median, 17.6), 19.5 readmissions
   per person-year (median, 2.1), 0.57 amputation-related procedures
   (median, 0), and 0.31 cardiovascular procedures (median, 0). Below-knee
   amputation as the index procedure was performed in 70% of patients, and
   25% had additional amputation procedures. Of readmissions at <= 30 days,
   52% were amputation-related. Overall mortality during follow-up was
   86.9%; 37 patients (10.2%) died within 30 days. Among patients surviving
   >30 days, multivariate Poisson regression demonstrated that younger age
   (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.98), public insurance (IRR, 1.63), CHF
   (IRR, 1.60), and RF (IRR, 2.12) were associated with increased cLOS.
   Diabetes with complications (IRR, 1.90) and RF (IRR, 2.47) affected
   subsequent amputation procedures. CHF (IRR, 1.83) and RF (IRR, 3.67)
   were associated with a greater number of cardiovascular procedures. Cox
   proportional hazard modeling indicated older age (hazard ratio [HR],
   1.04), CHF (HR, 2.26), and RF (HR, 2.60) were risk factors for decreased
   survival. Factors associated with SES were not significantly related to
   the outcomes.
   Conclusions: This study found that RU is high for amputees, and
   increased RU persists beyond the perioperative period. Results were
   similar across SES indices, suggesting higher SES may not be protective
   against poor outcomes when limb salvage is no longer attainable. These
   findings support the hypothesis that SES disparities may be more
   modifiable during earlier stages of care for critical limb ischemia. (J

   perspectives on contract farming and from the environmental sociology of

   contract farming of Jatropha on indigenous lands in the Philippines. In
   on-site observations and interviews, we found that while some indigenous
   groups grow Jatropha in polyculture, shifting-cultivation systems as
   part of biofuel contracts, these smallholder production systems are
   being phased out or transformed by the global biofuels network. In
   contract farming relationships involving biofuel crops, there seems to
   be a greater tendency for indigenous peoples to adapt to, or be left
   outside of, global production networks than for the latter to include
   indigenous peoples in socially and ecologically sustainable ways.

AB Dominant approaches to the study of gentrification tend to attribute
   this process either to the production of urban space by elites or to the
   consumption of urban space by individual consumers. In this article, we
   take a preliminary step toward bridging this gap by illustrating how
   these groups may, in some cases, be the same actors. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with middle-class parents in Boston, we explore the
   transitions that gentrifiers undergo as they age and have children. As
   young singles and childless couples, our respondents interacted with the
   city mainly as passive consumers. Years later, however, facing pressures
   to relocate in search of high-quality educational options, these parents
   emerged as active producers of the urban landscape through their
   substantial involvement in their children's public elementary schools.
   This school-based engagement reinforced their loyalties to their
   neighborhoods, dissuading them from moving to the suburbs. Since it is
   based on intense interactions with small local institutions, though,
   this strategy will likely be more difficult for parents to sustain in
   larger, less personal high schools. Thus, these parents may reconsider
   their dedication to city living as their children age. We discuss the
   implications of this research for urban theory and policy.

AB Apology is an increasingly prominent form of conflict management in many
   areas of social life. Yet there are few systematic studies of apology as
   a dependent variable. Analyzing the last statements of Texas death row
   prisoners, we find that the best predictor of apology is affiliation
   with God. Under traditional Western conceptions, God is an actor endowed
   with extraordinarily high status. Drawing on the theoretical paradigm
   known as pure sociology, we argue that death row prisoners who invoke
   God as a third party in their conflict thereby elevate their own status.
   Greater vertical closeness to the victim's side generates more social
   assertiveness and a greater willingness to apologize publicly. In
   addition, affiliation increases prisoners' relational closeness to God,
   enhancing their probability of adopting God's modern message of
   reconciliation. God's status has, however, declined somewhat over the
   past several centuriesa trend that helps to explain the modern religious
   emphasis on reconciliation over punishment, apology over defiance.

   Results: Both pre- and postsurveys were completed by 107 students (78%).
   Knowledge, attitudes about breast-feeding benefits, subjective norms,
   and intentions significantly improved following the intervention.
   Baseline knowledge and attitudes about breast-feeding benefits for
   mothers were low and demonstrated the greatest improvement.
   Conclusions: Offering breast-feeding education based on the theory of
   planned behavior in a single high school class session was effective in
   improving student knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about breastfeeding
   and intention to breast-feed.

AB Prior studies on racial and ethnic disparities in survival after motor
   vehicle crashes have examined only population-based death rates or have
   been restricted to hospitalized patients. In the current study, we
   examined 3 components of crash survival by race/ethnicity: survival
   overall, survival to reach a hospital, and survival among those
   hospitalized. Nine years of data (from 2000 through 2008) from the
   National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System were
   used to examine white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic
   drivers aged >= 15 years with serious injuries (injury severity scores
   of >= 9). By using multivariable logistic regression, we found that a
   driver's race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with overall
   survival after being injured in a crash (for blacks, odds ratio (OR) =
   0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.36, 1.32; for Hispanics, OR =
   1.00, 95% Cl: 0.59, 1.72), and blacks and Hispanics were equally likely
   to survive to be treated at a hospital compared with whites (for blacks,
   OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.52, 1.93; for Hispanics, OR = 1.13, 95% Cl: 0.71,
   1.79). However, among patients who were treated at a hospital, blacks
   were 50% less likely to survive 30 days compared with whites (OR = 0.50,
   95% Cl: 0.33, 0.76). The disparity in survival after serious traffic
   injuries among blacks appears to occur after hospitalization, not in
   prehospital survival.

AB When central governments decentralize natural resource management (NRM),
   they often retain an interest in the local efforts and provide funding
   for them. Such outside investments can serve an important role in moving
   community-based efforts forward. At the same time, they can represent
   risks to the community if government resources are not stable over time.
   Our focus in this article is on the effects of withdrawal of government
   resources from community-based NRM. A critical question is how to build
   institutional capacity to carry on when the government funding runs out.
   This study compares institutional survival and coping strategies used by
   community-based project organizations in two different contexts, India
   and the United States. Despite higher links to livelihoods, community
   participation, and private benefits, efforts in the Indian cases
   exhibited lower survival rates than did those in the U.S. cases.
   Successful coping strategies in the U.S. context often involved tapping
   into existing institutions and resources. In the Indian context,
   successful coping strategies often involved building broad community
   support for the projects and creatively finding additional funding
   sources. On the other hand, the lack of local community interest, due to
   the top-down development approach and sometimes narrow benefit
   distribution, often challenged organizational survival and project
   maintenance.

AB Refugee research, to date, has predominantly focused on factors that
   make refugees more vulnerable for developing posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) and/or psychological distress. Few articles have studied
   potential protective factors such as resilience. A targeted nonrandom
   sample of Iraqi refugees (n = 75) and a control group of non-Iraqi Arab
   immigrants (n = 53) were recruited from a number of Iraqi/Arab community
   institutions in Michigan to complete a questionnaire that included
   measures for psychological distress, PTSD symptoms, exposure to trauma,
   and resilience. The refugees reported significantly more PTSD symptoms
   (t-test, p < 0.01) and psychological distress (p < 0.05) compared with
   the immigrants. There was no difference in resilience between the two
   groups. In linear regression, premigration exposure to violence was a
   significant predictor of psychological distress (p < 0.01) and PTSD
   symptoms (p < 0.01). After controlling for migrant status and violence
   exposure, resilience was a significant inverse predictor of
   psychological distress (p < 0.001) but not of PTSD. Resilience is
   associated with less trauma-related psychological distress and should be
   considered in assessing risk and protective factors among victims of
   war-related violence.

   and White Americans with diagnosed anxiety disorders. Measures of

   were most distinctive, but the differences were small in magnitude.
   Across race/ethnicity, the associations between beliefs and service use
   were generally weak and statistically insignificant. The differences in
   illness beliefs and treatment preferences do not fully explain the
   large, persistent racial disparities in mental health care. Other
   crucial barriers to quality care exist in our health care system and our

AB Objective To describe the frequency and patient characteristics of
   emergency department encounters for mental health among youth, and to
   examine differences in utilization and treatment patterns.
   Study design Data were obtained from the Hawai'i Health Information
   Corporation database of emergency department records between January 1,
   2000, and December 31, 2010. Analyses were limited to records of visits
   by patients aged <18 years with a diagnosis of mental disorder or a
   suicide attempt.
   Results The annual average rate was 49.7 emergency department visits
   related to mental health issues per 10 000 youth, accounting for 2.1% of
   all emergency department visits among youth. Rates of mental
   health-related visits significantly and steadily increased, from a low
   of 25.8 in 2000 to a high of 67.4 in 2010. Rural areas consistently
   exhibited higher rates and acceleration at a steeper incline across
   time. Rural youth were more likely to be discharged or transferred for
   inpatient care or outpatient services compared with urban youth (6.3% vs
   12.4%; chi(2) = 61.42; df = 3; P < .001).
   Conclusion The trend in emergency department utilization for mental
   health-related issues in adolescents is apparently increasing, with
   significantly higher rate and morbidity for youth in rural areas.
   Several recommendations are described for creating a responsive and
   integrated system of mental health care for youth, covering training,
   consultation, screening, and brief interventions. (J Pediatr

AB Objectives To determine the costs for children with leukodystrophies and
   whether high costs are associated with characteristic clinical features
   or resources use.
   Study design We determined health care costs in a population cohort of
   122 patients with leukodystrophies, including inpatient, outpatient, and
   emergency department use, during a 9-year period. We analyzed
   differences in patients with high costs (>85th percentile) and their
   health care use.
   Results Patients with leukodystrophy had significant variability in
   resource use, with the top 15th percentile of patients accounting for
   73% of costs ($9.6 million). The majority of costs, 81% ($10.8 million),
   arose from inpatient hospitalization. High-cost patients had more and
   longer hospitalizations, increased requirements for intensive unit care
   and mechanical ventilation, and significantly more infections.
   Importantly, bone marrow transplantation did not solely account for the
   difference between high-cost and low-cost groups.
   Conclusion Inpatient hospitalization is the greatest source of health
   care resource use in patients with leukodystrophies. A minority of
   patients account for the majority of costs, primarily attributable to an
   increased volume of hospitalization. Strategies to improve care and
   reduce costs will need to reduce inpatient stays and target modifiable
   reasons for hospitalization. (J Pediatr 2013;162:624-8).

AB BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have revealed that preschool-aged
   children imitate both aggression and prosocial behaviors on screen,
   there have been few population-based studies designed to reduce
   aggression in preschool-aged children by modifying what they watch.
   METHODS: We devised a media diet intervention wherein parents were
   assisted in substituting high quality prosocial and educational
   programming for aggression-laden programming without trying to reduce
   total screen time. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of 565
   parents of preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 years recruited from
   community pediatric practices. Outcomes were derived from the Social
   Competence and Behavior Evaluation at 6 and 12 months.
   RESULTS: At 6 months, the overall mean Social Competence and Behavior
   Evaluation score was 2.11 points better (95% confidence interval [CI]:
   0.78-3.44) in the intervention group as compared with the controls, and
   similar effects were observed for the externalizing subscale (0.68 [95%
   CI: 0.06-1.30]) and the social competence subscale (1.04 [95% CI:
   0.34-1.74]). The effect for the internalizing subscale was in a positive
   direction but was not statistically significant (0.42 [95% CI: 20.14 to
   0.99]). Although the effect sizes did not noticeably decay at 12 months,
   the effect on the externalizing subscale was no longer statistically
   significant (P = .05). In a stratified analysis of the effect on the
   overall scores, low-income boys appeared to derive the greatest benefit
   (6.48 [95% CI: 1.60-11.37]).
   CONCLUSIONS: An intervention to reduce exposure to screen violence and
   increase exposure to prosocial programming can positively impact child
   behavior. Pediatrics 2013; 131:431-438

AB Surprisingly little is known about how relationship information is used
   predict others' behavior. We examine a key element of this ability-how
   relationship information is used to anticipate how others will react to
   events in which they are not directly involved. This requires both using
   relationship information to modify expected reactions (e.g., friends may
   be more responsive than acquaintances) and also inference rules for
   restricting the class of reactions that may be felt or experienced on
   behalf of others (e.g., uninvolved friends may become angry but cannot
   become dizzy). These capacities were examined in both preschoolers and
   adults. Two different events were presented; one that would elicit anger
   from those who were involved and one that would elicit dizziness. For
   both sets of participants, cues to relationship status had a strong
   impact on anger expectations (uninvolved friends were expected to be
   more angry than uninvolved classmates), but had no effect dizziness
   expectations (neither uninvolved friends nor classmates were expected to
   be dizzy). Follow-up analyses also revealed a developmental difference.
   Adults made distinctions within the uninvolved friends
   category-expecting friends to be less angry at their own friend, and
   that levels of anger would vary according to their friend's role within
   the social conflict-whereas preschoolers did not. These results
   demonstrate that by the early preschool years sophisticated inference
   rules already govern the expected reactions of uninvolved others, but
   that important developmental differences also remain. These results also
   indicate that relationship representations are inference engines for
   anticipating others' behavior and reactions, not simply static
   containers for sorting people into categories. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   review of 951 abstracts in English, 101 abstracts in Korean and 27 full

   presentation of and response to ASD in Korean culture. Based on research
   to date on the identification, description, and treatment of ASD in
   Korean populations, we argue that at both conceptual and practical
   levels, early child development and interventions must be understood
   within cultural context. Culturally informed research on ASD is vital
   for increasing awareness of the importance of early intervention and the
   need for educational and psychological services in countries in which

AB Background: Effects of neighborhood contextual features have been found
   for many diseases, including bone fractures in adults. Our study
   objective was to evaluate the association between neighborhood
   characteristics and pediatric bone fracture rates. We hypothesized that
   neighborhood indices of deprivation would be associated with higher
   fracture rates.
   Materials and Methods: Pediatric bone fracture cases treated at a
   tertiary, academic, urban pediatric emergency department between 2003
   and 2006 were mapped to census block groups using geographical
   information systems software. Fracture rates were calculated as
   fractures per 1000 children in each census block. Exploratory factor
   analysis of socioeconomic indicators was performed using 2000 census
   block data. Factor scores were used to predict odds of bone fracture at
   the individual level while adjusting for mean age, sex composition, and
   race/ethnicity composition at census block level using our sample data.
   Results: We analyzed 3764 fracture visits in 3557 patients representing
   349 distinct census blocks groups. Fracture rates among census blocks
   ranged from 0 to 207 per 1000 children/study period. Logistic regression
   modeling identified 2 factors (race/education and large families)
   associated with increased fracture risk. Census variables reflecting
   African American race, laborer/service industry employment, long-term
   block group residence, and lower education levels strongly loaded on the
   race/education factor. The large families factor indicated the
   children-to-families ratio within the block group. The poverty factor
   was not independently associated with fracture risk.
   Conclusions: Thus, neighborhood characteristics are associated with risk
   for fractures in children. These results can help inform translational
   efforts to develop targeted strategies for bone fracture prevention in
   children.

AB Aims To apply social network analysis (SNA) to investigate whether
   frequency and severity of gambling problems were associated with
   different network characteristics among friends, family and co-workers
   is an innovative way to look at relationships among individuals; the
   current study was the first, to our knowledge, to apply SNA to gambling
   behaviors. Design Egocentric social network analysis was used to
   characterize formally the relationships between social network
   characteristics and gambling pathology. Setting Laboratory-based
   questionnaire and interview administration. Participants Forty frequent
   gamblers (22 non-pathological gamblers, 18 pathological gamblers) were
   recruited from the community. Measurements and Findings The SNA revealed
   significant social network compositional differences between the two
   groups: pathological gamblers (PGs) had more gamblers, smokers and
   drinkers in their social networks than did non-pathological gamblers
   (NPGs). PGs had more individuals in their network with whom they
   personally gambled, smoked and drank than those with who were NPG.
   Network ties were closer to individuals in their networks who gambled,
   smoked and drank more frequently. Associations between gambling severity
   and structural network characteristics were not significant. Conclusions
   Pathological gambling is associated with compositional but not
   structural differences in social networks. Pathological gamblers differ
   from non-pathological gamblers in the number of gamblers, smokers and
   drinkers in their social networks. Homophily within the networks also
   indicates that gamblers tend to be closer with other gamblers. This
   homophily may serve to reinforce addictive behaviors, and may suggest
   avenues for future study or intervention.

AB Although some cultural practices have been identified as a determinant
   of HIV transmission, research investigating how specific practices
   affect HIV risk is lacking. In Malawi, initiation rites, in which young
   people attend ceremonies around the time of puberty, have received
   little attention. In this qualitative study, we explored whether
   communities in southern Malawi perceive initiation rites to be an HIV
   risk factor for girls. Twelve focus group discussions were held with
   adolescents and adults in a rural community of Thyolo district and a
   peri-urban community of Mangochi district. Community members observed
   that certain aspects of traditional initiation rites propel girls into
   sexual roles expected of adulthood, without facilitating their adaption
   to the emerging landscape of HIV, thereby increasing HIV risk. HIV
   prevention programming needs to address the role of initiation rites in
   adolescent girls' vulnerability to HIV and help young girls navigate the
   conflicting messages they receive from a wide range of channels about
   expected sexual behavior.

   theory of planned behavior (TPB) constructs: attitude, subjective norm
   (SN), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). A total of 66 respondents
   met inclusion criteria. Average age was 38 years old, 74% of respondents
   were male, 71% heterosexual, and 86% reported being from Mexico or
   Central America. Prevalence of complete adherence (i.e., not missing a
   single dose) in the past 30 days was 71%. Social support was
   significantly and inversely associated with adherence, PBC, and
   attitude. Positive correlates of adherence included attitude, PBC, and
   employment status. In multivariable analysis, SN and PBC were
   significantly associated with social support, controlling for
   acculturation, physician trust, and number of behavioral referents. TPB
   constructs have utility in explaining ART adherence among immigrant
   Latinos in the Deep South. Further research is necessary to understand
   the complex relationships between social support, attribution processes,
   and ART adherence outcomes.

AB Objective: This article examines effects of the social group on
   individual alcohol and drug use upon entry and exit from the club. Based
   on collected biological measurements of alcohol and other drug use, this
   study explores whether social group indicators (e.g., group
   characteristics) are predictive of alcohol and other drug use for
   individual club patrons. Method: A total of 368 social groups,
   representing 986 individuals (50.7% female), were anonymously surveyed,
   and biological measures of alcohol and other drug use were collected at
   entrance and exit to clubs on a single evening. Both individual and
   group-level indicators were assessed. Because data were clustered by
   club, event, and group, mixed-model regressions were conducted to
   account for non-independence. Results: Group indicators of high blood
   alcohol concentration were being in a group that intends to get drunk,
   that has at least one member who regularly gets drunk, and that has
   discrepancies in its expectations regarding drug use. Group indicators
   related to cocaine use were high levels of drug use expected among group
   members, little discrepancy among the group members regarding the drug
   use expected, and high levels of intentions to get drunk. In addition,
   older groups were more likely to have higher levels of cocaine use.
   There were less consistent findings regarding group effects on marijuana
   use. The most consistent finding was that high drug use expectations
   were related to higher levels of marijuana use. Conclusions: Together,
   these data suggest that strategies should focus on recognizing group
   indicators as risks for group members. Promoting social responsibility
   for group members may create safer club experiences among young adults.
   These efforts could model designated-driver programs as a way to
   increase safety and social responsibility. (J Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 74,

AB This study examines the influence of social processes on the spatial
   distribution of residential lawns, one of the most prominent
   anthropogenic environmental challenges in US urban/suburban areas today.
   Specifically, we examine how three theoretically informed social drivers
   of urban vegetation patterns-population density, social stratification,
   and lifestyle behavior-explain two measures of residential lawns at the
   US Census block group (CBG) scale in suburban Boston, MA, USA. Using
   fine-spatial resolution (0.5 m) remotely sensed data, we map land cover
   from which we generate two lawn measures: (1) "percent lawn cover,"
   which is the overall percentage of land in a CBG containing lawn, and
   (2) "percent lawn realized stewardship," which is the percentage of
   non-developed land in a CBG containing lawn. We use spatial regression
   to find that population density and lifestyle behavior, proxied by
   percentage of single-family detached homes, average household size, and
   percentage of protected land in the CBG are the key social processes
   driving the spatial distribution of both lawn measures in our study
   area. Results also show that spatial regression provides theoretical
   insight into additional, unspecified processes influencing the spatial
   distribution of lawns, net of the effects of the independent variables.
   These findings contribute to the existing understanding of the social
   processes influencing the residential lawn landscape, and are therefore
   useful for scientists, decision-makers, and stakeholders who are
   interested in moderating the potential social and ecological impacts of
   this landscape. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A global financial crisis seems a propitious time to renew a dialogue
   between legal scholarship and the field of economic sociology. In the
   1920s and 1930s, legal realist scholars developed insightful analyses of
   market processes. But since post-war mainstream legal scholarship has
   largely ignored this aspect of legal realism, economic sociology might
   be helpful in refocusing legal scholarship on what happens in actual
   market settings. One tool is Zelizer's concept of relational work; that
   in market transactions, actors must define the nature of their
   relationship, what is to be exchanged, and by what media. Relational
   work has an enormous impact on the outcomes of transactions, but it is
   largely ignored in economic accounts. An empirical study of variations
   in relational work across economic settings could provide a strong
   foundation for rethinking the relationship between law and economic
   activity.

AB While substantial sociolegal research has analyzed the deleterious
   effects of criminal records on life outcomes, little has examined the
   records themselves, or their relationship to the people they represent.
   In this article I take a novel tact, treating criminal records as the
   material, textual documentations of an individual's past. I then observe
   expungement seekerspeople who encounter their own recordsto understand
   their reactions. From this data, I use inductive theories of symbolic
   interactionism to theorize another collateral effect of the criminal
   record: it represents people in ways that depersonalize their social
   identities, and prevents them from communicating corrective
   self-understandings to the governing bodies that author the records. I
   conclude with my main theoretical contribution: having a criminal
   record, literally, means having a textual proxy that the state has
   authored on its own terms, without input from the people whom it
   permanently represents, and while concealing from those people the
   apparatus behind authorship. As a consequence, the criminal records
   system serves as a barrier to reciprocal communication between
   ex-arrestees and a legal system that represents them in ways that they
   may want to contest. This wrongful representation is a collateral effect
   of having a criminal record that impedes the ability of ex-arrestees to
   manage or repair their relationship with the state that has punished
   them.

AB While W. E. B. Du Bois is widely recognized for his contributions to the
   sociology of race, his contributions to the foundations of sociology are
   largely ignored. His sociology is based on African American reformism, a
   version of pragmatism, and a contingent historicism. The basic view of
   sociology is one that emphasizes the role of chance and will as opposed
   to law and certainty. He called sociology "the science of free will."
   His view of society is one that focuses on the historical contingency of
   the structure of society, the malleability of society, and the
   fundamental feature of American society: a society built around the
   "color line" or "veil." This view of society is not merely an
   interesting historical anomaly, but has significant implications for the
   understanding of and development of contemporary sociology.

AB College-educated adults are healthier than other people in the United

   education influences health. This article focuses on the possibility
   that the health benefits of college may vary according to childhood
   (mis)fortune and people's propensity to attain a college degree in the
   first place. Several perspectives from life course sociology offer
   competing hypotheses as to whether the most or the least advantaged see
   the greatest return of a college education. The authors use a national
   survey of middle-age American adults to assess risk of two
   cardiovascular health problems and mortality. Results from propensity
   score and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that the protective
   effect of college attainment is indeed heterogeneous. Further, the
   greatest returns are among those least likely to experience this life
   course transition (i.e., compensatory leveling). Explanations for this
   selection effect are offered, along with several directions for future
   research on the health benefits of completing college.

AB This paper builds on the general connection between culture consumption
   and sociability which has been the focus of recent research in the
   sociology of culture. I propose that cultural variety, as given by the
   number of cultural activities that the person engages in, is tied not
   only to static properties of social networks (such as range), but also
   to the likelihood of having benefited from this connectivity (social
   capital). Taking the classic example of finding a job via a network
   contact as the main outcome, I show that persons who have a propensity
   to engage in a wide variety of cultural activities have a higher
   likelihood of having found out about their current job via a weak tie
   and that different types of weak tie activation are selectively
   correlated with distinct cultural taste profiles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The authors assess the extent to which national-level integration in the
   world polity influences individual-level concern for the environment.
   While theoretically-derived propositions about such relationships have a
   deep history in comparative sociology, they-with few exceptions-remain
   untested. Consistent with past research, employed national-level
   measures of world polity integration include the relative presence of
   environmental international nongovernmental organizations (EINGOs) and
   the existence of environmental ministries. Results of multilevel
   analyses of individual-level environmental concern in 37 nations
   indicate that both forms of world polity integration increase the
   likelihood of individual-level environmental concern, net of other
   national-level factors and individual-level characteristics; although we
   find stronger support for the influence of EINGOs as a key variable
   indicating world polity connection. The findings provide unique support
   for world polity theory, suggesting that future research should consider
   how elements of world polity integration influence other forms of
   individual attitudes and behaviors. The results also highlight the
   importance in considering global and transnational factors when
   assessing the determinants of individual attitudes about the

AB This analysis tests overlooked sociological hypotheses about women's
   presence in the state legislatures and the House of Representatives.
   Stereotypes about women suggest that shifts in social conditions affect
   these political outcomes by making such stereotypes more or less
   salient. Findings indicate that beliefs about female competencies-such
   as women's purported unwillingness to endorse violent solutions-should
   reduce support for female candidates when increases in violent crime
   create demands for increasingly severe punishments. Since women also are
   typecast as being more protective of vulnerable populations than males,
   states with larger minority populations should have additional women in
   both legislatures. Pooled time-series models based on 1127 state-years
   show that fewer women were present in the state legislatures or in state
   delegations to the House after increases in the murder rates. States
   with larger minority populations, however, had more women in these two
   legislative bodies. Our result's support claims that under researched

   Objective To examine childhood SES measures, SES trajectory and other
   perinatal factors in relation to RA.
   Methods The sample included 50 884 women, aged 35-74 (84% non-Hispanic
   white) enrolled 2004-9 in a US national cohort study. In baseline
   questionnaires, cases (N=424, 0.8%) reported RA diagnosis after age 16,
   ever use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or steroids for RA and
   >= 6 weeks bilateral joint swelling. Childhood SES measures are
   presented as OR and 95% CI adjusted for age and race/ethnicity. Analyses
   of perinatal factors also adjusted for childhood SES, and joint effects
   of childhood and adult SES and smoking exposures were evaluated.
   Results Patients with RA reported lower childhood household education (<
   12 years vs college degree; OR=1.7; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5), food insecurity
   (OR=1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.0) and young maternal age (< 20 vs 20-34 years;
   OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.5), with a trend (p < 0.0001) for increasing
   number of adverse factors (OR=3.0; 95% CI 1.3 to 7.0; 4 vs 0 factors)
   compared with non-cases. High birth weight (> 4000 g) and preconception
   paternal smoking were independently associated with RA. Together, lower
   childhood SES and adult education (< college degree) were associated
   with RA (interaction p=0.03), with a joint effect magnitude similar to a
   history of paternal and adult smoking.
   Conclusions RA was associated with low childhood SES sustained into
   adulthood, with cumulative effects across multiple measures, suggesting
   the importance of other unmeasured factors linking SES and RA.

AB Delay discounting occurs when the subjective value of an outcome
   decreases as its delivery is delayed. The present study investigated
   whether how individuals discount delayed outcomes would vary as a
   function of who would hypothetically experience the outcome and the
   participants' perceived level of social support. In Experiment One, 600
   university students completed a measure of perceived social support and
   a discounting task involving four different outcomes, with different
   groups differing in terms of who would hypothetically receive the
   outcome being discounted (themselves, their mother, or a classmate). The
   degree of discounting did not vary as a function of recipient of the
   outcome, but did vary significantly and inversely with perceived level
   of social support. Experiment Two replicated the effect of perceived
   social support in 488 university students, but failed to demonstrate
   that the degree of discounting varied as a function of the level of
   social support available to the recipient of the outcome being
   discounted. These results suggest that people discount outcomes
   similarly regardless of who will be the recipient of the outcome, but
   that rates of discounting are reliably altered by the discounter's own
   perceived level of social support. The latter finding is potentially
   informative as to why social-support groups may be valuable in
   therapeutic environments.

AB The select individual(s) whom one trusts in sharing important personal
   matters is sometimes referred to as a confidant. The confidant
   relationship has received increasing attention in recent years as a
   major social factor contributing to individual health and wellness. Yet,
   little empirical data has been available to guide health researchers,
   policy-makers, and practitioners. In this study, 142 adult Taiwanese
   responded to a structured questionnaire. Participants comprised 105
   females, 32 males, and five with sex unspecified (overall mean age =
   33.8, age range = 18 to 74 years). They were asked whether they had a
   confidant, and if so, to describe various features of this relationship.
   Contrary to previous studies conducted in Europe and the Americas, our
   investigation found that Taiwanese men were equally likely as Taiwanese
   women to have a confidant (87.5 % of males and 89.5 % for females).
   Taiwanese women were significantly more likely to have a female rather
   than a male confidant, whereas males showed no such sex difference. A
   significantly higher percentage of confidants were non-family members
   rather than spouses or other immediate/extended family members. This
   finding is consistent with research on the relatively minor salience of
   emotional intimacy in Taiwanese marriages and the hierarchical
   structures of many Taiwanese families. The implications of our findings
   for enhancing Taiwanese and broader ethnic Chinese health treatment are
   discussed.

AB Background: Research has shown that interactions between young
   children's temperament and the quality of care they receive predict the
   emergence of positive and negative socioemotional developmental
   outcomes. This multimethod study addresses such interactions, using
   observed and mother-rated measures of difficult temperament, children's
   committed, self-regulated compliance and externalizing problems, and
   mothers' responsiveness in a low-income sample. Methods: In 186
   thirty-month-old children, difficult temperament was observed in the
   laboratory (as poor effortful control and high anger proneness), and
   rated by mothers. Mothers' responsiveness was observed in lengthy
   naturalistic interactions at 30 and 33months. At 40months, children's
   committed compliance and externalizing behavior problems were assessed
   using observations and several well-established maternal report
   instruments. Results: Parallel significant interactions between child
   difficult temperament and maternal responsiveness were found across both
   observed and mother-rated measures of temperament. For difficult
   children, responsiveness had a significant effect such that those
   children were more compliant and had fewer externalizing problems when
   they received responsive care, but were less compliant and had more
   behavior problems when they received unresponsive care. For children
   with easy temperaments, maternal responsiveness and developmental
   outcomes were unrelated. All significant interactions reflected the
   diathesis-stress model. There was no evidence of differential
   susceptibility, perhaps due to the pervasive stress present in the
   ecology of the studied families. Conclusions: Those findings add to the
   growing body of evidence that for temperamentally difficult children,
   unresponsive parenting exacerbates risks for behavior problems, but
   responsive parenting can effectively buffer risks conferred by
   temperament.

AB Cognitive variables are often neglected in child and adolescent
   populations despite their roles in the development and maintenance of
   psychopathology. Furthermore, the importance of examining these
   variables contextually is underestimated.
   The present study aimed to examine the relationship between two
   theoretically related cognitive variables in a contextually relevant
   fashion by proposing several models demonstrating the association
   between negative self-statements and social self-efficacy holistically
   and among differing relationships (i.e., peers, adults, strangers) using
   Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques.
   As part of a larger study, 126 participants (ages from 11 to 14 years)
   were recruited for participation from the middle school grades.
   Participants' parents were contacted for informed consent, and
   subsequently, participants were asked to fill out a set of measures in
   assembly format.
   Results indicated that the structural model was well-fitted to the data.
   Specifically, the frequency of negative self-statements was found to
   indicate the amount of social self-efficacy present with more negative
   self-statements being associated with less social self-efficacy.
   Further, when examined among differing relationships via path analysis,
   the frequency of negative self-statements was found to be indicative of
   the social self-self efficacy with peers and adults, but not with
   strangers.
   These findings provide useful information concerning cognitive trends,
   which are likely relevant for the enhancement of treatment processes in
   children and adolescents. Implications and recommendations are

AB This study examined psychotropic medication claims in a sample of
   Protestant clergy. It estimated the proportion of clergy in the sample
   who had a claim for psychotropic medication (i.e., anti-depressants and
   anxiolytics) in 2005 and examined associations between sociodemographic
   characteristics, occupational distress and having a claim. Protestant
   clergy (n = 749) from nine denominations completed a mail survey and
   provided access to their pharmaceutical records. Logistic regression
   models assessed the effect of sociodemographic characteristics and
   occupational distress on having a claim. The descriptive analysis
   revealed that 16 % (95 % Confidence interval [CI] 13.3 %-18.5 %) of the
   clergy in the sample had a claim for psychotropic medication in 2005 and
   that, among clergy who experienced frequent occupational distress, 28 %
   (95 % CI 17.5 %-37.5 %) had a claim. The regression analysis found that
   older clergy, female clergy, and those who experienced frequent
   occupational distress were more likely to have a claim. Due to recent
   demographic changes in the clergy population, including the increasing
   mean age of new clergy and the growing number of female clergy, the
   proportion of clergy having claims for psychotropic medication may
   increase in the coming years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first study to examine the use of psychotropic medication among clergy.

AB Racial and ethnic disparities are disturbing facets of the American
   healthcare system that document the reality of unequal treatment.
   Research consistently shows that patients of color experience poorer
   quality of care and health outcomes contributing to increased risks and
   accelerated mortality rates relative to their white counterparts. While
   initially conceptualized as an approach for increasing the
   responsiveness of children's behavioral health care, cultural competence
   has been adopted as a key strategy for eliminating racial and ethnic
   health disparities across the healthcare system. However, cultural
   competence research and practices largely focus on improving provider
   competencies, while agency and system level approaches for meeting the
   service needs of diverse populations are given less attention. In this
   article we offer seven essential strategies for promoting and sustaining
   organizational and systemic cultural competence. These strategies are
   to: (1) Provide executive level support and accountability, (2) Foster
   patient, community and stakeholder participation and partnerships, (3)
   Conduct organizational cultural competence assessments, (4) Develop
   incremental and realistic cultural competence action plans, (5) Ensure
   linguistic competence, (6) Diversify, develop, and retain a culturally
   competent workforce, and (7) Develop an agency or system strategy for
   managing staff and patient grievances. For each strategy we offer
   several recommendations for implementation.

AB Researchers have long been fascinated with youth subcultures. Decades of
   study have yielded several competing paradigms, which attempt to
   interpret these subcultures in diverse ways, with each succeeding
   paradigm criticizing, and attempting to improve on, those that came
   before it. Rather than offering criticism of a specific youth studies
   paradigm, this article provides a critique of this body of theory as a
   whole by delineating several theoretical assumptions that have persisted
   across these perspectives. These include: (1) the tendency to group all
   youth phenomena under a monolithic conceptual umbrella; (2) a
   preoccupation on the part of researchers with style and the consumption
   of goods; and (3) the assumed lack of rational behavior found in
   subcultures and an accompanying inability on the part of subcultures to
   achieve real goals or effect social change. It is argued that such
   assumptions trivialize subcultures, have led to a priori understandings
   of these without adequate empirical grounding, and must be addressed if
   subcultures are to be adequately understood and appreciated.

AB Objectives. To elucidate why the inverse association between education
   level and mortality risk (the gradient) has increased markedly among
   White women since the mid-1980s, we identified causes of death for which
   the gradient increased.
   Methods. We used data from the 1986 to 2006 National Health Interview
   Survey Linked Mortality File on non-Hispanic White women aged 45 to 84
   years (n = 230 692). We examined trends in the gradient by cause of
   death across 4 time periods and 4 education levels using
   age-standardized death rates.
   Results. During 1986 to 2002, the growing gradient for all-cause
   mortality reflected increasing mortality among low-educated women and
   declining mortality among college-educated women; during 2003 to 2006 it
   mainly reflected declining mortality among college-educated women. The
   gradient increased for heart disease, lung cancer, chronic lower
   respiratory disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's
   disease. Lung cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease explained 47%
   of the overall increase.
   Conclusions. Mortality disparities among White women widened across 1986
   to 2006 partially because of causes of death for which smoking is a
   major risk factor. A comprehensive policy framework should address the
   social conditions that influence smoking among disadvantaged women.

AB Objectives. We examined the association between mother-perceived
   neighborhood social capital and oral health status and dental care use
   in US children.
   Methods. We analyzed data for 67 388 children whose mothers participated
   in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. We measured mothers'
   perceived social capital with a 4-item social capital index (SCI) that
   captures reciprocal help, support, and trust in the neighborhood.
   Dependent variables were mother-perceived ratings of their child's oral
   health, unmet dental care needs, and lack of a previous-year preventive
   dental visit. We performed bivariate and multivariable logistic
   regression analyses for each outcome.
   Results. After we controlled for potential confounders, children of
   mothers with high (SCI = 5-7) and lower levels (SCI >= 8) of social
   capital were 15% (P =.05) and about 40% (P <= 02), respectively, more
   likely to forgo preventive dental visits than were children of mothers
   with the highest social capital (SCI = 4). Mothers with the lowest SCI
   were 79% more likely to report unmet dental care needs for their
   children than were mothers with highest SCI (P = .01).
   Conclusions. A better understanding of social capital's effects on
   children's oral health risks may help address oral health disparities.

AB Objectives. We examined the prospective effects of parental education
   (as a proxy for individual socioeconomic status [SES]) and neighborhood
   SES on adolescent smoking trajectories and whether the prospective
   effects of individual SES varied across neighborhood SES.
   Methods. The study included 3635 randomly recruited adolescents from 5
   age cohorts (12-16 years) assessed semiannually for 3 years in the
   Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort study. We employed a
   cohort-sequential latent growth model to examine smoking from age 12 to
   18 years with predictors.
   Results. Lower individual SES predicted increased levels of smoking over
   time. Whereas neighborhood SES had no direct effect, the interaction
   between individual and neighborhood SES was significant. Among higher
   and lower neighborhood SES, lower individual SES predicted increased
   levels of smoking; however, the magnitude of association between lower
   individual SES and higher smoking levels was significantly greater for
   higher neighborhood SES.
   Conclusions. We found evidence for differential effects of individual
   SES on adolescent smoking for higher and lower neighborhood SES. The
   group differences underscore social conditions as fundamental causes of
   disease and development of interventions and policies to address
   inequality in the resources.

AB Objectives. We assessed public support for a potential Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA)-mandated reduction in cigarette nicotine content.
   Methods. We used nationally representative data from a June 2010
   cross-sectional survey of US adults (n = 2649) to obtain weighted point
   estimates and correlates of support for mandated nicotine reduction. We
   also assessed the potential role of political ideology in support of FDA
   regulation of nicotine.
   Results. Nearly 50% of the public supported mandated cigarette nicotine
   reduction, with another 28% having no strong opinion concerning this
   potential FDA regulation. Support for nicotine reduction was highest
   among Hispanics, African Americans, and those with less than a high
   school education. Among smokers, the odds of supporting FDA nicotine
   regulation were 2.77 times higher among smokers who intended to quit in
   the next 6 months than among those with no plans to quit.
   Conclusions. Mandating nicotine reduction in cigarettes to nonaddictive
   levels may reduce youth initiation and facilitate adult cessation. The
   reasons behind nicotine regulation need to be communicated to the public
   to preempt tobacco industry efforts to impede such a regulation.

AB Mexican Americans typically have better cardiovascular health than
   Caucasians, despite being relatively economically disadvantaged. Given
   research indicating the importance of relationship quality on one's
   health, our study examined whether certain relationship orientations
   (eg, communal or exchange) differed between Caucasians and Mexican
   Americans and if these orientations could help explain the Hispanic
   Paradox. We recruited 582 adults from a community being primarily
   Caucasian (40%) and foreign-born Mexican Americans (55%). Participants
   wore 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitors and completed
   self-report measures of relationship satisfaction and relationship
   orientation. Results indicated that Caucasians tended to have more of a
   communal relationship orientation compared to foreign-born Mexican
   Americans. Communal orientation was predictive of higher relationship
   satisfaction and while higher relationship satisfaction predicted lower
   systolic blood pressure when ethnicity was added into the model this
   relationship was eliminated and foreign-born Mexican Americans had
   higher ABP compared to Caucasians. Even though communal and exchange
   relationship orientation don't seem to give us any more information to
   unravel the Hispanic Paradox, there are important ethnic differences in
   how we engage in marriage relationships and future research will need to
   examine the health effects of these differences.

AB Background. The 2010 floods inundated one-fifth of Pakistan and affected
   more than 20 million people.
   Objective. To characterize the impact of the floods and subsequent
   humanitarian response on household economy and food security.
   Methods. A cross-sectional 80 x 20 cluster survey (n = 1,569 households)
   was conducted using probability proportional to size sampling in the
   four most flood-affected provinces 6 months after the floods. Analysis
   included both descriptive statistics and regression models, with receipt
   of food aid (in the first month), dietary quality, and household income
   at 6 months postflood as outcomes.
   Results. Need for food aid was nearly ubiquitous (98.9%); however, only
   half of the study population ever received food aid. Displacement was
   not a significant predictor of food aid receipt (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.83
   to 1.98); however urban location (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.00 to 3.86) and
   damage to the home (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.34 to 5.60) were significantly
   associated. Some of the hardest-hit groups, including both farmers and
   day laborers, were significantly less likely to receive food aid (p <
   .05). Additionally, receipt of food aid was not necessarily associated
   with improved household economy or food security; although households in
   internally displaced people (IDP) camps were more likely to receive food
   aid (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.00 to 3.86), they were less likely to report
   same or improved dietary quality (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.88) or
   income status (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.86).
   Conclusions. Food aid coverage following the 2010 floods was relatively
   low, and many of the most affected populations were less likely to
   receive aid, suggesting that targeting should be improved in future
   responses.

AB The care of individuals with rare heritable conditions, such as those
   detectable through newborn screening, is an important target for quality
   improvement. Not only is there great opportunity to improve long-term
   outcomes, but there are lessons that can be generalized to the care of
   all children with special health-care needs. To identify an approach to
   quality improvement for individuals with conditions identified through
   newborn screening, the National Coordinating Center for the Regional
   Genetic and Newborn Screening Service Collaboratives convened an expert
   workgroup to develop strategies based on a family-centered,
   community-based system of care. These recommendations centered on
   involving families, the primary care medical home, and specialty care
   providers as equal partners. Key activities to improve care include
   explicit care coordination, identification of the location of
   management, and planned co-management. To implement this model of care,
   the Regional Collaboratives will develop a clearinghouse of tools,
   engage in activities to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to
   improve co-management, and identify strategies to align incentives for
   health-care providers and families to work together. Genet Med

   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2005-2006 Milwaukee African
   American oversample of the second Midlife Development in the United
   States (MIDUS II) study Multivariate logistic regression examined
   associations between type of social ties (family or friends), their
   frequency (number of contacts), and their quality (support and strain)
   with better self-related physical health (SRPH). We defined better SRPH
   to include self-reports of good, very good, or excellent SRPH; this
   catagory was compared with fair or poor SRPH. control variables included
   demographic factors; social engagement characteristics such as working
   volunteering, and caregiving; and measures of social structure such as
   types of discrimination experience and ratings of neighborhood quality.
   Results: In adjusted results, each additional degree of family support
   was associated with better self-related physical health (odds ratio
   [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.22). Each additional
   reported incident of daily discrimination was associated with 9% lower
   odds of reporting better SRPH (OR, 0.91; CI, 0.83-0.99).
   Discussion: Results suggest quality of family support may contribute
   importanly to the health of African Americans. When working with midlife
   and older African Americans, providers should engage and support familes
   as a vital resource to improve health.

AB Anxiety disorders are understudied, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in

   been hypothesized as a major barrier to research par ticipation. This
   article reviews the relevant literature to date and examines the
   experience of 6 African American adults who participated in a larger
   clinical assessment study about anxiety. Drawing upon in-depth
   semistructured interviews about their subjective experiences, we
   examined participant perspectives about the assessment process, opinions
   about African American perception of anxiety studies, and
   participant-generated ideas about how to improve African American
   participation. Based on a qualitative analysis of responses, feelings of
   mistrust emerged as a dominant theme. Concerns fell under 6 categories,
   including not wanting to speak for others, confidentiality, self and
   group presentation concerns, repercussions of disclosure, potential
   covert purposes of the study, and the desire to confide only in close
   others. Suggestions for increasing African American participation are
   discussed, including assurances of confidentiality, adequate
   compensation, and a comfortable study environment.

   individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes (N = 795) who were aged, on

   and 19.4% Hispanic. Approximately 8% reported nephropathy, 35% reported

   significant disparities in the rates of Complications among non-Hispanic
   white, African American, and Hispanic participants, with Hispanic
   participants having the highest rates of nephropathy, retinopathy, and
   cardiovascular disease. Macro SES indicators (eg, income) mediated
   racial differences (ie, non-Hispanic whites vs African Americans) in
   self-reported retinopathy, a combination of macro and more micro SES
   indicators (eg, education, income, and owning a home or having a
   checking account) mediated racial/ethnic differences (ie, non-Hispanic
   white vs Hispanic participants) in self-reported cardiovascular disease,
   and only micro SES indicators (eg, owning a home or having a checking
   account) mediated differences between lower-income SES racial/ethnic
   minority groups (ie, African American vs Hispanic participants) in
   self-reported retinopathy and cardiovascular disease. Findings
   underscore that indicators of SES must be sensitive to the outcome of

   satisfaction may be relevant for improving African American men's Use of
   regular care us improving the early detection of prostate cancer and
   attenuating racial disparities in prostate cancer outcomes.
   Methods: This descriptive Correlation study examined relationships of
   individual characteristics that influence patient satisfaction using
   data from 505 African American men: from North Carolina, who
   prospectively enrolled in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer
   Project from September 2004 to November 2007. Analyses consisted of
   univariate statistics, bivariate analysis, and multiple regression
   analysis.
   Results: The Variables selected for the final model were: participation
   in religious activities, mistrust, racism, and perceived access to care.
   In this study, both cultural variables, mistrust (p = < .0001, F =
   95.58) and racism (p = < .002, F = 5.59), were significantly negatively
   associated with patient satisfaction and accounted for the majority of
   the variability represented by individual characteristics.
   Conclusion: Mistrust and racism are cultural factors that are extremely
   important and have been negatively associated with patient satisfaction
   and decreased desires to utilize health care services for African
   American men. To overcome barriers in seeking health care services,
   health care providers need to implement a patient-centered approach
   by-creating a clinical environment that demonstrates cultural competence
   and eliminating policies, procedures, processes, or personnel that
   foster mistrust and racism.

   in adults. We fit a multiple mediation model to data from 139
   socio-economically disadvantaged women (85% African American) of whom
   44% endorsed moderate to severe levels of childhood physical, sexual, or
   emotional abuse and 12% screened positive for probable posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD). The model accounted for 63% of the variance in
   adult PTS symptoms. Child abuse exerted a direct effect on PTS symptoms
   and indirect effects through difficulties with emotion regulation, lower
   social support, and greater exposure to adult interpersonal violence.
   Implications of findings for the treatment of individuals at high risk
   of having experienced childhood abuse and PTS are discussed.

AB In a complex behavioral system, such as an animal society, the dynamics
   of the system as a whole represent the synergistic interaction among
   multiple aspects of the society. We constructed multiple single-behavior
   social networks for the purpose of approximating from multiple aspects a
   single complex behavioral system of interest: rhesus macaque society.
   Instead of analyzing these networks individually, we describe a new
   method for jointly analyzing them in order to gain comprehensive
   understanding about the system dynamics as a whole. This method of
   jointly modeling multiple networks becomes valuable analytical tool for
   studying the complex nature of the interaction among multiple aspects of
   any system. Here we develop a bottom-up, iterative modeling approach
   based upon the maximum entropy principle. This principle is applied to a
   multi-dimensional link-based distributional framework, which is derived
   by jointly transforming the multiple directed behavioral social network
   data, for extracting patterns of synergistic inter-behavioral
   relationships. Using a rhesus macaque group as a model system, we
   jointly modeled and analyzed four different social behavioral networks
   at two different time points (one stable and one unstable) from a rhesus
   macaque group housed at the California National Primate Research Center
   (CNPRC). We report and discuss the inter-behavioral dynamics uncovered
   by our joint modeling approach with respect to social stability.

AB Objective: To describe the socioeconomic and geographic distribution of
   smoking behaviour in Canada among 19,383 individuals (51% women) aged
   15-85 years.
   Methods: Current smoking and quitting were modeled using standard and
   multilevel logistic regression. Markers of socioeconomic status (SES)
   were education and occupation. Geography was defined by Canadian
   Provinces.
   Results: The adjusted prevalence of current smoking was 20.2% (95%
   confidence interval [CI]: 18.8-21.7) and 63.7% (95% CI: 61.1-66.3) of
   ever smokers had quit. Current smoking decreased and quitting increased
   with increasing SES. The adjusted prevalence of current smoking was
   32.8% (95% CI: 28.4-37.5) among the least educated compared to 11.0%
   (95% CI: 8.9-13.4) for the highest educated. Among the least educated,
   53.0% (95% CI: 46.8-59.2) had quit, rising to 68.7% (95% CI: 62.7-74.1)
   for the most educated. There was substantial variation in current
   smoking and quitting at the provincial level; current smoking varied
   from 17.9% in British Columbia to 26.1% in Nova Scotia, and quitting
   varied from 57.4% in Nova Scotia to 67.8% in Prince Edward Island.
   Nationally, increasing education and occupation level were inversely
   associated with current smoking (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% CI: 0.60-0.68
   for education; OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77-0.87 for occupation) and positively
   associated with quitting (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.16-1.40 for education; OR
   1.20, 95% CI: 1.12-1.27 for occupation). These associations were
   consistent in direction across provinces although with some variability
   in magnitude.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that socioeconomic inequalities in
   smoking have persisted in Canada; current smoking was less likely and
   quitting was more likely among the better off groups and in certain
   provinces. Current prevention and cessation policies have not been
   successful in improving the situation for all areas and groups. Future
   efforts to reduce smoking uptake and increase cessation in Canada will
   need consideration of socioeconomic and geographic factors to be
   successful.

AB Objectives: This cross-sectional study, guided by Ajzen's Theory of
   Planned Behavior, aimed to identify factors that influence the decision
   to obtain an HPV vaccine among college women and to examine the
   relationships among these factors.
   Methods: An electronic self-administered survey was utilized to collect
   data. An email invitation was sent to 3074 college women attending a
   large, public university in southern California, aged between 18 and 26
   years. The email directed the recipient to click on a link to a
   web-based survey if she wanted to participate in the study.
   Results: Participants in this study were college women (n = 384; 175 HPV
   non-vaccinees and 209 HPV vaccinees). Women in this study knew that a
   Pap test is still needed after HPV vaccination and that the HPV vaccine
   does not protect against other Sexually Transmitted Infections. Both
   non-vaccinees and vaccinees had positive attitudes about mandating HPV
   vaccine. Knowledge and attitudes toward the vaccine were not directly
   linked to the outcome predictors - intention to obtain the vaccine and
   vaccine uptake. Attitude about receiving HPV vaccine, subjective norms
   (complying with the expectations of others), and perceived behavioral
   control were correlated with the outcome predictors. Subjective norms
   consistently predicted intention to obtain HPV vaccine and vaccine
   uptake.
   Conclusions: A proposal to mandate the HPV vaccine among young
   girls/women was acceptable to this population. Vaccination promotion
   strategies to increase the vaccine uptake rate among the catch-up group
   (aged 13-26) should include attention to college women's subjective
   norms. Health care provider's recommendation and encouragement from
   significant others (i.e., mother and peers) are critical in order for
   the college women to obtain the vaccine. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Efforts to develop a global understanding of the functioning of the
   Earth as a system began in the mid-1980s. This effort necessitated
   linking knowledge from both the physical and biological realms. A
   motivation for this development was the growing impact of humans on the
   Earth system and need to provide solutions, but the study of the social
   drivers and their consequences for the changes that were occurring was
   not incorporated into the Earth System Science movement, despite early
   attempts to do so. The impediments to integration were many, but they
   are gradually being overcome, which can be seen in many trends for
   assessments, such as the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and
   Ecosystem Services, as well as both basic and applied science programs.
   In this development, particular people and events have shaped the
   trajectories that have occurred. The lessons learned should be
   considered in such emerging research programs as Future Earth, the new
   global program for sustainability research. The transitioning process to
   this new program will take time as scientists adjust to new colleagues
   with different ideologies, methods, and tools and a new way of doing

AB Background: Among the largest US metropolitan areas, trends in mortality
   rates for injection drug users (IDUs) with AIDS vary substantially.
   Ecosocial, risk environment and dialectical theories suggest many
   metropolitan areas characteristics that might drive this variation. We
   assess metropolitan area characteristics associated with decline in
   mortality rates among IDUs living with AIDS (per 10,000 adult MSA
   residents) after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was
   developed.
   Methods: This is an ecological cohort study of 86 large US metropolitan
   areas from 1993-2006. The proportional rate of decline in mortality
   among IDUs diagnosed with AIDS (as a proportion of adult residents) from
   1993-1995 to 2004-2006 was the outcome of interest. This rate of decline
   was modeled as a function of MSA-level variables suggested by ecosocial,
   risk environment and dialectical theories. In multiple regression
   analyses, we used 1993-1995 mortality rates to (partially) control for
   pre-HAART epidemic history and study how other independent variables
   affected the outcomes.
   Results: In multivariable models, pre-HAART to HAART era increases in
   'hard drug' arrest rates and higher pre-HAART income inequality were
   associated with lower relative declines in mortality rates. Pre-HAART
   per capita health expenditure and drug abuse treatment rates, and pre-
   to HAART-era increases in HIV counseling and testing rates, were weakly
   associated with greater decline in AIDS mortality.
   Conclusions: Mortality among IDUs living with AIDS might be decreased by
   reducing metropolitan income inequality, increasing public health
   expenditures, and perhaps increasing drug abuse treatment and HIV
   testing services. Given prior evidence that drug-related arrest rates
   are associated with higher HIV prevalence rates among IDUs and do not
   seem to decrease IDU population prevalence, changes in laws and policing
   practices to reduce such arrests while still protecting public order
   should be considered.

   justifications, and responses to criticisms [1]. In this paper, we
   introduce some of the key statistical methods used in social network
   analysis and indicate where those used by Christakis and Fowler (CF) fit
   into the general framework. The intent is to provide the background
   necessary for readers to be able to make their own evaluation of the
   work by CF and understand the challenges of research involving social
   networks. We entertain possible solutions to some of the difficulties
   encountered in accounting for confounding effects in analyses of peer

   describe the methods we have employed (and the assumptions they have
   entailed) to examine several datasets with complementary strengths and
   weaknesses, including the Framingham Heart Study, the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and other observational and
   experimental datasets that we and others have collected. We describe the
   regularities that led us to propose that human social networks may
   exhibit a three degrees of influence property, and we review statistical
   approaches we have used to characterize interpersonal influence with
   respect to phenomena as diverse as obesity, smoking, cooperation, and
   happiness. We do not claim that this work is the final word, but we do
   believe that it provides some novel, informative, and stimulating
   evidence regarding social contagion in longitudinally followed networks.
   Along with other scholars, we are working to develop new methods for
   identifying causal effects using social network data, and we believe
   that this area is ripe for statistical development as current methods
   have known and often unavoidable limitations. Copyright (C) 2012 John

   a three degrees of influence rule to characterize the extent of such

   such a rule, one involving only associations (which is the
   interpretation for which Christakis and Fowler give evidence), one
   involving actual causation, generally referred to as contagion or social

AB In Phoenix, Arizona and other metropolitan areas, water governance
   challenges include variable climate conditions, growing demands, and
   continued groundwater overdraft. Based on an actor-oriented examination
   of who does what with water and why, along with how people interact with
   hydro-ecological systems and man-made infrastructure, we present a
   sustainability appraisal of water governance for the Phoenix region.
   Broadly applicable to other areas, our systems approach to sustainable
   water governance overcomes prevailing limitations to research and
   management by: employing a comprehensive and integrative perspective on
   water systems; highlighting the activities, intentions, and rules that
   govern various actors, along with the values and goals driving
   decisions; and, establishing a holistic set of principles for social
   ecological system integrity and interconnectivity, resource efficiency
   and maintenance, livelihood sufficiency and opportunity, civility and
   democratic governance, intra- and inter-generational equity, and
   finally, precaution and adaptive capacity. This study also contributes
   to reforming and innovating governance regimes by illuminating how these
   principles are being met, or not, in the study area. What is most needed
   in metropolitan Phoenix is enhanced attention to ecosystem functions and
   resource maintenance as well as social equity and public engagement in
   water governance. Overall, key recommendations entail: addressing
   interconnections across hydrologic units and subsystems (e.g., land and
   water), increasing decentralized initiatives for multiple purposes
   (e.g., ecological and societal benefits of green infrastructure),
   incorporating justice goals into decisions (e.g., fair allocations and
   involvement), and building capacity through collaborations and social
   learning with diverse interests (e.g., scientists, policymakers, and the
   broader public). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (1999-2006) to investigate the association between
   metropolitan-level racial/ethnic residential segregation and obesity and
   to determine whether it was mediated by the neighborhood socioeconomic
   environment. Residential segregation was measured using the black and
   Hispanic isolation indices. Neighborhood poverty and negative income
   incongruity were assessed as mediators. Multilevel Poisson regression
   with robust variance estimates was used to estimate prevalence ratios.
   There was no relationship between segregation and obesity among men.
   Among black women, in age-, nativity-, and metropolitan
   demographic-adjusted models, high segregation was associated with a 1.29
   (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.65) times higher obesity
   prevalence than was low segregation; medium segregation was associated
   with a 1.35 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.70) times higher obesity prevalence.
   Mexican-American women living in high versus low segregation areas had a
   significantly lower obesity prevalence (prevalence ratio, 0.54; 95% CI:
   0.33, 0.90), but there was no difference between those living in medium
   versus low segregation areas. These associations were not mediated by
   neighborhood poverty or negative income incongruity. These findings
   suggest variability in the interrelationships between residential
   segregation and obesity for black and Mexican-American women.

   Outcomes Database was used to identify 1109 women who were diagnosed
   with stage I through III, HER2-positive breast cancer during September
   2005 through December 2008 and were followed for 1 year. The authors
   used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of
   race/ethnicity and education with the receipt of trastuzumab and, among
   those women who initiated trastuzumab, with the completion of > 270 days
   of therapy. RESULTS. The cohort was 75% white, 8% black, and 9%
   Hispanic; and 20% of women had attained a high school degree or less.
   Most women (83%) received trastuzumab, and no significant differences
   were observed according to race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Among
   the women who initiated trastuzumab, 73% of black women versus 87% of
   white women (P = .007) and 70% of women with less than a high school
   education versus 90% of women with a college degree completed > 270 days
   of therapy (P = .006). In adjusted analyses, black women (vs white
   women) and women without a high school degree (vs those with a college
   degree) had lower odds of completing therapy (black women: odds ratio,
   0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-074; white women: odds ratio, 0.27,
   95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.51). CONCLUSIONS. Differences in
   completing trastuzumab therapy were observed according to race and
   educational attainment among women who received treatment at National
   Comprehensive Cancer Network centers. Efforts to assure the appropriate
   use of trastuzumab and to understand treatment barriers are needed and
   may lead to improved outcomes. The authors report differences in the
   rate at which patients complete treatment with trastuzumab according to

AB Background: Women living in slum communities in India too often contend
   with depression. Local social support in other national contexts has
   been shown to reduce such risks. Less research in this area has been
   done in India and specifically with monogamous wives.
   Methods: This study involved a household sample of women reporting
   husband's partner violence or heavy alcohol use (N=220). Participants
   were assessed on high social support in the community, and number of
   depressed days in the past 30 day (dichotomized as 10+ vs. < 10 day).
   Logistic regression analyses assessed associations between local social
   support and depression, adjusting for demographics, spousal violence,
   and husband risky alcohol use.
   Results: High local social support was reported by 40% of women; 33%
   reported never having local social support. Women with high local social
   support were significantly less likely to report depression (AOR: 0.53,
   95% CI: 0.30-0.94), even after adjusting for husbands' recent spousal
   violence perpetration and his risky alcohol use, both of which were also
   significantly associated with depression.
   Limitations: The data analyzed for this study are vulnerable to
   self-report and recall biases, as well as issues around social
   desirability. These analyses are further limited due to the use of
   single item measures to assess depression and local social support.
   Conclusions: Local social support reduces risk for depression among
   women in Mumbai contending with husbands' spousal violence and risky
   alcohol use. These findings support the likely utility of
   community-based social support building to reduce risk for depression
   among this vulnerable population of women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Background. Few researchers have assessed the relationships between
   socioeconomic inequality and infectious disease outbreaks at the
   population level globally. We use a socioeconomic model to forecast
   national annual rates of infectious disease outbreaks.
   Methods. We constructed a multivariate mixed-effects Poisson model of
   the number of times a given country was the origin of an outbreak in a
   given year. The dataset included 389 outbreaks of international concern
   reported in the World Health Organization's Disease Outbreak News from
   1996 to 2008. The initial full model included 9 socioeconomic variables
   related to education, poverty, population health, urbanization, health
   infrastructure, gender equality, communication, transportation, and
   democracy, and 1 composite index. Population, latitude, and elevation
   were included as potential confounders. The initial model was pared down
   to a final model by a backwards elimination procedure. The dependent and
   independent variables were lagged by 2 years to allow for forecasting
   future rates.
   Results. Among the socioeconomic variables tested, the final model
   included child measles immunization rate and telephone line density. The
   Democratic Republic of Congo, China, and Brazil were predicted to be at
   the highest risk for outbreaks in 2010, and Colombia and Indonesia were
   predicted to have the highest percentage of increase in their risk
   compared to their average over 1996-2008.
   Conclusions. Understanding socioeconomic factors could help improve the
   understanding of outbreak risk. The inclusion of the measles
   immunization variable suggests that there is a fundamental basis in
   ensuring adequate public health capacity. Increased vigilance and
   expanding public health capacity should be prioritized in the projected
   high-risk regions.

AB Objectives To examine the association between income inequality and the
   risk of mortality and readmission within 30 days of hospitalization.
   Design Retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the
   United States. Hierarchical, logistic regression models were developed
   to estimate the association between income inequality (measured at the
   US state level) and a patient's risk of mortality and readmission, while
   sequentially controlling for patient, hospital, other state, and patient
   socioeconomic characteristics. We considered a 0.05 unit increase in the
   Gini coefficient as a measure of income inequality.
   Setting US acute care hospitals.
   Participants Patients aged 65 years and older, and hospitalized in
   2006-08 with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, heart
   failure, or pneumonia.
   Main outcome measures Risk of death within 30 days of admission or
   rehospitalization for any cause within 30 days of discharge. The
   potential number of excess deaths and readmissions associated with
   higher levels of inequality in US states in the three highest quarters
   of income inequality were compared with corresponding data in US states
   in the lowest quarter.
   Results Mortality analyses included 555 962 admissions (4348 hospitals)
   for acute myocardial infarction, 1 092 285 (4484) for heart failure, and
   1 146 414 (4520); readmission analyses included 553 037 (4262), 1 345
   909 (4494), and 1 345 909 (4524) admissions, respectively. In 2006-08,
   income inequality in US states (as measured by the average Gini
   coefficient over three years) varied from 0.41 in Utah to 0.50 in New
   York. Multilevel models showed no significant association between income
   inequality and mortality within 30 days of admission for patients with
   acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. By contrast,
   income inequality was associated with rehospitalization (acute
   myocardial infarction, risk ratio 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to
   1.15), heart failure 1.07 (1.01 to 1.12), pneumonia 1.09 (1.03 to
   1.15)). Further adjustment for individual income and educational
   achievement did not significantly attenuate these findings. Over the
   three year period, we estimate an excess of 7153 (2297 to 11 733)
   readmissions for acute myocardial infarction, 17 991 (3410 to 31 772)
   for heart failure, and 14 127 (4617 to 23 115) for pneumonia, that are
   associated with inequality levels in US states in the three highest
   quarters of income inequality, compared with US states in the lowest
   quarter.
   Conclusions Among patients hospitalized with acute myocardial
   infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, exposure to higher levels of
   income inequality was associated with increased risk of readmission but
   not mortality. In view of the observational design of the study, these
   findings could be biased, owing to residual confounding.

AB Application of social network analysis to education has revealed how

   and academic achievements. However, no study has been conducted on how
   their social network influences their academic progress over time. Here
   we investigated correlations between high school students' academic
   progress over one year and the social environment that surrounds them in
   their friendship network. We found that students whose friends' average
   GPA (Grade Point Average) was greater (or less) than their own had a
   higher tendency toward increasing (or decreasing) their academic ranking
   over time, indicating social contagion of academic success taking place
   in their social network.

AB Studies of social networks, mapped using self-reported contacts, have
   demonstrated the strong influence of social connections on the
   propensity for individuals to adopt or maintain healthy behaviors and on
   their likelihood to adopt health risks such as obesity. Social network
   analysis may prove useful for businesses and organizations that wish to
   improve the health of their populations by identifying key network
   positions. Health traits have been shown to correlate across friendship
   ties, but evaluating network effects in large coworker populations
   presents the challenge of obtaining sufficiently comprehensive network
   data. The purpose of this study was to evaluate methods for using online
   communication data to generate comprehensive network maps that reproduce
   the health-associated properties of an offline social network. In this
   study, we examined three techniques for inferring social relationships
   from email traffic data in an employee population using thresholds based
   on: (1) the absolute number of emails exchanged, (2) logistic regression
   probability of an offline relationship, and (3) the highest ranked email
   exchange partners. As a model of the offline social network in the same
   population, a network map was created using social ties reported in a
   survey instrument. The email networks were evaluated based on the
   proportion of survey ties captured, comparisons of common network
   metrics, and autocorrelation of body mass index (BMI) across social
   ties. Results demonstrated that logistic regression predicted the
   greatest proportion of offline social ties, thresholding on number of
   emails exchanged produced the best match to offline network metrics, and
   ranked email partners demonstrated the strongest autocorrelation of BMI.
   Since each method had unique strengths, researchers should choose a
   method based on the aspects of offline behavior of interest. Ranked
   email partners may be particularly useful for purposes related to health
   traits in a social network.

AB Hunting remains the cornerstone of the North American model of wildlife
   conservation and management. Nevertheless, research has indicated the
   potential for hunting to adversely influence size of horn-like
   structures of some ungulates. In polygynous ungulates, mating success of
   males is strongly correlated with body size and size of horn-like
   structures; consequently, sexual selection has favored the development
   of large horns and antlers. Horn-like structures are biologically
   important and are of great cultural interest, both of which highlight
   the need to identify long-term trends in size of those structures, and
   understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for such trends. We
   evaluated trends in horn and antler size of trophy males (individuals
   exhibiting exceptionally large horns or antlers) recorded from 1900 to
   2008 in Records of North American Big Game, which comprised >22,000
   records among 25 trophy categories encompassing the geographic extent of
   species occupying North America. The long-term and broad-scale nature of
   those data neutralized localized effects of climate and population
   dynamics, making it possible to detect meaningful changes in size of
   horn-like structures among trophy males over the past century; however,
   ages of individual specimens were not available, which prevented us from
   evaluating age-class specific changes in size. Therefore, we used a
   weight-of-evidence approach based on differences among trophy categories
   in life-history characteristics, geographic distribution, morphological
   attributes, and harvest regimes to discriminate among competing
   hypotheses for explaining long-term trends in horn and antler size of
   trophy ungulates, and provide directions for future research. These
   hypotheses were young male age structure caused by intensive harvest of
   males (H1), genetic change as a result of selective male harvest (H2), a
   sociological effect (H3), effects of climate (H4), and habitat
   alteration (H5). Although the number of entries per decade has increased
   for most trophy categories, trends in size of horn-like structures were
   negative and significant for 11 of 17 antlered categories and 3 of 8
   horned categories. Mean predicted declines during 19502008 were 1.87%
   and 0.68% for categories of trophy antlers and horns, respectively. Our
   results were not consistent with a sociological effect (H3), nutritional
   limitation imposed by climate (H4), or habitat alteration (H5) as
   potential explanations for long-term trends in size of trophies. In
   contrast, our results were consistent with a harvest-based explanation.
   Two of the 3 species that experienced the most conservative harvest
   regimes in North America (i.e., bighorn sheep [Ovis canadensis] and
   bison [Bison bison]) did not exhibit a significant, long-term trend in
   horn size. In addition, horn size of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana),
   which are capable of attaining peak horn size by 23 years of age,
   increased significantly over the past century. Both of those results
   provide support for the intensive-harvest hypothesis, which predicts
   that harvest of males has gradually shifted age structure towards
   younger, and thus smaller, males. The absence of a significant trend for
   mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), which are difficult to accurately
   judge size of horns in the field, provided some support for the
   selective-harvest hypothesis. One other prediction that followed from
   the selective-harvest hypothesis was not supported; horned game were not
   more susceptible to reductions in size.
   A harvest-induced reduction in age structure can increase the number of
   males that are harvested prior to attaining peak horn or antler size,
   whereas genetic change imposed by selective harvest may be less likely
   to occur in free-ranging populations when other factors, such as age and
   nutrition, can override genetic potential for size. Long-term trends in
   the size of trophy horn-like structures provide the incentive to
   evaluate the appropriateness of the current harvest paradigm, wherein
   harvest is focused largely on males; although the lack of information on
   age of specimens prevented us from rigorously differentiating among
   causal mechanisms. Disentangling potential mechanisms underpinning
   long-term trends in horn and antler size is a daunting task, but one
   that is worthy of additional research focused on elucidating the
   relative influence of nutrition and effects (both demographic and
   genetic) of harvest. (c) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

AB Drawing on archival materials and personal testimonies, I reconstruct
   the conditions under which Bourdieu came to receive the Gold Medal of
   the National Center for Scientific Research, France's highest science
   prize, in 1993 as a signal case study of the existential predicament and
   institutional trappings of scholarly consecration. Bourdieu's award
   speech and the ceremony at which he read it present a triple interest
   for the history and sociology of sociology. They illustrate how a
   shaping figure in the discipline personally experienced, reflexively
   viewed, and practically navigated the nexus of science, authority, and
   power. They mark 1993 as a pivot-year in Bourdieu's intellectual
   evolution, leading to a new agenda foregrounding the state as paramount
   symbolic power, the alchemy of group formation, and the unfinished
   promise of democratic politics; and they help explain why he ventured
   more forthrightly into civic debate in the 1990s. Bourdieu's ambivalent
   acceptance of the prize also illustrates his conception of the
   Realpolitik of reason' and put an emphatic end to the eclipse of
   Durkheim by restoring sociology to its rightful place at the scientific
   zenith in the country of its birth.

AB We argue that purely deficit-based perspectives regarding urban
   social-ecological systems (SES) and the human populations within them
   represent barriers to these systems' ability to move from undesirable
   system states into more desirable, sustainable ones. We characterize
   issues such as individual ecological identity, human exemptionalism,
   anthropocentrism, and resource dependence. We examine notions found in
   the resource dependency literature, where we trace the roots of ideas
   about dependency. We use this literature as a spring board into the
   possibilities of an antipodal notion of resource dependency potentially
   applicable in urban contexts, what we call positive dependency. Next we
   describe two possible sources of positive dependency in urban SES,
   urgent biophilia and restorative topophilia, followed by a brief
   discussion applying positive dependence to urban systems challenges and
   management. We conclude with the importance of recognition of positive
   dependency as a precursor to the development of a heightened sense of
   ecological self and sense of ecological place in urban SES, and provide
   insights and suggestions for further research into civic ecology
   practices that may enhance positive dependency on and investment in
   ecological assets that contribute to positive ecological senses of self
   and place, and the importance of these to achieving sustainable,

   provide a holistic assessment of diabetes care and management among
   people with diabetes (PWD), family members (FM), and healthcare
   professionals (HCPs) and explores potential drivers leading to active
   management.
   Methods: DAWN2 survey over 16,000 individuals (similar to 9000 PWD,
   similar to 2000 FM of PWD, and similar to 5000 HCPs) in 17 countries
   across 4 continents. Respondents complete a group-specific
   questionnaire; items are designed to allow cross-group comparisons on
   common topics. The questionnaires comprise elements from the original
   DAWN study (2001), as well as psychometrically validated instruments and
   novel questions developed for this study to assess self-management,
   attitudes/beliefs, disease impact/burden, psychosocial distress,
   health-related quality of life, healthcare provision/receipt, social
   support and priorities for improvement in the future. The questionnaires
   are completed predominantly online or by telephone interview,
   supplemented by face-to-face interviews in countries with low internet
   access. In each country, recruitment ensures representation of the
   diabetes population in terms of geographical distribution, age, gender,
   education and disease status.
   Discussion: DAWN2 aims to build on the original DAWN study to identify
   new avenues for improving diabetes care. This paper describes the study

AB This article considers contemporary developments in public health

   important insights for the sociology of pandemics. PHI aims to detect
   health events as (or even before) they unfold. Whilst its apparatuses
   envelope traditional public health activities, such as epidemiological
   surveillance, they increasingly extend to non-traditional public health
   activities such as data-mining in electronically mediated social
   networks. With a focus on non-traditional PHI activities, the article
   first situates the study of PHI in relation to the sociology of public
   health. It then discusses the conceptualisation and actualisation of
   pandemics, reflecting on how public health professionals and
   organisations must equip themselves with diverse allies in order to
   realise the claims they make about pandemic phenomena. Finally, using
   the analytic tools of actor-network theory, sites for future empirical
   research that can contribute to the sociology of pandemics are
   suggested.

AB African American adolescents residing in the South are at increased risk
   for obesity and physical inactivity, yet our understanding of potential
   influences is limited.
   Using an ecological framework, this study explored multilevel predictors
   (individual, family, home, and neighborhood environment) of
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among 116 African American
   adolescents (ages 12-16).
   Adolescents and their parents completed self-report surveys for
   hypothesized predictors. Youth physical activity was measured using
   accelerometry.
   In multiple regression models, decreased daily MVPA was associated with
   female sex (beta = -24.27, p < 0.0001). Family social support (beta =
   1.07, p = 0.004) and adolescent self efficacy for PA (beta = 6.89, p =
   0.054) were positively associated with daily MVPA.
   Adolescent demographics along with family social support and
   self-efficacy influence younger African American adolescent physical
   activity. Further exploration of the complex interaction of multiple
   levels of influence is needed to develop appropriate interventions for
   this vulnerable group.

AB School-based extracurricular sport remains an effective strategy to
   increase physical activity. However, school sport is often limited to a
   small number of elite athletes. Few schools provide more inclusive sport
   programs that offer a wider array of activities regardless of ability.
   The aim of this study was to examine school sport participation in
   middle schools (ages 11-14) with contrasting school sport delivery
   strategies (intramural vs. interscholastic).
   Data were obtained through an online survey administered to students at
   four public middle schools (grades 6-8) in a southeastern US city (n =
   2,582).
   More students participated in school sports at intramural schools. Boys
   were more likely to participate in after-school sports at intramural
   schools. Low-income and Black children, two groups at greater risk of
   physical inactivity and other negative outcomes, had greater
   participation in intramural programs.
   After-school intramural sports in middle school is a promising strategy
   for increasing sport participation.

AB Little is known about how physical activity and various high-risk
   behaviors of youth are associated, particularly in disadvantaged,
   minority neighborhoods.
   We examine whether fear, victimization, and perceived incivilities are
   associated with physical activity and outdoor recreation among Latino
   youth and whether involvement in physical activity is associated with
   delinquency.
   Path models were assessed using data collected from school-based surveys
   of 390 youth across 3 schools in Chicago, Illinois.
   Fear was associated with low levels of physical activity and outdoor
   recreation, while incivilities were associated with reduced levels of
   outdoor recreation but not physical activity. Outdoor recreation
   exhibited a positive association with delinquency. Some effects differed
   by gender.
   The findings reinforce considering different interventions to encourage
   physical activity and outdoor recreation for girls versus boys, and
   thinking comprehensively about lowering the risk for delinquency when
   encouraging outdoor recreation.

AB Parks are key community assets for physical activity, but some evidence
   suggests these resources are not equitably distributed.
   This study examined disparities by income and race/ethnicity in the
   availability, features, and quality of parks across Kansas City,
   Missouri.
   All parks and census tracts (CTs) were mapped using geographical
   information systems, and park features and quality were determined via
   audits. Multivariate analyses of covariance analyzed differences in park
   availability, features, and quality across low-, medium-, and
   high-income and race/ethnicity CT tertiles.
   Low-income CTs contained significantly more parks, but also had fewer
   parks with playgrounds and more quality concerns per park. High minority
   CTs had more parks with basketball courts, but fewer parks with trails.
   Medium-income CTs contained more aesthetic features per park.
   Future research should examine policies that contribute to and that
   might rectify disparities in park features and quality, especially in
   low-income and high minority areas.

   This study examines ecological associations of spatial access to parks
   and green spaces with percentages of black, Hispanic, and low-income
   residents across the urban-rural continuum in the conterminous USA.
   Census tract-level park and green space data were linked with data from
   the 2010 U.S. Census and 2006-2010 American Community Surveys. Linear
   mixed regression models were performed to examine these associations.
   Poverty levels were negatively associated with distances to parks and
   percentages of green spaces in urban/suburban areas while positively
   associated in rural areas. Percentages of blacks and Hispanics were in
   general negatively linked to distances to parks and green space coverage
   along the urban-rural spectrum.
   Place-based race-ethnicity and poverty are important correlates of
   spatial access to parks and green spaces, but the associations vary
   across the urbanization levels.

AB Lead (Pb) is a well-studied environmental contaminant that has many
   negative health effects, especially for children. Both racial/ethnic and
   income disparities have been documented with respect to exposure to Pb
   in soils. The objectives of this study were to assess whether soil Pb
   concentrations in rural and urban areas of South Carolina USA,
   previously identified as having clusters of intellectual disabilities
   (ID) in children, were positively associated with populations of
   minority and low-income individuals and children (<= 6 years of age).
   Surface soils from two rural and two urban areas with identified
   clusters of ID were analyzed for Pb and concentrations were spatially
   interpolated using inverse distance weighted analysis. Population
   race/ethnicity and income-to-poverty ratio (ITPR) from United States
   Census 2000 block group data were aerially interpolated by block group
   within each area. Urban areas had significantly higher concentrations of
   Pb than rural areas. Significant positive associations between black,
   non-Hispanic Latino, individuals and children <= 6 years of age and mean
   estimated Pb concentrations were observed in both urban (r = 0.38, p =
   0.0007) and rural (r = 0.53, p = 0.04) areas. Significant positive
   associations also were observed between individuals and children with an
   ITPR < 1.00 and Pb concentrations, though primarily in urban areas.
   Racial/ethnic minorities and low ITPR individuals, including children,
   may be at elevated risk for exposure to Pb in soils.

AB We investigated social and demographic factors as they relate to
   prevalence and incidence of epilepsy in Washington, DC, a culturally
   diverse area. Probability-based sampling was used to select 20,000
   households to complete a mailed epilepsy screening survey on all
   household members. Screened individuals with a history of epilepsy were
   sent a detailed case survey about seizures and treatment. Prevalence and
   incidence of epilepsy were estimated using weighted data. Lifetime
   prevalence was 1.53% overall; 0.77% in Whites, 2.13% in Blacks, and 3.4%
   in those with less than a high school diploma. Prevalence of active
   epilepsy was 0.79% and followed similar subgroup comparisons as lifetime
   prevalence. Age-adjusted lifetime and active epilepsy from multivariate
   analyses demonstrated significantly higher rates for Blacks compared to
   Whites and for those not completing high school compared to those that
   attended graduate school. The incidence of epilepsy was 71 per 100,000
   persons. Adults with active epilepsy were significantly less likely to
   live alone than those without epilepsy. Residents of DC for <4 years had
   the lowest prevalence and incidence of all subgroups indicating a
   possible healthy mover effect. This is the first study to provide
   estimates and profiles of the epilepsy population in DC which can help
   better target resources to improve the health and outcomes of people
   with epilepsy and their families. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   sociology and the sociology of natural resources is healthy. Attempts to
   more adequately understand the relationships between social organization
   and the natural world need to be informed by reviews and critiques of
   past and current work by resource/environmental social scientists and
   the array of theoretical frameworks, research designs, and
   problem-solving capabilities that are represented in the literature. In
   this article, we provide a perspective on the paths that natural
   resource sociology and environmental sociology have taken. We draw
   distinctions based on their origins, conceptual orientations,
   theoretical perspectives, and problem-solving focuses. Clarifying the
   differences between natural resource sociology and environmental
   sociology will not only help in tracing the intellectual foundations for
   these subfields of inquiry and bring to light lost literature, but also
   point to areas where synthesis and convergence in these subfields are

AB Objective To determine if there are differences or similarities in
   arthritis intervention preferences and barriers to participation between
   African Americans and whites with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Using a
   needs assessment survey, intervention preferences and barriers to
   participation in arthritis interventions among African American (n = 60)
   and white (n = 55) adults with self-reported doctor-diagnosed OA were
   examined. T-tests, chi-square tests, and multiple regression analyses
   adjusting for covariates were examined to determine race effects.
   Results While there were many similarities, African Americans were more
   likely to report cost (P < 0.01), lack of trust (P = 0.04), fear of
   being the only person of their race (P < 0.001), lack of recommendation
   from their doctor (P = 0.04), and lack of recommendation of a family
   member or friend (P = 0.02) as barriers to participating in a
   community-based self-management arthritis intervention. After adjusting
   for covariates, African Americans preferred interventions that provide
   information on arthritis-related internet sources (P = 0.04), solving
   arthritis-related problems (P = 0.04), and talking to family and friends
   about their condition (P = 0.02) in comparison to whites. African
   Americans also preferred an intervention with child care services
   provided (P < 0.01), with instructors and participants of the same race
   (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) or sex (P < 0.001 and P = 0.03,
   respectively), that allows a friend (P = 0.001) or family member (P =
   0.02) to attend, that is offered at a local church (P = 0.01) or clinic
   (P < 0.01), or that is mailed (P < 0.01). Conclusion Findings suggest
   that similar interventions are preferred across racial groups, but some
   practical adaptations could be made to existing arthritis interventions
   to minimize barriers, increase cultural sensitivity, and offer programs
   that would be appealing to African Americans and whites with arthritis.

AB We use the fire ecology and biogeographical patterns of Callitris
   intratropica, a fire-sensitive conifer, and the Asian water buffalo
   (Bubalus bubalis), an introduced mega-herbivore, to examine the
   hypothesis that the continuation of Aboriginal burning and cultural
   integration of buffalo contribute to greater savanna heterogeneity and
   diversity in central Arnhem Land (CAL) than Kakadu National Park (KNP).
   The 'Stone Country' of the Arnhem Plateau, extending from KNP to CAL, is
   a globally renowned social-ecological system, managed for millennia by
   Bininj-Kunwok Aboriginal clans. Regional species declines have been
   attributed to the cessation of patchy burning by Aborigines. Whereas the
   KNP Stone Country is a modern wilderness, managed through prescribed
   burning and buffalo eradication, CAL remains a stronghold for Aboriginal
   management where buffalo have been culturally integrated. We surveyed
   the plant community and the presence of buffalo tracks among intact and
   fire-damaged C. intratropica groves and the savanna matrix in KNP and
   CAL. Aerial surveys of C. intratropica grove condition were used to
   examine the composition of savanna vegetation across the Stone Country.
   The plant community in intact C. intratropica groves had higher stem
   counts of shrubs and small trees and higher proportions of
   fire-sensitive plant species than degraded groves and the savanna
   matrix. A higher proportion of intact C. intratropica groves in CAL
   therefore indicated greater gamma diversity and habitat heterogeneity
   than the KNP Stone Country. Interactions among buffalo, fire, and C.
   intratropica suggested that buffalo also contributed to these patterns.
   Our results suggest linkages between ecological and cultural integrity
   at broad spatial scales across a complex landscape. Buffalo may provide
   a tool for mitigating destructive fires; however, their interactions
   require further study. Sustainability in the Stone Country depends upon
   adaptive management that rehabilitates the coupling of indigenous
   culture, disturbance, and natural resources.

AB The relationship between the medical and disability communities is
   complex and is influenced by historical, social, and cultural factors.
   Although clinicians, health-care researchers, and people with
   disabilities all work from the standpoint of the best interest of
   disabled individuals, the notion of what actually is "best" is often
   understood quite differently among these constituencies. Eugenics
   campaigns, legal restrictions on reproductive and other freedoms, and
   prenatal testing recommendations predicated on the lesser worth of
   persons with disabilities have all contributed toward the historic
   trauma experienced by the disability community, particularly with
   respect to medical genetics. One premise of personalized medicine is
   that different individuals require different solutions. Disabled
   persons' experiences are a reminder that these solutions can be best
   realized by maintaining awareness and sensitivity in a complex ethical
   and moral terrain. Geneticists should recognize that their research may
   have implications for those with disabilities; they should recognize the

AB Background. Facial disfigurement from head and neck cancer can lead to
   the development of shame and a perception of stigma. We sought to
   develop the Shame and Stigma Scale (SSS) to measure this.
   Methods. Items were administered to 104 patients with squamous cell
   carcinoma of the oral cavity, together with measures of quality of life
   and adaptation. Exploratory factor analysis and item response theory
   (IRT) models assessed its psychometric properties.
   Results. A 20-item SSS had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 and 4 factors:
   shame with appearance, sense of stigma, regret, and speech/social
   concerns. These factors show satisfactory internal validity, convergent
   validity with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
   (FACT-G) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck
   (FACT-H&N), Demoralization Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)
   Depression, and divergent validity with the Social Desirability Scale.
   The items displayed desirable properties in factor-specific (IRT)
   models.
   Conclusion. Further validation studies are worthwhile to confirm this
   factor structure, reliability, and validity, and generalizability to all
   head and neck cancers. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 35:

AB Life course research has established associations between adverse
   childhood events and later life health. We examine the relationship of
   experiencing parental divorce before the age of 16 and survival across
   34 years of adulthood.
   Analysis of panel data from a USA-based survey of 6,928 adults residing
   in Alameda County, California in 1965. Cox regression was used to
   examine associations between parental divorce and longevity.
   Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, gender, and childhood socioeconomic
   position, respondents who recalled a parental divorce during childhood
   had increased risk of mortality compared to those with no separation.
   The association was stronger for premature mortality and deaths due to
   cardiovascular disease. Divorce in childhood was also associated with
   lowered adult education, fewer social network ties, more depression, and
   worse health practices. These factors appeared to explain the
   association with longevity.
   Parental divorce in childhood is associated with lowered well-being in
   adulthood and long-term survival. Early prevention and health promotion
   efforts may be warranted for children who experience parental divorce or
   discord as a means of supporting enhanced trajectories of health and
   well-being.

AB Background. The authors conducted a study to examine the influence of
   social support on dental visits among an adult population.
   Methods. Using 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey data, the authors analyzed information. pertaining to adults 40
   years and older (N = 2,598) (with the exclusion of edentulous people),
   who represent about 108 million people in the United States. They
   weighted logistic regression models for dental visits, while controlling
   for demographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, sex, education,
   insurance, income), socioenvironmental characteristics (marital status,
   emotional and financial support, number of close family members and
   friends, years lived in the neighborhood) and physical and mental health
   status.
   Results. The study findings show that the odds of having had a timely
   dental visit (that is, within the preceding year), a self-care-related
   dental visit (that is, a visit initiated by the patient for a checkup,
   examination or cleaning more than one year previously but less than
   three years previously) or both were decreased significantly by not
   having had any financial help if needed and by having fewer close family
   members and friends. The authors did not find any association. between
   marital status, emotional support or years lived in the neighborhood and
   having had a timely or self-care-related dental visit.
   Conclusions and Clinical Implications. Timely or self-care-related
   dental visits depend. in part on financial support and the number of
   one's close friends and family members. Clinicians should engage
   appropriate members of the patient's social network to facilitate dental
   visits.

   mortality after hospital discharge from neonatal congenital heart
   surgery. A retrospective chart review examined all the neonates who
   underwent neonatal heart surgery from January 2005 to June 2006 at The
   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. After risk adjustment for the type
   of surgery using the Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery 1
   (RACHS-1) method, the association of race with mortality after hospital
   discharge was assessed using Fisher's exact test for statistical
   analysis. A cross-sectional telephone survey of surviving patients also
   was conducted to examine the association of race and social factors with
   adverse events (admissions or reinterventions). Mortality status was
   known for 201 of the 217 patients screened. The mortality rate after
   discharge was 8 %, with a higher mortality rate for nonwhite patients
   (14 %) than for white patients (4 %) (p = 0.01). After risk adjustment,
   this effect was limited to nonwhite patients with less complex heart
   disease (RACHS-1 categories 1-3; 17 vs 2 %, respectively; p = 0.01). The
   survey completion rate was 54 %. In this cohort, race also was
   independently associated with adverse events among patients with less
   complex heart disease (RACHS-1 categories 1-3; nonwhites 53 % vs whites
   25 %; p = 0.046). Among the patients with less complex heart disease,
   the nonwhite patients had a significantly higher risk of morbidity and
   mortality after hospital discharge than the white patients.

AB Maternal mood disorders such as depression and chronic anxiety can
   negatively affect the lives of both mothers and their adult offspring.
   An active focus of maternal depression and anxiety research has been the
   role of chronic social stress in the development of these disorders.
   Chronic exposure to social stress is common in humans, especially in
   lactating mothers, and postpartum mood disorders have been correlated
   with high levels of social conflict and low levels of social support.
   Recent studies have described an effective and ethologically relevant
   chronic social stress (CSS) based rodent model for postpartum depression
   and anxiety. Since CSS attenuates maternal behavior and impairs both dam
   and offspring growth, it was hypothesized that CSS is an ethologically
   relevant form of early life stress for the developing female offspring
   and may have effects on subsequent adult maternal behavior and
   neuroendocrinology. Dams exposed to early life CSS as infants display
   substantial increases in pup retrieval and nursing behavior that are
   specifically associated with attenuated oxytocin, prolactin, and
   vasopressin gene expression in brain nuclei involved in the control of
   maternal behavior. Since the growth patterns of both groups were similar
   despite substantial increases in nursing duration, the early life CSS
   dams exhibited an attenuated nursing efficiency. It is concluded that
   early life CSS has long term effects on the neuroendocrinology of
   maternal care (oxytocin and prolactin) which results in decreased
   nursing efficiency in the adult dams. The data support the use of early
   life CSS as an effective model for stress-induced impairments in
   nursing, such as those associated with postpartum depression and
   anxiety. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Residence in a socioeconomically disadvantaged community is
   associated with mortality, but the mechanisms are not well understood.
   We examined whether socioeconomic features of the residential
   neighborhood contribute to poststroke mortality and whether neighborhood
   influences are mediated by traditional behavioral and biologic risk
   factors.
   Methods: We used data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a
   multicenter, population-based, longitudinal study of adults >= 65 years.
   Residential neighborhood disadvantage was measured using neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (NSES), a composite of 6 census tract variables
   representing income, education, employment, and wealth. Multilevel Cox
   proportional hazard models were constructed to determine the association
   of NSES to mortality after an incident stroke, adjusted for
   sociodemographic characteristics, stroke type, and behavioral and
   biologic risk factors.
   Results: Among the 3,834 participants with no prior stroke at baseline,
   806 had a stroke over a mean 11.5 years of follow-up, with 168 (20%)
   deaths 30 days after stroke and 276 (34%) deaths at 1 year. In models
   adjusted for demographic characteristics, stroke type, and behavioral
   and biologic risk factors, mortality hazard 1 year after stroke was
   significantly higher among residents of neighborhoods with the lowest
   NSES than those in the highest NSES neighborhoods (hazard ratio 1.77,
   95% confidence interval 1.17-2.68).
   Conclusion: Living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood is
   associated with higher mortality hazard at 1 year following an incident
   stroke. Further work is needed to understand the structural and social
   characteristics of neighborhoods that may contribute to mortality in the
   year after a stroke and the pathways through which these characteristics
   operate. Neurology (R) 2013;80:520-527

AB We investigated the influence of contextual expressions on emotion

   Consistent with our hypothesis, Americans were more accurate than
   Chinese participants at recognizing emotions embedded in the context of
   other emotional expressions. Eye-tracking data suggest that, for some
   emotions, Americans attended more to the target faces, and they made
   more gaze transitions to the target face than Chinese. For all emotions
   except anger and disgust, Americans appeared to use more of a
   contrasting strategy where each face was individually contrasted with
   the target face, compared with Chinese who used less of a contrasting
   strategy. Both cultures were influenced by contextual information,
   although the benefit of contextual information depended upon the
   perceptual dissimilarity of the contextual emotions to the target
   emotion and the gaze pattern employed during the recognition task.

AB Since the advent of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM)
   in the mid-1980s, scholars and practitioners have sought to explain the
   uneven performance of CBNRM programs. Most CBNRM assessments examine the
   underlying principles of community-based conservation, the local social
   and ecological contexts, and connections with larger political and
   historical patterns. In this article, I argue that analysis of the
   potential and pitfalls of CBNRM also requires an understanding of the
   institutional history and internal dynamics of projects that implement
   CBNRM reforms. Drawing upon theory and methods from development
   ethnography and public policy, I examine the rise and fall of CONASA, a
   second-generation CBNRM project in Zambia that operated from 2001 to
   2004. CONASA was constituted from a merger of organizations and
   discourses to provide continuity with previous projects. Its ambitious
   suite of activities included support for household livelihoods,
   community-based resource management, policy analysis, advocacy, and
   conservation enterprises at local, national, and transboundary levels.
   While individual activities were largely successful, CONASA's hybrid
   origins and logframe-centric management created fissures between its
   holistic design and operational logics, and hindered its ability to
   develop a broader narrative and maintain key alliances. This case study
   illustrates the importance of understanding the interplay between
   project design and operational context to fully appreciate the
   possibilities and limitations of project-mode conservation.

AB While farming has been the subject of frequent critical analysis with
   respect to its environmental impacts, including its greenhouse gas
   emissions, there has been relatively little consideration of the
   potentially positive role of agriculture in responding to a future
   greatly influenced by climate change. One possible realm for agriculture
   to contribute successfully to this future is through biofuels
   cultivation. This paper uses the state of Kansas as an example to
   examine factors that are influencing farmer decision-making during a
   time of heightened debates about climate and energy. Drawing on
   interviews with key informants and Kansas farmers, we apply and refine a
   conceptual model for understanding farmer decisions. We find that
   farmers have largely positive perceptions of the natural environment.
   Climate change, especially, is not a salient concern at this time.
   Factors that appear most likely to influence farmer decisions to adopt a
   new practice include the relative advantage of that practice and the
   ability to learn about and discuss it through existing social networks.
   Successful policy incentives must provide farmers with a continued sense
   of both independence and contribution to greater societal good.

AB Older, economically troubled urban neighborhoods present multiple

   framework led to implementation of best management practices followed by
   assessment of changes in human perception, behavior, and education
   programs. Results suggest that such an initiative can improve both water
   quality (eg reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus runoff) and quality of
   life (eg increased involvement in outdoor recreation by residents and
   improvements in student environmental literacy and performance) in urban
   neighborhoods. However, proposed solutions to the water-quality problems
   in such neighborhoods have (1) typically emphasized the need for
   stormwater facilities that are difficult to build and maintain and (2)
   comprehensively addressed neither the issues related to aging

AB Conservation subdivision design offers an environmentally superior
   alternative to traditional large-lot, low-density subdivision
   development but remains far less prevalent. Moreover, when it is
   implemented, commonly identified goals of protection of lands with
   conservation value, creation of a regional network of open spaces, and
   contribution to improved water quality are often not reached. This paper
   investigates how local land use regulations impact conservation
   subdivision implementation; specifically whether regulations pose
   barriers to the development and environmental success of conservation
   subdivisions. The empirical analysis is based on a review of the zoning
   ordinances of 19 Waukesha County, WI, U.S.A. communities where 54
   conservation subdivisions were built between 1990 and 2005. The
   ordinance review was supplemented with a review of permitting documents
   for 22 subdivisions and interviews with 16 developers. The analysis
   finds that conservation outcomes in a subdivision were seldom
   significantly different based on the presence and specificity of land
   use regulations and guidelines. In addition, the study identifies the
   permitting process and its most important tool, the zoning ordinance, as
   barriers to the successful implementation of conservation subdivision
   design. An important implication of this research is that unless
   conservation subdivisions are permitted by right or encouraged with
   incentives, rigorous guidelines for natural resource protection are
   provided, and the design is championed by key decision makers,
   conservation subdivision design is likely going to remain the
   less-popular development pattern at the urban fringe, and its
   environmental goals will continue to be compromised. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   high-income countries over the last three decades, and the variables
   that might explain that evolution. Life expectancy at age 65 for males
   and females is used as summary indicator to conceptualize "health at
   advanced age." A comparison of the nine countries - Canada, Denmark,
   France, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the
   United States - reveals excellent health performance for Japan, which
   has the greatest proportion of elderly people in the population and also
   the best health indicators for both males and females; the United States
   and Denmark perform poorly. Of all nine countries, the United States has
   the youngest population, the highest income per capita, and the greatest
   expenditure on health care, but also the highest levels of income
   inequality and relative poverty, and lacked universal health care
   coverage during the study period. Experts have considered that these
   three factors have probably contributed to the poor progress in the
   health of the elderly in the United States in recent decades. Tobacco
   consumption appears to be a key influence on the health of the elderly
   and probably explains to a large extent - with a lag of several decades
   - the differential evolution of health in these countries. (c) 2012

AB Study Objectives: Black race has been associated with decreased
   continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence. Short sleep
   duration, long sleep latency, and insomnia complaints may affect CPAP
   adherence as they affect sleep and opportunity to use CPAP. We assessed
   whether self-reported sleep measures were associated with CPAP adherence
   and if racial variations in these sleep characteristics may explain
   racial differences in CPAP adherence.
   Design: Analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial (HomePAP),
   which investigated home versus laboratory-based diagnosis and treatment
   of obstructive sleep apnea.
   Setting: Seven American Academy of Sleep Medicine-accredited sleep
   centers in five cities in the United States.
   Patients or Participants: Enrolled subjects (n = 191) with
   apnea-hypopnea index >= 15 and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale >
   12).
   Interventions: N/A.
   Measurements and Results: Multivariable regression was used to assess if
   subjective sleep measures and symptoms predicted 3-mo CPAP use.
   Mediation analysis was used to assess if sleep measures mediated the
   association of race with CPAP adherence. Black participants reported
   shorter sleep duration and longer sleep latency at baseline than white
   and Hispanic participants. Shorter sleep duration and longer sleep
   latency predicted worse CPAP adherence. Sleep duration mediated the
   association of black race with lower CPAP adherence. However, insomnia
   symptoms were not associated with race or CPAP adherence.
   Conclusions: Among subjects with similar severity of obstructive sleep
   apnea and sleepiness, baseline self-reported sleep duration and latency,
   but not perceived insomnia, predicted CPAP adherence over 3 mo. Sleep
   duration explains some of the observed differences in CPAP use by race.
   Sleep duration and latency should be considered when evaluating poor
   CPAP adherence.

AB Background: Urbanization is often cited as a main cause of increasing
   BMIs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and urban residents in
   LMICs tend to have higher BMIs than do rural residents. However,
   urban-rural differences may be driven by differences in socioeconomic
   status (SES).
   bjective: Using nationally representative data collected at 2 time
   points in 38 LMICs, we assessed the association between urban residence
   and BMI before and after adjustment for measures of individual-and
   household-level SES.
   Design: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of nationally
   representative samples of 678,471 nonpregnant women aged 15-49 y, with
   225,312 women in the earlier round of surveys conducted between 1991 and
   2004 and 453,159 women in the later round conducted between 1998 and
   2010. We used linear and ordered multinomial analysis with a country
   fixed effect to obtain a pooled estimate and a country-stratified
   analysis.
   Results: We found that mean BMI (kg/m(2)) in less-developed countries
   was generally higher within urban areas (excess BMI associated with
   urban residence before wealth index adjustment: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.52,
   1.57). However, the urban association was attenuated after SES was
   accounted for (association after adjustment: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.47).
   Individual-and household-level SES measures were independently and
   positively associated with BMI.
   Conclusion: The association between urban residence and obesity in LMICs
   is driven largely by higher individual-and community-level SES in urban
   areas, which suggests that urban residence alone may not cause increased
   body weight in developing countries. Am J Clin Nutr 2013;97:428-36.

AB Background: Child abuse is highly prevalent and associated with
   increased risk for a range of health problems, including cancer,
   cardiovascular disease, diabetes, psychiatric disorders, and other
   health problems. Little is currently known about the mechanism by which
   early adversity confers risk for health problems later in life.
   Purpose: To determine if there are epigenetic differences associated
   with child maltreatment that may help explain association between
   adverse childhood experiences and later health problems.
   Methods: As part of a study examining genetic and environmental factors
   associated with depression, saliva DNA specimens were collected on 96
   maltreated children removed from their parents due to abuse or neglect
   and 96 demographically matched control children between 2003 and 2010.
   In 2011, the Illumina 450K BeadChip was used on stored DNA specimens and
   analyzed to examine whole-genome methylation differences between
   maltreated and control children.
   Results: After controlling for multiple comparisons, maltreated and
   control children had significantly different methylation values at 2868
   CpG sites (p < 5.0 x 10(-7), all sites; average methylation difference
   per site = 17%; range = 1%-62%). The gene set contained numerous markers
   of diseases and biological processes related to the health problems
   associated with early childhood adversity.
   Conclusions: Although replication is required, this study suggests that
   epigenetic mechanisms may be associated with risk for health problems
   later in life in maltreated children. This study lays the groundwork for
   future studies examining health and methylation measures to further
   characterize the role of epigenetic mechanisms in conferring risk for
   medical problems in individuals with histories of early adversity. (Am J
