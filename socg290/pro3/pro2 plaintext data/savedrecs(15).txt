AB The purpose of our study is to examine the economic and social
   correlates of re-employment following job displacement. Our data are
   taken from 247 workers who were displaced as a result of plant Closures
   in Ontario (Canada). Human capital did not affect reemployment. Economic
   need positively affected re-employment. Discrimination negatively
   affected re-employment, and social networks positively affected
   re-employment. Our conclusion falls squarely within the field of
   economic sociology, in that an economic outcome can have both an
   economic and a sociological explanation.

AB Society understands that racial and ethnic minorities experience
   inferior medical care and health status, but may not appreciate the
   seriousness of the problem. Each year the nation spends billions of
   dollars to perfect the "technology" of health care (e.g., development of
   new drugs) and modernize delivery systems, thereby saving thousands of
   lives. Correcting disparities in care, however, would avert five times
   as many deaths. If policymakers adhered to the goal of optimizing
   population health, greater priority would go to resolving disparities
   than to refining technology, but reverse priorities prevail. Adverse
   socioeconomic conditions-chief among the many causes of
   disparities-could be eased through bold socioeconomic reforms. Society
   has the resources to enable the disadvantaged to attain better health
   but pursues other priorities. (C) 2004 American Jortrnal of Preventive

AB Objectives. We examined the 6-month cumulative incidence of anti-gay
   harassment, discrimination, and violence among young gay/bisexual men
   and documented their associations with mental health.
   Methods. Gay/bisexual men from 3 cities in the southwestern United
   States completed self-administered questionnaires.
   Results. Thirty-seven percent of men reported experiencing anti-gay
   verbal harassment in the previous 6 months; 11.2% reported
   discrimination, and 4.8% reported physical violence. Men were more
   likely to report these experiences if they were younger, were more open
   in disclosing their sexual orientation to others, and were HIV positive.
   Reports of mistreatment were associated with lower self-esteem and
   increased suicidal ideation.
   Conclusions. Absent policies preventing anti-gay mistreatment,
   empowerment and community-building programs are needed for young
   gay/bisexual men to both create safe social settings and help them cope
   with the psychological effects of these events.

   Methods. A total of 2508 adults from shelters, meal programs, and
   low-cost hotels received interviews, blood tests, and tuberculosis
   screening.
   Results. Seroprevalence was 10.5% overall, 29.6% for men reporting sex
   with men (MSM), 7.7% for non-MSM injection drug users (IDUs), and 5.0%
   for residual non-MSM/non-IDUs. Risk factors were identified for MSM (sex
   trade among Whites, non-White race, recent receptive anal sex,
   syphilis), non-MSM IDUs (syphilis, lower education, prison, syringe
   sharing, transfusion), and residual subjects (greater than or equal to 5
   recent sexual partners, female crack users who gave sex for drugs).
   Conclusions. HIV seroprevalence was 5 times greater for indigent adults
   than in San Francisco generally. Sexual behavior predicted HIV infection
   better than drug use, even among IDUs.

AB Objectives: To measure girls' and boys' exposure to alcohol advertising
   in magazines and to compare this exposure with that of legal-age
   persons.
   Design, Setting, and Subjects: Alcohol advertisements (N = 6239) in 103
   national magazines for which placement, audience, and cost data for 2001
   and 2002 were available, categorized by year, beverage type, and brand.
   Placement and readership (age and sex) data generated estimates of media
   exposure for the age groups 12 to 20, 21 to 34, And 21 years and older.
   Main Outcome Measures: Gross rating points, an advertising industry
   standard measure of the level of media exposure of a given population,
   and gross rating point ratios comparing exposure of different
   demographic groups.
   Results: Alcohol companies spent $590.4 million to place 471 beer and
   ale advertisements (8%), 4748 distilled spirits advertisements (76%),
   116 low-alcohol refresher advertisements (2%), and 904 advertisements
   for wine (14%) in magazines in 2001 and 2002. In 2002, underage youth
   saw 45% more beer and ale advertising, 12% more distilled spirits
   advertising, 65% more low-alcohol refresher advertising, and 69% less
   advertising for wine than persons 21 years and older. Girls aged 12 to
   20 years were more likely to be exposed to beer, ale, and low-alcohol
   refresher advertising than women in the group aged 21 to 34 or women in
   the group aged 21 years and older. Girls' exposure to low-alcohol
   refresher advertising increased by 216% from 2001 to 2002, while boys'
   exposure increased 46%.
   Conclusion: Exposure of underage girls to alcohol advertising is
   substantial and increasing, pointing to the failure of industry
   self-regulation and the need for further action.

AB Objective: To determine whether office-based interventions change
   adolescents' alcohol beliefs and alcohol use.
   Design: Randomized, controlled trial.
   Setting: Five managed care group practices in Washington, DC.
   Participants: Consecutive 12- to 17-year-olds (N = 409) seeing primary
   care providers (N = 26) for general checkups. Most of the adolescents
   (79%) were African American, 44% were male, and 16% currently drank.
   Interventions: Usual care (Group I), adolescent priming with alcohol
   self-assessment just prior to check-up (Group II), adolescent priming
   and provider prompting with adolescent self-assessment and brochure
   (Group III).
   Main Outcome Measures: Adolescent alcohol beliefs at exit interview and
   self-reported behaviors at 6- and 12-month follow-up.
   Results: At exit interview, Groups II and III reported that less alcohol
   was needed for impaired thinking and a greater intent to drink alcohol
   in the next 3 months than Group I. At 6 months, Group III reported more
   resistance to peer pressure to drink, and Groups II and III reported
   more bingeing than Group I. At 1-year follow-up, controlling for
   baseline levels, Groups II (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% confidence
   interval [CI], 1.44-6.24) and III (OR, 2.86; CI, 1.13-7.26) reported
   more bingeing in the last 3 months than Group I. Group II reported more
   drinking in the last 30 days (OR, 2.31; CI, 1.31-4.07) and in the last 3
   months (OR, 1.76; CI, 1.12-2.77) than Group I.
   Conclusion: Brief office-based interventions were ineffective in
   reducing adolescent alcohol use but may increase adolescent reporting of
   alcohol use.

AB Background: Previous studies of concealed firearm carrying among
   children and adolescents have focused on individual risk factors.
   Objective: To identify features of neighborhoods associated with
   concealed firearm carrying among a representative sample of youth from
   Chicago, Ill.
   Design: Cross-sectional analysis of individual- and neighborhood-level
   data collected by the Project on Human Development in Chicago
   Neighborhoods. Setting: Families and neighborhoods in Chicago.
   Participants: Population-based sample of 1842 multiethnic youth aged 9
   to 19 years and the 218 neighborhoods in which they resided.
   Main Outcome Measure: Whether youth had ever carried a concealed
   firearm.
   Results: Lifetime estimates for concealed firearm carrying were 4.9% for
   males and 1.1% for females. We found that youth in safer and less
   disordered neighborhoods were less likely than youth in unsafe and more
   disordered neighborhoods to carry concealed firearms. Specifically,
   multilevel nonlinear regression models identified a positive association
   between concealed firearm carrying and (1) community members' ratings of
   neighborhoods as unsafe for children; (2) neighborhood social disorder;
   and (3) neighborhood physical disorder. Neighborhood collective efficacy
   was negatively associated with concealed firearm carrying. Models
   controlled for neighborhood economic indicators and individual and
   family factors associated with the carrying of concealed firearms by
   youth.
   Conclusions: Youth are less likely to carry concealed firearms in areas
   where there is less violence and increased safety. Interventions to
   improve neighborhood conditions such as increasing safety, improving
   collective efficacy, and reducing social and physical disorder may be
   efficacious in preventing firearm use and its associated injuries and
   death among youth.

AB Background: African American female adolescents living in low-income
   urban areas are at increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases.
   Objective: To determine if high levels of perceived parental supervision
   and communication were associated with reduced gonorrhea (GC) and
   chlamydia (CT) incidence in low-income, African American, sexually
   experienced female adolescents, aged 14 to 19 years, attending urban
   health clinics.
   Design: A prospective cohort study was used to determine the predictive
   value for high levels of parental supervision and communication on GC
   and CT infection in 158 adolescent females. Multiple logistic regression
   analysis explored the association between incident infection and
   perceived parental supervision and perceived parental communication
   while controlling for relevant demographic and behavioral factors (age,
   religious involvement, school enrollment, a 2-parent household, having a
   main sex partner, and having concurrent sex partners).
   Results: When adjusted for age and baseline GC and CT infection, high
   levels of perceived parental supervision were associated with reduced GC
   and CT incidence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.06; 95% confidence interval,
   0.01-0.31). High levels of perceived parental communication were not
   associated with reduced GC and CT incidence (adjusted odds ratio, 0.55;
   95% confidence interval, 0.21-1.42).
   Conclusions: The link between parental supervision and disease
   acquisition is particularly valuable because it provides evidence that
   parental supervision can result in lower sexually transmitted disease
   rates in urban high-prevalence populations. This is important for
   interventions designed to increase parental involvement as a strategy
   for promoting protective sexual behaviors in female adolescents because
   it indicates that increased parental involvement can also influence
   subsequent disease acquisition.

AB The challenge to effectively evaluating teams in extreme environments

   longer duration missions all further compound the complexity of the
   problem. The primary goal is the insurance of human health and wellbeing
   with expectations that such priorities will naturally lead to improved
   chances for performance and mission success. This paper provides an
   overview of some of the most salient immediate challenges for selecting,
   training, and supporting teams in extreme environments, gives exemplars
   of research findings concerning these challenges, and discusses the need

AB Introduction: Previous anecdotal reports from space and results from
   space simulation studies on Earth have suggested that the group
   interactions of crewmembers during space missions can be problematic in
   ways that can negatively affect crew safety and the accomplishment of
   mission goals. Methods: To assess the interpersonal environment of space
   crewmembers, we used a set of standard questionnaires that were
   completed by 5 astronauts, 8 cosmonauts, and 58 American and Russian
   mission control personnel who participated in the Shuttle/Mir Program.
   Results: Although we did not find strong evidence supporting predicted
   decrements in tension and cohesion during the second half of the
   missions, we did find that both crewmembers and mission control
   personnel displaced unpleasant emotions to monitoring personnel outside
   of their group. We also found significant differences between Americans
   and Russians in terms of measures of satisfaction with their
   interpersonal and work environments. Conclusions: These findings suggest
   a number of countermeasures to help future space crews deal with
   potential maladaptive group interactions. These countermeasures address
   issues at the time of selection, during prelaunch training, during the
   mission itself, and after the crew returns to Earth.

   Hispanic caregivers, OR 0.2 (0.07-0.9), and those who breastfed (partial
   or exclusive), OR 0.4 (0.2-0.9), were less likely to introduce cereal at
   less than 4 months of age. Among caregivers who introduced solids at

   the child sleep better at night. Thirty-four caregivers (76%) who
   started solids at less than 4 months were aware of guidelines regarding
   proper infant feeding practices. Despite knowledge of infant feeding
   guidelines, female caregivers frequently introduce solids at less than 4
   months of age. Early targeted anticipatory guidance is needed to address

AB BACKGROUND: Oocyte donation is a popular treatment option among women
   with ovarian dysfunction. Little is known about the amount of
   information recipients have about their donors and if the amount of
   information the couple has relates to their plans to disclose. The
   purpose of this study was to assess the amount of information recipients
   had about their donors and their disclosure plans. METHODS: Sixty-two
   sets of oocyte donation parents from five programmes completed a
   self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Ninety percent of both men and women
   knew their donor's age, ethnicity, hair colour, eye colour, height,
   weight, education and medical history. Significantly more women than men
   told others about using a donor to conceive, but two-thirds of women and
   men would not tell others if they had to do it over again. Fifty-nine
   percent of women and 52% of men planned to or had told their child; 34%
   of women and 41% of men do not plan to tell. The amount of information
   known about the donor was related to plans to tell the child for men
   only. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of couples plan to tell their child
   of their oocyte donor origin and a majority have told others but many
   regret having done so. Knowledge about the donor is related to
   disclosure for men only.

AB During toddlerhood the ability to organise actions for accomplishing
   goals rapidly increases. The developmental changes in actions and
   self-process that become part of this motivational system have seldom
   been studied simultaneously. Fifty-seven toddlers between the ages of 15
   and 35 months were observed for two sessions while working on mastery
   tasks. These tasks varied in the degree to which the goal was implicit
   in the task materials and consequently in how much representation of the
   goal was necessary to carry out the task. Younger toddlers were just as
   engaged as older toddlers in tasks with implicit (i.e., proximal) goals
   but less engaged on tasks with less implicit (i.e., more distal) goals.
   Older toddlers were more successful in reaching goals (i.e., carrying
   tasks to completion), and they showed more investment in their own
   agency (e.g., more pride when goals were reached and more insistence on
   completing the last step of a task). These broad behavioural changes
   document the increasing propensity of toddlers to use goals to organise
   their behaviours and the increasing importance of self-processes in the
   organisation of action and motivation.

AB We examined the relationship between parents' behaviour and children's
   use of simple arithmetic strategies while playing a board game in
   contrast to solving arithmetic problems. In a microgenetic study
   spanning 3 weeks, 5-year-old children who were just beginning
   kindergarten played a modified game of "Chutes and Ladders" with one of
   their parents, computing their moves from the throw of dice. Children
   also solved math problems (math context) given to them by their parents
   at the end of each session. Children's arithmetic strategies and a
   variety of parental behaviours (prompt, prompt after error, affirmation,
   disaffirmation, cognitive directives, provide answer) were coded for
   children's game moves and the math context. As in past research,
   children used multiple and variable strategies, both when computing
   their moves during the game and in solving the math problems. Parents
   displayed different patterns of behaviours during the game and math
   contexts and showed different relationships among behaviours and
   strategies as a function of context, reflecting their sensitivity to the
   cognitive demands on their children of the different tasks. The results
   were interpreted in terms of the need to integrate contemporary strategy
   development theory with a sociocultural perspective and to recognise the
   dynamic nature of parent-child interactions with respect to the social
   construction of cognitive strategies.

AB This paper describes a pilot study assessing the psychosocial impact of
   political violence in the Peruvian Andes, utilizing a collaborative
   approach with local professionals and communities. The study team
   prioritized dialogue and information exchange with the local
   professional community and villagers participating in the assessment in
   order to raise awareness of psychosocial issues and provide education
   and support. Participation in the pilot study had positive therapeutic
   effects for villagers, and inspired ongoing discussion groups to address
   psychosocial problems in communities. This paper also describes a
   psychosocial assessment strategy utilizing qualitative methods and an
   adaptation of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire in collaboration with
   Andean villagers. Usefulness and limitations of the data will be
   reviewed, in terms of cultural and context relevance, usefulness for
   informing interventions, and comparisons with ethnographic methodologies
   and other survey instruments.

AB Within seven years after the end of the Nicaraguan civil war in 1990,
   forced migrants, whose lives had been most disrupted by the conflict,
   were self-settled in a squatter community in the capital city of Managua
   and lived in extreme poverty with minimal health, education, security
   and social service supports. Compared with voluntary migrant neighbours,
   whose lives had been less affected by the conflict, forced migrants
   exhibited equal clinically significant symptoms of physical and mental
   health and psychosocial maladaptation. These findings run counter to
   generally held theory and assumptions about the negative long-lasting
   effects of the trauma and stress of war, forced migration and
   resettlement. Explanations are offered to explain the discrepancies
   between theory and the study findings as well as the dominance of
   poverty and socioeconomic status. Implications are also drawn for
   increasing social support and other durable forms of assistance that
   emerge from the study as important to meeting the needs of equally poor
   and unhealthy forced and voluntary migrants in proliferating squatter
   communities throughout the Third World.

AB The effects of war-induced anxiety and mental distress on individuals
   and groups can either be mitigated or exacerbated by 'humanitarian
   action'. This paper focuses on two key factors that protect the mental
   well-being of war-affected populations: organized displacement or
   assisted relocation; and coordinated humanitarian aid operations that
   are responsive to local needs. Qualitative data from two internally
   displaced person (IDP) camps in Eritrea are presented. Analysis of these
   data serves to substantiate and refine a working hypothesis: that social
   support of the right type, provided at the right time and level, can
   mitigate the worst effects of war and displacement on victims/survivors.
   An integrated. model of psychosocial transition is suggested. The
   implications of this approach for humanitarian policy and practice are
   discussed in the wider context of current debates and lamentations of
   the 'humanitarian idea'.

AB Limited research has been conducted to measure the association between
   elevated blood lead levels and sociodemographic factors among U.S.
   workers in various industries and occupations using population-based
   survey data. Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (n = 10,127) were used to determine the blood lead
   levels in the U.S. workers. The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels
   greater than or equal to50 mug/dL was 0.001% (1560) among U.S. workers
   compared with 0.2% (19,953) workers with elevated lead levels greater
   than or equal to40 mug/dL. Regression analyses indicated that workers in
   the repair service industry were correlated with higher blood lead
   levels than those workers in the construction industry. Although low
   blood lead levels were found for the entire working population, the
   results showed that there were still high blood lead levels in certain
   occupations and industries during 1988 to 1994.

   implemented consisting of 2264 employees of a large national employer
   located in the Northeast. Participants responded to a health risk
   assessment and work productivity scale. Mean productivity loss was
   compared for individuals with different levels of risk factors using
   analysis of variance. Multivariate analyses, including logistic and
   linear regression, were used to determine the significance of health
   risks on productivity loss. Participants with more risk factors reported
   greater productivity loss (P < 0.001). The odds of any productivity loss
   were most significant for individuals with diabetes (absenteeism) and
   stress (presenteeism). In. conclusion, higher risks are strongly
   associated with greater productivity loss, and different risks are
   associated with absenteeism than with presenteeism.

AB Objective: This study examined changes in drinking as a function of
   changes in perceived drinking norms following a social norms marketing
   campaign to correct normative misperceptions of college student drinking
   among residence hall students. The researchers expected students to
   reduce their estimates of typical student drinking following the social
   marketing campaign and that reductions in perceived norms would be
   associated with reduced drinking. Method: Perceived norms and
   self-reported frequency and quantity of alcohol consumption were
   assessed before and after a social norms marketing campaign among 474
   residence hall students. Results: Paired samples t tests revealed
   reduced perceptions of typical student drinking frequency and quantity.
   In addition, among nonabstainers, drinking quantity went down from pre-
   to postintervention. Further examination revealed that reductions in
   drinking were evident only among students whose perceived norms were
   reduced. Conclusions: Results suggest that social norms marketing in
   residence halls can effectively reduce overestimates of typical student
   drinking and that reduction of perceived drinking norms are associated
   with reduced drinking.

AB OBJECTIVES: To compare rates of institutionalization of dementia
   patients cared for by Latina and Caucasian female caregivers and to
   explore which caregiver and care-recipient characteristics predicted
   institutionalization.
   DESIGN: Longitudinal.
   SETTING: San Francisco Bay area, California.
   PARTICIPANTS Two hundred sixty-four female caregivers of dementia
   patients (154 Caucasian women, 110 Latinas) who participated in an
   intervention project designed to reduce caregiver stress and may
   represent a sample that is more stressed and motivated than a general
   sample of caregivers.
   MEASUREMENTS: Number of days between baseline interview and
   institutionalization was recorded over an 18-month period. Kaplan-Meier
   survival analysis with the log rank statistic was used to test for
   ethnic differences in time to institutionalization. Cox regression
   analyses were conducted to determine whether care-recipient or caregiver
   characteristics (e.g., care-recipient age and memory and behavior
   problems; caregiver depression, years of education, income, and views of
   the caregiving role) significantly interacted with ethnicity to explain
   time to institutionalization.
   RESULTS: Latinas delayed institutionalization significantly longer than
   their Caucasian counterparts; care-recipient characteristics or
   caregiver demographics did not explain these results, although Latinas
   who identified greater benefits or more-positive aspects of the
   caregiving process at baseline were less likely to institutionalize
   their loved one than those who reported fewer benefits of caregiving.
   Less-acculturated Latinas were significantly more likely to identify
   positive aspects of caregiving than more-acculturated Latinas.
   CONCLUSION: Latina dementia caregivers delay institutionalization
   significantly longer than female Caucasian caregivers. In addition,
   Latino cultural values and positive views of the caregiving role are
   important factors that may significantly influence their decision to
   institutionalize loved ones with dementia.

AB OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential facilitators of or deterrents to
   end-of-life planning for community-dwelling older adults, including
   personal (health-related and sociodemographic) and social (physician and
   family) influences.
   DESIGN: In-person interviews with older adults, telephone interviews
   with physicians and family members.
   SETTING: Cleveland, Ohio.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred thirty-one adults aged 65 to 99 who were aging
   in place, 99 of their primary care physicians, and 127 of their family
   members.
   MEASUREMENTS: Questions assessing older adults' discussions with others
   about end-of-life plans, implementation of advance directives, and
   physical (Older American Resources and Services) illness index and
   mental (Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire) health status.
   RESULTS: Just fewer than half of older adults had executed an advance
   directive and discussed their wishes with others. Only personal
   characteristics of elderly individuals were related to end-of-life
   plans, with whites, unmarried individuals, and younger adults more
   likely to have made preparations. Older adults' health status, as
   evaluated by the patient, physician, and caregiver, did not relate to
   the tendency to have made advance care plans. Older adults' family
   members were much more likely to report knowledge of advance care plans
   than were physicians.
   CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that many physicians are not talking
   with their patients about their end-of-life wishes. Furthermore, the
   propensity to have such discussions may relate more to the personal
   preferences and level of comfort of patients, physicians, and family
   members than on the health status of the older adult.

AB Objective. Violent media exposure has been associated with aggressive
   behavior, and it has been suggested that child health professionals
   counsel families on limiting exposure. Effective violence prevention
   counseling requires an understanding of norms regarding parental
   attitudes, practices, and influencing factors. Both theories of reasoned
   action and planned behavior emphasize that subjective norms and
   attitudes affect people's perceptions and intended behavior. Few data
   exist on violent television viewing and monitoring from a cross-section
   of families. By understanding the spectrum of parental attitudes,
   community-sensitive interventions for violence prevention can be
   developed. The objective of this study was to assess attitudes about and
   monitoring of violent television viewing from the perspective of
   parents.
   Methods. An anonymous self-report assisted survey was administered to a
   convenience sample of parents/guardians who visited child health
   providers at 3 sites: an urban children's hospital clinic, an urban
   managed care clinic, and a suburban private practice. The parent
   questionnaire included questions on child-rearing attitudes and
   practices and sociodemographic information.
   Results. A total of 1004 adults who accompanied children for health
   visits were recruited for the study; 922 surveys were completed
   (participation rate: 92%). A total of 830 (90%) respondents were parents
   and had complete child data. Of the 830 respondents, 677 had questions
   on television viewing included in the survey and were the focus of this
   analysis. Seventy-five percent of families reported that their youngest
   child watched television. Of these, 53% reported always limiting violent
   television viewing, although 73% believed that their children viewed
   television violence at least 1 time a week. Among television viewers,
   81% reported usually or always limiting viewing of sexual content on
   television and 45% reported usually or always watching television with
   their youngest child. Among children who watched television, parents
   reported that they spent an average of 2.6 hours per day watching
   television. Limitation of television violence was associated with female
   parents and younger children.
   Conclusions. There was variability in attitudes and practices regarding
   television violence viewing and monitoring among parents. Attitudes and
   practices varied on the basis of the age of the child and the gender of
   the parent.

AB Context. Each year 2.1 million children 19 to 35 months of age are
   undervaccinated. Among these are children who have received no
   vaccinations. Unvaccinated children are at increased risk of acquiring
   and transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases.
   Objectives. To assess whether the characteristics of children with no
   vaccinations differ from those of undervaccinated children, to monitor
   trends in the numbers of unvaccinated children, and to identify states
   with high rates and counties with large numbers of unvaccinated
   children.
   Design. A nationally representative probability sample of children 19 to
   35 months of age was collected annually between 1995 and 2001.
   Vaccination histories were ascertained from children's medical
   providers. Undervaccinated children had received greater than or equal
   to1 dose of diphtheriatetanus-pertussis, polio, measles, Haemophilus
   influenzae type b, hepatitis B, or varicella vaccine but were not fully
   vaccinated. Unvaccinated children were children who were reported as
   having no medical providers and having received no vaccinations or
   children whose medical providers reported administering no vaccinations.
   Participants. A total of 151 720 children sampled between 1995 and 2001,
   795 of whom were unvaccinated.
   Results. Undervaccinated children tended to be black, to have a younger
   mother who was not married and did not have a college degree, to live in
   a household near the poverty level, and to live in a central city.
   Unvaccinated children tended to be white, to have a mother who was
   married and had a college degree, to live in a household with an annual
   income exceeding $75 000, and to have parents who expressed concerns
   regarding the safety of vaccines and indicated that medical doctors have
   little influence over vaccination decisions for their children.
   Unvaccinated children were more likely to be male than female. Annually,
   similar to17 000 children were unvaccinated. The largest numbers of
   unvaccinated children lived in counties in California, Illinois, New
   York, Washington, Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Utah, and
   Michigan. States that allowed philosophical exemptions to laws mandating
   vaccinations for children as they entered school had significantly
   higher estimated rates of unvaccinated children.
   Conclusions. Unvaccinated children have characteristics that are
   distinctly different from those of undervaccinated children.
   Unvaccinated children are clustered geographically, increasing the risk
   of transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases to both unvaccinated and
   undervaccinated children.

AB Context. States have been reluctant to enroll children with special
   health care needs (SHCN) into capitated managed care, because the
   financial incentives inherent in such plans may elicit undertreatment,
   restrict access to specific services and providers, and have adverse
   effects on quality. Little research has examined how children with SHCN
   who qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) fare under managed
   care versus the fee-for-service (FFS) system.
   Objective. To examine how enrollment of children with SHCN with SSI into
   a Medicaid capitated managed care plan differs from regular FFS with
   respect to unmet needs and access to care in the District of Columbia.
   Design, Setting, and Participants. We conducted telephone interviews
   with a random sample of 1088 caregivers of children with SHCN who
   resided in the District of Columbia during the summer and fall of 2002.
   Main Outcome Measures. 1) Usual source of care; 2) unmet need for the
   following services during the 6-month period prior to the interview:
   physician/hospital, mental health, therapy services, dental care,
   durable medical equipment and supplies, prescription drugs, and home
   health services; and 3) caregivers' ratings of dimensions of access to
   services.
   Results. The percentage of FFS children who did not receive needed
   dental care, durable medical equipment/supplies, or prescription drugs
   was significantly larger than the percentage of children enrolled in the
   capitated managed care plan. We found no significant differences by plan
   type in unmet need for physician/hospital care, mental health services,
   home health service, or therapy services.
   The most problematic areas of access seem to be "wait time between
   making an appointment and the actualvisit," "waiting time in the
   doctor's office," " office hours for appointments," "getting medical
   advice by phone," and "getting specialist's care if needed." For each of
   these dimensions of access, children in the FFS system experienced
   significantly more of such access problems, compared with children in
   Health Services for Children With Special Needs (HSCSN). These 4
   dimensions of access cause problems for 18% to 29% of FFS parents but
   only 13.6% to 22.3% of caregivers with a child in HSCSN. Three other
   dimensions of access, " convenience of doctor's office," "getting
   emergency care if needed," and getting hospital care if needed," also
   seemed to pose significantly more problems for caregivers with children
   in FFS plans, compared with those in HSCSN. These dimensions of access
   were only problematic for 9% to 14% of FFS caregivers and 5.9% to 7.7%
   of caregivers with children enrolled in HSCSN.
   Conclusions. Children in the managed care option have lower levels of
   unmet need than children in FFS plans. Caregivers of children in FFS
   plans encountered more difficulties in navigating the health care
   system, compared with those with children in managed care. We conclude
   that a combination of factors that characterize the capitated managed
   care plan are responsible for improving access to care and mitigating
   the level of unmet need among children with SHCN. These include the
   comprehensive care plan assessment, ongoing case management, primary
   care providers' gatekeeping role, and higher physician reimbursement.

AB Objective. To examine the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of parents
   whose children were underimmunized with respect to greater than or equal
   to 2 vaccines that have recently received negative attention, compared
   with parents whose children were fully immunized with respect to the
   recommended vaccines.
   Design. Case-control study. Setting. A sample of households that
   participated in the National Immunization Survey were recontacted in
   2001.
   Main Outcome Measure. Vaccination status was assessed. Case subjects
   were underimmunized with respect to greater than or equal to 2 of 3
   vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis or diphtheria-tetanus-acellular
   pertussis, hepatitis B, or measles-containing vaccines), and control
   subjects were fully immunized.
   Results. The response rate was 52.1% ( 2315 of 4440 subjects). Compared
   with control households, case households were more likely to make $0 to
   $30 000 ( adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
   1.5 - 4.6) than at least $ 75 000, to have greater than or equal to2
   providers ( OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3 - 3.1) than 1, and to have greater than
   or equal to4 children (OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5 - 6.3) than 1 child. With
   control for demographic and medical care factors, case subjects were
   more likely than control subjects to not want a new infant to receive
   all shots (OR: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.5 - 9.8), to score vaccines as unsafe or
   somewhat safe (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2 3.4), and to ask the doctor or nurse
   not to give the child a vaccine for reasons other than illness ( OR:
   2.7; 95% CI: 1.2 - 6.1). Among case subjects, 14.8% of underimmunization
   was attributable to parental attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.
   Conclusions. Attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors indicative of vaccine
   safety concerns contribute substantially to underimmunization in the
   United States. Although concerns were significantly more common among
   parents of underimmunized children, many parents of fully immunized
   children demonstrated similar attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors,
   suggesting a risk to the currently high vaccination levels. Efforts to
   maintain and improve immunization coverage need to target those with
   attitudes/ beliefs/behaviors indicative of vaccine safety concerns, as
   well as those with socioeconomic and health care access problems.

AB Objectives. Several guidelines have been published for the care of
   children with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however,
   few data describe adoption of practice guidelines. Our study sought 1)
   to describe primary care diagnosis and management of ADHD, 2) to

   associated with guideline adherence.
   Methods. We conducted a mail survey of 1374 primary care physicians in
   Michigan. Main outcome measures were reported adherence to practices
   specified in the AAP guidelines; ADHD practice patterns; and other
   measures, including attitudes about parent, teacher, and community
   influences on ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Bivariate and multivariate
   analyses were performed to assess patient and physician factors
   associated with adherence to guideline components.
   Results. The overall response rate was 60%. The majority (77.4%) of
   primary care physicians were familiar with AAP guidelines on ADHD, and
   many (61.1%) reported incorporating the guidelines into their practice.
   Differences were apparent by specialty: 91.5% of pediatricians were
   familiar with the guidelines in contrast to 59.8% of family physicians.
   The majority of clinicians reported practices consistent with individual
   components of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines. However, when
   adherence to multiple components was analyzed together, only 25.8% of
   clinicians reported routine use of all 4 diagnostic components in the
   survey. In addition, some physicians continue to use diagnostic
   modalities that are currently not recommended for routine evaluation of
   school-aged children with ADHD - continuous performance testing,
   neuroimaging, and laboratory tests (eg, thyroid, lead, or iron testing).
   With regard to ADHD treatment, the majority (66.6%) of respondents
   reported routine recommendation of pharmacotherapy and titration of
   medications in the first month when prescribed (81.3%). However, just
   over half (53.1%) reported routine follow-up visits ( 3 - 4 times per
   year) for children who have ADHD and are taking medications. Most
   (53.4%) clinicians also recommended behavioral therapy for children who
   had a diagnosis of ADHD. Patterns of specialty differences were less
   consistent for treatment components: pediatricians were more likely to
   recommend medications, but family physicians reported more frequent
   follow-up evaluations for children who receive medications. There were
   no specialty differences in recommendations for behavioral therapy. In
   addition to physician specialty variations, differences in management
   were apparent by practice type and other demographic characteristics.
   There were few significant associations between adherence to guideline
   components and physician attitudes about parent, teacher, or community
   influences. However, these factors were noted by many respondents. Only
   32.5% agreed that their community had adequate, accessible mental health
   resources. Half (50.1%) of the physicians reported that insurers limit
   coverage for assessment and treatment of ADHD.
   Conclusions. Primary care physicians generally report awareness of
   pediatric ADHD guidelines and follow these clinical practice
   recommendations. However, some physician variations are apparent, and
   areas for improvement are noted. Many primary care physicians report
   poor access to mental health services, limited insurance coverage, and
   other potential system barriers to the delivery of ADHD care. Additional
   study is needed to confirm provider-reported data; to determine what
   constitutes high-quality, long-term management of this chronic
   condition; and to confirm how reported practices associate with
   long-term outcomes for children with ADHD.

AB Objective. Twenty-three million people, accounting for > 58% of Medicaid
   enrollees, are enrolled in Medicaid managed care programs. Although the
   expectation of management in Medicaid managed care programs necessitates
   restrictions in use of some services sought by patients and families,
   the circumstances surrounding care denial and related access problems in
   vulnerable populations of children have not been studied. The objective
   of this study was to identify experiences with care denial reported by
   families in TennCare, Tennessee's managed care program for Medicaid
   enrollees and uninsured.
   Methods. Primary caregivers for 399 children who were enrolled in
   TennCare and presented for care at 21 pediatric and family medicine
   sites throughout Tennessee participated in a face-to-face interview.
   Results. Of the 399 caregivers who participated in the study, 146
   (36.6%) reported that their child experienced denial of care in the
   previous 12 months at a physician's office (12.5% of those interviewed),
   dentist's office (13.8%), or pharmacy (20.0%). For denial of any 1 type
   of care, families of children with chronic conditions (multivariable
   odds ratio [OR]: 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41 - 2.99) and
   those whose parents had > 12 years of education (OR: 1.80; CI: 1.21 -
   2.70) were more likely to report denial of care; families of black
   children were less likely to report denial than white children ( OR:
   0.34; CI: 0.20 - 0.56). Content analysis of caregiver perceptions
   identified provider concerns about reimbursement as a factor in denials.
   Of the children who could not be seen by a physician, caregivers
   perceived that 12.2% became sicker as a result of the delay in care;
   16.3% reported an emergency department visit after the denial.
   Conclusions. More than one third of TennCare families reported denials
   of care for their children in the previous year, and factors surrounding
   these denials were identified. Given the large number of Americans who
   receive health care through Medicaid managed care programs like
   TennCare, more research is needed to understand the implications of
   denied care for children and families who are enrolled in these
   programs.

AB Background. The need exists to educate and motivate medically
   disadvantaged Latinas to engage in regular mammography screening to
   reduce their high breast cancer (BC) mortality risk due to the illness'
   late detection.
   Methods. Qualitative research methods [e.g., focus groups, key
   informants] were primarily used during the basic and formative research
   phases in preproducing and producing a breast cancer educational video
   for low-literacy Latinas.
   Results. An 8-min video was created in an Entertainment-Education soap
   opera format. The purpose of the video is to create awareness about
   breast cancer and to motivate low-literacy Latinas who are at the
   precontemplation stage of behavior change to consider engaging in
   mammography screening. Thus, the video presents a compelling story of a
   Latina with whom the target audience can identify and become involved
   with the unfolding events of her story as she realizes her risk for
   breast cancer and struggles with the decision to engage in mammography.
   The content and format of the video include culturally relevant clues
   and modeling to influence Latinas' cognitive and subjective processes
   involved in making the decision to change.
   Conclusions. Complex attitudinal and behavioral issues can be
   effectively targeted to decrease the influence that psychological
   barriers exert in Latinas low breast cancer screening rates. (C) 2004

AB Objective: The purposes of this study were to a) compare emotional
   responses and perception of control of patients and their spouses to
   myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization; and b) examine the
   relationship between spouses' emotional distress and patients' emotional
   distress and psychosocial adjustment to the cardiac event. Methods: A
   total of 417 patient-spouse pairs were recruited after the patient was
   hospitalized for either acute myocardial infarction or coronary
   revascularization. We compared emotional responses of patients and
   spouses. The relationship between spouse anxiety and depression, and
   patient psychosocial distress was then determined. Results: Spouses had
   higher levels of anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001) than did
   patients, but there were no differences in level of hostility. Patients
   also expressed higher levels of perceived control than did spouses (p <
   .001). Spouse anxiety, depression, and perceived control remained
   correlated with patient psychosocial adjustment to illness, even when
   patient anxiety and depression were kept constant. Patients'
   psychosocial adjustment to illness was worse when spouses were more
   anxious or depressed than patients, and it was best when patients were
   more anxious or depressed than spouses, whereas psychosocial adjustment
   to illness was intermediate to these 2 extremes when patient and spouse
   anxiety and depression levels were similar (p = .001). Conclusion:
   Spouses often experience greater anxiety and depression and less
   perceived control than patients themselves. Attention to the
   psychological distress experienced by spouses of patients who have
   suffered a cardiac event may improve outcomes in patients.

AB Objective: Low childhood socioeconomic status (SES) is a risk factor for
   adult morbidity and mortality primarily attributable to cardiovascular
   disease. Here, we examine whether childhood SES is associated with adult
   host resistance to infectious illness, and whether the effect is limited
   to a critical period of low SES exposure, can be undone by changes in
   childhood SES, and is explained by adult SES. Methods: Three hundred
   thirty-four healthy volunteers reported their own and their parents'
   level of education and the ages during their childhood when their
   parents owned their homes. Volunteers' current home ownership was
   recorded from real estate records. Subsequently, they were given nasal
   drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and were monitored in quarantine
   for infection and signs/symptoms of a common cold. Results: For both
   viruses, susceptibility to colds decreased with the number of childhood
   years during which their parents owned their home (odds ratios by
   tertiles adjusted for demographics, body mass, season, and prechallenge
   viral-specific immunity were 3.7 for fewest years, 2.6 and 1). This
   decreased risk was attributable to both lower risk of infection and
   lower risk of illness in infected subjects. Moreover, those whose
   parents did not own their home during their early life but did during
   adolescence were at the same increased risk as those whose parents never
   owned their home. These associations were independent of parent
   education level, adult education and home ownership, and personality
   characteristics. Conclusions: A marker of low income and wealth during
   early childhood is associated with decreased resistance to upper
   respiratory infections in adulthood. Higher risk is not ameliorated by
   higher SES during adolescence and is independent of adult SES.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of subclinical
   paranoia on social perception and behavior. Two groups of participants,
   those high and low in subclinical paranoia, were identified based on
   extreme scores on the Paranoia Scale (PS). As expected, persons high in
   subclinical paranoia had greater depression, social anxiety,
   self-consciousness, and lower self-esteem compared to persons low in
   subclinical paranoia. In addition, persons high in subclinical paranoia
   performed worse than persons low in subclinical paranoia on laboratory
   measures of emotion perception and on an in vivo social perception task.
   Finally, behavioral differences between these two groups were revealed:
   Persons high in subclinical paranoia sat further away from the examiner
   and took longer to read the consent form than low-paranoia persons.
   These behavioral differences were not due to the group differences in
   clinical functioning, indicating that level of paranoia generally
   accounted for these findings. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   initiative. The goal of this program was (and is) to ensure that
   doctoral students anticipating entry into a professional position be
   prepared for all expectations associated with faculty life in a wide
   variety of college and university placements. NCSUs program combined
   in-house research mentoring opportunities as well as off-campus
   mentoring relationships with faculty at other schools to explore the
   teaching and service responsibilities of junior faculty members. An
   evaluation committee assessed the effectiveness of this new initiative.
   Data were collected using several methods, including surveys,
   interviews, and focus groups. The committee found the PFF program to be
   a welcome addition to graduate training, however, the NCSU program
   experienced struggles that provide insight for other schools that may
   wish to start a PFF program of their own.

PD JUL 2004
PY 2004
AB This paper discusses learning communities as pedagogy for introductory
   sociology courses, which are often plagued by student apathy. Most
   importantly, it examines the potential for learning communities to
   incorporate active and collaborative learning techniques as a vehicle to
   subvert dominant views of diversity, to see diversity as intersecting
   social inequalities that can be rearranged in favor of greater social
   equality. The effectiveness of a learning community with the theme of
   diversity for meeting these goals is assessed using qualitative and
   quantitative data. It is concluded that the pedagogic framework of the
   learning community did indeed push students to problematize their
   student role. Finally, a review of results from a pre/post-test
   questionnaire suggests that students entered the community as a fairly
   homogenous group in their views of diversity and left as a more
   heterogeneous group, indicating some shift in consciousness, however
   slight.

AB The sex ratio at birth (SRB) in Punjab increased from 1.14 to 1.20 male
   births per female birth between 1978-92 and 1984-98. The analysis
   indicates not only considerable sex-selective abortion of girls,, as
   expected, but also some sex-selective abortion of boys. Sex-selective
   abortion of boys is indicated by very, low SRBs for third-order births
   to women who already have two living sons. Also analyzed are trends in
   ideal and wanted sex ratios and how these relate to trends in the actual
   sex ratio at birth. Although the actual SRB increased between the two
   surveys, ideal and wanted sex ratios fell, indicating that declining son
   preference was more than offset by an increasing propensity to use
   sex-selective abortion to achieve one's gender preferences.

   women, aged 42-52 years at baseline (1995-1997), in the Study of Women's
   Health Across the Nation (SWAN). All lifestyle factors and symptoms were

   measured once in days 2-7 of the menstrual cycle. After adjustment for
   covariates using multiple logistic regression, significantly more
   African-American and Hispanic and fewer Chinese and Japanese than
   Caucasian women reported vasomotor symptoms. Fewer women with
   postgraduate education reported vasomotor symptoms. Passive exposure to
   smoke, but not active smoking, higher body mass index, premenstrual
   symptoms, perceived stress, and age were also significantly associated
   with vasomotor symptoms, although a dose-response relation with hours of
   smoke exposure was not observed. No dietary nutrients were significantly
   associated with vasomotor symptoms. These cross-sectional findings
   require further longitudinal exploration to identify lifestyle changes
   for women that may help prevent vasomotor symptoms.

AB Aims The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) Methamphetamine
   Treatment Project (MTP) is the largest randomized clinical trial of
   treatments for methamphetamine (MA) dependence to date. The objective of
   the study was to compare the Matrix Model, a manualized treatment
   method, with treatment-as-usual (TAU) in eight community out-patient
   settings in the Western United States.
   Design Over an 18-month period between 1999 and 2001, 978
   treatment-seeking, MA-dependent people were randomly assigned to receive
   either TAU at each site or a manualized 16-week treatment (Matrix
   Model).
   Setting The study was conducted as an eight-site out-patient trial, with
   six sites located in California and one each in Montana and Hawaii.
   Findings In the overall sample, and in the majority of sites, those who
   were assigned to Matrix treatment attended more clinical sessions,
   stayed in treatment longer, provided more MA-free urine samples during
   the treatment period and had longer periods of MA abstinence than those
   assigned to receive TAU. Measures of drug use and functioning collected
   at treatment discharge and 6 months post-admission indicate significant
   improvement by participants in all sites and conditions when compared to
   baseline levels, but the superiority of the Matrix approach did not
   persist at these two timepoints.
   Conclusions Study results demonstrate a significant initial step in
   documenting the efficacy of the Matrix approach. Although the
   superiority of the Matrix approach over TAU was not maintained at the
   post-treatment timepoints, the in-treatment benefit is an important
   demonstration of empirical support for this psychosocial treatment
   approach.

AB Aims To compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of methadone maintenance
   treatment and 180-day methadone detoxification enriched with
   psychosocial services.
   Design Randomized controlled study conducted from May 1995 to April
   1999.
   Setting Research clinic in an established drug treatment program.
   Participants One hundred and seventy-nine adults with diagnosed opioid
   dependence.
   Intervention Patients were randomized to methadone maintenance (n=91),
   which required monthly 1 hour/week of psychosocial therapy during the
   first 6 months or 180-day detoxification (n = 88), which required 3
   hours/week of psychosocial therapy and 14 education sessions during the
   first 6 months.
   Measurements Total health-care costs and self-reported injection drug
   use. A two-state Markov model was used to estimate quality-adjusted
   years of survival.
   Findings Methadone maintenance produced significantly greater reductions
   in illicit opioid use than 180-day detoxification during the last 6
   months of treatment. Total health-care costs were greater for
   maintenance than detoxification treatment ($7564 versus $668 7; P <
   0.001). Although study costs were significantly higher for methadone
   maintenance than detoxification patients ($4739 versus $2855, P <
   0.001), detoxification patients incurred significantly higher costs for
   substance abuse and mental health care received outside the study.
   Methadone maintenance may provide a modest survival advantage compared
   with detoxification. The cost per life-year gained is $16967.
   Sensitivity analysis revealed a cost-effectiveness ratio of less than
   $20000 per quality-adjusted life-year over a wide range of modeling
   assumptions.
   Conclusions Compared with enriched detoxification services, methadone
   maintenance is more effective than enriched detoxification services with
   a cost-effectiveness ratio within the range of many accepted medical
   interventions and may provide a survival advantage. Results provide
   additional support for the use of sustained methadone therapy as opposed
   to detoxification for treating opioid addiction.

AB This study compared stage of change measures among adolescent smokers.
   Participants were 56 adolescents who had received smoking tickets. They
   filled out an assessment packet including readiness to change measures
   [i.e., algorithm, Crittenden's measure, University of Rhode Island
   Change Assessment (URICA), and Ladder], smoking history, a 30-day
   calendar, Fagerstrom, self-efficacy measures, locus of control, and a
   problem screen. The Crittenden algorithm was correlated with the Ladder
   and URICA motivation scores as well as with decreased frequency/amount
   of smoking and past quit attempts. Ladder scores were correlated with
   less cigarettes smoked, self-efficacy, and fewer adolescent problems.
   Readiness to change was unrelated to nicotine dependence and locus of
   control. The classification of participants into stages by the
   Crittenden algorithm was associated with a significant MANOVA (Wilks'
   Lambda F = 1.56, P < .025), with group differences on reported quit
   attempts, abstinence self-efficacy, and adolescent problems. The
   Crittenden measure and the URICA motivation score were sensitive to a
   MET intervention. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   among college students. Personal strivings are ongoing goals that
   individuals are characteristically trying to achieve through their
   behavior. Participants generated lists of personal strivings following
   standard instructions and then completed an assessment of alcohol use
   and related problems. Participants returned to complete a follow-up
   assessment of drinking behavior after 30 days. Personal strivings were
   coded into content categories by trained raters using a coding manual.
   Four content categories were examined for this study: achievement,
   affiliation, health, and self-presentation. A series of t tests revealed
   that participants endorsing achievement strivings reported less
   alcohol-related problems and marginally fewer instances of binge
   drinking during the 30-day follow-up period. In contrast, participants
   endorsing self-presentation strivings reported more alcohol-related
   problems during the follow-up period. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This article summarizes the proceedings of a symposium presented at the
   2003 RSA Meeting in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, organized and chaired by
   Nancy Barnett. The purpose of the symposium was to present information
   and efficacy data about approaches to brief intervention with students
   who get into trouble on their campuses for alcohol and as a result are
   required to attend alcohol education or counseling. Presentations were
   (1) Differences Between Mandated College Students and Their Peers on
   Alcohol Use and Readiness to Change, by Tracy O'Leary Tevyaw; (2) An
   Effective Alcohol Prevention Program for Mandated College Students, by
   Kim Fromme; (3) Two Brief Alcohol Interventions for a Referred College
   Population, by Kate Carey; and (4) Brief Motivational Intervention With
   College Students Following Medical Treatment or Discipline for Alcohol,
   by Nancy Barnett. The data presented in this symposium indicated that
   students who are evaluated or disciplined for alcohol use are on average
   heavy drinkers who drink more heavily than their closest peers. Brief
   intervention approaches described by the speakers included group
   classroom sessions, individual motivational intervention, individual
   alcohol education, and computerized alcohol education. Reductions in
   consumption and problems were noted across the various intervention
   groups. Brief motivational intervention as a general approach with
   mandated students shows promise in that it reduced alcohol problems in a
   group of mandated students who were screened for being at risk (in the
   Borsari and Carey study) and increased the likelihood that students
   would attend further counseling (in the Barnett study).

AB The authors have studied whether area-level socioeconomic status
   predicts mortality independently of individual-level socioeconomic
   status in 179,383 persons in the American Cancer Society Nutrition
   Cohort, followed for mortality from 1992 to 2000 (17,383 deaths). They
   used an area-level variable based on census blocks that was an average
   of home value, income, education, and occupation. Education was the
   individual-level socioeconomic status variable. The authors studied
   socioeconomic status-mortality trends with each socioeconomic status
   variable adjusted for the other. For all causes, an individual's
   education was strongly and inversely associated with mortality; a weak
   but significant inverse trend was also present for area-level
   socioeconomic status. A similar pattern was seen for all-vascular
   disease. For all cancers, there was again a significant inverse trend
   with education but no trend with area-level socioeconomic status.
   Adjustment for conventional (non-socioeconomic status) individual-level
   risk factors diminished the effect of both socioeconomic status
   variables, although significant trends remained for men between
   education and all-cause, all-cancer, and all-vascular disease mortality.
   Study data indicate that the predictive value of area-level
   socioeconomic status variables varies by cause of death but is less
   important than individual-level socioeconomic status variables.
   Multivariate models that consider socioeconomic status as a potential
   confounder may not need to consider area-level socioeconomic status if
   data are available on individual-level education.

AB Objective: This article explores the potential of community intervention
   perspectives for increasing the relevance, reach, and public health
   impact of mental health services research.
   Method: The authors reviewed community intervention strategies,
   including public health and community development and empowerment
   interventions, and contrast community intervention with practice-based
   quality improvement and policy research.
   Results: A model was proposed to integrate health services and community
   intervention research, building on the evidence-based strength of
   quality improvement and participatory methods of community intervention
   to produce complementary functions, such as linking community-based case
   finding and referral with practice-based quality improvement, enhanced
   by community-based social support for treatment adherence.
   Conclusions: The community intervention approach is a major paradigm for
   affecting public health or addressing health disparities. Despite
   challenges in implementation and evaluation, it represents a promising
   approach for extending the reach of mental health services interventions
   into diverse communities.

AB Objective: The authors attempted to estimate the occurrence, frequency,
   and pattern (winter versus summer) of seasonal affective disorder in
   African American college students. They hypothesized that winter
   seasonal affective disorder would be more prevalent than summer seasonal
   affective disorder.
   Method: Undergraduate and graduate college students who identified
   themselves as African Americans living in the Washington, D.C.,
   metropolitan area were invited to participate in the study. The Seasonal
   Pattern Assessment Questionnaire was used to calculate a global
   seasonality score and to estimate the frequency of seasonal affective
   disorder and subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder. The frequency of
   the summer versus winter pattern of seasonality of seasonal affective
   disorder was compared by using multinomial probability distribution
   tests. The effects of gender and the awareness of seasonal affective
   disorder were evaluated with a two-way analysis of variance.
   Results: Of 646 students who were invited to participate, 597 returned
   the questionnaires, and 537 (83.1%) fully completed them. Winter
   seasonal affective disorder was significantly more prevalent than summer
   seasonal affective disorder. The mean global seasonality score was 8.3
   (SD=5.3). The majority of the subjects (80%) were not aware of the
   existence of seasonal affective disorder.
   Conclusions: The authors found that the frequency, magnitude, and
   pattern of seasonality of mood in African American students were similar
   to those previously reported in the general population at similar
   latitude, but that awareness of the existence of seasonal affective
   disorder, a condition with safe and effective treatment options, was
   lower.

AB Objectives. We examined the published literature on health programs in
   faith-based organizations to determine the effectiveness of these
   programs.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic literature review of articles
   describing faith-based health activities. Articles (n = 386) were
   screened for eligibility (n = 105), whether a faith-based health program
   was described (n = 53), and whether program effects were reported (28).
   Results. Most programs focused on primary prevention (50.9%), general
   health maintenance (25.5%), cardiovascular health (20.7%), or cancer
   (18.9%). Significant effects reported included reductions in cholesterol
   and blood pressure levels, weight, and disease symptoms and increases in
   the use of mammography and breast self-examination.
   Conclusions. Faith-based programs can improve health outcomes. Means are
   needed for increasing the frequency with which such programs are
   evaluated and the results of these evaluations are disseminated.

   Methods. We estimated least squares and probit models using aggregate

   of the Current Population Survey merged with data from the US Bureau of
   the Census regarding state- and county-level racial minority

   Results. Except in the case of older Whites, racial minority
   concentration was not associated with health status after control for
   individual characteristics and fixed regional factors.
   Conclusions. Racial minority concentration may not be a determinant of
   individual health; differential migration patterns may explain the
   anomalous result for older Whites.

SO AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW

IS 3
BP 387
EP 404
PD JUN 2004
PY 2004
AB This article presents a social-organizational approach to explaining
   empirical variation in rates of altruism. The efforts of organizations
   are mostly responsible for much of the altruism seen today, and the
   substance of these efforts varies. Although research from social
   psychology and organizational studies suggests that altruistic action is
   sensitive to social context, the link between individual and
   organizational aspects of altruism has not been clearly articulated. In
   particular our knowledge of "one-shot," organizationally managed
   altruism is limited. I suggest that the factors of organizational
   resources, scope, and persistence are likely to generate higher rates of
   individual altruism in the absence of long-term relationships that
   encourage giving behavior The approach is applied to the case of
   cadaveric organ procurement in the United States. The analysis
   highlights the central role of organ procurement organizations (OPOs).
   Quantitative analysis of OPO procurement rates shows that, while
   demographic characteristics are important, OPO resources and scope are
   important predictors of procurement. The findings strongly suggest that
   the ability of organizations to produce contexts for giving explains a
   substantial amount of variation in rates of one-shot altruism.

AB Background: Violent behavior among adolescents is a significant problem
   worldwide, and a cross-national comparison of adolescent violent
   behaviors can provide information about the development and pattern of
   physical violence in young adolescents.
   Objectives: To determine and compare frequencies of adolescent
   violence-related behaviors in 5 countries and to examine associations
   between violence-related behaviors and potential explanatory
   characteristics.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional, school-based
   nationally representative survey at ages 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 years in 5
   countries (Ireland, Israel, Portugal, Sweden, and the United States).
   Main Outcome Measures: Frequency of physical fighting, bullying, weapon
   carrying, and fighting injuries in relation to other risk behaviors and
   characteristics in home and school settings.
   Results: Fighting frequency among US youth was similar to that of all 5
   countries (nonfighters: US, 60.2%; mean frequency of 5 countries,
   60.2%), as were the frequencies of weapon carrying (noncarriers: US,
   89.6%; mean frequency of 5 countries, 89.6%) and fighting injury
   (noninjured: US, 84.5%; mean frequency of 5 countries, 84.6%). Bullying
   frequency varied widely cross-nationally (nonbullies: from 57.0% for
   Israel to 85.2% for Sweden). Fighting was most highly associated with
   smoking, drinking, feeling irritable or bad tempered, and having been
   bullied.
   Conclusions: Adolescents in 5 countries behaved similarly in their
   expression of violence-related behaviors. Occasional fighting and
   bullying were common, whereas frequent fighting, frequent bullying, any
   weapon carrying, or any fighting injury were infrequent behaviors. These
   findings were consistent across countries, with little cross-national
   variation except for bullying rates. Traditional risk-taking behaviors
   (smoking and drinking) and being bullied were highly associated with the
   expression of violence-related behavior.

AB Background: Multiple studies have demonstrated that girls are engaging
   in interpersonal violence. However, little is known about the
   potentially unique aspects of violent events involving girls.
   Objectives: To describe characteristics of interpersonal Violence events
   in preadolescents and young adolescents and to determine if events
   involving any girl are different than those involving only boys.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey of 8- to 14-year-old patients who were
   being evaluated at an urban children's hospital emergency department for
   injuries caused by interpersonal violence was conducted between
   September 2000 and August 2001. The survey asked the patient to describe
   details about event circumstances, opponents, weapon use, and injury
   severity.
   Results: We enrolled 190 patients into the study; 58 (31%) were girls.
   Seventy-four events (39%) had a girl involved, 156 (82%) occurred on a
   weekday, 127 (67%) were classified as fights, 140 (74%) were with a
   known opponent, and 93 (49%) occurred at school. Events involving girls
   were more likely than events involving all boys to occur at home
   (relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-2.5). Both
   boys and girls reported "being disrespected" and "teasing" as popular
   reasons for a fight. Events involving girls were more commonly related
   to a "recurrence of a previous fight" (RR, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.9-21.5), were
   more likely to end because of adult intervention (RR, 1.7; 95% CI,
   1.1-2.6), and have a family member try to physically break up the fight
   (RR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-9.1).
   Conclusion: Violent events involving preadolescent and early adolescent
   girls are more likely to be in response to a previous event and to
   involve the home environment and family member intervention. Health care
   professionals should screen violently injured girls for safety concerns
   and retaliation plans and consider engaging the family in efforts to
   prevent future events.

AB Urban and suburban residents have more contact with the landscape
   environment than with any other exterior environment. They place high
   value on the aesthetic quality of the urban landscape and express
   significant concerns about managing insect herbivores that damage trees
   and shrubs. A comprehensive survey was initiated to assess the
   preference of urban residents for three pest management approaches
   (chemical pesticide, biorational insecticide, or introduction of a
   specific natural enemy) to control an introduced urban forest pest.
   Potential survey participants were initially contacted by telephone.
   Those agreeing to be interviewed were provided with written background
   information on the pest, the control options, and given one of 48
   different cost and program attribute scenarios for implementation of the
   three approaches. They were contacted a second time by telephone for a
   final survey that asked them whether they were willing to pay the annual
   cost for the program attributes stated in their survey. Release of
   natural enemies was the overwhelming first choice among control options
   and application of chemical insecticides was least favored. When the
   price of all options was low, the respondents preferred the biological
   control option. As prices for all options rose, the chemical and
   bacterial options increased in preference, but when prices became high,
   preferences shifted again to the natural enemy option. The social
   characteristics of respondents favoring the different options were also
   examined in a contingent valuation analysis. From the survey, it was
   possible to calculate a respondent's annual willingness to pay $485 for
   the natural enemy option, $131 for the bacterial spray option, and $23
   for the chemical pesticide option. The results suggest that it may be
   possible to generate social and financial support from urban residents
   for introduction/classical biological control programs for landscape
   insect pests. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lifestyle changes in persons diagnosed with cancer are important because
   they may impact prognosis, comorbidities, and survival. This report
   describes longitudinal changes in lifestyle behaviors and health status
   among colon cancer survivors (n = 278) and population-based controls (n
   = 459) in North Carolina (39% African American), and examines
   demographic and psychosocial correlates of healthy lifestyle changes
   following a colon cancer diagnosis. Data are from surveys of a
   population-based cohort of colon cancer patients on diagnosis (the North
   Carolina Colon Cancer Study, NCCCS) and approximately 2 years
   post-diagnosis [the North Carolina Strategies to Improve Diet, Exercise,
   and Screening Study (NC STRIDES)], and population-based controls. Both
   studies collected information on demographic/lifestyle characteristics
   and medical history. The NCCCS reflects pre-diagnosis or pre-interview
   patterns, whereas NC STRIDES queried on current practices. Between the
   NCCCS and NC STRIDES, colon cancer survivors reported significant
   increases in vegetable intake, physical activity, and supplement use
   (all P <0.01) and a non-statistically significant increase in
   fruit/juice consumption (0.1 serving), with larger fruit/vegetable
   changes in African Americans than Whites. Controls increased physical
   activity and supplement use and fewer reported arthritic symptoms (P <
   0.05). Survivors who were older and female had an almost 3 times higher
   likelihood of having used at least one new dietary supplement
   post-diagnosis, whereas being retired correlated with increased
   vegetable intake, all P < 0.05. Having more barriers to increasing
   fruit/vegetable intake was inversely associated with taking a new
   supplement (P < 0.05 only in controls). Colon cancer survivors reported
   making significant improvements in multiple health-related behaviors.
   Health care providers should communicate with persons diagnosed with
   colon cancer to ensure that they are making healthy lifestyle changes.

AB This investigation most importantly sought to illustrate the use of
   social science to promote: cross-cultural dialogue. Fukuyama (1992)
   explained contemporary cultural trends in terms of a triumphant
   individualism that would overcome all other forms of social life,
   including what he described as the "fundamentalist resentment" of Iran.
   Lasch (1979) more pessimistically diagnosed Western social arrangements
   in terms of an emerging "culture of narcissism." In this study, Iranian
   and American university students responded to measures of narcissism,
   individualist and collectivist values, religious interest, and
   psychological adjustment (identity, self-actualization, and
   self-consciousness). Variables related to a sense of community
   (collectivist values, religious interest, and identity) correlated
   negatively with narcissism in both societies, as did self-actualization.
   These data supported a moderate position between the polarized extremes
   of Fukuyama and Lasch and more importantly demonstrated how social
   scientific methods might be useful in creating a "space" for conducting
   a "dialogue between civilizations.".

   demonstrate that residents in the minority communities bear a greater
   socioeconomic, risk factor, and disease burden than do members of the
   general US population. However, substantial variations in the prevalence
   of risk factors and chronic conditions also indicated that public health
   priorities should vary among different racial/ethnic groups, and even
   among communities within each group, and that culturally sensitive
   primary and secondary prevention strategies should be tailored to meet
   community-specific needs.

AB During the last 25 years, numerous studies have been conducted to
   promote breast cancer and cervical cancer screening. Most of these
   studies focused on individual-level factors predicting screening, but we
   are unaware of any that directly examined community and ecological
   influences. The goal of this project, Promoting Access to Health for
   Pacific Islander and Southeast Asian Women (PATH for Women), was to
   increase community capacity for breast and cervical cancer screening and
   follow up in Los Angeles and Orange counties. We focused on Southeast
   Asian and Pacific Islander women because, although they have the lowest
   rates for cancer, compared to all other ethnic groups, relatively few
   programs have specifically targeted Asian-American and Pacific Islander
   (AAPI) women to promote and sustain screening practices. The PATH for
   Women project involved a partnership between 5 community-based
   organizations and 2 universities, and included 7 Asian-American and
   Pacific Islander communities: Cambodians, Chamorros, Laotians, Thais,
   Tongans, Samoans, and Vietnamese. In this paper, we share our
   experiences in developing a Geographic Information System (CIS)-mapping
   evaluation component that was used to explore availability and
   accessibility to culturally responsive breast and cervical cancer
   screening services for Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander women in all
   7 communities. We describe the methods used to develop the maps, and
   present the preliminary findings that demonstrate significant geographic
   and language barriers to accessing healthcare providers, services for
   breast and cervical cancer screening, and follow up, in each of the
   communities. Finally, we discuss implications for programs designed to
   promote breast and cervical screening and policy education.

   southwest Detroit families in focus groups organized by community, age,
   gender, and language, to plan community-based participatory
   interventions to reduce the prevalence and impact of diabetes and its
   risk factors. Community residents participated in planning,
   implementing, and analyzing data from the focus groups and subsequent
   planning meetings. Major themes included: 1) diabetes is widespread and
   risk begins in childhood, with severe consequences for African Americans
   and Latinos; 2) denial and inadequate health care contribute to lack of
   public awareness about pre-symptomatic diabetes; 3) diabetes risks
   include heredity, high sugar, fat and alcohol intake, overweight, lack
   of exercise, and stress; and 4) cultural traditions, lack of motivation,
   and lack of affordable, accessible stores, restaurants, and recreation
   facilities and programs, are barriers to adopting preventive lifestyles.
   Participants identified community assets and made recommendations that
   resulted in REACH Detroit's multi-level intervention design and
   programs. They included development of: 1) family-oriented interventions
   to support lifestyle change at all ages; 2) culturally relevant
   community and health provider education and materials; 3) social support
   group activities promoting diabetes self-management, exercise, and
   healthy eating; and 4) community resource development and advocacy.

AB in order to gain a better understanding of diabetes-related health
   disparities, Nashville REACH 2010 conducted a community baseline survey
   on health status. A total of 3204 randomly selected African-American
   (AA) and Caucasian (C) residents of North Nashville, and a comparison
   sample of residents living in Nashville/Davidson County were interviewed
   using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system. Diabetes
   prevalence was determined, and similarities/differences relative to
   access to health care, co-morbid conditions, diabetes care, and
   lifestyle behaviors, were examined. Age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes
   was 1.7 times higher among AAs. Increasing age (P<.0001) and being AA
   (P<.01) were predictive of diabetes status in a regression model.
   African Americans were more likely to be uninsured (P<.01), while Cs had
   to travel farther to get medical care (P<.0002). Compared to Caucasians,
   African Americans were 1.6 times more likely to have co-morbid
   hypertension (P<.004). Reported insulin use was higher (P<.0001) in AAs,
   and more Cs (25.5% vs 9.1%, respectively) reported taking no
   medications. African Americans were more likely to report (P<.0001)
   daily glucose self-monitoring, while more Cs (P<.04) reported having had
   an eye exam in the last 1 to 2 years. Caucasians reported more (P<.05)
   active lifestyle behaviors, while AA reported more (P<.001)
   fat-increasing behaviors.
   In conclusion, interventions addressing diabetes disparities in the
   target population should focus on insuring equitable awareness of, and
   access to, insurance options; managing co-morbidities; improving
   provider adherence to standards of care; and establishing multi-level
   supports for lifestyle modifications.

   sessions were transcribed and analyzed using a consensus panel
   methodology.
   A combined analysis of the focus groups revealed 3 categories of
   barriers to healthier living: 1) personal, 2) environmental, and 3)
   systemic. Personal barriers included lack of adequate finances, physical
   limitations, lack of knowledge, and stress. Environmental barriers were
   related to the unavailability of healthy food choices and adequate
   places to exercise in the community. The accessibility and quality of
   health care were the most pervasive systemic barriers identified. Though
   these findings are not novel to urban African-American communities, they
   will serve as the framework by which Nashville REACH 2010 will implement
   strategies to reduce and, ultimately, eliminate cardiovascular disease
   and diabetes disparities.

   Results support positive changes within and between levels of change.
   REACH participants reported an increase in knowledge of preventative
   health behaviors, the development of health-related skills, and the
   diffusion of knowledge to family. Fellowship was identified as the
   primary motivator to continue positive health behaviors. Community Lay
   Health Advisors (LHAs) reported changes in individual health perceptions
   from disease-to prevention-oriented, and positive community changes,
   including the establishment of walking groups, and a farmers' market.
   The REACH program staff reported that collaboration between staff and

   MIHAS clients were more likely to report at least some smoking during
   pregnancy (20% vs 15%, respectively, P<.05). However, after controlling
   for age and education, these results were no longer statistically
   significant. In terms of birth outcomes, the comparative odds of MIHAS
   clients delivering a low birth-weight infant are 1.124 (95% CI:
   0.620-2.038); the odds of their delivering an infant at 37 weeks or
   earlier are 1.032 (0.609-1.749). Although the MIHAS clients did not have
   statistically better birth outcomes than those of the general
   African-American population in Flint, the MIHAS clients did not
   demonstrate the outcomes one would expect, given their higher level of
   risk. Based on this analysis, the MIHAS intervention may have brought
   its clients "up to par" with the general community on several birth
   outcomes.

AB This study examined diabetes-related health disparities in a Latino
   population in terms of prevalence of the disease, and the extent to
   which practice-based interventions improve health care and health for
   the Latinos who have diabetes. Previous research has shown that Latinos,
   overall, are at greater risk for diabetes, but less is known for those
   of Puerto Rican and Dominican origin.
   Two interventions were implemented in a large primary care practice: an
   ADA-recognized Diabetes Self Management Education program, and clinical
   information feedback loops to providers regarding adherence to the
   Massachusetts Guidelines for the Care of Diabetes.
   The study identified the prevalence of diabetes to be 13.7% among Puerto
   Ricans, and 9.1% among Dominicans, rates 2-to-3 times that for the
   general population. Latino patients (N=567) who participated in a
   Diabetes Self Management Education Program maintained lower Hb A(1c)
   values than did a comparison group (N=432). For a random sample of
   Latinos with diabetes (N=98) in this study, 6 measures of health care
   improved significantly from 2001 to 2003. Areas of improvement among
   healthcare providers were: ordering a microalbumin level measurement
   when appropriate, prescribing ACE inhibitors as needed, providing
   pneumococcal and influenza vaccines, reviewing activity status and
   exercise, identifying smoking status, and prescribing lipid-lowering
   agents, as appropriate. Body mass index (BMI) for the 98 patients
   remained the same for both measurement periods at 32.8.
   Although this initial study spanned only 2 years, improvements in health
   care and health indices for the population are encouraging. Further
   study is underway to expand on these gains.

AB Vietnamese-American women who regularly see Vietnamese-American
   physicians are less likely to obtain Pap tests, perhaps because of the
   physicians' limited training in preventive medicine and the women's
   discomfort receiving Pap tests from male physicians.
   To address this problem, during 20012003, the University of California,
   San Francisco's (USCF) Vietnamese Community Health Promotion Project
   collaborated with the Vietnamese Physician Association of Northern
   California to organize 3 continuing medical education (CME) seminars on
   cervical cancer for association members. Experts gave lectures and
   answered questions about screening, diagnosis, and treatment to train
   physicians to identify risk factors, recommend Pap tests, and evaluate
   and conduct follow up of abnormal tests.
   To evaluate the seminars, we administered pre- and post-CME
   pencil-and-paper questionnaires. Data analysis employing the McNemar
   chi-squared test demonstrated significant changes in knowledge and
   understanding from pre- to post-CME in multiple areas. Results suggest
   that CME seminars can significantly increase Vietnamese physicians'
   knowledge about cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment.

AB The purpose of this paper is to report results of the People with
   Diabetes survey conducted as part of the REACH 2010: Charleston and
   Georgetown Diabetes Coalition. The pilot data revealed that African
   Americans (AAs) (N=80) reported fewer A,c, lipid, and kidney testing,
   feet and eye exams, and less nutrition and diabetes self-management
   counseling during 1999-2000 than did Caucasians (Cs) (N=23). The survey
   was repeated in 2002 when data were collected from a convenience sample
   of 160 AAs and 150 Cs using the revised self-reported survey instrument.
   African Americans (AAs) were significantly likely to report that their
   understanding of results for the kidney function test were good as
   compared to Cs (P<.001) and were more likely to report receiving
   nutrition education (P=.003). Otherwise, there were no significant
   differences between AAs and Cs on the remaining items in the survey.
   Since REACH 2010 was actively involved in the AA community for 2 years
   between the pilot survey and the repeated survey, these results were
   anticipated and are also reflected in results of chart audits conducted
   within healthcare systems used by the same AA population.

AB This paper reports on the impact of the community-based Start Right
   program on childhood immunization coverage in 2 communities of color in
   New York City. Fully launched in 2002, Start Right operates through the
   major social service programs of its 23 member organizations.
   Immunization promotion strategies are based on the following guiding
   principles: community leadership; integration with community programs;
   parental empowerment; peer health educators; tracking and feedback; and
   linkage with health providers. By September 2003, 2,433 children under
   age 5 years (14% of that age group in the community) were enrolled in
   Start Right. The rates for the cohort of children enrolled in 2003 were
   substantially higher than for those enrolled in 2002. Among the 2003
   cohort of 19- to 35-month-old children, the coverage rate was 88%,
   significantly more than national rates: 75% for total population, 68%
   for African Americans, and 73% for Hispanics. The rate for our 2003
   enrollment cohort exceeded the rate for New York City (78%) but did not
   exceed the New York City average for Hispanics (79%). Of the 2003
   enrollment cohort, the Washington Heights children had the highest rates
   for enrollment (89.6%), exceeding New York City rates. Parents reported
   a high level of satisfaction with the program.

AB Comparisons of birth-weight-specific infant mortality indicate that
   low-birth-weight African American infants have lower mortality than
   low-birth-weight European American infants despite higher infant
   mortality overall-the "pediatric paradox." One explanation is
   heterogeneity in birth weight. Analyses of African American and European
   American births suggest that birth cohorts consist of two heterogeneous
   subpopulations. One appears to account for normal births, whereas the
   other may consist of compromised births. Estimates of infant mortality
   indicate that the compromised subpopulation has higher overall mortality
   but lower birth-weight-specific mortality. We attribute lower
   birth-weight-specific infant mortality in the compromised subpopulation
   to higher rates of fetal loss. Compared to European American birth
   cohorts, African American birth cohorts have (1) higher
   birth-weight-specific mortality in the normal subpopulation, (2) larger
   compromised subpopulations, and (3) lower birth-weight-specific
   mortality in the compromised subpopulation. Consequently, the pediatric
   paradox is attributable to greater rates of compromised pregnancies and
   higher fetal losses among African Americans.

AB Stuttering is a complex developmental speech disorder of unknown
   etiology. There is a substantial aggregation of stuttering in families,
   suggesting a genetic component to the disorder. However, the exact mode
   of transmission is still unknown. An earlier study of 56
   multigenerational pedigrees ascertained through single adult probands
   (38 males and 18 females) found that biological relatives of persistent
   developmental stutterers have an approximately 10-fold higher risk than
   in the general population; risk is higher for male relatives, and
   proband's sex does not affect recurrence and relative risks. In the
   present paper we conduct a complex segregation analysis of the same
   data, using the logistic regression model of the SAGE software. Based on
   the comparisons of model likelihoods, the Mendelian model was selected
   over all other nongenetic models and the general transmission model.
   This model was further refined into the most parsimonious model, which
   shows an autosomal dominant major gene effect influenced by two
   covariates: sex and affection status of parents. With this model applied
   to 47 informative multiplex pedigrees, a power calculation based on
   linkage simulation produced an average lod score of 6.8 for 10-cM
   density genome scan markers. These results give impetus for a genomewide
   linkage analysis of susceptibility to persistent developmental
   stuttering.

AB Women are important stakeholders in natural resource policies since
   rural women in developing countries are responsible for most of the
   collection of food, fuel, and firewood for commercial and domestic use.
   When it comes to the management of these natural resources, gender
   inequality due to societal traditions could limit the ability of women
   to participate in policy-making, even when they are not formally
   excluded. This paper analyzes the effect of gender stratification on
   women's participation by undertaking an empirical study of a
   participatory environmental policy program in Indian villages. It
   endeavors to answer the question of how gender stratification affects
   participatory environmental policy-making. Using the case study of a
   community forestry program, it finds that women are still marginalized
   in decision-making, even in participatory environmental policies. Gender
   stratification continues to impinge upon forms of democratic
   decision-making in developing societies. Using facilitating policy tools
   that seek to empower such marginalized groups would be one way of making
   participation meaningful for all groups in society.

AB Substance use disorders affect not only the identified client but
   significant others as well. Clinical work and some research suggest that
   partner responses to drinking may either facilitate or hinder treatment
   acceptance and recovery efforts. Female partners of male alcoholics have
   received much of this attention, and have been labeled as codependents
   or enablers. We administered a clinically derived assessment tool, the
   Behavioral Enabling Scale, to 42 alcoholic clients and their partners
   enrolled in a couples counseling program to determine the extent of
   specific partner behaviors that might reasonably be thought to reinforce
   drinking or hinder recovery. Results indicated that, among other
   findings, the majority of both clients and partners reported the partner
   took over chores or duties from the alcoholic client at some point
   during the relationship, drank or used other drugs with the client, and
   lied or made excuses to others to cover for the drinker. Moreover,
   particular relationship beliefs were associated with higher behavioral
   enabling scores, providing clear direction for cognitive and behavioral
   interventions. It is argued that efforts to understand and treat alcohol
   dependence will be more productive if partner behaviors are incorporated
   into assessment and intervention procedures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Background. Solutions to the problem of limited access to dental care
   for some segments of the population are being sought. Certain factors in
   access-to-dental-care program design are critical to the success of
   these programs.
   Overview. The author discusses the triad of factors that are essential
   in the successful design and operation of programs aimed at improving
   access to dental care for underserved populations.
   Conclusions. The author found that attention must be paid to creating an
   effective demand for dental care, an adequate dental work force to
   respond to that demand and an economic environment that enables patients
   and dentists to participate in any programs that are aimed at improving
   access to care.
   Practice Implications. Failure to adequately address demand, work force
   and economic factors will condemn any program designed to increase
   access to dental care to failure at worst, or to limited success at
   best.

AB This study was designed to investigate the detection rate of domestic

   training program. Baseline information on detection rates was gathered
   from residents in the prestudy phase and was compared with data from the
   6-month investigation phase of the study, during which a
   self-administered pencil-and-paper questionnaire on domestic violence
   was provided to patients and residents. The nursing staff screened new
   female patients and established patients returning for annual physical
   examinations. Patients older than 18 years were asked to complete a
   four-question survey. The examining resident physicians then reviewed
   the questionnaire answers with patients. During the 6-month prestudy
   phase, only 7 of 136 patients (5.1%) were determined to be in current
   (2.9%) or past (2.2%) abusive relationships. Of the 52 patients who
   completed the investigation phase of the study, 25 (48.1%) reported a
   lifetime history of abuse, with 9.6% of patients reporting current abuse
   and 38.5% reporting past abuse. There was a statistical difference
   regarding history of abuse and lifetime incidence of abuse between the
   control and study groups. The authors found that routine screening with
   a few questions could significantly increase detection of domestic
   violence and enable victims to begin to address their problems. This
   study has implications for continuing medical education programs as well
   as residency training programs.

AB From both within and without bioethics, growing criticism of the
   predominant methods and practices of the field can be heard. These
   critiques tend to lament an emphasis on logically derived rules and
   philosophical theories that inadequately capture how and why people have
   the moral attitudes they do, and they urge the use of more empirically
   grounded social sciences-history, sociology, and anthropology-to draw
   attention to the complex factors behind such attitudes. However, these
   critiques do not go far enough, as they do not question why debate over
   ethical categories should have such a central role in voicing concerns
   about medicine. The importance of using other forms of inquiry,
   especially that of history, to examine aspects of medical practice and
   the emergence of bioethics itself is not simply to refine bioethical
   moral analysis. Instead, history can be employed to counter the
   preoccupation with translating concerns about medicine into moral terms
   and to move towards what is more sorely needed: a true medical humanism.

AB Musical boundaries mark distinctions between what is valued and what is
   shunned among cultural objects. One prominent line of research on
   musical boundaries investigates variations of inclusiveness and
   exclusiveness - identifying cultural omnivores and univores - but has
   not fully considered the role of ambivalence toward genres that are
   neither liked nor disliked categorically. Another line of research
   deepens our understanding of the rhetorics, discourses, and cultural
   schemas organizing boundary work, but it has yet to map the
   combinatorial logic through which specific taste evaluations are made.
   In this study, I bridge research on boundary forms and organizing
   principles through a comparative and relational approach, combining
   Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA)
   to analyze musical tastes in the U.S. Results confirm the general
   associations of highbrows and omnivores, lowbrows and univores, but they
   also show a diversity of musical boundary configurations: the largest
   group of omnivores do not exclude lowbrow musics; a significant subset
   of univores are highbrows; and those with indecisive or ambivalent
   boundaries favor popular music. I conclude by noting that the musical
   taste structure is shaped more like a parabola than a pyramid and by
   proposing future directions for integrating qualitative and quantitative
   cultural sociology. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. (1) To describe the accuracy of self-report and
   administrative claims for measuring mammography adherence among
   low-income women; (2) to determine whether the accuracy of self-report
   differed between telephone interview and mailed questionnaire; and (3)
   to explore whether the method of measuring adherence affected
   associations between mammography adherence and participant
   sociodemographic characteristics.
   Design. Retrospective cohort study of women receiving care from a
   Philadelphia Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO).
   Participants. Three hundred and ninety-nine low-income women eligible
   for screening mammography of whom 64% were African American, 14%
   Caucasian, 13% Hispanic, and 8% Asian American.
   Measures. Self-reported use of mammography screening, administrative
   mammography claims data, and dates of mammograms from radiology facility
   records. The "gold standard" categorized women as having undergone
   screening if they had either a billing claim or facility record for a
   mammogram in the past 12 months.
   Main results. Two hundred and eighty-three of the 399 women reported
   having had a mammogram in the past 12 months. The sensitivity of
   self-report was 0.93, specificity was 0.54, positive predictive value
   was 0.70, and negative predictive value was 0.86. One hundred and
   seventy-nine of the 399 women had a claim for a mammogram in the past 12
   months. The sensitivity of claims data was 0.83 with a negative
   predictive value of 0.84. The sensitivity of self-report was higher with
   telephone data collection (0.98) than with mailed data collection
   (0.82), while the specificity was higher with mail (0.64) than telephone
   (0.50). African American race was associated with adherence to screening
   recommendations when mammography use was measured by self-report (RR
   1.31, P = 0.002) but not when it was measured by claims or facility
   validation (RR 1.03, P = 0.56, and RR 1.12, P = 0.15, respectively).
   Conclusions. Accurate measurement of adherence to mammography screening
   among low-income women is difficult. Self-report substantially
   overestimates adherence (particularly when collected through telephone
   interviews), while also misclassifying some women who underwent
   screening as not having been screened (particularly when collected
   through mailed questionnaires). In contrast, administrative claims data
   substantially underestimates adherence. Inaccurate measurement of
   mammography adherence can lead to a biased understanding of the factors
   associated with adherence. (C) 2004 Published by The Institute For

AB Lysine is a limiting amino acid in diets based on wheat as the staple.
   In experimental animals, prolonged dietary lysine inadequacy increases
   stress-induced anxiety. If observed in humans, such a result would have
   a strong implication for the relationship between nutrition and communal
   quality of life and mental health. As part of a 3-month randomized
   double-blind study, we tested whether lysine fortification of wheat
   reduces anxiety and stress response in family members in poor Syrian
   communities consuming wheat as a staple food. In the lysine-fortified
   group, the plasma cortisol response to the blood drawing as a cause of
   stress was reduced in females, as was sympathetic arousal in males as
   measured by skin conductance, Lysine fortification also significantly
   reduced chronic anxiety as measured by the trait anxiety inventory in
   males. These results suggest that some stress responses in economically
   weak populations consuming cereal-based diets can be improved with
   lysine fortification.

AB There is an increasing number of severely mentally ill persons in the
   criminal justice system. This article first discusses the
   criminalization of persons with severe mental illness and its causes,
   the role of the police and mental health, and the treatment of mentally
   ill offenders and its difficulties. The authors then offer
   recommendations to reduce criminalization by increased coordination
   between police and mental health professionals, to increase mental
   health training for police officers, to enhance mental health services
   after arrest, and to develop more and better community treatment of
   mentally ill offenders. The necessary components of such treatment are
   having a treatment philosophy of both theory and practice; having clear
   goals of treatment; establishing a close liaison between treatment staff
   and the justice system; understanding the need for structure; having a
   focus on managing violence; and appreciating the crucial role of case
   management, appropriate living arrangements, and the role of family
   members.

AB It was reported recently that exposure to an adverse rearing environment
   lowers central nervous system (CNS) serotonergic activity in a nonhuman
   primate (rhesus monkeys), but only among animals having the shorter
   variant of a functional, biallelic repeat polymorphism in the regulatory
   region of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene. Because repeat
   variants of the same core sequence affect transcriptional efficiency of
   the 5-HTT gene in humans, we examined whether biallelic variation in the
   5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) acts analogously to
   modulate a previously described association between socioeconomic status
   (SES) and CNS serotonergic function. The 5-HTTLPR was genotyped in 139
   adult men and women (n = 75 and 64) who were administered a standard
   neuroendocrine challenge to assess central serotonergic responsivity
   (plasma prolactin (PRL) response to the serotonin releasing agent,
   fenfluramine). Socio-economic status was estimated from reported income
   and years of education. Hierarchical linear regression showed
   serotonergic responsivity to be predicted by the interaction of 5-HTTLPR
   genotype and SES (p = 0.018). Individuals of lower income and less
   education had lower peak PRL concentrations following administration of
   fenfluramine than did subjects ranking higher on these dimensions, but
   only among persons possessing at least one 5-HTTLPR short allele. Within
   genotype, SES covaried moderately with the PRL response to fenfluramine
   among subjects who were homozygous for the short allele (r(18) = 0.50, p
   < 0.03). A similar association was present at lesser magnitude in
   heterozygotes (r(70) = 0.24, p < 0.05) and absent among subjects
   homozygous for the long allele (r(45) = -0.04, n.s.). Findings were
   comparable for men and women and persisted on re-analysis restricted to
   persons without current Axis I psychopathology. We conclude that allelic
   variation at 5-HTTLPR moderates the influence of social position on CNS
   serotonergic responsivity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Darwin recognized that natural selection could not favor a trait in one
   species solely for the benefit of another species. The modern,
   selfish-gene view of the world suggests that cooperation between
   individuals, whether of the same species or different species, should be
   especially vulnerable to the evolution of noncooperators. Yet,
   cooperation is prevalent in nature both within and between species. What
   special circumstances or mechanisms thus favor cooperation? Currently,
   evolutionary biology offers a set of disparate explanations, and a
   general framework for this breadth of models has not emerged. Here, we
   offer a tripartite structure that links previously disconnected views of
   cooperation. We distinguish three general models by which cooperation
   can evolve and be maintained: (i) directed reciprocation-cooperation
   with individuals who give in return; (ii) shared genes-cooperation with
   relatives (e.g., kin selection); and (iii) byproduct
   benefits-cooperation as an incidental consequence of selfish action.
   Each general model is further subdivided. Several renowned examples of
   cooperation that have lacked explanation until recently-plant-rhizobium
   symbioses and bacteria-squid light organs-fit squarely within this
   framework. Natural systems of cooperation often involve more than one
   model, and a fruitful direction for future research is to understand how
   these models interact to maintain cooperation in the long term.

AB Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine the
   prevalence of risk behaviors, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in clients of
   female sex workers, and to compare them with men selected from the
   general population.
   Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional study of men recruited from
   commercial sex venues in Lima, Peru from January to February 2002.
   Subjects answered a survey and provided a urine sample.
   Results: Men reported that in the recently concluded commercial sex
   encounter, 95.8% used condoms, and 85.8% always used condoms with female
   sex workers. Only 16% reported always using condoms with their stable
   partners; 50.8% always used condoms with casual, noncommercial partners;
   and 59.6% always used condoms for homosexual anal sex. There were 8 (2
   %) cases of chlamydia and no cases of gonorrhea.
   Conclusions: Clients of female sex workers report high rates of condom
   use with sex workers and a low prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea. It
   is unlikely that they constitute a bridging population.

   model the association of condom use at sexual debut on condom use at
   most recent sex (mean interval, 23 months).
   Results: Condom use at adolescent sexual debut was associated with a
   twofold increased likelihood of condom use during most recent sex (odds

AB This article encourages sociologists to study gender as a social
   institution. Noting that scholars apply the institution concept to
   highly disparate phenomena, it reviews the history of the concept in
   twentieth-century sociology. The defining characteristic most commonly
   attributed to social institution is endurance (or persistence over time)
   while contemporary uses highlight practices, conflict, identity, power,
   and change. I identify twelve criteria for deciding whether any
   phenomenon is a social institution. I conclude that treating gender as
   an institution will improve gender scholarship and social theory
   generally, increase awareness of gender's profound sociality, offer a
   means of linking diverse theoretical and empirical work, and make
   gender's invisible dynamics and complex intersections with other
   institutions more apparent and subject to critical analysis and change.

   Effects of this reorganization, historical period, and research funding
   on scholarly journal publications are examined. Results are based on a
   content analysis of 1,612 articles published in leading journals between
   1951 and 1993. Multivariate analyses support neoinstitutional ideas, as
   topical and theoretical foci are associated with themes suggested by the
   policy sector. The replication of the policy sector in academic
   organization tightens this association. Further, articles based on
   political funding are more likely to engage new preoccupations of the

AB The growing interest in public sociologies marks an increasing gap
   between the ethos of sociologists and social, political, and economic
   tendencies in the wider society. Public sociology aims to enrich public
   debate about moral and political issues by infusing them with
   sociological theory and research. It has to be, distinguished from
   policy, professional, and critical sociologies. Together these four
   interdependent sociologies enter into relations of domination and
   subordination, forming a disciplinary division of labor that varies
   among academic institutions as well as over time, both within and
   between nations. Applying the same disciplinary matrix to the other
   social sciences suggests that sociology's specific contribution lies in
   its relation to civil society, and, thus, in its defense of human
   interests against the encroachment of states and markets.

   State Owned Enterprises operated within institutional constraints to
   make strategic decisions, and state intervention shaped which factors
   were salient. Firms financed through central government and bond issues
   relied less on markets. Firms funded through local government moved into
   markets faster; firms funded by banks were initially faster to markets
   but slower to markets after bank reform shifted lending policies. Thus,
   the accessibility, flexibility, and stability of financing shaped
   decisions about market entrance.

AB Four decades have passed since the publication of Gerhard Lenski's The
   Religious Factor. While generally regarded as a classic in the sociology
   of religion, the book has had a curious history, largely because of the
   interest it generated in differences between Protestants and Catholics.
   In this paper I provide an alternative reading of The Religious Factor's
   impact on sociology of religion that points to its larger theoretical
   implications. I argue that the book should be understood in relation to
   continuing debates about the classification of religious traditions,
   differentiation among socioreligious groups, intergroup relations among
   religious traditions, and friendship ties within religious communities.
   Through understanding these contributions, the book's legacy as well as
   continuities and new opportunities in the study of religion can be
   appreciated.

   explanation in sociology was social-psychological. Moreover, by the
   1980s, the bias against biology in feminist theory came to include all
   of science. Exceptions to these trends include the work of Blumberg,
   Chafetz, Collins, Coltrane, and Turner. Whether feminist sociologists

   but, as universally accepted in sociology at the time, "social"
   stratification was conceptualized implicitly as inequality between male
   household heads. To move from this to explaining gender inequality
   requires consideration of constructs in addition to those developed by
   Lenski, but in terms of his typology of societies based on technology
   and size of economic surplus, the level of gender stratification tracks
   that of "social" stratification and the basic variables he delineates
   remain centrally important.

   engagement with alternativity and by introducing a different approach to
   structure, I reconsider the salience of the event in the
   developmentalist project and suggest that ecological-evolutionary theory
   can be quite helpful in posing new questions about an eventful
   sociology. By rethinking communism's collapse in 1989 and terrorism's
   explosion in 2001 within Lenski's theoretical frame, one can suggest
   critical transformations of theory and research on the evolution of

   levels of church participation. This paper examines two cases where
   rates of individual religious activity increased following the
   differentiation of political and ecclesiastical structures as the
   competition theory predicts. However, the facts surrounding these

   Rather, I show that a heretofore neglected variant of secularization

AB BACKGROUND: The demographic composition of the US population is rapidly
   changing. As a result, pharmacists increasingly face the need to
   interact effectively with and provide care for patients whose ethnic or
   cultural background may differ from their own. While schools implement
   curricula to provide pharmacy students with cultural awareness,
   knowledge, and communication skills they will need in practice, few
   assessment tools exist to evaluate the impact or effectiveness of such
   training.
   OBJECTIVE: To implement and assess the impact of a cultural competency
   training course designed specifically for pharmacy students.
   METHODS: An 8-hour elective course offering basic cultural competency
   training was provided to 60 first-through fourth-year pharmacy students
   in 2003. A 12-item survey assessing students' perceived awareness,
   knowledge, and communication skills in the areas of cultural competence
   and cross-cultural communication skills was administered immediately
   prior to and upon completion of the course. Surveys were linked,
   enabling estimation of within-student change as a result of exposure to
   the program.
   RESULTS: Fifty-six paired surveys (96.6% of participants) were
   analyzable. Responses to all survey items (p < 0.05) and total scores
   (t(55) = 16.27; p < 0.001) increased significantly from pre- to
   posttraining. The mean +/- SD 12-item pretraining scale score was 33.35
   +/- 5.48 (range 21-44), and the mean posttraining scale score was 47.88
   +/- 4.90 (range 36-59).
   CONCLUSIONS: Survey results suggest that the course successfully raised
   student awareness of diversity and provided basic knowledge and skills
   pertaining to cultural competence and cross-cultural communication.

AB Little is know about the relationship of abuse history and other risk
   factors with being overweight and obese among gastrointestinal patients.
   The purpose of this study was to assess the relative risk of abuse
   history on being overweight and obese among 239 female gastrointestinal
   patients. Forty-one percent of the patients were found to be overweight
   or obese, 49% reported a history of physical abuse, and 42% had a sexual
   abuse history. A history of physical abuse (odds ratio = 1.34, P <
   0.03), being nonwhite (odds ratio = 2.66, P < 0: 01), being older (odds
   ratio = 1.03 for each year older, P < 0.02), and having fewer years of
   schooling (odds ratio = 1.11, P < 0.05) were found to be strongly
   associated with being overweight and/or obese. Among the female patients
   referred for gastrointestinal disorders at a university-based
   gastrointestinal clinic, a high proportion was overweight or obese.
   Physical abuse history and several demographic factors were
   significantly related to being overweight and obese in this clinical
   population.

AB Countries of the former Soviet Union are experiencing the steepest
   increases in annual HIV incidence in the world. Over 80%, of registered
   HIV cases in Russia have occurred among intravenous drug users (IDUs),
   but current conditions set the stage for a heterosexually-transmitted
   epidemic. IDUs who also trade sex for money or drugs may serve as a
   conduit, or 'bridge' group, through which HIV could make inroads into
   the general Russian population. The present study examined the
   prevalence of sex trading among female Russian IDUs, and further
   examined drug use, sexual behaviour, and perceived vulnerability in this
   group. Female IDUs (n = 100) in St Petersburg, Russia participated; 37%
   reported a history of sex trading. This group reported a mean of 49.5
   male sexual partners in the previous month and in average of 15.4
   unprotected vaginal intercourse acts in the previous 30 days. A
   significant minority (44%) also reported sharing injection equipment
   with others. Mathematical models to calculate risk estimates for HIV
   seroconversion indicated that participants were at significant risk of
   contracting HIV and infecting sexual partners. Despite significant rates
   of risk behaviours, most participants perceived themselves to be at
   little risk of contracting HIV. Effective HIV prevention programmes
   targeted at this group are urgently needed and are likely to be a
   cost-effective step in curtailing the spread of HIV in the region.

AB HIV-associated immunosuppression has been linked to an increased risk of
   a number of cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma (KS), non-Hodgkin's
   lymphoma (NHL), and invasive cervical cancer. Because prison inmates
   constitute one of the highest HIV/AIDS prevalent populations in the US,
   understanding the link between HIV infection and cancer in the
   correctional setting holds particular public health relevance. The study
   population consisted of 336,668 Texas Department of Criminal Justice
   inmates who were incarcerated, for any duration, between 1 January 1999
   and 31 December 2001. Inmates diagnosed with HIV infection exhibited
   elevated rates of KS, NHL, anal cancer, and Hodgkin's disease, after
   adjusting for age and race. The elevated rates of cancer among
   HIV-infected individuals, particularly prison inmates, may be mediated,
   in part, by high-risk behaviours. HIV-associated risk behaviours,
   including unsafe sexual practices, injection drug use, and prostitution
   may be associated with cancer-related risk behaviours, such as smoking,
   excessive alcohol consumption, and poor diet. It will be important for
   future investigators to examine the association between HIV infection
   and cancer risk with sufficiently large study cohorts and appropriate
   longitudinal designs.

AB The purpose of the research reported here is to examine the connection
   between contraception and those aspects of a woman's position that are
   related to her marriage. The research was conducted in two villages
   among the Pare of northern Tanzania where a shift from hoe cultivation
   as primary occupation to wage labour has brought about major changes in
   social relations. The major hypothesis is that a change from a
   'traditional' marital union to a 'companionate' marriage is instrumental
   in the acceptance of contraception and in lowering fertility. The latter
   type of relationship between marital partners is related to the status
   of women. The research methodology consisted of a combination of an
   ethnographic study, demographic surveys and in-depth interviews.
   Findings show that approximately half of the women in this community
   ever used contraception. Of current users, a third are sterilized and
   half are using a modern reversible method. The determining factor for
   using modern reversible methods is the nature of the conjugal union.

AB The Old Order Amish are a healthy and well-nourished natural fertility
   population, so that the timing of births is not influenced by behaviours
   to limit family size, undernutrition or disease. The present study
   examines the monthly distribution of 8160 births occurring between 1920
   and 1991 in the Geauga Settlement in north-east Ohio, USA. The monthly
   distribution of births in the Geauga Settlement is bimodal, with a major
   peak extending from August to October, a minor peak in February, and a
   major trough from April to June. This pattern is almost identical to the
   pattern found in the US in 1943. The monthly distribution of first
   births appears to be influenced to some extent by a highly significant
   seasonal pattern of weddings. The pattern of births in the Old Order
   Amish is consistent with the hypothesis that the spring trough in US
   births is at least partially caused by a decrease in coital frequency
   and/or a decrease in fecundability as a result of hot summer
   temperatures but is not consistent with the hypothesis that the fall
   peak in US births is primarily due to an increase in coital frequency
   during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons.

AB Liquor store employees experience disproportionately higher rates of
   workplace injury death than employees in any other retail setting.
   However, efforts to introduce workplace violence prevention programs
   into liquor stores have been minimal. This study examines the
   effectiveness of a Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
   intervention in reducing criminal activity in Santa Monica, California
   liquor stores. Nine stores enrolling in the study received an
   individualized intervention safety plan; the remaining 13 served as a
   comparison group. Mixed-effects Poisson regression was used to examine
   intervention effectiveness. The largest reductions in criminal activity
   occurred for robbery and shoplifting outcomes. We conclude that the
   Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design program reduced crime and
   injury in liquor stores and educated small businesses about the risks
   associated with retail violence and the countermeasures that can be
   taken.

AB Buprenorphine's physiological effects are produced when it attaches to
   specific opiate receptors that are designated mu, kappa, or delta.
   Buprenorphine, a partial agonist at the mu receptor and an antagonist at
   the kappa receptor, produces typical morphine-like effects at low doses.
   At higher doses, it produces opiate effects that are less than those of
   full opiate agonists. Knowledge of the physiological effects of opiate
   receptors and the way they interact with opiate agonists, partial opiate
   agonists, and opiate antagonists is fundamental to understanding the
   safety and efficacy of buprenorphine in treatment of pain and opiate
   addiction. Knowledge of the historical and social context of opiate
   agonist treatment of opiate dependence is fundamental to understanding
   how nonpharmacological factors may limit the clinical adoption and
   utility of a safe and effective medication in treatment of opiate
   dependence. This article reviews. the pharmacology of sublingual
   buprenorphine and the historical context of opiate agonist therapy
   delineates classes of opiate receptors and their interaction with opiate
   agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists; and describes the
   commercially available pharmaceutical formulations of buprenorphine. It
   focuses on sublingual buprenorphine tablets, Subutex(R) and Suboxone(R),
   the FDA-approved formulations of buprenorphine for treatment of opiate
   dependence. Sublingual buprenorphine, and the combination of sublingual
   buprenorphine/naloxone, have unique pharmacological properties that make
   them a logical first-line intervention in the treatment of opioid
   dependence.

AB The association between the restriction length polymorphisms of the
   Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene and the bone mineral density (BMD) or the
   rate of bone loss is still under debate. In a longitudinal study of
   untreated postmenopausal elderly women, we evaluated the relationship
   between the VDR gene polymorphisms (BsmI, TaqI, ApaI, and FokI) and the
   rate of bone loss over a 3-year period. We also examined the effect of
   adjustments for dietary and lifestyle factors on these associations.
   Before adjustments, the rate of femoral neck bone loss was -3.76 +/-
   1.58% in women with BB genotype and 0.45 +/- 0.65% in women with bb
   genotype, which was not significantly different. Upon adjustment for
   dietary and lifestyle factors, statistically significant (P = 0.03) bone
   loss was observed at femoral neck in women with BB genotype (-3.66 +/-
   2.44%) compared to that of bb genotype (2.39 +/- 1.32%). Similar results
   were observed with TaqI genotypes. The rates of bone loss at other
   skeletal sites were not different between VDR genotypes defined by BsmI
   and TaqI. VDR gene polymorphisms defined by Apal and Fokl were not
   related to the rate of bone loss. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Objective: The current study was designed to examine the impact of
   perpetrator and victim substance use on the sexual assault outcomes of
   penetration and victim injury. Method: Women, ages 1830 (n = 1,014),
   were recruited from households using random digit dialing. They
   completed computer-assisted measures, including the Sexual Experiences
   Survey (Koss et al., 1987). Women who reported sexual assault since age
   14 (n = 359) were interviewed face-to-face regarding their most recent
   sexual assault incident. Results: As hypothesized, high levels of
   perpetrator intoxication decreased the likelihood of penetration
   occurring. When the victim was highly intoxicated, however, penetration
   was more likely. Victim injury was more likely in assaults involving
   penetration. Higher levels of perpetrator intoxication in assaults
   involving a sober victim were also associated with greater odds of
   victim injury Conclusions: Perpetrator intoxication effects are
   consistent with the presumption that intoxication at high levels impairs
   male sexual function but increases male physical aggression. Victim
   intoxication increases vulnerability to penetration but does not reduce
   odds of injury.

AB Objective: Drinking behavior, and consequently the risk to develop
   alcohol problems, is influenced in part by one's subjective response to
   alcohol. Studies have shown that individuals at risk for alcoholism
   report greater stimulation, less sedation and/or "low response" to
   alcohol. Whether this effect exists in early-stage alcoholics has not
   been examined. The present study was conducted to determine whether
   alcoholics and social drinkers differ in response following a challenge
   dose of alcohol in a clinical laboratory procedure. Method:
   Nontreatment-seeking alcoholics (n = 38) and social drinkers (n = 30)
   randomized to a placebo in a medication study were given a standard dose
   of alcohol (0.34 g/kg women; 0.4 g/kg men) in a bar-laboratory setting.
   Assessments, including blood alcohol concentrations and the Biphasic
   Alcohol Effects Scale, were conducted four times (from 10 to 60 minutes
   following initiation of consumption). Results: Alcoholics reported
   greater stimulation, but similar sedation, compared with social
   drinkers, following alcohol consumption. Conclusions: This study
   provides the first evidence of greater stimulation following alcohol in
   alcoholics not seeking treatment.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to examine the associations
   between mother physical abuse, mother psychological aggression, father
   physical abuse and father psychological aggression and women's alcohol
   dependence while controlling for several demographic variables,
   childhood sexual abuse and mother and father alcohol problems. Method:
   Samples of women in treatment for substance use disorders (n = 225) and
   receiving services for domestic violence (n= 222) volunteered to be in
   the study. We used the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scales to assess
   retrospectively experiences of parental aggression during childhood and
   the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for a diagnosis of
   alcohol dependence based on International Classification of Diseases
   (ICD-10) criteria. Results: Logistic regression applied to the data
   showed that being in the substance use disorder treatment sample, being
   unemployed and not being black were significantly related to a higher
   likelihood of lifetime diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Mother
   psychological aggression was found to be significantly associated with
   alcohol dependence. Father psychological aggression was found to be
   significantly related to alcohol dependence for nonwhite women but not
   for white women. Mother and father physical abuse were both found to be
   significantly related to alcohol dependence, but Only for women who did
   not report childhood sexual abuse. Conclusions: Associations between
   experiences of childhood abuse and development of alcohol problems for
   women are complex. Experiences of mother and father abuse need to be
   examined separately with samples of women who are of different
   ethnicities and samples of women who are receiving services for
   different problems.

   to 65, was obtained from the 1990 National Health Interview Survey
   (NHIS). The gender compositions of three-digit occupational and
   industrial categories were calculated based on a 1% sample of the 1990
   census and attached to the NHIS sample. A set of regression analyses
   tests the relationship between gender composition of occupation or
   industry and drinking behavior, such as the likelihood of being a
   drinker and the level of alcohol consumption among the drinkers. and
   reported levels of stress. Results: When the demographic back-ground
   variables are controlled for, the percentage of men within each
   occupational classification is positively correlated with stress levels.
   Curvilinear relationships were found between percentage of men in both
   industry and occupation and the likelihood of drinking in the past year.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the women working in
   gender-balanced, rather than gender-typed, jobs were more likely to
   drink due to increased interaction between genders. The results also
   suggest that male dominance of an occupation may be a source of stress,
   which may increase alcohol consumption among women workers.

AB Objective: Alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) has gained
   widespread acceptance as an effective method for reducing problem
   drinking in at-risk populations. This study examines the cost and
   cost-effectiveness of an SBI pilot program delivered in an inner-city
   hospital emergency department (ED) to a traditionally underserved
   population. Method: A total of 1,036 subjects were screened for problem
   drinking during their visit to an ED. Eligible participants (N = 294)
   were randomly assigned to either a brief intervention group or a control
   group. As the result of attrition, a final sample of 194 (90 brief
   intervention; 104 control) participants remained at follow-up. The
   intervention consisted of a brief counseling session and a health
   information packet. The control group received only the packet.
   Intervention cost data were collected and analyzed using the Drug Abuse
   Treatment Cost Analysis Program. Selected outcomes at the 3-month
   follow-up included the raw Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
   score, average weekly number of drinks and engaging in heavy drinking in
   the past month (>6 drinks on one occasion for men, >4 for women).
   Outcome differences between the intervention and control groups were
   estimated with both bivariate and multivariate techniques. Results: The
   average economic cost of the brief intervention was $632 per subject, of
   which screening ($497) was the largest component. In all cases,
   intervention subjects had better 3-month outcomes than control subjects,
   but the differences were not always statistically significant.
   Cost-effectiveness ratios were relatively small for all three outcomes,
   suggesting this type of intervention has the potential to be
   cost-effective under full implementation. Conclusions: The preliminary
   results demonstrate the potential advantage of further research in this
   area with larger samples and a longer follow-up period.

AB We suggest that a particular form of social hierarchy, which we
   characterize as "pathogenic", can, from the earliest stages of life,
   exert a formal analog to evolutionary selection pressure, literally
   writing a permanent developmental image of itself upon immune function
   as chronic vascular inflammation and its consequences. The staged nature
   of resulting disease emerges "naturally" as a rough analog to punctuated
   equilibrium in evolutionary theory, although selection pressure is a
   passive filter rather than an active agent, like structured psychosocial
   stress. Exposure differs according to the social constructs of race,
   class, and ethnicity, accounting in large measure for observed
   population-level differences in rates of coronary heart disease across
   industrialized societies. American Apartheid, which enmeshes both
   majority and minority communities in a social construct of pathogenic
   hierarchy, appears to present a severe biological limit to continuing
   declines in coronary heart disease for powerful as well as subordinate
   subgroups: "Culture"-to use the words of the evolutionary anthropologist
   Robert Boyd-"is as much a part of human biology as the enamel on our
   teeth".

AB This paper examines the impact of two multisectoral highland development
   projects on ethnic minorities in northern Thailand. While social sector
   interventions were relatively successfully delivered and locally
   appreciated, strategies for agricultural development failed to take
   account of local cultural and production systems, and were fraught with
   a range of design and implementation difficulties. These uneven outcomes
   are traced to the assumptions underlying project design, contradictions
   in policy (especially relating to land tenure), and the institutional
   cultures of implementing agencies.

AB Because of the growing concern that exposures to airborne pollutants
   have adverse effects on fetal growth and early childhood
   neurodevelopment, and the knowledge that such exposures are more
   prevalent in disadvantaged populations, we assessed the joint impact of
   prenatal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and material
   hardship on the 2-year cognitive development of inner-city children,
   adjusted for other sociodemographic risks and chemical exposures. The
   put-pose was to evaluate the neurotoxicant effects of ETS among children
   experiencing different degrees of socioeconomic disadvantage, within a
   minority population. The sample did not include children exposed to
   active maternal smoking in the prenatal period. Results showed
   significant adverse effects of prenatal residential ETS exposure and the
   level of material hardship on 2-year cognitive development, as well as a
   significant interaction between material hardship and ETS, such that
   children with both ETS exposure and material hardship exhibited the
   greatest cognitive deficit. In addition, children with prenatal ETS
   exposure were twice as likely to be classified as significantly delayed,
   as compared with nonexposed children. Postnatal ETS exposure in the
   first 2 years of life did not contribute independently to the risk of
   developmental delay, over and above the risk posed by prenatal ETS
   exposure. The study concluded that prenatal exposure to ETS in the home
   has a negative impact on 2-year cognitive development, and this effect
   is exacerbated under conditions of material hardship in this urban
   minority sample. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. This paper presents the reliability and validity of several
   diet-related psychosocial questionnaires.
   Methods. At baseline and 12 weeks follow-up, parents/caregivers of one
   hundred fifty 8- to 10-year-old African-American completed
   questionnaires on food preparation habits for their daughter, perceived
   home barriers to healthy eating, and fruit, juice, vegetable (FJV),
   low-fat and high-fat food availability. Girls completed a sweetened
   beverage preferences questionnaire and two 24-h dietary recalls assess
   intake. Principal components analyses were conducted for two newly
   designed measures. Internal consistency was calculated and construct
   validity was assessed between the psychosocial scales and
   obesity-related dietary variables.
   Results. Low-fat and high-fat food preparation for daughters, and
   perceived home barriers to eating low-fat food and FJV subscales were
   derived from the new questionnaires. Internal consistency reliabilities
   were moderate (0.58) to substantial (0.80) across all new and existing
   scales. Test-retest reliabilities were moderate (0.44) to substantial
   (0.79). Girls' intake of fat as a percentage of energy was positively
   related to parental high-fat food preparation for daughters (P < 0.01)
   and negatively related to parental low-fat food preparation practices
   for daughters (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions. Measures of family influences on FJV, fat, and sweetened
   beverage consumption were internally consistent with moderate to
   substantial stability. Scales for low-fat and high-fat food preparation
   practices for daughters achieved construct validity with fat consumption
   in the hypothesized direction. Family food preparation habits appear to
   be important targets for future interventions. (C) 2004 The Institute

AB Background. Social desirability (SocD) may bias children's self-reported
   health behaviors and attitudes and confound relationships with health
   outcome measures.
   Methods. Ninety-five, 8- to 10-year-old African-American girls completed
   dietary recalls, a physical activity checklist, psychosocial
   questionnaires related to diet, and physical activity; and 3 days of
   physical activity monitoring. Potential SocD construct bias was
   investigated by comparing designated criterion measures of physical
   activity, beverage intake, and body mass index (BMI) with respective
   self-reported measures related to activity, beverage preferences, and
   body image and weight concerns in cross-sectional regression models.
   Potential confounding by SocD of associations between self-reported
   behaviors with BMI was assessed using change-in-coefficient regression
   analyses.
   Results. Controlling for age and BMI, overestimates of self-reported
   activity (P = 0.02), underestimates of sweetened beverage preferences
   (P= 0.02), and lower ratings of weight concems and dieting behaviors
   (P's < 0.05) were related to SocD. Confounding by SocD of associations
   between self-reported physical activity and energy intake with BMI was
   found.
   Conclusions. In 8- to 10-year-old African-American girls, SocD was found
   to bias self-reports of diet and physical activity and confound
   associations between BMI and self-reported physical activity and energy
   intake. Methods to measure and control SocD bias are needed to reduce
   potential distortion of relationships between diet and physical activity
   and health outcomes. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and

AB Background. This paper presents reliability and validity analyses of
   physical activity-related psychosocial questionnaires completed by 8-to
   10-year-old African-American girls at baseline and follow-up assessments
   of pilot intervention studies in the Girls health Enrichment Multi-site
   Study (GEMS).
   Methods. Two hundred ten girls participated in the GEMS 12-week pilot
   studies and had their height and weight measured, wore an accelerometer
   for 3 days and completed a measure of their usual physical activity (PA)
   at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Subgroups of girls also
   completed physical activity-related psychosocial measures at these two
   time points including: (a) self-concept; (b) self-efficacy; (c) outcome
   expectancies; and d) preferences. Principal components analysis was
   conducted on the psychosocial measures obtained at baseline. Cronbach's
   alpha and test-retest reliability were computed. Convergent validity was
   assessed by correlating the baseline psychosocial measures with baseline
   physical activity measures and body mass index (BMI).
   Results. The following sub-scales were derived: Activity Preference,
   Positive Expectancies and Negative Expectancies for physical activity.
   Physical Performance Self-Concept and Self-Efficacy for physical
   activity were kept as single dimensional scales. Sub-scales, derived
   from principal components analyses, were Activity Preference, Positive
   Expectancies, and Negative Expectancies for physical activity. Internal
   consistency estimates for the various scales were substantial to
   excellent (0.67-0.85), while test-retest reliability estimates were fair
   to moderate (0.22-0.56). Correlations between the PA psychosocial
   sub-scales and measured levels of activity measures showed evidence of
   convergent validity for the Activity Preference sub-scale, although
   social desirability may have influenced the significant associations
   observed.
   Conclusions. The Activity Preference was a fairly reliable and valid
   measure. Further studies are needed to examine the utility of activity
   related psychosocial measures in interventions to increase physical
   activity among preadolescent African-American girls. (C) 2004 The

AB This article further develops the "political process" model of social
   movements by analyzing historical transformations in the women's
   movement and equal employment policy in the mid-to-late 1960s.
   Confronting the model's tendency to treat social movements exclusively
   as a dependent variable, I outline an interactive political process
   framework. My framework considers not only how movements are enabled and
   constrained by the broader political environment, but also how
   challengers in turn actively reshape that environment. I also revisit
   the political process model's core concept of "political opportunity
   structure" by exploring legal rules and institutions as key elements of
   a movement's opportunity structure. I apply this framework specifically
   to initial legal battles over sex-segregated help-wanted ads and
   formation of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Historical
   evidence suggests that NOW was both the recipient and creator of
   political opportunities embedded in equal employment law, and that
   mobilization of legal resources is one way in which social movements
   interact with and transform their broader political environment.

AB Interdisciplines are hybridized knowledge fields that are constituted by
   intentionally porous organizational, epistemological, and political
   boundaries. To date, these processes are not well understood. This
   article uses the case of genetic toxicology and draws on framing theory
   to examine how interdisciplines are made. I argue that the concept of
   "collective action frames" and attention to framing processes (Snow et
   al. 1986) and frame resonance (Snow and Benford 1988) adds much needed
   refinement to sociologists' understanding of the permeable boundaries
   that accompany the development of interdisciplines. I develop this
   argument through an analysis of public lectures, expert testimony,
   articles, and editorials produced by scientists promoting genetic
   toxicology during the period 1968-1973. I show how these researchers
   made the rhetorical case for genetic toxicology by amplifying,
   extending, and translating a set of interrelated collective action
   frames and why, in the context of shifting institutional opportunities,
   framing processes were integral to the rapid consolidation of a new and
   intensely interdisciplinary environmental health science. The article
   concludes by noting the study's implications for integrative research on
   science and social movements.

AB The media, in the sociology of natural disasters, are mainly viewed as
   management tools used to influence people's preparedness and response to
   natural disasters. As a consequence, research in this area has been
   limited to the warning, preparedness, and recovery phases. Through
   interviews with residents of eight communities in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico,
   impacted by Hurricane Georges in 1998, this paper shows that through
   integrating mass communication research to disaster theory we can obtain
   a more accurate picture of the media-audience relationship during
   natural disasters. In addition to the manifest functions of providing
   information, the media also have latent functions in disasters, which
   consist of emotional support and companionship. The media also help
   isolated individuals to feel connected with the "outside world." These
   functions are most salient in the impact phase of disasters. These
   functions are also particularly crucial as they have been shown to
   reduce the negative effects of stressful life events.

AB This paper examines medical intake screening through the process of
   making appointments with medical specialists. By employing a
   multi-method, qualitative approach, it shows how decisions to schedule
   doctors' appointments are based on medical knowledge about physicians'
   specialties and specific organisational practices. It draws on insights
   from first-contact interactions between clients and institutional
   gatekeepers to enrich our understanding of intake screening. In relation
   to gatekeeping, rationing commonly gets framed as restrictive screening
   practices, with a preference for denying or limiting access to
   treatment. Restrictive screening practices are typically organised to
   elicit a narrow range of information ('facts') relevant to specific
   eligibility criteria; whereas inclusive intake screening tends to
   involve less scripted, more complex and open-ended interactional
   exchanges between workers and clients, wherein workers help clients
   frame their claims in ways that will increase their chances of getting
   accepted. Front-office workers hold a preference for inclusive intake
   screening, a preference that is undergirded by the referral-driven
   nature of this stage of patient processing, and by a work environment
   that favours inclusive screening. This finding builds on the literature
   within medical sociology, but also extends our understanding of
   frontline decision-making and the distribution of resources within a
   variety of people-processing institutions.

   the four-factor structure of the CES-D scale replicated in all three

AB BACKGROUND. Compared with northern Europe and the U.S., the widespread
   initiation of cigarette smoking began 20-40 years later among young
   women in Spain because of strong cultural prohibitions against female
   smoking. In this study, the authors examined the correlation between the
   rapid increase in female smoking prevalence and tobacco industry
   cigarette marketing practices in Spain during a period of rapid social
   liberalization.
   METHODS. The authors examined age-specific, period-specific, and birth
   cohort-specific increases in cigarette smoking among young women in
   Spain in relation to internal documents from Philip Morris beginning in
   1971, cigarette advertising from 1982 to 1997, and the increase in the
   market share of blond tobacco and "light" cigarettes preferred by women.
   RESULTS. Some increase in cigarette smoking occurred among Spanish women
   before 1970, but the increase was substantially smaller and occurred
   later than in many Western countries. However, after 1970, the
   prevalence of cigarette smoking increased rapidly in Spanish women of
   all ages < 50 years. The rapid increase in female smoking coincided with
   massive increases in television advertising, especially to women, and
   increases in the market share of blond tobacco, "light cigarettes," and
   international tobacco brands.
   CONCLUSIONS. The increase in cigarette smoking among young Spanish women
   illustrates how aggressive marketing can exploit periods of social
   liberalization and rapidly increase cigarette smoking among women, even
   in countries in which female smoking traditionally has been
   unacceptable. Strategies are needed to prevent similar increases in
   smoking by women elsewhere. (C) 2004 American Cancer Society.

   to identify associations between self-reported adherence levels and
   psychosocial measures selected with guidance from the Transactional
   Model of Stress and Coping (TMSC). The study was conducted using data
   collected from 137 HIV-positive African American drug users who were
   receiving antiretroviral medications at the time they were interviewed.
   Bivariate associations were investigated using correlational analyses
   and variables showing a significant correlation with adherence were
   entered into a multivariate regression model. The multivariate model
   showed only perceived efficacy of antiretrovirals and one measure of
   perceived barriers, simply forgetting to take medications, were
   independently related to adherence. These preliminary findings suggest
   that theoretical approaches to understanding antiretroviral adherence
   must address a range of variables, including but not limited to
   behavioural practices, cognitive appraisals, affective responses and
   social support. Further studies using the complete TMSC are recommended.

   Methods. We used data from the Taxi Drivers' Health Study to estimate
   1-year prevalence of knee pain as assessed by the Nordic musculoskeletal
   questionnaire.
   Results. Among 1242 drivers, the prevalence of knee pain, stratified by
   duration of daily driving (less than or equal to6, > 6 through 8, > 8
   through 10, and >10 hours), was 11%, 17%, 19%, and 22%, respectively.
   Compared with driving 6 or fewer hours per day, the odds ratio of knee
   pain prevalence for driving more than 6 hours per day was 2.52 (95%
   confidence interval= 1.36, 4.65) after we adjusted for socioeconomic,
   work-related, and personal factors in the multiple logistic regression.
   Conclusions. The dose-related association between driving duration and
   knee pain raises concerns about work-related knee joint disorders among

AB Objectives. This cross-sectional, community-based, epidemiological study
   characterized Somali and Ethiopian (Oromo) refugees in Minnesota to
   determine torture prevalence and associated problems.
   Methods. A comprehensive questionnaire was developed, then administered
   by trained ethnic interviewers to a nonprobability sample of 1134.
   Measures assessed torture techniques; traumatic events; and social,
   physical, and psychological problems, including post-traumatic stress
   symptoms.
   Results. Torture prevalence ranged from 25% to 69% by ethnicity and
   gender, higher than usually reported. Unexpectedly, women were tortured
   as often as men. Torture survivors had more health problems, including
   posttraumatic stress.
   Conclusions. This study highlights the need to recognize torture in
   African refugees, especially women, identify indicators of posttraumatic
   stress in torture survivors, and provide additional resources to care
   for tortured refugees.

AB Objectives. This study investigated the effects of physical abuse in
   childhood on health problems in adulthood and assessed gender
   differences in these associations.
   Methods. We used data from 8000 men and 8000 women who were interviewed
   in the National Violence Against Women Survey. We used multivariate
   logistic regression to test for main and interactive effects and
   conducted post hoc probing of significant moderational effects.
   Results. Men were more likely than women to have experienced physical
   abuse during childhood. Whereas abuse had negative consequences for both
   boys and girls, it was generally more detrimental for girls.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest the need to consider gender differences
   and long-term adverse health consequences in the development of
   intervention strategies to address physical abuse in childhood.

AB Objectives. We examined prevalence, 3-year incidence, and predictors of
   physical and verbal abuse among postmenopausal women.
   Methods. We used a cohort of 91749 women aged 50 to 79 years from the
   Women's Health Initiative. Outcomes included self-reported physical
   abuse and verbal abuse.
   Results. At baseline, 11.1% reported abuse sometime during the prior
   year, with 2.1% reporting physical abuse only, 89.1% reporting verbal
   abuse only, and 8.8% reporting. both physical and verbal abuse. Baseline
   prevalence was associated with service occupations, having lower
   incomes, and living alone. At 3-year follow-up, 5.0 % of women reported
   new abuse, with 2.8% reporting physical abuse only, 92.6% reporting
   verbal abuse only, and 4.7% reporting both physical and verbal abuse.
   Conclusions. Postmenopausal women are exposed to abuse at similar rates
   to younger women; this abuse poses a serious threat to their health.

   Methods. We analyzed 1997 and 1999 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System data for 120 metropolitan areas in 48 states and the District of
   Columbia.
   Results. The prevalence of binge drinking varied substantially across
   metropolitan areas, from 4.1% in Chattanooga, Tenn, to 23.9% in San
   Antonio, Tex, (median =14.5%). Seventeen of the 20 metropolitan areas
   with the highest estimates were located in the upper Midwest, Texas, and
   Nevada. In 13 of these areas, at least one third of persons aged 18 to
   34 years were binge drinkers. There were significant intrastate
   differences for binge drinking among metropolitan areas in New York,
   Tennessee, and Utah.
   Conclusions. Metropolitan-area estimates can be used to guide local
   efforts to reduce binge drinking.

PD APR 2004
PY 2004
AB Drawing on interviews with peer-review panelists from five
   multidisciplinary fellowship competitions, this paper analyzes one of
   the main criteria used to evaluate scholarship in the humanities and the
   social sciences: originality. Whereas the literature in the sociology of
   science focuses on the natural sciences and defines originality as the
   production of new findings and new theories, we show that in the context
   of fellowship competitions, peer reviewers in the social sciences and
   humanities define originality much more broadly: as using a new
   approach, theory, method, or data; studying a new topic; doing research
   in an understudied area; or producing new findings. Whereas the
   literature has not considered disciplinary variation in the definition
   of originality, we identified significant differences. Humanists and
   historians clearly privilege originality in approach, and humanists also
   emphasize originality in the data used. Social scientists most often
   mention originality in method, but they also appreciate a more diverse
   range of types of originality. Whereas the literature tends to equate
   originality with substantive innovation and to consider the personal
   attributes of the researcher as irrelevant to the evaluation process, we
   show that panelists often view the originality of a proposal as an
   indication of the researcher moral character especially of his/her
   authenticity and integrity. These contributions constitute a new
   approach to the study of peer review and originality that focuses on the
   meaning of criteria of evaluation and their distribution across clusters
   of disciplines.

AB Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years?
   Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage
   between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas,
   suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific
   practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration
   networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been
   growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline
   coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the
   sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that
   quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative
   work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given
   collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is
   consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has
   potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in
   sociology.

PD APR 2004
PY 2004
AB The prestige of academic departments is commonly understood as rooted in
   the scholarly productivity of their faculty and graduates. I use the
   theories of Weber and Bourdieu to advance an alternative view of
   departmental prestige, which I show is an effect a department position
   within networks of association and social exchange-that is, it is a form
   of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs
   among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data
   on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network
   analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental
   prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view.
   Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks
   explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar
   findings are reported for history and political science. This
   alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies -
   e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity,
   the strong association between department size and prestige, and the
   long-term stability of prestige rankings - encountered in research that
   is based on the more conventional view.

AB More than 30 million titles of "academic" articles, from the years
   1945-2001, were surveyed for occurrences of the words sex and gender. At
   the beginning of this period, uses of gender were much rarer than uses
   of sex, and often used in the sense of a grammatical category. By the
   end of this period, uses of gender outnumbered uses of sex in the social
   sciences, arts, and humanities. Within the natural sciences, there was
   now more than 1 use of gender for every 2 uses of sex. The beginnings of
   this change in usage can be traced to Money's introduction of the
   concept of "gender role" in 1955 (J. Money, 1955). However, the major
   expansion in the use of gender followed its adoption by feminists to
   distinguish the social and cultural aspects of differences between men
   and women (gender) from biological differences (sex). Since then, the
   use of gender has tended to expand to encompass the biological, and a
   sex/gender distinction is now only fitfully observed.

AB Human activities continue to eliminate or degrade wetlands that provide
   rich habitat for many species. Compensatory mitigation, including
   creation of new wetlands, restoration of previously degraded wetlands,
   or preservation of existing wetlands, is one policy option that seeks to
   maintain no net loss of wetland habitat. Public support of wetland
   mitigation is essential because the public incurs the cost for many
   mitigation projects in the form of higher taxes. Therefore,public
   preferences should be considered when decisions are made about wetland
   mitigation options. We used a contingent-choice survey in Rhode Island
   to identify factors affecting public support for different types of
   compensatory wetland mitigation. Results were based on 640 survey
   responses. The amount of wetland lost during the original development
   project had no significant effect, on the preferred mitigation
   alternative. Preferences for preservation, restoration, and no-action
   alternatives varied according to respondents' gender, education, and
   income. Certain general considerations applied, however, regardless of
   mitigation type. Respondents were willing to incur increases in taxes
   and fees for most mitigation projects. The larger the mitigation project
   and the lower the cost, the more likely it was to gain public support.
   The presence of endangered species contributed to public support, but
   less significantly than public access. Public access can be critical to
   public support, particularly if the size of the wetland is small or the
   cost is high. If the cost of providing public access, such as a
   boardwalk or viewing tower, is relatively small, the gain in public.
   support for mitigation expenditures may well allow a substantial
   expansion of the area involved in mitigation projects and thus a greater
   increase in the amount of habitat conservation.

   (SES) are predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Blacks
   and Hispanics are more likely to have higher LVM and lower SES. The
   relation between SES, race-ethnicity, and LVM has not been fully
   explored. Data were used from the NOMAS population-based sample of 1916
   subjects living in Northern Manhattan. SES was characterized on the
   basis of educational attainment and divided into 4 categories.
   Echocardiography-defined LVM was indexed according to height at the
   allometric power of 2.7 and analyzed as a continuous variable. LVM
   varied by race in our cohort (blacks 48.9 g/m(2.7), Hispanics 48.4
   g/m(2.7), whites 45.6 g/m(2.7); P = 0.004). Using ANCOVA, there was a
   significant inverse and graded association between mean LVM and SES for
   the total cohort. Mean LVM was 48.4 g/m(2.7), 48.6 g/m(2.7), 47.1
   g/m(2.7), and 45.3 g/m(2.7) for the lowest to the highest educational
   level category (P trend = 0.0004). This relationship remained among
   normotensives (P trend = 0.0005) and was present for blacks (P trend =
   0.009), but not for whites (P trend = 0.86) or Hispanics (P trend =
   0.47). The difference in mean LVM between the highest and lowest
   categories of education was 5.3 g/m(2.7) for blacks, 0.0 g/m(2.7) for
   whites, and 1.0 g/m(2.7) for Hispanics. Lower SES is an independent
   predictor of increased LVM among hypertensive and normotensive blacks.

   autism within cultural groups and multicultural family adaptation based

   are a minority within the dominant culture. We found differences in

   challenged on at least four dimensions: communication, social skills,
   behavioral repertoires, and culture. Future research in these areas is

AB OBJECTIVE: To measure Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) prevalence, incidence, and
   initiation of HCV therapy in a representative HIV-infected cohort of the
   urban poor.
   DESIGN: Cohort analysis.
   SETTING: The Research and Access to Care for the Homeless (REACH) Cohort
   is a systematic sample of HIV-infected marginally housed individuals
   identified from single-room occupancy hotels, homeless shelters, and
   free lunch programs in San Francisco.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-nine participants with 28.9 months
   (median) of follow-up were studied. Mean age was 44 (range 24 to 75,
   standard deviation 8.4) years. Eighty-two percent were male, 43% were
   African-American, 64% were lifetime injection drug users, and 24% had
   been on the street or in a shelter in the prior month.
   INTERVENTIONS: We measured HCV testing and treatment history with
   structured interviews; additionally, participants were tested for HCV
   antibodies (EIA-2) with RNA viral load confirmation.
   MAIN RESULTS: At baseline, 172 (69.1%) were HCV-positive and 182 (73.1%)
   were HCV-positive at follow-up, including 155 (62.2%) with viremia.
   HCV-positive status was associated with having injected drugs, elevated
   serum alanine aminotransferase, homelessness in the last 1 year, and
   more severe depressive symptoms. The incidence of new HCV infection was
   4.63% per person-year (ppy; 95% confidence interval, 2.31 to 8.13) in
   the entire cohort and 16.77% ppy among injection drug users. The
   prevalence of HCV antibody-negative HCV-viremia was 13.2% (10/76).
   Nonwhites were less likely to receive HCV testing and subspecialty
   referral, controlled for drug use and other confounders. Sixty-eight
   percent (123/182) were aware treatment was available; however, only 3.8%
   (7/182) or 1.16% ppy received HCV treatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: While HCV infection is common, HCV treatment is rare in the
   HIV-HCV coinfected urban poor. Urban poor, nonwhite individuals are less
   likely to receive HCV testing and subspecialty referral than their white
   counterparts. Antibody-negative infection may complicate screening and
   diagnosis in HIV-infected persons.

AB BACKGROUND: Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend delaying
   antiretroviral therapy for nonadherent patients, which some fear may
   disproportionately affect certain populations and contribute to
   disparities in care.
   OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship of physician's attitude toward
   prescribing protease inhibitors (PIs) to nonadherent patients with
   disparities in PI use and with health outcomes.
   DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
   PATIENTS AND SETTING: A national probability sample of HIV-infected
   adults in the United States and their health care providers was surveyed
   between January 1996 and January 1998. We analyzed data on 1,717
   patients eligible for PI treatment and the 367 providers who cared for
   them.
   MEASUREMENTS: Providers' attitude toward prescribing PIs to nonadherent
   patients, time until patients' first receipt of PIs, mortality, and
   physical health status.
   MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of providers agreed that patient
   adherence is important in their decision to prescribe PIs (Selective)
   while 11% disagreed (Nonselective). Patients who had a Selective
   provider received PIs later than those with a Nonselective provider (P =
   .05). Adjusting for patient demographics and health characteristics and
   provider demographics, HIV knowledge, and experience, Latinos, women,
   and poor patients received PIs later if their provider had a Selective
   attitude but as soon as others if their provider had a Nonselective
   attitude. African-American patients received PIs later than whites,
   irrespective of their providers' prescribing attitude. Patients with
   Selective providers had similar odds of mortality than those with
   Nonselective providers (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.6 to
   2.0), but had slightly worse adjusted physical health status at
   follow-up (49.1 vs 50.4, respectively; P = .04), after controlling for
   baseline physical health status and other patient and provider
   covariates.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most providers consider patient adherence an important
   factor in their decision to prescribe PIs. This attitude appears to
   account for the relatively later use of PI treatment among Latinos,
   women, and the poor. Given the rising HIV infection rates among
   minorities, women, and the poor, further investigation of this treatment
   strategy and its impact on HIV resistance and outcomes is warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder
   and its treatment in economically disadvantaged pregnant women.
   METHODS: The sample included 744 pregnant Medicaid-eligible women from
   Women, Infants and Children Supplemental Nutrition Program sites in 5
   counties in rural Missouri and the city of St. Louis. Race (black and
   white) was proportional to clients seen at each site. Women were
   assessed by using standardized measures of posttraumatic stress
   disorder, 18 other psychiatric disorders, environmental stressors, and
   pregnancy characteristics. Logistic regression identified risk factors
   associated with posttraumatic stress disorder.
   RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress disorder prevalence was 7.7% (n = 57/744).
   Comorbid disorders were common. Women with posttraumatic stress disorder
   were 5 times more likely to have a major depressive episode (odds ratio
   5.17; 95% confidence interval 2.61, 10.26) and more than 3 times as
   likely to have generalized anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.25; 95%
   confidence interval 1.22, 8.62). Besides these comorbid disorders, risk
   factors for posttraumatic stress disorder included a history of maternal
   separation for 6 months and multiple traumatic events. Although most
   women with posttraumatic stress disorder reported moderate impairment in
   their daily lives, only 7 of the 57 women with this disorder reported
   speaking with any health professional about it in the last 12 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder in
   pregnancy and low treatment rates suggest that screening for this
   disorder should be considered in clinical practice. (C) 2004 by The

AB Much of the work in professional ethics sees ethical problems as
   resulting from ethical ignorance, ethical failure or evil intent. While
   this approach gets at real and valid concerns, it does not capture the
   whole story because it does not take into account the underlying
   professional or institutional culture in which moral decision making is
   imbedded My argument in this paper is that this culture plays a powerful
   and sometimes determinant role in establishing the nature of the ethical
   debate; i.e., it helps to define what are viable action options, what is
   the organization's genuine mission, and what behaviors will be rewarded
   or criticized. Given these conclusions, I also argue that consulting
   ethicists need more than an understanding of ethics theory, concepts and
   principles; they also need a sufficiently rich understanding of
   organizational culture and a willingness and an ability to critique that
   culture.

AB Objectives: To examine the amount of time adolescents waited to have
   intercourse with past partners ( main and casual), and intentions to
   delay with future partners. To determine psychosocial factors which
   predict delay intentions among adolescent males and females with future
   partners ( main and casual).
   Methods: Adolescent STD clinic attendees were approached before clinical
   appointments to participate in an interview. Data from 205 participants
   who had previous experience with both main and casual partners were used
   in the current study.
   Results: Adolescents waited less time to have intercourse with most
   recent casual than with most recent main partners (chi(2) = 31.97, p<
   0.0001). The amount of time waited with past partners was shorter than
   intended time to wait in future relationships ( medians of 1 month v 2
   months ( main) (t = 3.47, p< 0.0010; medians of 2 weeks v 1 month (
   casual) ( t = 6.14, p, 0.0001)). Factors influencing intentions to delay
   intercourse with future main partners differed by sex; males were
   negatively influenced by importance of sex in relationships, while
   females were positively influenced by importance of intimacy in
   relationships, perceived risk of STDs, and health values.
   Conclusions: Implications for designing interventions for adolescent
   males and females are discussed.

AB Organic and conventional agriculture are considered different not only
   because of distinct food production practices, but also because organic
   production is thought to rest on non-dualistic and non-modern views of
   the natural world. However, views of nature that were expressed in the
   debate leading up to the US decision not to develop certification
   standards for fish and shellfish show that organic views of nature are
   quite complicated, and cannot easily be categorized as either dualistic
   or non-dualistic. The paper identifies three themes: how those in the
   organic movement conceptualized the relationship between "organic" and
   "natural;" the emphasis on control as a key dimension of organic
   practice; and ways that different organisms were classified as being
   similar or different from each other. Analysis reveals concepts of
   nature that rely on making sharp distinctions between terrestrial and
   aquatic systems, distinctions that led to deciding that it is
   inappropriate to ever certify fish as organic.

AB This essay applies the approach of the relational model to the quotidian
   modes of contemporary movement, walking and motoring, in order to
   analyse fitness. The social model of disability provides a tool for
   de-individualising fitness discourse, as well as for embedding fitness
   within sociomaterial and cultural contexts. Fitness, or 'being able to',
   is seen as an outcome of the interpenetrations and interactions of
   mind-bodies moving within their environments. The analysis indicates
   that the social model has general relevance for the sociology of health
   and illness. Here, it is extended beyond the study of disability to
   encompass fitness. In future, the social model may prove fruitful in the
   analysis of other socially situated conditions as well.

   exercise, using a modified version of the game Monopoly, intended to
   stress the structural nature of social inequality and to stimulate
   student reflection and class discussion on social stratification in the
   United States. The primary focus of this exercise is to help students
   experience different levels of social stratification and to challenge
   the idea that individual talents or aspirations are enough to overcome
   structural barriers to upward class mobility. Student reactions to the
   experience suggest that it is an effective tool for demonstrating the
   structural nature of social inequality in the United States and for
   stimulating discussion on social inequality and related topics. This
   exercise has worked well in introductory sociology, social problems, and

AB This paper examines the micro level relationship between women's status

   individual-level variations in women's status of limited importance.
   This study is based on a subset of survey data that collected women's
   status indicators in addition to measures of fertility, education, and
   employment. The analyses show that women's economic autonomy is the
   single-most important indicator of women's status that negatively
   influences reproductive behaviour. However, its impact seems to be
   dependent on socio-economic conditions at the community level. Beyond
   postponing age at marriage, the effect of education on fertility is
   largely insignificant.

   enormous diversity of terms was used to describe the concepts of race
   and ethnicity as variables as well as to describe the categories used to

   between the concepts of race and ethnicity, to state the context in
   which these variables were used, to state the study methods used to
   assess these variables, and to discuss significant study results based
   on race or ethnicity. Continued professional commitment is needed to
   ensure the scientific integrity of race and ethnicity as variables. At a
   minimum, researchers should clearly state the context in which these
   valuable epidemiologic and public health study variables are being used,
   describe the method used to assess and categorize these variables, and

AB Drug testing was used as an adjunct to a general population household
   drug use survey administered via audio computer assisted self-interview.
   Participants, ages 18-40 years residing in Chicago, were recruited to
   participate in three different biological tests (hair, oral fluid, and
   urine) presented in random order subsequent to completing an interview.
   Subjects had the option of participating in zero to three different
   tests. We examined participation/refusal in tests, reaction to testing
   requests, as well as variables associated with participation and
   reaction. Subjects were randomly assigned to a low (US$ 10 per test) or
   high (US$ 20 per test) incentive condition. Over 90% of the sample
   participated in at least one test, usually the oral fluid test.
   Associations between refusal status and two variables, socioeconomic
   status (SES) and presence of children in the household, provided partial
   support for the notion that drug test participation parallels the survey
   response process in general. Incentive level did not directly increase
   drug test participation. Reporting of recent illicit drug use was
   associated with participation in only one procedure, hair testing. Type
   of test offered and individual differences in willingness to be drug
   tested were important predictors of drug test refusal and subject
   reaction to testing requests. Compared with urine and hair testing, oral
   fluid testing had lower refusal rates and was generally more acceptable
   to respondents in a general population survey. The findings support the
   feasibility of incorporating multiple drug tests with modest incentives
   into general population household surveys on drug abuse. (C) 2003

AB The authors examine self-reported emotional experiences of individuals
   in a large probability sample of Americans, using two theories in the
   sociology of emotions as lenses to apprehend social order in emotional
   processes. Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals' positions in a
   three-dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith-Lovin, MacKinnon),
   the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social
   structural, circumstantial, and individual-level variables. Viewing
   emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts
   (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how
   transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and
   other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that
   emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the
   examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find
   that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience,
   structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The
   analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion
   management that may have been overlooked in other studies.

   cohort study design. Rural settlement residents in Leonislandia, Peixoto
   de Azevedo, Mato Grosso, Brazil were followed from September 1996 to
   April 1997. At baseline, an interview and malaria diagnoses were carried
   out and spleen size was measured. Incident cases were detected through
   follow-up visits and laboratory records. Cox regression was used to
   assess risk factors for time to malaria onset. Eighty percent (n = 414)
   of the study population (n = 521) contributed follow-up data. Overall,
   malaria prevalence during any study visit ranged from 0.3% to 5.4% and
   the malaria incidence rate (IR) was 4.49 (95% confidence interval =
   3.66, 5.46) per 100 person-months. The IR of Plasmodium vivax malaria
   was approximately four times higher than the IR for P. fulciparum
   malaria during follow-up. Among individuals who had had malaria during
   his or her lifetime, 14.03% reported hospitalization (median duration =
   3 days) and 70.1 % reported days of work lost (median duration = 4 days
   for P. falciparum malaria and 3 days for P. vivax malaria) related to
   the last malaria episode. No important risk factor was associated with
   the malaria IR. the fact that neither work-related factors nor age was
   associated with the risk of malaria indicates that
   indoor/peri-domiciliary transmission by the local vector is more
   important or as important as workplace-related transmission.

AB We conducted a school-based assessment of the geographic distribution of

   generalized linear mixed models, children attending schools in the

   1.28-12.23) and 23.56 (95% CI = 8.99-61.79) times as likely to be
   infected, respectively, as children attending mountain schools.
   Infection prevalence decreased with increasing altitude, but some local
   foci of infection were detected at higher altitudes. Higher school
   tuition, a marker of socioeconomic status (SES), was not associated with
   decreased infection prevalence. Our results indicate that although the
   force of infection in Leogane Commune is greatest below 70 meters above
   sea level, higher altitude communities are not exempt from infection.
   Lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programs should consider extending
   infection mapping activities to presumed non-LF altitudes. In addition,
   higher SES does not confer protection against W. bancrofti infection.

AB Presumably, Latino women engage in little family planning because of
   religious or cultural objections to contraception. The purpose of this
   study was to examine how acculturation, religion and various demographic
   factors were related to the family-planning behaviors of Latino women in
   the United States. Data were collected on 234 pregnant women (aged 18-40
   years), on their family size, how actively they planned their current
   pregnancy, and how consistently they used contraception in the past.
   Through path analysis, we found that Spanish-speaking women were more
   consistent contraceptive users than their English-speaking counterparts,
   suggesting that acculturation negatively impacts contraceptive use.
   However, Spanish-speaking women with longer US residency were more
   likely to be consistent contraceptive users than Spanish-speaking women
   who had lived in the United States for briefer periods, suggesting a
   positive effect of acculturation. Religiosity and years of education
   were associated with family size, but not contraceptive use. Women who
   were married and had fewer children were more likely to plan their
   current pregnancy, indicating that Latino women take family size and
   marital status into consideration when actively deciding to become
   pregnant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The integration of the social sciences into long-term ecological
   research is an urgent priority. To address this need, a group of social,
   earth, and life scientists associated with the National Science
   Foundation's (NSF) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network have
   articulated a conceptual framework for understanding the human
   dimensions of ecological change for the LTER Network. This framework
   explicitly advocates that what is often divided into "natural" and human
   systems be considered a single, complex social-ecological system (SES).
   In this paper, we propose a list of core social science research areas,
   concepts, and questions; identify the need for multiscale investigatory
   frameworks crucial for implementing integrated research; and suggest
   practical approaches for integration. In sum, this paper is a general
   outline for empirical and cross-site research projects where
   investigators agree that bringing together social, biological, and earth
   scientists can lead to synthetic approaches and a unified understanding
   of the mechanisms regulating SES. Although the motivation for this goal
   is specific to the LTER Network and similar projects, we believe that
   the issues and ideas presented here are widely applicable to other
   interdisciplinary SES studies.

AB During the recent bioterrorism-related outbreaks, inhalational anthrax
   had a 45% mortality in spite of appropriate antimicrobial therapy,
   underscoring the need for better adjuvant therapies. The variable
   latency between exposure and development of disease suggests an
   important role for the host's innate immune response. Alveolar
   macrophages are likely the first immune cells exposed to inhalational
   anthrax, and the interferon (IFN) response of these cells comprises an
   important arm of the host innate immune response to intracellular
   infection with Bacillus anthracis. Furthermore, IFNs have been used as
   immunoadjuvants for treatment of another intracellular pathogen,
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We established a model of B. anthracis
   infection with the Sterne strain (34F(2)) which contains lethal toxin
   (LeTx). 34F(2) was lethal to murine and human macrophages. Treatment
   with IFNs significantly improved cell viability and reduced the number
   of germinated intracellular spores. Infection with 34F(2) failed to
   induce the latent transcription factors signal transducer and activators
   of transcription 1 (STAT1) and ISGF-3, which are central to the IFN
   response. Furthermore, 34F(2) reduced STAT1 activation in response to
   exogenous alpha/beta IFN, suggesting direct inhibition of IFN signaling.
   Even though 34F(2) has LeTx, there was no mitogen-activated protein
   kinase kinase 3 cleavage and p38 was normally induced, suggesting that
   these early effects of B. anthracis infection in macrophages are
   independent of LeTx. These data suggest an important role for both IFNs
   in the control of B. anthracis and the potential benefit of using
   exogenous IFN as an immunoadjuvant therapy.

AB Context Although human rights abuses have been reported in Iraq, the
   full scope of these abuses has not been well documented.
   Objective To assess the prevalence of human rights abuses since 1991 in
   southern Iraq, along with attitudes about women's health and human
   rights and women's rights and roles in society, to inform reconstruction
   and humanitarian assistance efforts in Iraq.
   Design Cross-sectional, randomized survey of Iraqi men and women
   conducted in July 2003 using structured questionnaires.
   Setting Three major cities in 3 of the 9 governorates in southern Iraq.
   Participants A total of 1991 respondents representing 16520 household
   members.
   Main Outcome Measures Respondent demographics, information on human
   rights abuses that occurred among household members since 1991, women's
   health and human rights, opinions regarding women's rights and roles in
   society, and conditions for community health and development.
   Results Respondents were a mean age of 38 years and were mostly of Arab
   ethnicity (99.7% [1976/1982]) and Muslim Shi'a (96.7% [1906/1971]).
   Overall, 47% of those interviewed reported 1 or more of the following
   abuses among themselves and household members since 1991: torture,
   killings, disappearance, forced conscription, beating, gunshot wounds,
   kidnappings, being held hostage, and ear amputation, among others.
   Seventy percent of abuses (408/586) were reputed to have occurred in
   homes. Baath party regime-affiliated groups were identified most often
   (95% [449/475]) as the perpetrators of the abuses; 53% of the abuses
   occurred between 1991 and 1993, following the Shi' a uprising, and
   another 30% between 2000 and the first 6 months of 2003. While the
   majority of men and women expressed support for women's equal
   opportunities for education, freedom of expression, access to health
   care, equality in deciding marriage and the number and spacing of
   children, and participation in community development decisions, there
   was less support among both men and women for women's freedom of
   movement, association with people of their choosing, and rights to
   refuse sex. Half of women and men (54% and 50%, respectively) reported
   agreeing that a man has the right to beat his wife if she disobeys.
   Fifty-three percent of respondents reported that there were reasons to
   restrict educational opportunities for women at the present time and 50%
   reported that there were reasons to restrict work opportunities for
   women at the present time.
   Conclusions Nearly half of participating households in 3 southern cities
   in Iraq reported human rights abuses among household members between
   1991 and 2003. The households surveyed supported a government that will
   protect and promote human rights, including the rights of women.
   However, currently, neither men nor women appear to support a full range
   of women's human rights.

AB Context Physicians are known to have participated in human rights abuses
   in Iraq during Saddam Hussein's Baathist regime, but the nature and
   extent of that participation are not well documented.,
   Objectives To characterize the nature of physician participation inhuman
   rights abuses, identify structural factors that facilitated physician
   participation, and assess approaches for accountability and for
   prevention of future physician participation in abuses.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A self-administered survey in June and
   July, 2003, of a convenience sample of 98 physicians and semistructured
   interviews of hospital directors and physicians in 3 major hospitals
   with general surgical units in 2 cities in southern Iraq.
   Main Outcome Measure Respondent reports of peer and self-participation
   in. human rights abuses in Iraq since 1988.
   Results The majority of participants were male (88% [86/98]) and Shi'a
   Muslims (97% [95/98]). Respondents reported a mean of 6.8 years in
   practice. A total of 71% of respondents (65/91) reported that torture
   was a problem to an extreme extent in Iraq since 1988. The proportion of
   respondents indicating that, since 1988, their physician peers as a
   group were extremely or quite a bit involved in human rights abuses
   included 50% (42/83) for nontherapeutic amputation of ears as a form of
   punishment, 49% (39/ 79) for falsification of medical-legal reports of
   torture, and 32% (25/78) for falsification of death certificates. Fewer
   numbers of respondents (range, n=2 to 6) reported participation in
   abuses themselves. More than half (52% [48/92]) indicated that
   physicians did not willingly participate in these abuses; 93% (52/71)
   reported that the Iraqi paramilitary force Fedayeen Saddam was
   responsible for initiating physician complicity. Fear of harm to oneself
   or family members was a common explanation for complicity. Respondents
   reported that physicians who refused to participate in abuses faced
   consequences including loss of job, imprisonment, torture, and
   disappearance. Respondents reported on preventive measures that should
   be undertaken to prevent physician involvement in future abuses,
   including increasing human rights and ethics education of physicians
   (99% [79/80]), legal provisions to ensure effective monitoring (97%
   [73/75]), punitive sanctions for physicians who commit abuses (96%
   [77/80]), and ensuring the independence of physicians from state
   authorities (95% [76/80]).
   Conclusions Although not generalizable beyond the study participants,
   the findings of this study suggest that among those surveyed, physician
   participation in human rights abuses included falsification of
   medical-legal reports of alleged torture, physical mutilation as a form
   of punishment, and falsification of death certificates. As Iraq
   rebuilds, it is essential that the country address these violations and
   enact measures to prevent physicians from future complicity in human
   rights abuses.

PY 2004
AB Businesses and professions must stay in accord with social ethics, or
   risk losing their autonomy. A major social ethical issue that has
   emerged in the past three decades is the treatment of animals in various
   areas of human use. This point can be illustrated with numerous examples
   across all areas of animal use. These examples reflect society's moral
   concern having outgrown the traditional ethic of animal cruelty that
   began in biblical times and is encoded in the laws of all civilized
   societies. There are five major reasons for this new social concern,
   most importantly, the replacement of husbandry-based agriculture with
   industrial agriculture. This loss of husbandry to industry has
   threatened the traditional fair contract between humans and animals, and
   resulted in significant amounts of animal suffering arising on four
   different fronts. Because such suffering is not occasioned by cruelty, a
   new ethic for animals was required to express social concerns. Since
   ethics proceed from preexisting ethics rather than ex nihilo, society
   has looked to its ethic for humans, appropriately modified, to find
   moral categories applicable to animals. This concept of legally encoded
   rights for animals has emerged as a plausible vehicle for reform. The
   meaning of this ethical movement for animal agriculture is examined.
   Animal agriculture should explore ways to replace the animal husbandry
   lost to industrialization.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate trends in the availability
   of socially marketed condoms in urban Tanzania, and to assess the effect
   of changes in the social marketing programme's strategy for distributing
   condoms to retail outlets. Three retail outlet surveys conducted in
   urban Tanzania in 1996/97, 1998 and 1999 were analysed. Multiple
   Classification Analysis (MCA) was used to determine changes in
   availability of condoms, after adjusting for differences in the
   composition of the samples. Consistent with the changes in the condom
   social marketing distribution system, the proportion of condom outlets
   that were supplied by wholesalers increased from 42% in 1997 to 60% in
   1999. The increasing use of wholesalers allowed sales agents to devote
   more time to opening new outlets. Hence, the percentage of outlets that
   had been solicited to sell condoms by social marketing condom sales
   persons increased from 14% in 1997 to 25% in 1999. Following these
   changes in the distribution system, the percentage of outlets selling
   socially marketed condoms increased from 25% to 32% between 1997 and
   1998, and stabilized at that level. More detailed examination showed
   that availability of socially marketed condoms increased significantly
   in most non-traditional outlets, and in all regions of the country. In
   conclusion, distribution survey data indicate that changes in the
   distribution system increased the role of wholesalers, and enabled sales
   teams to allocate more time to soliciting new condom outlets. Concurrent
   with these changes, the availability of socially marketed condoms in
   non-traditional retail outlets increased significantly. Regular
   monitoring of condom availability can ensure that any emerging supply
   problems are identified and remedied quickly.

AB The aim of this study is to test prevailing assumptions that Guatemalan
   men are authoritative or aloof husbands and, in turn, are either
   problematic or irrelevant to child health. Based on survey data
   collected in 1994-95 about 959 children, this research examines whether,
   how and why husbands were involved in recent episodes of young
   children's illness and sheds light on the potential effect of husband
   involvement on treatment. A relatively high percentage of women reported
   that they asked for advice or assistance from their husbands regarding
   child illness, and, contrary to popular notions, the multivariate
   analyses suggest that husbands' involvement was not driven by their
   household authority. Rather, key determinants of whether husbands gave
   advice or assistance included characteristics of the illness and child
   and the availability of sources of social support, while key
   determinants of what kind of support husbands gave (namely whether they
   gave/bought medicines, recommended a provider visit, or gave other
   advice or assistance) largely related to characteristics of the illness
   and child, as well as the availability of biomedical health care
   providers in the community and ethnicity.

AB Each year in countries like India, thousands of young women are burned
   to death or afflicted with fatal burns. They are victims of dowry
   deaths. The husband and/or in-laws have determined that the dowry, a
   gift given from the daughter's parents to the husband, was inadequate
   and therefore attempt to murder the new bride to make the husband
   available to remarry or to punish the bride and her family.
   Unfortunately, this is a domestic issue that is often ignored or
   minimized, and the prosecution is often inadequate. This review article
   illustrates various scenarios of dowry deaths, investigates different
   predispositions, summarizes the current legislation, and proposes
   solutions to this problem. One hopes that the exposure of this problem

AB This paper presents a new interpretation of a unique Bronze Age (c.
   3000-1100 BCE) Aegean wall painting in the building of Xeste 3 at
   Akrotiri, Thera. Crocus cartwrightianus and its active principle,
   saffron, are the primary subjects at Xeste 3. Several lines of evidence
   suggest that the meaning of these frescoes concerns saffron and healing:
   (1) the unusual degree of visual attention given to the crocus,
   including the variety of methods for display of the stigmas; (2) the
   painted depiction of the line of saffron production from plucking blooms
   to the collection of stigmas; and (3) the sheer number (ninety) of
   medical indications for which saffron has been used from the Bronze Age
   to the present. The Xeste 3 frescoes appear to portray a divinity of
   healing associated with her phytotherapy, saffron. Cultural and
   commercial interconnections between the Therans, the Aegean world, and
   their neighboring civilizations in the early 2nd millennium BCE indicate
   a close network of thematic exchange, but there is no evidence that
   Akrotiri borrowed any of these medicinal (or iconographic)
   representations. The complex production line, the monumental
   illustration of a goddess of medicine with her saffron attribute, and
   this earliest botanically accurate image of an herbal medication are all
   Theran innovations.

AB Objective: Prior studies of quality of life among cardiac patients have
   examined mostly men. This study evaluated gender differences in quality
   of life and examined the degree to which social support was associated
   with quality of life. Methods: A sample of 536 patients (35% women) was
   recruited during a 14-month period from the inpatient cardiology service
   of a University-based hospital. Participants completed assessments at
   baseline and at 3-month intervals over the subsequent 12 months, for a
   total of 5 assessments. Measures at each assessment included quality of
   life [Mental Component Score (MCS) and Physical Component Score (PCS)
   from the Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form 36] and social support
   [Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-Sbort Form]. Results: A total of
   410 patients completed the baseline assessment and at least one
   follow-up, and were included in the data analyses. Linear mixed effects
   modeling of the MCS score revealed a significant effect of gender (p =
   .028) and time (p < .001), as well as a significant interaction of
   gender by social support (p = .009). Modeling of the PCS revealed a
   significant effect of gender (p = .010) and time (p < .001).
   Conclusions: Women with cardiac disease indicated significantly lower
   quality of life than men with cardiac disease over the course of a
   12-month longitudinal follow-up. Social support, especially a sense of
   belonging or companionship, was significantly associated with emotional
   quality of life (MCS) among women. Strategies to increase social support
   may be important for health and well-being of women with cardiac
   disease.

AB Sociologists have produced large, well-known literatures on inequality
   across geographic territory at two ends of the spatial scale continuum,
   within the city and across nation-states. In this paper, I discuss a
   different scale of focus, subnational stratification processes across
   middle-range spatial units, those between the city and nation-state.
   While characterizing much contemporary rural sociological research, this
   approach to spatial inequality does not tend to be seen as a coherent
   tradition that cross-cuts substantive areas. First, I discuss why
   attention to subnational inequality, rural regions, and middle-range
   spatial units are important to social science understanding of
   stratification processes. Second, I provide an overview of contemporary
   research traditions in rural sociology which, taken together, form a
   distinct and innovative approach to spatial inequality. Third, I draw
   from my own work to explain how factors affecting socioeconomic
   inequalities across middle-range territorial units may be conceptualized
   and provide two sets of empirical examples. Finally, I discuss what
   should be done in terms of furthering rural sociology's regional
   approach to spatial inequality.

AB Retail farmers' markets are seen as key institutions in a more "civic
   agriculture," but little is known about how they promote small business
   entrepreneurship. Drawing on research in economic sociology and economic
   geography, this paper examines the role of social learning in vendor
   innovation. Data from a 1999 mail survey of farmers' market vendors in
   California, New York and Iowa show that business innovation, as
   represented by intensity of vendors' innovative marketing practices and
   vendors' successful enterprise expansion, was modest. Social learning
   through engagement with customers contributed to more innovative
   marketing by vendors, while social learning through engagement with
   customers and fellow vendors increased the likelihood of vendors
   diversifying to additional markets beyond the farmers' market. Certain
   individual and enterprise characteristics also influenced vendor
   innovation. This suggests that, although important, the beneficial
   effects of social learning for vendors at farmers' markets remain
   moderated by human capital and structural factors.

AB Sustainable development demands institutions manage the conflicts and
   struggles that inevitably arise over material and ideal interests. While
   current cooperative theory privileges the economic element, a political
   economy of cooperation emphasizes cooperatives' tentative bridging of
   economic and political spheres with a democratic ethos. The
   cooperatives' democratic political structure exists in tension with a
   capitalist economic structure and other sites of friction. These
   contradictions are: in the realm of social relations, between production
   and consumption; in the realm of spatial relations, between the local
   and the global; and in the realm of collective action, between
   cooperatives as both traditional as well as new social movements. Where
   neo-classical economic models seek to eliminate or reduce these
   tensions, political economy views these tensions as functional to
   sustainability by creating an "institutional friction" that facilitates
   innovation, flexibility and long-term adaptability. This political
   economy of cooperation is intended as a step toward the development of a
   multidimensional sociology of cooperation.

PD SPR-SUM 2004
PY 2004
AB Social epidemiology has increasingly looked to psychological factors as
   both risk factors for physical health and mechanisms behind disparities.
   Yet, there has been little resolution to the question of whether
   psychological factors explain disparities, and skepticism has begun to
   mount about whether psychological factors are causally linked to health.
   Furthermore, some have questioned the nature of the relationship: most
   research suggests that psychological factors mediate the relationship
   between socioeconomic status and health, but recent research suggests
   that they moderate the relationship. The present paper attempts to
   provide a more comprehensive appraisal of the current debate. It uses
   four popular psychological factors (i.e., self-esteem, mastery,
   neuroticism, and depressive symptoms), three health outcomes, and a
   nationally representative, three-panel longitudinal survey. The results
   illustrate the promise and limitations of psychological mechanisms. In
   the cross-section, the results provide evidence for substantial
   moderating effects, but these effects disappear entirely when estimated
   prospectively. The results also provide some evidence for mediating
   effects, but these effects are very weak and the prospective effects of
   psychological factors diminish over time and with controls for baseline
   health. Implications for theories of socioeconomic status and health are
   discussed and a more social psychologically sophisticated approach is
   encouraged.

AB Although there have been general social, economic, and environmental
   hypotheses developed to explain the distribution of endangered species
   across the globe, there is a paucity of social science literature
   designed to specify these hypotheses in more detail or test them with
   comparative, national-level data. This study draws on several models
   from environmental sociology to specify conceptually the relationship
   between social and economic factors and rates of endangered mammals and
   birds. Specifically, I developed hypotheses based on neo-Malthusian,
   ecological modernization, treadmill of production, and world-systems
   theory and analyzed data on endangered species, population, land use,
   economic size and growth, energy use, and industrial pollutants from one
   hundred twenty nations. The results support ecological modernization's
   position that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP per
   capita and endangerment rates, but they also indicate that GDP growth is
   associated with a monotonic increase in these rates, thus supporting a
   treadmill of production argument. Yet these relationships vary by
   world-systems position. Endangerment rates in peripheral nations are
   affected more by GDP growth, whereas rates in semiperipheral nations are
   affected more by deforestation, GDP per capita, and growth in energy use
   per capita.

AB Terrorism in its purest form is self-help by organized civilians who
   covertly inflict mass violence on other civilians. Pure sociology
   explains terrorism with its social geometry-its multidimensional
   location and direction in social space. Here I build on the work of
   Senechal de la Roche (1996) and propose the following geometrical model:
   Pure terrorism arises intercollectively and upwardly across long
   distances in multidimensional space. Yet because social distance
   historically corresponded to physical distance, terrorism often lacked
   the physical geometry necessary for its occurrence: physical closeness
   to civilians socially distant enough to attract terrorism. New
   technology has made physical distance increasingly irrelevant, however,
   and terrorism has proliferated. But technology also shrinks the social
   universe and sows the seeds of terrorism's destruction.

AB Shigella remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in developing
   countries, including China. In response, national and international
   researchers are actively working to develop vaccines that will be
   effective against dysentery and diarrhea caused by shigella dysentariae.
   With the growing recognition of the problems associated with sustained
   vaccine acceptance and usage, researchers and policy makers recognize
   the importance of conducting theory-based qualitative research to inform
   vaccine development program efforts. Accordingly we undertook this
   qualitative study involving 81 residents of one of China's rural
   communities with high rates of dysentery. The semi-structured interviews
   suggest that a Western model of behavioral change offered a useful
   research construct. Consistent with the model is the community's strong
   perception of 'response efficacy' of vaccines, particularly in
   comparison with water and sanitation and disease treatment. Residents
   were eager to vaccinate their children despite variable perception of
   disease severity, while they were less consistent in their interest in
   vaccinating adults; this enthusiasm for vaccinating children was
   attributed to China's 'one child per couple' policy. Intervention
   implications are discussed.

AB Urban ecology is increasingly interdisciplinary, with biophysical and
   social scientists joining forces to study how human and built
   environments and processes interact with non-human nature. Humanistic
   disciplines that study high culture and intellectual currents also bear
   upon urban ecology, since cities are not simply aggregates of human and
   non-human factors but seats of civilization and loci of concentrated
   creative energy. The Russian city of St. Petersburg, which Dostoevsky
   called "the most abstract and intentional city in the world," offers an
   example of the way individual acts of intellectual and artistic creation
   affect the energy balance of a city and its interaction with ecological
   forces. Such concentrated creative energy may be a key to making cities
   sustainable, and it should not remain outside the calculus of urban
   ecology.

   Objective To compare patient satisfaction with hemodialysis and
   peritoneal dialysis in a cohort of patients who have recently begun
   dialysis.
   Design and Setting Cross-sectional survey at enrollment in a prospective
   inception cohort study of patients who recently started dialysis at 37
   dialysis centers participating in the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in
   Caring for End-stage Renal Disease (CHOICE) study, a national
   multicenter study of dialysis outcomes, from October 1995 to June 1998.
   Patients Of 736 enrolled incident dialysis patients, 656 (89%) returned
   a satisfaction questionnaire after an average of 7 weeks of dialysis.
   Main Outcome Measure Data collected from a patient-ad ministered
   questionnaire including 3 overall ratings and 20 items rating specific
   aspects of dialysis care.
   Results Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis were much more likely
   than those receiving hemodialysis to give excellent ratings of dialysis
   care overall (85% vs 56%, respectively; relative probability, 1.46 [95%
   confidence interval, 1.31-1.57]) and significantly more likely to give
   excellent ratings for each specific aspect of care rated. The 3 items
   with the greatest differences were in the domain of information provided
   (average of information items: peritoneal dialysis [69% excellent] vs
   hemodialysis [30% excellent]). The smallest differences were in ratings
   of accuracy of information from the nephrologist, response to pain,
   amount of fluid removed, and staff availability in an emergency.
   Adjustment for patient age, race, education, health status, marital
   status, employment status, distance from the center, and time since
   starting dialysis did not reduce the differences between peritoneal
   dialysis and hemodialysis patients.
   Conclusions After several weeks of initiating dialysis, patients
   receiving peritoneal dialysis rated their care higher than those
   receiving hemodialysis. These findings indicate that clinicians should
   give patients more information about the option of peritoneal dialysis.

   conversion rates of MCI to dementia have not been thoroughly

   Mini-Mental State Examination were administered serially among
   well-matched subjects from two clinics located in Xi'an, China and
   Houston, USA. Subtle cognitive impairments were weighed according to MCI
   criteria as defined previously. Subjects with MCI were followed for an
   additional 3 years after their identification. Diagnoses of VaD and DAT
   were made according to established criteria. During screening period, 73
   American and 65 Chinese individuals were identified with MCI. After 3
   years of MCI follow-up, of the 73 American MCI subjects, 35 (47.9%)
   developed DAT and 15 (20.5%) developed VaD. Of the 65 Chinese MCI
   subjects, 12 (18.5%) developed DAT and 19 (29.2%) developed VaD.
   According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, Chinese MCI subjects, despite their
   lower educational level, are 1.7 times less likely to progress to DAT
   and 2.3 times more likely to progress to VaD than American subjects
   within 3 years of MCI being identified (p < 0.01). Data suggest that
   progression rates of MCI vary considerably among subjects from two
   countries. American MCI subjects are more prone to DAT, while Chinese
   subjects are more prone to VaD. Differences in genetic factors,
   cultures, educational levels, and preventive treatments of vascular risk
   factors are proposed as responsible for this uneven geographic
   distribution for different types of dementia.

   random-digit-dial telephone survey was conducted in 1999-2000 with a
   representative sample of the U.S. population aged 18 or older. The
   current analyses uses data from the 2168 respondents who gambled in the
   year before the interview. Gambling measures included the Diagnostic
   Interview Schedule (DIS)-IV for pathological gambling, frequency of 15
   types of gambling, and size of win or loss on the last occasion. Other
   measures included the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption,
   frequency of illicit drug use and criminal offending, and the DIS-IV for
   alcohol and drug abuse and dependence. Results showed that casino
   gambling is associated with a high risk of gambling pathology. Lottery,
   cards, and bingo are associated with a moderately high risk of gambling
   pathology. Participation in a greater number of types of gambling is
   strongly predictive of gambling pathology, even after frequency of
   gambling and size of win or loss are taken into account. Alcohol abuse
   is strongly predictive of gambling pathology, even with gambling
   behaviors held constant. Minority and low socioeconomic status (SES)
   group members have higher levels of gambling pathology than other groups
   after all other factors are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Since the intentional dissemination of anthrax through the US postal
   system in the fall of 2001, there has been increased interest in
   surveillance for detection of biological terrorism. More generally, this
   could be described as the detection of incident disease clusters. In
   addition, the advent of affordable and quick geocoding allows for
   surveillance on a finer spatial scale than has been possible in the
   past. Surveillance for incident clusters of disease in both time and
   space is a relatively undeveloped arena of statistical methodology.
   Surveillance for bioterrorism detection, in particular, raises unique
   issues with methodological relevance. For example, the bioterrorism
   agents of greatest concern cause initial symptoms that may be difficult
   to distinguish from those of naturally occurring disease. In this paper,
   the authors propose a general approach to evaluating whether observed
   counts in relatively small areas are larger than would be expected on
   the basis of a history of naturally occurring disease. They implement
   the approach using generalized linear mixed models. The approach is
   illustrated using data on health-care visits (1996-1999) from a large
   Massachusetts managed care organization/multispecialty practice group in
   the context of syndromic surveillance for anthrax. The authors argue
   that there is great value in using the geographic data.

AB Objective: This study estimates them prevalence of depression and
   describes the correlates and independent associations of distress and
   depression among U.S. men who have sex with men.
   Method: A household-based probability sample of men who have sex with
   men (N = 2,881) was interviewed between 1996 and 1998 in four large
   American cities. With cutoff points of 15 and 22 for the Center for
   Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, individual correlates and
   predictors of distress and depression were examined, and multinomial
   logistic regression was performed.
   Results: The 7-day prevalence of depression in men who have sex with men
   was 17.2%, higher than in adult U.S. men in general. Both distress and
   depression were associated with lack of a domestic partner; not
   identifying as gay, queer, or homosexual; experiencing multiple episodes
   of anti gay violence in the previous 5 years; and very high levels of
   community alienation. Distress was also associated with being of other
   than Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity and experiencing early antigay
   harassment. Depression was also associated with histories of attempted
   suicide, child abuse, and recent sexual dysfunction. Being HIV positive
   was correlated with distress and depression but not significantly when
   demographic characteristics, developmental history, substance use,
   sexual behavior, and current social context were controlled by logistic
   regression.
   Conclusions: Rates of distress and depression are high in men who have
   sex with men. These high rates have important public health
   ramifications. The predictors of distress and depression suggest
   prevention efforts that might be effective when aimed at men who have
   sex with men.

AB In the United States in 1997, the smoking prevalence among blue-collar
   workers was nearly double that among white-collar workers, underscoring
   the need for new approaches to reduce social disparities in tobacco use.
   These inequalities reflect larger structural forces that shape the
   social context of workers' lives.
   Drawing from a range of social and behavioral theories and lessons from
   social epidemiology, we articulate a social-contextual model for
   understanding ways in which socioeconomic position, particularly
   occupation, influences smoking patterns. We present applications of this
   model to worksite-based smoking cessation interventions among
   blue-collar workers and provide empirical support for this model. We
   also propose avenues for future research guided by this model.

AB Objectives. We sought to describe the burden of smoking on the US
   population, using diverse socioeconomic measures.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2000 National Health Interview
   Survey.
   Results. Overall, the prevalence of current smoking was greatest among
   persons in-and independently associated with-working class jobs, low
   educational level, and low income. Attempts to quit showed no
   socioeconomic gradient, while success in quitting was greatest among
   those with the most socioeconomic resources. These patterns held in most
   but not all race/ethnicity-gender groups. Finer resolution of smoking
   patterns was obtained using a relational UK occupational measure,
   compared to the skill-based measure commonly used in US studies.
   Conclusions. Reducing social disparities in smoking requires attention
   to the complexities of class along with race/ethnicity and gender.

AB Store-and-forward telemedicine, using e-mail to send clinical data and
   digital images, offers a low-cost alternative for physicians in
   developing countries to obtain second opinions from specialists. To
   explore the potential usefulness of this technique, 91 chest X-ray
   images were photographed using a digital camera and a view box. Four
   independent readers (three radiologists and one pulmonotogist) read two
   types of digital (JPEG and JPEG2000) and original film images and
   indicated their confidence in the presence of eight features known to be
   radiological indicators of tuberculosis (TB). The results were compared
   to a "gold standard" established by two different radiologists, and
   assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
   There was no statistical difference in the overall performance between
   the readings from the original films and both types of digital images.
   The size of JPEG2000 images was approximately 120KB, making this
   technique feasible for slow internet connections. Our preliminary
   results show the potential usefulness of this technique particularly for
   tuberculosis and lung disease, but further studies are required to
   refine its potential. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB 1. A parataxonomist is a resident, field-based, biodiversity inventory
   specialist who is largely on-the-job trained out of the rural work force
   and makes a career of providing specimens and their natural history
   information to the taxasphere, and therefore to a multitude of users
   across society.
   2. Any large inventory effort will benefit from a team of
   parataxonomists, not only through the large quantity of material and
   information they will gather and process, but through its among-year and
   within-season continuity.
   3. Parataxonomists' accuracy increases substantially with pride of
   workplace ownership, experience, and detail and continuity of iterative
   feedback from users of specimens and information.
   4. Being drawn from the pool of rural workers into activities that are
   normally the privilege of university-educated citizens, parataxonomists
   require continuous mentoring and encouragement to compensate for their
   potential social isolation from their former peer groups and the
   defensive disdain with which they may be treated by more elevated social
   classes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Parataxonomists are a key element in
   setting up wild biodiversity for non-damaging sustainable development,
   not only through finding and making biodiversity available, but also by
   being employed locally by its development. The parataxonomist is to the
   neighbouring forest as both a literate person and a reference librarian
   are to a library.

AB Despite significant efforts in recent years to increase diversity in
   science and academia, African Americans, Hispanics, and American
   Indian/Alaskan Natives remain severely underrepresented in these fields.
   To date, institutional social climate has received little attention as a
   target to improve the representation of these minority groups. In this
   article, we suggest that improvement in the social climate in both
   individual laboratories and larger institutions may lead to better
   recruitment and retention of minorities in science and academia. After
   documenting the magnitude of the underrepresentation problem, we offer a
   framework for a better understanding of climate, illustrate how members
   of majority and minority groups may perceive climate differently, and
   provide specific recommendations for improving the climate. The benefits
   of a diverse workforce in the sciences include a commitment to social
   justice, a broad diversity of perspectives leading to greater
   opportunities for scientific advancement, and a potentially enhanced
   focus on understanding and eliminating the health disparities among
   different racial and ethnic groups.

AB Public opinion plays an important part in the successful development of
   a fisheries management plan. We used a mail questionnaire to survey
   1,400 anglers who fish for muskellunge Esox masquinongy in Wisconsin.
   The survey included defined groups of muskellunge anglers separated by
   muskellunge club affiliation and geographic location and general anglers
   selected from a random sample of angler license sales. The survey
   questions were designed to obtain opinions regarding muskellunge fishery
   and trophy management in Wisconsin in terms of angling behaviors,
   regulation options, and perceived problems. All anglers generally
   preferred fishing with artificial lures and practiced the voluntary live
   release of legal-length muskellunge. Muskellunge anglers considered a
   trophy muskellunge to be at least 40 in long, with a preferred length of
   50 in or longer. Muskellunge anglers also supported regulations for
   muskellunge that were based on a water's biological potential, along
   with increased restrictions on regulations such as minimum length
   limits. General anglers were less supportive of restrictive regulations
   and were more likely to keep a legal muskellunge for consumptive
   purposes. The greatest perceived problems with muskellunge fishing were
   Native American spearing and conflicts with users of speedboats and jet
   skis. Opinion surveys such as this can help in formulating management
   strategies that satisfy most anglers within biological limits.

   these foundations and argues that they have little to do with science
   and its relation to policy may not be as fruitful as the committee
   believes. The so-called bedrocks of science are based on, at best, weak
   premises and an unrigorous understanding of the sociology, history, and
   philosophy of science. There is a nostalgia for a simple and ordered
   universe of science that never was. The resulting models of science
   embody a technological sublime that weaves together the procedures of
   administration and engineering with utopian visions and discourses of
   progress ordered by the expansion of its expertise. Finally, although
   the resulting framework was to relieve educational research of its
   "awful" reputation, the report may reinstitute and reinstantiate those
   very practices.

AB Even in an increasingly polarized climate of global policy-making, the
   ideal of "sustainable development" retains currency across a remarkably
   broad swath of the political spectrum in debating alternative scenarios
   for the future. By adapting Weber's classic categories of value spheres
   and collective rationality, I distinguish contemporary approaches to
   operationalizing the concept of sustainability and elucidate the
   practical implications of each. For some, the social, ecological, and
   economic dimensions of sustainability are synergistic components of a
   single meaningful goal, pursued by either an overarching technique or a
   unifying ethic. In contrast to these unifying models, one may conclude
   that the dimensions of sustainable development invoke values that
   inevitably conflict in any complex social interaction to derive
   strategies for collective action. Framing the concept in such terms, as
   a dialogue of values, highlights the need to adapt social institutions
   to mediate value conflict at different scales, and points to
   opportunities for engaging development debates through applied research
   on comparative governance.

AB This article revisits Hunter's (1991) culture wars thesis and applies it
   to an institutional arena that has received comparatively little
   attention in the culture wars debate-the contemporary American
   workplace. The authors ask to what extent cultural divisions originating
   in four broad cultural domains (i.e., social equality social freedom,
   multiculturalism, and gender equity) permeate. the workplace and impact
   workers' views of the property rights of jobs. That is, do cultural
   values originating in the larger society affect workers' evaluations of
   managerial prerogative to make unilateral decisions in the best
   interests of the firm without regard to workers' claims to their jobs?
   Or conversely, do such cultural values shape workers' sense of job
   entitlement that jobs should be protected in times of changing
   technology, declining demand for a firm's product, or other
   organizational and market imperatives? The authors use data from the
   Indiana Quality of Employment Survey to examine several hypotheses
   surrounding this debate. The results suggest that the relationship
   between cultural values and specific, work-based ideologies are more
   complicated than Hunter's original formulation might suggest; that is,
   there are complex and nonobvious relationships between these four
   domains of American cultural life and workers' views concerning job
   entitlement. These relationships are not significantly mediated by
   organizational and occupational characteristics normally associated with
   workplace attitudes. The results speak to broader debates about the role
   of structure and culture in the sociology of work and the complexity of
   the ideological landscape of American working life.

   chronicity and type of bullying, school climate, familial, demographic,
   and attitudinal factors that influenced victim reporting to anyone
   versus no one, to adults versus no one, and to adults versus peers.
   Logistic regression analyses indicated that reporting increased with the
   chronicity of victimization. Reporting was generally more frequent among
   girls than boys, and among lower grade levels. Students who perceived
   the school climate to be tolerant of bullying, and students who
   described their parents as using coercive discipline were less likely to
   report being bullied. Implications for improving victim reporting of

AB Tested a theoretical model in which social cognitions about aggression
   partially mediated the relation of environmental and emotion regulation
   factors to children's aggressive behavior. An ethnically diverse sample
   of 778 children (57% girls) in grades 4-6 from both urban and suburban
   schools participated. Measures included exposure to aggression
   (seeing/hearing about aggression, victimization), emotion regulation
   (impulsivity, anger control), social cognitions about aggression
   (self-evaluation, self-efficacy, retaliation approval, aggressive
   fantasizing, caring about consequences), and aggressive behavior.
   Results supported the hypothesis that social cognitions mediate the
   relations of exposure to aggression and anger control to aggressive
   behavior. Also, social cognitions about direct and indirect aggression
   differentially predicted the respective behaviors with which they are
   associated. That is, social cognitions about direct aggression were
   mediators of direct aggressive behavior, whereas social cognitions about
   indirect aggression were mediators of indirect aggressive behavior.
   Finally, gender moderated the relations among the variables such that
   for girls, retaliation approval beliefs were a strong mediator, whereas
   for boys, self-evaluation was more important. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Although many studies have examined the relationship between early
   deviant behavior and subsequent life problems among adolescents drawn
   from the general population, such relationships have not been examined
   for youth attending substance abuse treatment. Based on in-depth
   psychosocial assessments conducted with adolescents entering an
   outpatient substance abuse treatment program (N = 193), the current
   study examines individual characteristics, life circumstances, and other
   behavioral and psychological characteristics that are correlated with
   the age at which these youth initiated substance use and criminal
   activity. Early onset of substance use was associated with greater
   levels of family deviance and a variety of problems including school
   adjustment, drug use, criminal involvement, bullying and cruelty to
   people and animals, and involvement in risky sexual activities. In
   contrast, early onset of crime was related only to male gender, early
   onset of substance use, and cruelty to people. Findings suggest that
   treatment providers may need to consider the ages at which their
   adolescent clients initiated substance use given its association with
   illegal activity, other deviant behavior, and precocious and high-risk
   sexual behaviors.

   abuse, 50% reported emotional, 42% physical, and 42% sexual abuse.
   Million Clinical Multiarial Inventory (MCMI-III) scores > 74 provided
   evidence of personality disturbance and scores on Minnesota Multiphasic
   Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) scales measuring somatic complaints,
   depression, anxiety and postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) served as
   covariates. Emotional and physical abuse survivors were at increased
   risk for borderline, masochistic, and avoidant disturbances and
   decreased risk for narcissistic disturbances. Emotional abuse survivors
   were also less likely to be sadistic whereas physical abuse survivors
   were more likely to be paranoid. Sexual abuse survivors were twice as
   likely be antisocial; however, no association was found with borderline
   personality. Finally, an increased prevalence of severe personality
   disturbances was observed among those experiencing multiple types of
   abuse. Childhood trauma predisposes drug-dependent women to develop
   troublesome personality characteristics that are independent of drug
   addiction and other psychological problems associated with childhood
   trauma.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of family
   background and preincarceration socioenvironmental variables on
   three-year post-release drug use for African American and white
   prison-based drug treatment participants in order to explain the
   previously found disparities in rates of three-year post-release drug
   use between the two groups. There were two hypotheses: 1) for both
   groups, family background and preincarceration socioenvironmental
   variables would predict postrelease drug use more strongly than
   sociodemographic characteristics and preincarceration behaviors, and 2)
   the predictors would be different for each group. The sample included
   279 African American and 512 white male treatment participants who were
   supervised by a U.S. probation officer following incarceration. Event
   history analyses were used to model time to first drug use during
   postrelease supervision. The results indicated that none of the family
   background factors or socioenvironmental variables predicted postrelease
   drug use. The variables predictive of drug use for one or both racial
   groups were limited to sociodemographic characteristics and
   preincarceration behaviors such as age at release, prior commitments,
   and preincarceration employment. Yet, there were no significant
   between-group differences for these predictors. The authors concluded
   that future assessment of the effects of socioenvironmental variables on
   postrelease drug use likely requires evaluation of the postrelease
   social environment at the time of release.

   across the United States and the availability of services often needed
   by this client population at these facilities. Data from the National
   Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) were used to
   assess the geographic distribution and the characteristics of facilities
   that offer dual diagnosis treatment programs/groups and to examine the
   other clinical, social, and health services available in these
   facilities. Overall, 49.9% of all U.S. substance abuse treatment
   facilities offered dual diagnosis programs/groups. There were no clear
   regional variations on availability of these services. There were,
   however, clear variations based on facility ownership and treatment
   modality. Facilities owned by the federal, state, and local governments,
   and those offering inpatient treatment were more likely than were other
   facilities to offer dual diagnosis programs/groups. A large proportion
   of facilities with specialized dual diagnosis programs/groups did not
   offer mental, social, or health services often needed by dual diagnosis
   clients. It is concluded that specialized programs for dual diagnosis
   clients are offered in many different substance abuse treatment
   facilities, attesting to the growing recognition of the special needs of
   this group of clients. However, dissemination of comprehensive services
   often needed to meet the special needs of these clients has not kept
   pace with the spread of specialized programs, highlighting the need for
   establishing and implementing standard evidence-based guidelines for
   dual diagnosis treatment programs in these settings.

   from a rural and urban drug court. Study findings indicate that for the
   urban drug court, marital status, employment, drug use, and criminal

   graduation was only predicted by age and juvenile incarceration.
   Findings from this study suggest there are different factors associated

   probability sample of 1972 college students, from the National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth (NLSY79) was interviewed in 1984 and
   reinterviewed again as adults in 1994. The short-term effects of binge
   drinking in college were assessed as well as the extent to which
   experiences of negative effects in college predicted patterns of alcohol
   use across the transition from college into postcollege years. As
   expected, college binge drinkers were comparatively more likely than
   nonbinge drinkers to experience one or more alcohol-related problems
   while in college. In addition, weighted estimates of DSM-IV-defined,
   diagnostic criteria in logistic regression models indicated that the
   binge drinking patterns exhibited during the college years, for some
   former college students of both genders, posed significant risk factors
   for alcohol dependence and abuse 10 years after the initial interview,
   in conjunction with evidence of academic attrition, early departure from
   college and less favorable labor market outcomes.

   and impulsivity significantly increased risk for alcohol problems even
   after controlling for gender and lifetime-use frequency. Impulsivity was
   further examined as a vulnerability factor, potentially enhancing the
   relations between use frequency and problems and affect lability and
   problems. Impulsivity did not moderate the use frequency-problems

AB Objectives. We investigated the relationship between friendships and

   Methods. We analyzed friendship data on 13465 adolescents from the
   National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health to explore the
   relationship between friendship and suicidal ideation and suicide
   attempts. We controlled for known factors associated with suicidality.
   Results. Having had a friend who committed suicide increased the
   likelihood of suicidal ideation and attempts for both boys and girls.
   Socially isolated females were more likely to have suicidal thoughts, as
   were females whose friends were not friends with each other. Among
   adolescents thinking about suicide, suicide attempts appear largely
   stochastic, with few consistent risk factors between boys and girls.
   Conclusions. The friendship environment affects suicidality for both
   boys and girls. Female adolescents' suicidal thoughts are significantly
   increased by social isolation and friendship patterns in which friends
   were not friends with each other. (Am J Public Health. 2004;94:89-95).

AB Recent calls to reintegrate the sciences and humanities are challenged
   by the contemporary work of anatomist Gunther von Hagens and his Body
   Worlds exhibits of plastinated cadavers. The anatomical quest to
   understand our physical interior has long been in tension both with
   aesthetic ideals and religious sensitivities regarding the metaphysical
   significance of the human body. Part I of this two-part Historical Note
   examines tensions epitomized by Goethe's figures of the prosektor and
   proplastiker. The former, driven by scientific curiosity, is willing to
   destroy, even desecrate, the human form to obtain knowledge. The latter
   demurs at such mutilation of our physical body, wondrous even in death -
   seeking instead to rejoin what the prosektor has pulled apart, to
   restore human dignity. In the confrontation between prosektor and
   proplastiker, roles disturbingly fused in the person of von Hagens
   himself, questions arise regarding the authenticity of models as well as
   the appropriate recipients of such mediated yet intimate anatomical
   knowledge. Part II will focus on religious perspectives on the human
   body, variously interpreted as God's handiwork, habitation for the soul,
   and vehicle of resurrection. Consideration also is given to the role of
   anatomist as priest, prophet, and Promethean creator, roles
   self-consciously embraced by von Hagens.

AB At some point in its evolutionary history, our species Homo sapiens
   ceased to be a nonlinguistic, nonsymbolic organism, living in the world
   as presented to it by Nature, and instead began to exist in a world that
   it reconstructs in its own mind. Most scientists since Darwin have been
   content to explain this extraordinary transformation in human
   consciousness by the operation of natural selection. However, the human
   fossil and archaeological records indicate that modern human symbolic
   consciousness is not the culmination of the long trend that natural
   selection would predict. Instead, it shows that major change in the
   human past has been episodic and rare and that, as far as can be
   determined from the archaeological record, the passage from nonsymbolic
   to symbolic cognition is a recent event as well as an unprecedented one.
   So recent, indeed, that it significantly postdates the acquisition of
   modern human anatomy as expressed in skeletal structure. It, thus,
   appears most likely that the biological (neural) capacity underwriting
   the radically new behavioral mode arose as an incidental exaptation in
   the same process that produced the new skeletal structure of Homo
   sapiens, but that it lay unexpressed until it was "discovered" by means
   of a cultural innovation, plausibly the invention of language. As in the
   case of the modern anatomical structure, it appears that the new
   capacity was initially expressed in Africa and that its various
   behavioral potentials were sequentially discovered in a drawn-out
   process that is continuing today. An "accidental" origin of the human
   capacity helps understand why so many human behaviors have proven
   self-destructive and contradictory, a feature of our species that
   reductionist, selection-based scenarios are hard-put to explain.

   circumcision, focusing again on symbolism but especially on highly
   impassioned debates over cultural relativism and human rights, medical
   complications, criticism and imperialism, and female agency versus brute
   patriarchy. What are the moral, political, and scientific obligations of
   anthropology to a cultural practice that is increasingly vilified in
   Western popular culture and jurisprudence? Should anthropology advocate
   eradication, contextualize Western opposition, or critique one's own
   bodily practices? Finally, I critically analyze the growing movement to

AB The discourse of cannibalism, which began in the encounter between
   Europe and the Americas, became a defining feature of the colonial
   experience in the New World, especially in the Pacific. The idea of
   exoticism, like that of the primitive, is also a Western construct
   linked to the exploring/conquering/cataloguing impulse of colonialism.
   We now live in a world where those we once called exotic live among us,
   defining their own identities, precluding our ability to define
   ourselves in opposition to "others" and to represent our own culture as
   universal. This chapter reviews anthropological approaches to
   cannibalism and suggests that we may now be in a position to exorcise
   the stigma associated with the notion of the primitive. If we reflect on
   the reality of cannibal practices among ourselves as well as others, we
   can contribute to dislodging the savage/civilized opposition that was
   once essential to the formation of the modern Western self and Western
   forms of knowledge.

AB According to recent interpretive approaches to the study of children's
   socialization, meaning creation is an active process by which children
   playfully transform and actively resist cultural categories, and where
   language is viewed as social action that helps shape reality (Gaskins et
   al. 1992). Four ways in which children's peer talk establishes and
   maintains peer culture are considered: (a) how children elaborate games
   and codes (and ritualize the basis of inclusion in the peer group)
   through peer talk, (b) how conflict talk functions to elaborate peer
   culture, (c) how identities as peer group phenomena are talked into
   being through peer talk, and (d) how adult culture is resisted through
   peer talk. Agentive goals of children's peer culture, and the role of
   language in achieving them, are discussed in each section. I conclude
   that sociolinguistics gives researchers a way to think about social
   competence as sets of linguistic practices (e.g., positionings,
   voicings, participation framework manipulations) that children enact.

   hypotheses about necessary and sufficient causes, and these procedures
   address the skepticism that mainstream methodologists may hold about
   necessary and sufficient causation. Likewise, new techniques are
   available for analyzing hypotheses that refer to complex temporal
   processes, including path-dependent sequences. In the area of
   descriptive inference, the comparative-historical literature offers
   important tools for concept analysis and for achieving measurement
   validity. Given these contributions, comparative-historical methods
   merit a central place within the general field of social science
   methodology.

AB The sociology of terrorism has been understudied, even though
   considerable literatures on various forms of social conflict and
   violence have been produced over the years. The aim here is to note what
   has been learned about the social origins and dynamics of terrorism in
   order to suggest agendas for future research. Arguably the main foci of
   sociological studies of terrorism should be (a) the social construction
   of terrorism, (b) terrorism as political violence, (c) terrorism as
   communication, (d) organizing terrorism, (e) socializing terrorists, (f)
   social control of terrorism, and (g) theorizing terrorism. For each
   issue, I provide a brief summary of current knowledge, with
   bibliographic leads to more detailed information, as well as identify
   research issues.

AB This paper examines recent work in the sociology of culture devoted to
   providing endogenous explanations of cultural phenomena. The focus is on
   works that provide cultural explanations of cultural processes, as
   opposed to the social structural and "production of culture"
   explanations otherwise predominant in the literature. I examine three
   distinct approaches: a "post-hermeneutic" approach devoted. not to the
   question of cultural interpretation but to the issue of subjects'
   manipulation of culture in the quest for meaning; a semiotic approach
   focused on the mechanics of symbol systems; and an ecological approach
   that emphasizes the role of competition and niche density in explaining
   both cultural stasis and change. The three approaches have in common a
   general lack of interest in traditional conceptions of meaning
   (verstehen), choosing instead to focus on issues related to the internal
   structure and dynamics of cultural expression. This marks a new
   opportunity for synthesis and exploration in a field traditionally
   devoted to extra-cultural explanation of cultural phenomena. Both
   endogenous and exogenous explanations are offered for the rise of this
   new trend in the sociology of culture.

AB Durkheim hypothesized that basic categories of thought an, based on
   society as their model, and that these mental representations arise from
   participation in society's totemic rites. This proposition is evaluated
   in light of recent research on the cognitive architecture of newborns
   and infants. The evidence suggests that presocialized infants possess
   mental representations of not only the physical world but also the minds
   of others and even the sui generis quality of collectivities. This
   review concludes that the Durkheimian theory of the social origin of
   mind has little empirical support and suggests that the sociology of
   mental life needs to be radically retheorized.

AB WHEN ACADEMIC SOCIOLOGY was founded around 1900, the idea of creating an
   economic sociology played an important role in the plans of Durkheim,
   Weber et al. (I). Durkheim, for example, proposed sociologie economique
   as one of the key areas of the new science of sociology, and Weber
   assigned Wirtschaftssoziologie a place of honor in Economy and Society
   (Durkheim [1909] 1978; Weber [1921-1922] 1978, pp. 63-211). The reason
   for the idea that a topic such as economic sociology was needed had much
   to do with the way that economics around this time ignored the role of
   institutions and social relations. The Battle of the Methods, which went
   on around this time, also helped to accentuate the analytical dimension
   of 19(th) century economics and assign its empirical part to the
   historians. In any case, the development of economic sociology after the
   founding generation in sociology was very meager, despite some important
   exceptions by scholars such as Schumpeter, Polanyi and Parsons-Smelser
   (e.g. Swedberg 2003b, PP. 1-31). It was not until the mid-1980s that
   economic sociology again caught the imagination of the sociologists, and
   the so-called "new economic sociology" came into being, primarily as a
   result of the work of people such as Mark Granovetter, Harrison White
   and Viviana Zelizer. It was now suggested that all economic actions are
   "embedded", that markets can be conceptualized as "social structures",
   and that economic actions do not only have a rational component but also
   a social-cultural one (e.g. Granovetter 1985; White 1981; Zelizer 1999).
   These and similar ideas soon led to a flourishing economic sociology,
   and it is primarily the last decade of its accomplishments to which this
   article is devoted.

AB An idea is not a replicator because it does not consist of coded
   self-assembly instructions. It may retain structure as it passes from
   one individual to another, but does not replicate it. The cultural
   replicator is not an idea but an associatively-structured network of
   them that together form an internal model of the world, or worldview. A
   worldview is a primitive, uncoded replicator, like the autocatalytic
   sets of polymers widely believed to be the earliest form of life.
   Primitive replicators generate self-similar structure, but because the
   process happens in a piecemeal manner, through bottom-up interactions
   rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low fidelity, and
   acquired characteristics are inherited. Just as polymers catalyze
   reactions that generate other polymers, the retrieval of an item from
   memory can in turn trigger other items, thus cross- linking memories,
   ideas, and concepts into an integrated conceptual structure. Worldviews
   evolve idea by idea, largely through social exchange. An idea
   participates in the evolution of culture by revealing certain aspects of
   the worldview that generated it, thereby affecting the worldviews of
   those exposed to it. If an idea influences seemingly unrelated fields
   this does not mean that separate cultural lineages are contaminating one
   another, because it is worldviews, not ideas, that are the basic unit of
   cultural evolution.

AB Decades of research have demonstrated that disease risk varies in
   relation to culture. Much of this research has focused on blood
   pressure, given its relative ease of measurement under difficult field
   conditions. Community average blood pressures in more developed,
   industrialized societies are higher than those in less developed,
   traditional societies. These differences can be accounted for only in
   part by differences in body composition and nutrient intake. A portion
   of the difference is accounted for by more direct effects of culture on
   individual behaviour and physiology. This chapter reviews this evidence.
   Approaches to this research have included studies of communities
   differing in exposure to modernizing influences; studies of
   sociocultural stresses generated within the process of social change and
   modernization; and, studies of how individual differences in the ability
   to act on shared cultural models (referred to as 'cultural consonance')
   are associated with disease risk. Clinical implications of these results
   are briefly discussed.

AB Postponing childbearing beyond the teenage years is now adaptive

   disseminate the social control message meant for their youth that
   teenage childbearing has disastrous consequences. Yet, patterns of

   fertility-timing patterns may constitute adaptive practice for African
   American residents of high-poverty urban areas, in no small measure
   because they contend with structural constraints that shorten healthy
   life expectancy. The entrenched cultural interdependence of and social
   inequality between European and African Americans lead African Americans
   to be highly visible and vulnerable targets of moral condemnation for
   their fertility behaviour. This, in turn, sets up African Americans to
   pay a particularly high price politically, psychosocially, and in terms

   Overall, both patients with obsessive compulsive disorder and normal

   intrusive recollections and greater desire to be with loved ones) and a

   scholars have recently challenged the latter portion of this view by
   advocating the development of more interpretive, interactionist
   approaches. However, these scholars' agendas often tend to perpetuate
   the first half of the conventional wisdom. While interactionists (and
   other constructionist scholars) can choose to study inequality in any

   make is to focus on the meanings that inequalities have for people in

AB Because of its ease of dispersal and high lethality, Bacillus anthracis
   is one of the most feared biowarfare agents. A better understanding of
   anthrax pathogenesis is urgently needed to develop new therapies for
   systemic disease that is relatively unresponsive to antibiotics.
   Although experimental evidence has implicated a role for macrophages in
   anthrax pathogenesis, clinical and pathological observations suggest
   that a direct insult to the host vasculature may also be important. Two
   bacterial toxins, lethal toxin and edema toxin, are believed to mediate
   the clinical sequelae of anthrax. Here, I examined whether these toxins
   are directly toxic to endothelial cells, the cell type that lines the
   interior of blood vessels. I show for the first time that lethal toxin
   but not edema toxin reduces the viability of cultured human endothelial
   cells and induces caspase-dependent endothelial apoptosis. In addition,
   this toxicity affects both microvascular and large vessel endothelial
   cells as well as endothelial cells that have differentiated into tubules
   within a type I collagen extracellular matrix. Finally, lethal toxin
   induces cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases in
   endothelial cells and inhibits phosphorylation of ERK p38, and JNK p46.
   Based on the contributions of these pathways to endothelial survival, I
   propose that lethal toxin-mediated cytotoxicity/apoptosis results
   primarily through inhibition of the ERK pathway. I also hypothesize that
   the observed endothelial toxicity contributes to vascular pathology and
   hemorrhage during systemic anthrax.

   cultural construction. More traditional, non-Western cultures may have a
   shortened period of emerging adulthood, or no emerging adulthood at all,

   lead to an earlier transition to adulthood. The purpose of this study
   was to examine emerging adulthood in the Chinese culture, including (1)
   the types of criteria Chinese young people deem necessary for becoming
   an adult, (2) the types of behaviours Chinese emerging adults are
   engaging in, (3) identity-related issues, and (4) other aspects of

   be different than in the United States. Participants in this study were
   207 students at Beijing Normal University located in Beijing, China.
   Results provided evidence to support the notion that emerging adulthood
   is affected by culture. Findings revealed that the majority of Chinese
   college students (1) feel they have reached adult status in their early
   twenties, (2) have culturally specific criteria for adult status, and
   (3) tend to engage in behaviours and have beliefs and values that appear
   to differ from emerging adults in Western cultures.

   using the ASAM Patient Placement Criteria with care actually received
   during the previous 12 months. Overall 531 adults were surveyed with 382
   meeting DSM-IIIR criteria of being in need of treatment or having a
   demand for treatment. Of those with a treatment need, 1.5% met criteria
   for outpatient care, 40.3% intensive outpatient/partial hospitalization
   care, 29.8% medically monitored care and 28.8% managed care levels. In
   contrast, of those receiving treatment (50.5%, 162 persons), almost all
   care received by this cohort was either inpatient or residential based
   (83.6%). Unsheltered homeless persons and those without insurance were
   significantly more likely to report not receiving needed treatment. Lack
   of treatment availability or capacity, expense, and changing one's mind
   while on a wait Est were the most commonly cited reasons for no
   treatment.

AB This paper offers some suggestions on, and encouragement for, how to be
   better at risk communication in times of agricultural crisis. During the
   foot and mouth epizootic, the British public, having no precedent to
   deal with such a rapid and widespread epizootic, no existing rules or
   conventions, and no social or political consensus, was forced to
   confront the facts of a perceived "economic disease.'' Foot and mouth
   appeared as an economic disease because the major push to eradicate it
   was motivated exclusively by trade and economic reasons and not because
   of threats it posed to the lives of human beings and livestock. The
   British public deferred responsibility to their elected officials for a
   speedy end to this non-life threatening viral epizootic. The latter,
   however, did not have a contingency plan in place to tackle such an
   extensive outbreak. The appeal to an existing policy, i.e., mass
   eradication, as the exclusive strategy of containment was a difficult
   pill for the public to swallow well before the end of the 226-day
   ordeal. Public outcry reflected ( in part) serious misgivings about the
   lack of effective communication of risk-informed decisions between
   government agents and all concerned. The government's handling of the
   matter underestimated concerns and values about animal welfare, public
   trust, and the plight of farmers and rural communities. A general loss
   of trust by some segments of the public was exacerbated by perceived
   mismanagement and early fumbles by government agents.
   Public moral uneasiness during the crisis, while perhaps symbolic of
   growing discontent with an already fractured relationship with farmed
   animals and the state of animal farming today, arguably, also reflected
   deep disappointment in government agents to recognize inherently and
   conditionally normative assumptions in their argument as well as
   recognize their narrow conception of risk. Furthermore, broader
   stakeholder participation was clearly missing from the outset,
   especially with respect to the issue of vaccination. A greater
   appreciation for two-way risk communication is suggested for
   science-based public policy in agriculture, followed by suggestions on
   how to be more vigilant in the future.

AB In a study of urban forestry/arboriculture professionals in the United
   States, we found that love of trees and plants was most often listed as
   the reason for women and minorities entering the profession, followed
   closely by love of the outdoors. This order was reversed for white
   males. After enjoyment-related reasons, income/employment potential was
   the most common reason for entering the profession for white males and
   minorities, but it was much less of a motivating factor for women.
   Satisfaction with the urban forestry profession was high and differed
   little among white males, females, and minorities. Satisfaction was
   higher for those in upper management, those with higher income, and
   those who entered the profession for enjoyment rather than income
   potential. Professional motivating factors that could be considered
   "selfless" ranked highest in importance, and "selfish" factors ranked
   lowest. Respondents generally disagreed that discrimination exists in
   the profession, with the level of disagreement varying depending on the
   type of discrimination and the respondents' gender/minority status.

AB Residents of the largest metropolitan areas in the continental United
   States were surveyed about the benefits and problems of trees in urban
   areas. The public rated the social, environmental, and practical
   benefits of trees highly. The ability of trees to shade and cool
   surroundings was the highest-ranked benefit. Their potential to help
   people feel calmer was ranked second highest. Potential problems with
   trees were not considered to be reasons not to use trees. Practical
   problems, such as causing allergies, were bigger concerns than were
   financial issues. People who strongly agreed that trees were important
   to their quality of life rated the benefits of trees more highly than
   people who did not strongly agree. Those who strongly agreed and those
   who did not strongly agree ranked the benefits and problems similarly.
   Responses varied slightly based on demographic factors. For example,
   those who did not strongly agree that trees were important to life
   quality were more likely than expected to be 18 to 21 years old or to
   earn USdollar sign20,000 or less per year. The general public in urban
   areas, not just people who volunteer for tree programs, felt very
   positively toward trees in cities.

AB Researchers in psychology have focused a great deal of attention on the
   potential greater predisposition to achievement among first-born
   children relative to their siblings. Focusing on the United States as an
   example, a time series of the first birth ratio is used to show how the
   changing prevalence of first births relative to higher order births has
   altered the composition of birth cohorts, and the ratio is decomposed
   into four factors. Results show that the ratio increased significantly
   in the 1960s and early 1970s, but changed only slightly in the following
   decades. While more recent birth cohorts are composed of larger
   proportions of first-born children, the majority of children are still
   born as siblings. Contrary to expectations, the primary source of change
   was the proportion childless rather than decreasing higher order birth
   rates.

   effective strategies for reaching out to them. The data were collected
   from a survey with the ENP's staff and volunteers and three focus group
   discussions with professionals working with minority elders and minority
   community leaders. The study participants identified as their perceived
   barriers: the lack of information or misinformation; culturally driven
   reluctance to ask for outside help; fear and distrust of formal systems;
   lack of ethnic menus in the program; discomfort due to cultural
   differences; and inaccessibility and inadequacy of transportation.
   Recommended outreach strategies included: involvement of family members
   in the information dissemination process; establishment of good working
   relationships with community leaders and contact with key older persons;
   diversification of menus and increased use of food enhancements;
   increase in cultural activities/programs in congregate dining centers;
   solicitation of input from current participants; provision of

AB The contributions of current agricultural practices to environmental
   degradation and the social problems facing agricultural regions are well
   known. However, landscape-scale alternatives to current trends have not
   been fully explored nor their potential impacts quantified. To address
   this research need, our interdisciplinary team designed three
   alternative future scenarios for two watersheds in Iowa, USA, and used
   spatially-explicit models to evaluate the potential consequences of
   changes in farmland management. This paper summarizes and integrates the
   results of this interdisciplinary research project into an assessment of
   the designed alternatives intended to improve our understanding of
   landscape ecology in agricultural ecosystems and to inform agricultural
   policy. Scenario futures were digitized into a Geographic Information
   System (GIS), visualized with maps and simulated images, and evaluated
   for multiple endpoints to assess impacts of land use change on water
   quality, social and economic goals, and native flora and fauna. The
   Biodiversity scenario, targeting restoration of indigenous biodiversity,
   ranked higher than the current landscape for all endpoints
   (biodiversity, water quality, farmer preference, and profitability). The
   Biodiversity scenario ranked higher than the Production scenario (which
   focused on profitable agricultural production) in all endpoints but
   profitability, for which the two scenarios scored similarly, and also
   ranked higher than the Water Quality scenario in all endpoints except
   water quality. The Water Quality scenario, which targeted improvement in
   water quality, ranked highest of all landscapes in potential water
   quality and higher than the current landscape and the Production
   scenario in all but profitability. Our results indicate that innovative
   agricultural practices targeting environmental improvements may be
   acceptable to farmers and could substantially reduce the environmental
   impacts of agriculture in this region.

AB OBJECTIVE: To provide national estimates of knowledge about treatments
   available to reduce mother-to-infant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   transmission among U.S. women of childbearing age.
   METHODS: We used data from 55,712 women aged 18 to 44 years who
   responded to questions on antiretroviral treatment in the 2001
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. We obtained the percentage
   of women who correctly answered a question on treatment to prevent
   mother-to-child transmission of HIV and determined factors independently
   associated with such knowledge using a multiple logistic regression
   model.
   RESULTS: Overall, the percentage of women who correctly stated that
   treatment existed to help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV
   was 58.6% (95% confidence interval 57.9, 59.3). In the multiple logistic
   regression model that controlled for sociodemographics, having correct
   knowledge about treatment to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission
   was independently associated with being black, younger age (18-34
   years), college level education, and having been tested for HIV. Current
   pregnancy was not an independent predictor of having knowledge about the
   availability of treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
   CONCLUSION: Among US women of childbearing age, just over one half had
   correct knowledge of effective perinatal HIV prevention strategies.
   Increasing the awareness of these treatments may lead to greater uptake
   of HIV testing among pregnant women. (C) 2004 by The American College of

   Specifically, this article draws upon Gubrium and Holstein's (2001)
   theory of institutional selves, and argues that it is important to
   extend our analytic focus to the rhetorical production of narratives by
   institutions. To illustrate, I analyze how the leading organization for
   female-to-male transsexuals (FTM/transmen) rhetorically produces an
   identity to advance its purposes in transsexual/transgender politics.
   Drawing on Loseke and Cavendish's (2001) approach, I show that the FTM
   newsletter, produced by FTM International, constructs an image of
   FTM/transmen as different from transwomen and marginalized within
   transsexual/transgender politics and in broader society. I close by
   detailing how a focus on the rhetorical production of institutional
   identities contributes to key areas in social movements and might be
   applied in future work.

   management planning in the Canadian province of British Columbia
   represents a unique application of alternative dispute resolution
   theory. Portentous in its scope and inclusivity, this case provides an
   opportunity to evaluate large-scale consensus decision-making processes
   within natural resources planning and management. Qualitative analysis
   of in-depth interviews, conducted from September 1997 to July 1998,
   revealed one overarching theme reflecting important issues and concerns
   to respondents: legitimacy. From respondents' perspectives, a successful
   public planning process must have fair representation, appropriate
   government resources, and be consensus driven-the three components of
   legitimacy. According to respondents, a legitimate planning process is a
   successful one. This observation has important implications for public
   policymakers involved in resource planning and for theorists and
   researchers working in this area as well.

   judicial narratives in appellate cases over the last fifty years in the
   United States, but also expert reports and briefs obtained from
   attorneys in these cases and interviews with judges, attorneys and
   litigants, I investigate the role of judicial narratives in adjudicating
   between competing social scientific claims about sexuality and child
   welfare, constructing expertise, and ultimately deciding what is valid
   knowledge and what is not. I focus specifically on the ways in which
   judges credit and discredit social scientific evidence, experts, and
   knowledge claims. The power of legal actors and particularly judges to
   police the boundaries of knowledge and expertise in the context of the
   custody case and the judicial narrative is complicated by the
   observation that this form of social scientific knowledge is not only
   the object acted upon and shaped by these power dynamics, but is also
   itself a source of power and legitimation.

AB I report on a study of 301 sociologists to determine which concepts,
   topics, and skills they deem most important to cover in the introductory
   course and in the sociology curriculum. Respondents indicated high
   agreement that the list of skills, topics, and concepts adequately
   represented the range of possible items. I use both the raw ratings and
   the results of asking respondents to select their "top five" items.
   Results show strong agreement on core concepts, topics, and skills, with
   both overlaps and differences between results for the introductory
   course and the sociology curriculum. Issues of difference and inequality
   are important for both the introductory course and the curriculum. Core
   concepts are seen as more critical for the introductory course, and
   theory and methods are seen as more critical for the curriculum. Values
   and commitments as well as applied sociology rank lowest for both the
   introductory course and the sociology curriculum. Implications for the
   sociology curriculum as well as for introductory textbooks are
   discussed.

   nature of participation in out-of-class learning for our sociology
   majors? (2) What barriers do students see to engaging in such
   experiences? (3) What supports for involvement do students recognize?
   (4) What are students' overall attitudes about OOCLO? (5) What variables
   are associated with participation in OOCLO? All students from one
   medium-sized, public, Midwestern university who were enrolled in the
   required sociology senior experience course in one academic year were
   given the self-administered questionnaire. Results indicate most
   students participate most frequently in OOCLO that involve low student
   initiative, effort, and commitment. Lack of time is reported as a
   critical barrier to participation. Factors viewed as key supports for
   participation include convenient/spare time, useful and interesting
   activities, no cost, and teacher encouragement. Involvement in OOCLO was
   significantly related to engagement in the discipline and to skipping
   fewer classes. Structural factors were more important for participation
   than were individual characteristics.

AB To increase student engagement and enhance critical thinking and deep

   Web-based discussions of issues in a "Race and Education" senior
   sociology seminar. These Web-based discussions were structured by
   specific questions and discussion roles. Before seminar, Staters posted
   on the course Web site the most important thing they learned from a
   reading, describing what was most difficult, and raising new
   sociological questions. After seminar, Responders replied to the
   questions and difficulties posted and posed further sociological
   questions. Two days later, Integrators synthesized and integrated what
   they had learned that week from others' postings, readings, and seminar
   discussion, and raised further questions. Analysis of student postings
   suggests that students' engagement with the ideas of others increased
   during the semester and their thinking became more complex. This paper
   discusses the processes that contributed to students' learning and
   suggested pedagogical changes. It also raises questions for further
   research.

AB The majority of literature regarding problem-based learning demonstrates
   its usefulness as a teaching technique in the natural sciences
   curriculum. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, the broad
   purpose is to illustrate the application of problem-based learning for
   instructing students about controversial issues in sociology. Within the
   second, more narrowed focus, we describe a class exercise involving the
   recent Vermont Supreme Court decision to legalize civil unions as an
   approach to addressing contemporary debates in sociology pertaining to
   the decline versus transition of the American family social institution.
   This project is developed using a three-pronged pedagogical approach
   involving critical theory, problem-based learning, and information
   literacy. While the technique described in this article is taken from a
   course on the Social History of American Families, the method can be
   modified for a variety of courses including sociology of the family,
   sociology of gender, introduction to sociology, and social problems.

   the general literatures on emotion, the symbolic interactionist

   sentiments and emotional outbursts allows the development of

AB After a vigorous debate in the late 1970s, the sociology of emotion put
   aside most discussion of whether or not the physiological arousal
   associated with emotion labels is differentiated. Since this early
   period, scholars have made great progress on two fronts. First, theories
   about the interrelationship of identity, action and emotion have
   specified a family of new concepts related to emotion. Second, a large
   corpus of research on the physiological correlates of emotional
   experience emerged. In this chapter, we review the well-developed
   control theories of identity and emotion, and focus on the key concepts
   that might relate to different physiological states. We then review the
   general classes of physiological measures, discussing their reliability,
   intrusiveness and other features that might determine their usefulness
   for tracking responses to social interaction. We then offer a highly
   provisional mapping of physiological measures onto the concepts that
   they might potentially measure, given past research about how these
   physiological processes relate to environmental stimuli. While any
   linkage between concepts and measures must be speculative at this point,
   we hope that this review will serve as a stimulus to theoretically
   guided research that begins to assess the validity of these new measures
   for sociological use.

   is due in part to the out-of-state tuition waiver provided to the
   students. Part-time students are a significant part of the program,
   these students have special needs that are different from traditional
   full-time students that must be taken into consideration in program
   planning. A small program provides an attentive atmosphere for students'
   learning, but it also has problems that a larger program would not
   encounter, such as competitiveness, personal conflicts, program
   identity, etc. Despite success in the past, the program is likely to
   merge with other related programs in the university during times of
   budget restrictions.

   widely available to the masses, local charities and municipal
   governments worked feverishly to construct public bathhouses. Reformers,
   including city officials, engineers, physicians, and members of the
   clergy, increased the number of public bath facilities across America
   from a mere six in 1894 to 49 by 1904. The urban poor took tens of
   millions of showers at the turn of the century as a result. What the
   poor may not have realized, however, is that the reformers of the
   Progressive Era had in mind a form of social engineering. Bathing, they
   argued, not only assisted in the containment of disease; it also served
   to instill upper-middle class values of self-respect, morality, and
   citizenship into the life and practice of the poor.

AB In the United States, drug users have dramatically reduced drug-related
   risk behaviors but continue sexual behaviors that place them at risk for
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Successful interventions
   are likely to be those that intervene at multiple levels, yet,
   historically, sexual interventions for drug users have primarily
   addressed only personal factors, such as condom use. Sexual risk arises
   from personal factors ( e. g., perceived vulnerability and protective
   behaviors); interpersonal factors ( e. g., relationship type and a
   partner's risk profile); social factors ( e. g., gender roles and sexual
   mixing patterns among and between networks); and, finally,
   community-level factors ( e. g., access to preventive methods and the
   prevalence of a sexually transmitted pathogen within a network). For
   female drug users, multiple sources of risk plus concurrent drug use
   during sex pose additional prevention challenges that disproportionately
   elevate their risk of sexually acquired HIV infection. New, multimodal
   interventions need to be developed and tested to more effectively
   address the many sources of sexual risk facing female drug users.

AB Since first recognition of the scope of the acquired immunodeficiency
   syndrome epidemic among the drug-using community, substance abuse
   treatment has been viewed as playing an important role in preventing new
   infections. In the past 20 years, many studies have documented
   significantly lower rates of drug use, drug-related risk behaviors, and
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among drug users who
   remain in treatment programs. There is also growing evidence that drug
   detoxification alone is insufficient to provide protection from HIV
   infection. These findings have important implications for users of
   cocaine and noninjection drugs, as well as heroin injectors. Despite
   strong evidence of effectiveness and widespread support for the
   important public health role of drug treatment, its impact has been
   compromised by limited availability and acceptability. The available
   data clearly establish drug abuse treatment as HIV prevention, yet
   without expansion of existing treatment programs and the continued
   development of treatments for addiction to cocaine and other widely used
   stimulants, its public health potential cannot be realized.

   Scientific understanding of MHPs' readiness to provide these services,

   experience, HIV care-related knowledge, and related attitudes among 524
   MHPs employed in three CMHCs and two state psychiatric hospitals in
   central Indiana. The results indicate that both clinical experience and
   subjective readiness to provide HIV care are concentrated among a few
   MHPs - primarily gay, lesbian, or bisexual (g/l/b) staff - within each
   facility. This informal system for organizing HIV care highlights the
   unique contributions g/l/b staff members make both in providing direct
   HIV care and in making sure that HIV-related issues are addressed in
   mental health settings. The implications of g/l/b staff members' "gate

   the interviews, the most common reasons for low attendance were time
   conflicts and enrolling primarily to obtain the monetary incentives
   given for completing research questionnaires. Latent class statistical
   analysis of the full sample identified two subgroups that differed from
   each other in the number of psychosocial problems recently experienced.
   Relative to the 'nondistressed' class, the 'distressed' class members
   had higher probabilities of psychological distress, low incomes, heavy
   substance use, sex for trade, relationship violence, and unstable
   housing. This group had higher HIV/STD risk, but lower intervention
   attendance. Members also had less education and less knowledge about
   HIV/STD. A higher proportion of the distressed group was
   African-American. Study findings suggest that in interventions for women
   at HIV/STD risk, it is not necessarily enough to ensure cultural
   relevance and to provide food, childcare, and transportation. To
   increase retention, interventionists should consider (1) the use of
   strategies to support attendance (such as monetary incentives and
   attention to group process factors) and (2) intervention formats that
   are brief, matched to participants' stage of change,
   population-specific, and/or maximally accessible.

AB Even before the influx of Mexicans, public health officials in Los
   Angeles constructed very sick and very poor tubercular people as an
   illegitimate presence who not only endangered others but also
   represented weakness and failure and imposed intolerable economic
   burdens. The identification of tuberculosis with Mexicans during the
   1920s hardened the perception that they did not belong in Los Angeles.
   Because Mexicans lived and worked in dangerous surroundings, it is
   likely that they bore a very high burden of tuberculosis. Contemporary
   statistics, however, tell us less about the prevalence of disease than
   about the attitudes of health officials. Most were convinced that
   Mexicans had an innate susceptibility to tuberculosis. Concerns about
   the cost of supporting tubercular Mexicans figured prominently in
   efforts to restrict their immigration in the 1920s, and in the
   deportation and repatriation drives of the 1930s.

AB As wolf (Canis lupus) populations recover in Wisconsin (U. S. A.), their
   depredations on livestock, pets, and hunting dogs have increased. We
   used a mail-back survey to assess the tolerance of 535 rural citizens of
   wolves and their preferences regarding the management of "problem"
   wolves. Specifically, we tested whether people who had lost domestic
   animals to wolves or other predators were less tolerant of wolves than
   neighboring residents who had not and whether compensation payments
   improved tolerance of wolves. We assessed tolerance via proxy measures
   related to an individual's preferred wolf population size for Wisconsin
   and the likelihood she or he would shoot a wolf. We also measured
   individuals' approval of lethal control and other wolf-management
   tactics under five conflict scenarios. Multivariate analysis revealed
   that the strongest predictor of tolerance was social group. Bear (Ursus
   americanus) hunters were concerned about losing valuable hounds to
   wolves and were more likely to approve of lethal control and reducing
   the wolf population than were livestock producers, who were more
   concerned than general residents. To a lesser degree, education level,
   experience of loss, and gender were also significant. Livestock
   producers and bear hunters who had been compensated for their losses to
   wolves were not more tolerant than their counterparts who alleged a loss
   but received no compensation. Yet all respondents approved of
   compensation payments as a management strategy. Our results indicate
   that deep-rooted social identity and occupation are more powerful
   predictors of tolerance of wolves than individual encounters with these
   large carnivores.

AB Private landowners manage many rare species' habitats, yet research on
   their responses to species conservation legislation is scarce. To
   address this need, we examined private landowners' responses to the
   listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius preblei)
   as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). We mailed a
   questionnaire designed to measure these responses to a sample of
   landowners. The adjusted response rate was 46% (n = 379). The
   questionnaire asked landowners whether they had managed their land to
   improve the Preble's habitat and to minimize the chance of the Preble's
   living on it. We also asked whether landowners had or would allow a
   survey for the Preble's on their property. We hypothesized that
   landowners would respond to these questions based on their aesthetic
   preferences, economic concerns, information sources, parcel size,
   personal values, recreation activities, residence status, social
   influences, and other factors. Listing the Preble's under the ESA does
   not appear to have enhanced its survival prospects on private land. In
   terms of hectares owned, for example, the efforts of landowners who
   reported they had sought to help the Preble's (25%) were cancelled out
   by the efforts of those who sought to harm it (26%). Moreover, the
   majority of respondents had not or would not allow a biological survey
   (56%), thus preventing the collection of data for conserving the
   species. All eight hypothesized determinants significantly predicted
   responses to the listing when they were considered individually. When
   considered simultaneously, however, only one economic consideration
   (dependence on agriculture), recreation activity (consumptive), and
   social factor (distrusting government), and select information sources
   (conservation and social), and personal values (valuing nature, valuing
   local control, and denying landowner responsibility) remained direct
   determinants. To promote the conservation of rare species by private
   landowners, we recommend communicating information through social
   networks, alleviating landowners' economic concerns, increasing use of
   collaborative processes, and institutionalizing assurances that
   landowners will not be harmed by managing their land to help rare
   species.

AB Ecologists have paid increasing attention to the design of marine
   protected areas (MPAs), and their design advice consistently recommends
   representing all habitat types within MPAs or MPA networks as a means to
   provide protection to all parts of the natural ocean system. Recent
   developments of new habitat-mapping techniques make this advice more
   achievable, but the success of such an approach depends largely on our
   ability to define habitat types in a way that is ecologically relevant.
   We devised and tested the ecological relevance of a set of habitat-type
   definitions through our participation in a stakeholder-driven process to
   design a network of MPAs, focusing on no-take marine reserves in the
   Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, San Andres Archipelago, Colombia. A priori
   definitions of habitat types were ecologically relevant, in that our
   habitat-type definitions corresponded to identifiable and unique
   characteristics in the ecological communities found there. The
   identification of ecological pathways and connectivity among habitats
   also helped in designing ecologically relevant reserve boundaries. Our
   findings contributed to the overall design process, along with our
   summary of other general principles of marine reserve design. Extensive
   stakeholder input provided information concerning the resources and
   their patterns of use. These inputs also contributed to the reserve
   design process. We anticipate success for the Seaflower Biosphere
   Reserve at achieving conservation and social goals because its zoning
   process includes detailed yet flexible scientific advice and the
   participation of stakeholders at every step.

AB Since the late 1970s, cattle raiding with automatic weapons has
   escalated among nomadic herding societies in northern East Africa. We
   examine the impact of AK-47 raiding on the adaptability of Karimojong
   agropastoralists in northern Uganda. Most notably, raiding is linked to
   a loss of population resilience in Karamoja, measured in increased
   mortality of young children and of adult males in their prime
   reproductive years and decreased female fertility. AK-47 raiding has
   acted both directly and indirectly as a Darwinian stressor in this
   population, compromising long-standing adaptive strategies and
   intensifying selection pressure. We briefly discuss similar effects of
   recently altered patterns of raiding among related Turkana pastoralists
   in Kenya. We then consider the process by which this traditional
   cultural institution was modified in the interests of preserving
   cultural identity. We conclude nonetheless that cattle raiding with
   automatic weapons constitutes singularly maladaptive cultural behavior
   in contemporary pastoralist societies. Indeed, it represents the single
   greatest threat to their biobehavioral resilience and ultimately may
   have profound evolutionary costs in terms of pastoralists' survival.

AB Background Social class, as a theoretical framework, represents a
   complementary approach to social stratification by introducing social
   relations of ownership and control over productive assets to the
   analysis of inequalities in economic, political, and cultural resources.
   In this study we examined whether measures of social class were able to
   explain and predict self-reported general and mental health over and
   above measures of social stratification.
   Methods We tested this using the Barcelona Health Interview Survey, a
   cross-sectional survey of 10 000 residents of the city's
   non-institutionalized population in 2000. We used Erik Olin Wright's
   indicators of social class position, based on ownership and control over
   productive assets. As measures of social stratification we used the
   Spanish version of the British Registrar General (BRG) classification,
   and education. Health-related variables included self-perceived health
   and mental health as measured by Goldberg's questionnaire.
   Results Among men, high level managers and supervisors reported better
   health than all other classes, including small business owners.
   Low-level supervisors reported worse mental health than high-level
   managers and non-managerial workers, giving support to Wright's
   contradictory class location hypothesis with regard to mental health.
   Social class indicators were less useful correlates of health and mental
   health among women.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight the potential health consequences of
   social class positions defined by power relations within the labour
   process. They also confirm that social class taps into parts of the
   social variation in health that are not captured by conventional
   measures of social stratification and education.

AB Background The relationship between income inequality and health across
   US states has been challenged recently on grounds that this relationship
   may be confounded by the effect of racial composition, measured as the
   proportion of the state's population who are black.
   Methods Using multilevel statistical models, we examined the association
   between state income inequality and poor self-rated health. The analysis
   was based on the pooled 1995 and 1997 Current Population Surveys,
   comprising 201 221 adults nested within 50 US states.
   Results Controlling for the individual effects of age, sex, race,
   marital status, education, income, health insurance coverage, and
   employment status, we found a significant effect of state income
   inequality on poor self-rated health. For every 0.05-increase in the
   Gini coefficient, the odds ratio (OR) of reporting poor health increased
   by 1.39 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.51). Additionally controlling for the
   proportion of the state population who are black did not explain away
   the effect of income inequality (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.45). While
   being black at the individual level was associated with poorer
   self-rated health, no significant relationship was found between poor
   self-rated health and the proportion of black residents in a state.
   Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that neither race, at the individual
   level, nor racial composition, as measured at the state level, explain
   away the previously reported association between income inequality and
   poorer health status in the US.

AB Background Although a robust association between socioeconomic status
   and health has been shown in past research, the processes that explain
   the connection are not well understood. This paper seeks to advance such
   understanding in two ways, first by attending to the distinction between
   onset of a functional health problem and its progression, and second by
   addressing whether and how education and income relate differently to
   the onset versus progression of functional health problems.
   Methods Data come from the Americans' Changing Lives survey (n = 3617).
   The baseline was conducted in 1986 and outcome status measured in 1994.
   Activity limitations are categorized into none, mild, moderate, severe.
   Onset is defined as having no limitation at origin and a limitation at
   outcome. Progression is defined as limitation of a particular severity
   at origin and improving, staying the same, or getting worse with respect
   to the severity. Multinomial regressions determine transition
   probabilities related to onset and progression.
   Results Those with higher income and education are less likely to
   experience an onset. Only income associates with progression. Those with
   the highest income are most likely to improve and least likely to get
   worse in comparison to those with the lowest income.
   Conclusions Education, being determined early in life and influencing
   psychosocial mechanisms throughout life, may have a greater impact on
   prevention of activity and functional disorders. Income's role may be
   both as a prevention factor and as a mechanism for management of health
   problems.

   stressors predicted deterioration in self-reported health status over
   the 15-month assessment period. Additionally, the association between

AB Rationale. There is a broad range of complex ethical issues in the
   conduct of psychopharmacological drug studies that go beyond the
   question of the ethics of placebo controls. However, our empirical
   knowledge with respect to these issues is very limited. This review,
   although not exhaustive, highlights an array of ethical issues that
   arose from discussions within the NIMH Human Subjects Research Council
   Workgroup. Objectives. To delineate issues in psychopharmacological drug
   studies that require debate and would benefit from research leading to
   the development of empirically-supported guidelines. Methods.
   Information included in this report was drawn from the first author's
   participation as chair of the NIMH Human Subjects Research Council
   Workgroup, guidelines for the ethical conduct of research proposed by
   professional organizations to which the first and third author belong,
   and relevant research literature. Results. We have focused on general
   issues relating to informed consent, research with special populations,
   and long-term treatment studies. Additionally, we raise issues relevant
   to large research-oriented institutions. Conclusions. The essential
   ethical challenge in psychopharmacological trials is to balance risks
   and benefits in the context of the needs and capacities of individual
   research subjects. The IRB system must become evidence-based and not
   rely on unproven assumptions. Specific research studies should be
   undertaken to address many of the issues of informed consent and
   research ethics postulated in this paper.

   a heightened concern for psychiatric researchers. Objectives. We
   examined a post-consent test of comprehension given to older patients
   with psychotic disorders to identify problem areas in the understanding
   of informed consent for research. Methods. One hundred and two
   middle-aged and older outpatients with schizophrenia or related
   psychotic disorders and twenty normal comparison subjects were
   administered a 20-item questionnaire to assess their comprehension of
   consent for a low-risk research protocol after receiving either a
   routine (paper-based) or an enhanced (computerized, structured slideshow
   incorporating greater review) consent procedure. Data on individual
   questions were analyzed. <LF>Results. Patients had more difficulty than
   normal comparison subjects on open-ended questions, including those
   asking about study procedures, time involved, and potential risks and
   benefits. Among patients, the enhanced procedure was associated with
   better performance on questions about potential risks and time required
   than the routine procedure. Conclusions. Problem areas in the
   understanding of informed consent, such as study procedures and
   potential risks and benefits, should be the focus of attempts to improve
   the consent process for patient participants with severe mental illness.
   Research also should be done to clarify how best to assess understanding
   of consent, since the wording of questions likely affects the responses.

AB Rationale. This article is intended to explore how minority status and
   cultural factors affect the participation of subjects in clinical
   psychopharmacology research. Objectives and methods. A literature review
   was performed using key words "clinical psychopharmacology trials",
   "psychiatric ethics" and "minority groups". Major goals of this review
   were to examine current knowledge base and identify existing gaps in
   this fairly new area of psychiatric research.<LF>Results. We found
   extremely few papers addressing the issue directly. Most references to
   minority groups were made peripherally, and many of these were
   extrapolated to psychiatric patients from work done on medical
   populations. We found no empirical studies done in psychiatric
   populations. Conclusions. Systematic, well-designed research studies are
   needed to elucidate how culture, race and ethnicity impact on such
   issues as accrual, retention, informed consent and safeguards against
   the potential exploitation of minority research subjects. On the basis
   of the literature review and our personal experience doing clinical
   research with minority patients, we provide several recommendations and
   specific suggestions to clinical researchers who include minority
   patients in their clinical trials.

TI Rationality, choice, and the religious economy: Individual and

SO REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
VL 45
IS 2
BP 155
EP 171
PD DEC 2003
PY 2003
AB One of the most useful contributions of rational choice theories to the
   sociology of religion has been the concept of the religious economy.
   However, this study argues that the rational choice view of the
   religious economy still suffers from serious shortcomings. Here, I argue
   that the concept of rationality in economic action is more complex than
   rational choice theorists generally recognize. Part of this complexity
   involves the multi-dimensional nature of the concept and part of it
   involves the fact that degrees of rationality in individual actions must
   be understood in relation to collective actions and contexts. One of the
   consequences of the underdeveloped understanding of rationality is that
   theorists have tended to gloss over the processes by which individuals
   and groups make decisions that create demands for specific types of
   religious goods. I attempt to approach these problem by describing the
   dimensions of rationality, by describing the relations between
   rationality at the individual level and at aggregate levels, and by
   providing a schematization to suggest how supply of religious goods and
   demand for them interact at individual and collective levels.

AB Rural sociologists are currently debating the pace and extent of
   industrialization in the dairy sector of the United States. We offer the
   perspective of historical sociology to this debate, arguing that time
   and place significantly determine the outcomes of processes such as
   industrialization. We present an historically-grounded explanation for
   the rise of industrial dairying, which first occurred in Los Angeles
   County. Beginning with the immigration of Dutch dairy farmers to Los
   Angeles (L.A.) in the 1920s, a contingent and sequential
   process-embedded within the local/California political economy-of
   exploding population growth, rapid urbanization, and skyrocketing land
   prices led to repeated geographical relocations and expansions of
   large-scale dairies during the next three decades. We conclude that
   agricultural industrialization is not inevitable but instead is the
   result of contingent factors (cultural and political-economic) as well
   as the particular sequencing of events and processes. In thus
   historicizing the industrialization debate, we seek limited, rather than
   universal, generalizations.

AB Despite their plausibility, political explanations for incarceration
   rates have not been intensely investigated. Centralized democracies that
   reduce public influence by using corporatist methods to resolve disputes
   should have lower incarceration rates, but the opposite should be true
   in decentralized polities with federalist political arrangements where
   mass publics have greater control over punishment. Threat hypotheses are
   assessed by examining the effects of minority presence and economic
   inequality. This study uses a panel design to examine these effects on
   imprisonment rates in 13 of the most progressive democracies from 1970
   to 1995. With the murder or overall crime rates, social disorganization,
   and additional indicators held constant, the presence of corporatist and
   federalist political arrangements explain cross-national differences in
   incarceration rates. The evidence suggests that internal racial or
   ethnic threat produces larger imprisonment rates as well. The findings
   indicate that a well-developed comparative political sociology of
   punishment should help us understand contrasts in the proportion of the
   population that is incarcerated in advanced democracies.

AB In an effort to explain pro-environmental behavior, environmental
   sociologists often study environmental attitudes. While much of this
   work is atheoretical, the focus on attitudes suggests that researchers
   are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present
   research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by
   drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally responsive
   behavior. We develop an environment identity model of environmental
   behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment
   identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment
   identity and commitment to the environment identity,. We examine the
   identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion
   of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal
   that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally
   responsive behavior, but this agency is largely through identity
   processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important
   theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental
   sociology.

AB Traditionally, African Americans have registered lower rates of suicide
   than other ethnic groups. In the last 20 years this pattern has changed,
   particularly among young African Americans. To date, the research
   conducted regarding this phenomenon has been limited for a variety of
   reasons and previous research has been inconclusive in determining risk
   factors of African American suicide. The purpose of this paper is to
   identify risk and protective factors specific to African American
   suicide. To determine the factors, the 1993 National Mortality
   Follow-back Survey was analyzed. The risk factors identified include
   being under age 35, southern and northeastern residence, cocaine use,
   firearm presence in home, and threatening others with violence. Some of
   the. protective factors associated with African American suicide include
   rural residence and educational attainment. These results provide
   valuable information about completed African American suicides in
   relation to Whites. Several of these factors are unique to African
   Americans.

AB By the late 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu had become the primary public
   intellectual of major social scientific status at the head of the
   anti-globalization movement that emerged in France and in other Western
   European countries. This article discusses how Bourdieu became a leading
   public intellectual, a role that seems to contrast with his early years
   as a professional sociologist. It explores what seemed to change in
   Bourdieu's activities and outlook as sociologist and what seems to have
   remained constant. It identifies several institutional conditions that
   seemed necessary for Bourdieu to be able to play the kind of public
   intellectual role he did in his later years. Bourdieu's movement from a
   peripheral position to a central location in the French intellectual
   field, the changing character of the field itself, the growing influence
   of the mass media in French political and cultural life, the failures of
   the French Socialists in power, a cultural legacy of leading critical
   intellectuals in France, a unifying national issue of globalization, and
   the political conjuncture in 1995 all intersected in ways that opened a
   path for Bourdieu to choose new and more frequent forms of political
   action. His responses to that combination of factors at different
   moments reveal both a striking continuity in desire to preserve the
   autonomy of intellectual life and a change in view and strategy on how
   best to do that. The article concludes with a brief evaluation of
   Bourdieu's public intellectual role.

AB I offer a critical analysis of a view that has become a dominant aspect
   of recent thought on the relationship between evolution and morality,
   and propose an alternative. An ingredient in Michael Ruse's 'error
   theory' (Ruse 1995) is that belief in moral (prescriptive, universal,
   and nonsubjective) guidelines arose in humans because such belief
   results in the performance of adaptive cooperative behaviors. This
   statement relies on two particular connections: between ostensible and
   intentional types of altruism, and between intentional altruism and
   morality. The latter connection is problematic because it makes morality
   redundant, its role having already been fulfilled by the psychological
   dispositions that constitute intentional altruism. Both behavioral
   ecology and moral psychology support this criticism, and neither human
   behavioral flexibility nor the self-regard/other-regard distinction can
   provide a defense of the error theory. I conclude that morality did not
   evolve to curb rampant selfishness; instead, the evolutionarily recent
   'universal law' aspect of morality may function to update behavioral
   strategies which were adaptive in the paleolithic environment of our
   ancestors (to which our psychological dispositions are best adapted), by
   means of norms more appropriate to our novel social environment.

   means something quite different by the claim, and each claim, when

   withstand scrutiny. It is possible that none of these critics believes
   the "death" claim, but continue repeating it because it has become a

AB Background: Botswana has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world,
   estimated at 36% among the population aged 15-49 years. To improve
   antiretroviral (ARV) treatment delivery, we conducted a cross-sectional
   study of the social, cultural, and structural determinants of treatment
   adherence.
   Methods: We used both qualitative and quantitative research
   methodologies, including questionnaires and interviews with patients
   receiving ARV treatment and their health care providers to elicit
   principal barriers to adherence. Patient report and provider estimate of
   adherence (greater than or equal to95% doses) were the primary outcomes.
   Results: One hundred nine patients and 60 health care providers were
   interviewed between January and July 2000; 54% of patients were adherent
   by self-report, while 56% were adherent by provider assessment. Observed
   agreement between patients and providers was 68%. Principal barriers to
   adherence included financial constraints (44%), stigma (15%),
   travel/migration (10%), and side effects (9%). On the basis of logistic
   regression, if cost were removed as a barrier, adherence is predicted to
   increase from 54% to 74%.
   Conclusions: ARV adherence rates in this study were comparable with
   those seen in developed countries. As elsewhere, health care providers
   in Botswana were often unable to identify which patients adhere to their
   ARV regimens. The cost of ARV therapy was the most significant barrier
   to adherence.

AB In this paper, I argue that there may be common ground shared by animal
   science and its critics insofar as animal scientists seek improvement in
   their field in four areas: the quality of their products, the quality of
   life for those who make their livelihood in food production, the fair
   treatment of human workers, and the humane treatment of animals. I also
   propose that there are fundamental differences between improvement
   motivated by profit and improvement motivated by ethical values.
   Positive moral change is sometimes revolutionary, although it is often a
   matter of promoting positive incremental changes and keeping one's
   attention on the effects of actions and attitudes. In conclusion, I
   suggest that in animal agriculture, positive change can be brought about
   by "getting closer" to the objects of scientific research, including
   nonhuman animals, by paying more attention to their welfare.

AB People who work in the animal industries are faced with questions and
   criticisms about a variety of contentious issues, including animal
   management practices, ethics, diversity in animal agriculture, and
   animal welfare. Formulating responses to these questions requires a
   critical evaluation of our own work and open discussion of these
   controversial issues. Effective debate on these issues can be
   accomplished only with input from philosophers and social scientists
   skilled in such discussions, in addition to animal scientists.
   Therefore, animal scientists must engage in discussions of controversial
   issues among themselves and with entities outside agriculture.
   Furthermore, we must accept responsibility for the application of
   research results and any potential negative consequences. Because
   society is increasingly concerned with issues of animal welfare and the
   effects of new technologies, we should increase communications and
   transparency with the public. Increased diversity of race and gender
   will increase the ability of animal agriculture to connect with our
   stakeholders and to communicate the relevance of our work to society.
   Animal scientists need a professional ethic that espouses a higher level
   of understanding and commitment to philosophical discussions of
   contentious issues.

   psychology, and gender studies focuses on three dialectical issues:
   nature versus culture, similarity, versus difference, and stability
   versus fluidity. Deconstructing gender theories from a postmodern
   feminist perspective, the authors discuss agency and context in
   families' gender discourse. Narrative excerpts from interviews with an
   adolescent daughter and her mother illustrate three emergent themes in
   the social construction of gender: body, identity, and sexuality. The

   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in inner-city adolescent
   girls. One hundred four adolescents who obtained medical care at a
   hospital-based adolescent clinic were systematically surveyed for trauma
   exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and substance use. A subset (N
   = 54, 52%) of girls completed a semistructured psychiatric diagnostic
   interview (K-SADS-PL) to ascertain timing of PTSD symptoms relative to
   substance use. Compared with traumatized girls without PTSD, girls with
   full and partial PTSD were significantly more likely to use nicotine,
   marijuana, and/or alcohol on a regular basis. Fifteen girls met criteria
   for both PTSD and a substance-use disorder. For 80% of these girls, the
   age of onset of PTSD was either before or concurrent with the onset of
   their substance-use disorder. Inner-city adolescent girls with PTSD
   exhibit problematic substance use and may be at high risk of developing
   a comorbid substance-use disorder.

AB Data on discharge diagnoses was obtained from a state-supported mental
   hospital located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States for the
   years 1975 through 1999. Results indicated that frequencies of diagnosis
   of major mental disorders changed significantly during this interval,
   with reciprocal changes between schizo-affective and affective disorders
   and schizophrenia. Percentages of total discharge diagnoses of major
   affective disorders increased threefold, diagnoses of schizoaffective
   disorders increased fivefold, and schizophrenia diagnoses decreased
   threefold during the interval of study. Several of these trends were
   contemporaneous with changes in successive editions of the Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Additional factors that may
   have contributed to changes in diagnostic rates include increased access
   to disability payments, changes in third-party payment policies and
   institutional funding priorities, access to improved medications,
   paradigm shifts, and changes in actual incidence of the disorders.
   Consistent with changed social policies, length of stay decreased for

AB Objective: The present analysis is an attempt to examine the
   characteristics of bars in which violence occurs while accounting for
   the personalities of the clientele that frequent the bar. It is proposed
   that an explanation of why violence occurs at certain bars requires
   examining the characteristics of the bars, the personalities of the
   clientele, and how these two types of variables act together in order to
   give rise to aggressive behavior. Method: We conducted interviews with
   frequent bar patrons (n = 327), assessing participants on a number of
   individual differences related to aggression and drinking behavior as
   well as on characteristics of the usual bar that they attend. Bars were
   categorized into violent bars (n = 256) or nonviolent bars (n = 71)
   based on participant responses. Results: Participants' age, alcohol
   dependence and anger expression differentiated those who frequented
   violent bars from those who frequented nonviolent bars. The relationship
   of these individual differences to bar type was mediated by a number of
   characteristics of the bar itself, including noise, temperature, the
   presence of bouncers, the gender of the workers, the presence of
   billiards and illegal activities in the bar. Conclusions: The results
   indicate that individuals having certain personality characteristics are
   attracted to bar environments that promote antinormative behaviors such
   as violence. However, it seems to be the characteristics of the bars
   that are the strongest predictors of violence.

   successfully battled for over 20 years by a diverse collection of

   has changed frequently, engineering plans have been modified, and
   political maneuvering has taken place. This research is based on 25
   interviews with persons close to this dispute and on fieldwork in the
   affected area. Using a social constructionist perspective, this research
   shows that ITECH, as a resource mobilization tool, has enabled an
   effective educational campaign, rapid and efficient communication of
   information, networking and pooling of membership skills, recruitment,
   and fund-raising activities. It is suggested that other grass-roots

AB Robert Merton presented two, not always clearly differentiated theories
   in his seminal explorations on the social-structure-and-anomie paradigm:
   a strain theory and an anomie theory. A one-sided focus on Merton's
   strain theory in the secondary literature has unnecessarily restricted
   the power and effectiveness of Merton's anomie theory. For although
   structural strain is one way to explain why deviance occurs in the
   context of anomie, it is not the only way. We contend that scholars who
   are critical of strain theory should not automatically discard Merton's
   anomie theory, because the perspective of anomie is compatible with
   several other theories of crime and delinquency. Offering examples of
   previous integration efforts, we maintain that Merton's theoretical
   model can benefit from the input of other theories of crime and deviance
   as much as these other theoretical perspectives can fine-tune their
   models and explanations.

AB Background. Several transplant centers have begun to accept kidneys
   donated by altruistic living strangers. Many of these centers insist
   that such donations be nondirected, meaning that the donors may not
   choose their recipients. On the other hand, some authors have argued
   that anonymous donors should be allowed to select their recipients. This
   study was designed to explore public attitudes toward this issue.
   Methods. Two telephone surveys of US adults, each including more than
   1,000 participants, were conducted. The first asked about the general
   acceptability of allowing altruistic strangers to direct donations, the
   willingness to donate a kidney to a stranger, and the impact of
   permitting directed donation on willingness to give. The second survey
   asked about the acceptability of directed donation to members of
   specific groups.
   Results. About one quarter of the respondents said they would donate a
   kidney to a stranger for free, and the vast majority of them would
   donate even if they could not choose their recipients. Two thirds would
   not allow anonymous kidney donors to direct their gifts to a member of a
   specific racial or religious group, but three quarters would support
   kidney donations directed to children.
   Conclusions. These data support the current policy of several transplant
   centers that people who wish to donate a kidney to a stranger are not
   permitted to choose their recipients on the basis of membership in a
   racial or religious group. On the other hand, theoretical considerations
   and the results of this study suggest that people who wish to donate a
   kidney only to an unknown child should be permitted to do so.

   differences exist in the sociodemographic characteristics between
   counties with high or low utilization of the regional poison control
   center (PCC. The goal was to generate hypotheses about the potential
   reasons for the variances in the utilization rates by different
   subpopulations, in order to develop culturally sensitive educational and
   preventive strategies in an effort to enhance the use of PCC services.
   Data from the NJPIES 2002 computerized medical records were analyzed to
   estimate the utilization rates (number of calls to NINES per 1000 of
   population) for each county in New Jersey. This information was then
   combined with county sociodemographic data from the 2000 U.S. Census.
   Sociodemographic characteristics were compared between the counties with
   high and low utilization rates and statistically significant differences
   were found. Counties with low utilization of PCC had significantly
   higher population density per square mile, smaller proportion of White
   residents, larger proportion of residents of "other race," and larger
   proportion of Black, Asian, and Hispanic and Latino residents. Further
   study is needed to examine the underlying reasons for the
   underutilization of PCC among such populations and to explore methods
   for improving their awareness and use of the services provided by PCC.

   (downward mobility from familial liability to mental illness) are
   competing theories about the origins of mental illness.
   Objective To test the role of social selection vs social causation of
   childhood psychopathology using a natural experiment.
   Design Quasi-experimental, longitudinal study.
   Population and Setting A representative population sample of 1420 rural
   children aged 9 to 13 years at intake were given annual psychiatric
   assessments for 8 years (1993-2000). One quarter of the sample were
   American Indian, and the remaining were predominantly white. Halfway
   through the study, a casino opening on the Indian reservation gave every
   American Indian an income supplement that increased annually. This
   increase moved 14% of study families out of poverty, while 53% remained
   poor, and 32% were never poor. Incomes of non-Indian families were
   unaffected.
   Main Outcome Measures Levels of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, psychiatric symptoms in the
   never-poor, persistently poor, and ex-poor children were compared for
   the 4 years before and after the casino opened.
   Results Before the casino opened, the persistently poor and ex-poor
   children had more psychiatric symptoms (4.38 and 4.28, respectively)
   than the never-poor children (2.75), but after the opening levels among
   the ex-poor fell to those of the never-poor children, while levels among
   those who were persistently poor remained high (odds ratio, 1.50; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.08-2.09; and odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence
   interval, 0.77-1.07, respectively). The effect was specific to symptoms
   of conduct and oppositional defiant disorders. Anxiety and depression
   symptoms were unaffected. Similar results were found in non-Indian
   children whose families moved out of poverty during the same period.
   Conclusions An income intervention that moved families out of poverty
   for reasons that cannot be ascribed to family characteristics had a
   major effect on some types of children's psychiatric disorders, but not
   on others. Results support a social causation explanation for conduct
   and oppositional disorder, but not for anxiety or depression.

AB Background: Patients at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center
   frequently voice concern that air exposure during lung cancer surgery
   might cause tumor spread. Several African-American patients asserted
   that this belief was common in the African-American community.. I.
   Objective: To assess the prevalence of the belief that air exposure
   during lung cancer surgery might cause tumor spread and gauge the
   influence of this belief on the willingness of African-American and
   white patients to have lung cancer surgery.
   Design: Prospective questionnaire survey.
   Setting: Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of
   Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles Veterans Affairs
   Medical Center, Los Angeles, California; and Medical University of South
   Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina.
   Patients: 626 consecutive patients in pulmonary and lung cancer clinics.
   Results: 38% of patients (61% of whom were African American and 29% of
   whom were white) stated that they believe air exposure at surgery causes
   tumor spread. The most significant predictor of belief was
   African-American race (odds ratio, 3.5 [95% Cl, 1.9 to 6.5]), even after
   controlling for other relevant variables in a multivariable analysis.
   Nineteen percent of African Americans stated that this belief was a
   reason for opposing surgery, and 14% would not accept their physicians'
   assertion that the belief is false. These rates were also statistically
   significantly higher among African-American than white patients.
   Conclusions: Belief in accelerated tumor spread at surgery is prevalent
   among general pulmonary outpatients and lung cancer clinic patients
   facing lung surgery, particularly among African-American patients. Our
   findings may pertain to key racial disparities in lung cancer surgery
   and survival rates and suggest that culturally sensitive physician
   training or outreach programs directed at disparate beliefs and
   attitudes may help to address racial discrepancies in health care
   outcomes.

AB Given the low mortality and morbidity of the severe acute respiratory
   syndrome (SARS) compared with other public health scourges, is the
   attention devoted to it misdirected? The SARS experience has provided at
   least 4 enduring lessons. First, by providing a test of the capacity of
   each part of the public health system, from national to local and
   hospital responses, it has better prepared the world for the anticipated
   and much-feared next real pandemic. Second, SARS has reemphasized that
   from housing, sexual practices, and slaughtering techniques to health
   care capacity, the situation in other, especially developing, countries
   affects us. Global cooperation is necessary not only for justice but to
   ensure our own health. Third, despite trends toward commercialization,
   easier lives, and self-centered individualism, the response of health
   care professionals to SARS reaffirmed dedication to caring for the sick
   even at great personal risks as the core ethical principle of medicine.
   Finally, SARS also emphasized the importance of the duty of health care
   administrators and senior physicians to rapidly institute procedures to
   maximize the safety of frontline physicians and nurses. These lessons
   will be valuable far beyond the SARS episode.

AB Caring for patients involves empathic listening and awareness of the
   needs and feelings of the patient as well as our own; the acceptance of
   the fallibilities of medicine and ourselves. Too often we lead
   unbalanced lives in terms of work, relationships, play and personal
   time. We frequently strive for perfection, deny our needs and feelings,
   assume total responsibility for the patient, and are altruistic to the
   point of self-denial. Caring for patients without adequately caring for
   ourselves is frequently associated with subconscious needs for external
   validation. The hidden agenda may be harmful to the patient and the
   physician. Change requires self-awareness and recognition of the overt
   and covert benefits and risk of our current work patterns. Often there
   is a need to reexamine our life priorities, set limits at work, admit
   vulnerability, share our emotional lives, and appreciate the small
   things in our daily life that give us meaning and purpose. ((C) 2003 by

AB Background: The myths of aging provide a partial explanation for why
   older people have not been primary targets for health promotion and
   disease-prevention programs. Accelerated population aging signals an
   urgent need for increased attention to health promotion and
   disease-prevention interventions across the entire life course.
   Objective: The purpose of this article is to review what is known about:
   (1) the prevalence and nature of ageist stereotypes; (2) the varied ways
   in which ageist stereotypes are harmful to health, functioning, and
   well-being; and (3) strategies for effective communication with older
   adults around lifestyle issues, with particular emphasis on physical
   activity.
   Method: This article reviews literature on current myths and reality of
   aging in the context of designing health promotion programs for older
   adults. Strategies for combating ageist stereotypes are based on a
   multilevel view of determinants of health and aging.
   Conclusions: Ageist stereotypes are pervasive in U.S. society and
   harmful to older adults' psychological well-being, physical and
   cognitive functioning, and survival. Concrete strategies for
   communicating with older adults can increase the effectiveness of health
   promotion programs. Strategies for combating ageism and creating a
   healthier society must address all segments of society, and include
   educational and media campaigns, an expansion of current research foci,
   greater sensitivity from care providers, more opportunities for
   intergenerational linkages, the design of productive roles for older
   adults, a retrofit of the built environment, and intensified and
   collaborative action from both the public and private sectors.

AB This paper explores the ethnographic technique of the focused
   revisit-rare in sociology but common in anthropology-when an
   ethnographer returns to the site of a previous study. Discrepancies
   between earlier and later accounts can be attributed to differences in:
   (1) the relation of observer to participant, (2) theory brought to the
   field by the ethnographer (3) internal processes within the field site
   itself or (4) forces external to the field site. Focused revisits tend
   to settle on one or another of these four explanations, giving rise to
   four types of focused revisits. Using examples, the limits of each type
   of focused revisit are explored with a view to developing a reflexive
   ethnography that combines all four approaches. The principles of the
   focused revisit are then extended to rolling, punctuated, heuristic,
   archeological, and valedictory revisits. In centering attention on
   ethnography-as-revisit sociologists directly confront the dilemmas of
   participating in the world they study-a world that undergoes (real)
   historical change that can only be grasped using a (constructed)
   theoretical lens.

AB PURPOSE: To determine whether neighborhood characteristics are
   associated with self-rated health in older Mexican Americans.
   METHODS: Epidemiologic data on 3050 older Mexican Americans residing in
   the southwestern United States during 1993 and 1994 were merged with
   1990 LIS Census data. All subjects were matched to one of 210 census
   tracts (neighborhoods). Multilevel ordinal logit models were used to
   examine relationships between self-rated health and individual and
   neighborhood-level variables.
   RESULTS: After adjusting for individual characteristics, older Mexican
   Americans were more likely to rate their health poorer if they lived in
   neighborhoods that were economically disadvantaged, less populated by
   other Hispanics, or located within 50 miles of the US-Mexico border. In
   addition, residence in a border community moderated the relationship
   between self-rated health and neighborhood economic disadvantage. The
   effect of neighborhood economic disadvantage on poorer self-rated health
   was two to three times stronger for subjects living near the border
   region than subjects living further away from the border.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of considering
   several dimensions of neighborhood context, especially for Mexican
   Americans. Residence in a border community and neighborhood economic
   disadvantage were important predictors of poorer self-rated health
   status. In addition, older Mexican Americans experience a health benefit
   from living in neighborhoods populated with other Hispanics. (C) 2003

AB Before the 1980s, coral reefs were considered relatively stable and
   healthy in Kuna-Yala, Caribbean Panama. During the 1980s, however,
   several natural disturbances changed the reef's community structure. We
   evaluated historical changes in coral cover and for the first time
   provide quantitative evidence of a large-scale process of reef
   degradation. This process started long before the onset of these
   disturbances as a result of demographic growth and the traditional
   practices of the Kuna people. Living coral cover declined 79% in 30
   years (1970-2001) while the indigenous population increased 62%. We
   measured 20 km of seawall built with mined reef corals (16,000 m 3) and
   an increase in island surface area of 6.23 ha caused by coral land
   filling. Consequently, coastal erosion has increased as a result of the
   lack of a protective natural barrier and a 2.0 cm/year local increase in
   sea level. Coral-mining and land-filling practices to accommodate
   population expansion and mismanagement of resources have significantly
   modified the reef ecosystem and will have serious long-term
   consequences. We propose eight priority conservation areas within the
   Indian reserve, based on reef conservation status. The Kuna people and
   their leaders are considering a cultural change, which may include a
   gradual and organized migration to the mainland, and have optimistically
   accepted our results.

AB One of the most controversial aspects of federal and state policies
   aimed at protecting old-growth ecosystems is the potential effect of job
   losses on local economic conditions. A fundamental question for
   historically forest-dependent areas is whether these policies will
   result in local economic stagnation and enduring pockets of poverty.
   This study uses monthly, multicounty time series data to estimate a
   vector autoregressive model of the experience of northern California
   counties during the 1980s and 1990s. It examines the long-run impact of
   changes in timber-related employment on other employment and
   participation in major federal poverty programs. It finds that
   employment base-multiplier effects of timber employment on other county
   employment are small and state economic conditions rather than local
   employment conditions are the principal driver behind local poverty.

   attorneys. Like the general population of African American women,
   respondents with partners and with children do not seem to suffer a wage
   penalty. But like White women in male-dominated, prestigious
   professions, respondents tend to delay or avoid childbearing,
   particularly if they have uninterrupted careers. Their integration of
   work and family is supported by family resources found particularly in
   the Black community yet is also constrained by the demands of elite,
   male-dominated careers. We also find evidence of an impact of the

AB Fumonisin B-1 (FB1) is a maize mycotoxin. In tortilla preparation, maize
   is treated with lime (nixtamalization), producing hydrolyzed FB1 (HFB1)
   due to loss of the tricarballylic acid side chains. This study
   determined the following: 1) whether nixtamalization by Mayan
   communities reduces total fumonisins, and 2) the steps in the process at
   which reduction occurs. Tortillas prepared by the traditional process
   contained FB1, FB2 and FB3 and their hydrolyzed counterparts. There were
   equimolar amounts of FB1 and HFB1 in the tortillas, but the total
   fumonisins were reduced 50%. The total FB1 plus HFB1 in the residual
   lime water and water washes of the nixtamal accounted for 50% of the
   total FB1 in the uncooked maize. HFB1 and FB1 were present in a 1:1
   mol/L ratio in the water washes of the nixtamal, the masa dough and the
   cooked tortillas, whereas the ratio of HFB1:FB1 in lime water after
   steeping was 21. Water washes contained 11% of the FB1 that was in the
   uncooked maize. The results show that the traditional method reduced the
   total fumonisins in tortillas and reduced the sphinganine elevation (a
   biomarker closely correlated with fumonisin toxicity) in cells treated
   with extracts of tortillas compared with cells treated with extracts of
   contaminated maize.

AB This paper affirms the relevance of Bourdieu's arguments concerning
   schooling and inequality to the sociology of education in the US. In
   doing so, it eschews abstract debates about "reproduction theory" in
   favor of an empirically grounded treatment. We begin by noting that
   Bourdieu's theoretical account of the educational system's role in
   perpetuating inequality was tailored to an institutional arrangement
   which is highly distinct from that presently found in the US in at least
   one key respect: whereas for Bourdieu connections between the school and
   the domestic sphere are "hidden" or "masked," in the contemporary US
   they have become the focal point of a vast amount of educational
   research, discourse, and policy. Indeed, numerous institutional
   mechanisms exist which are intended to "harmonize" the environments
   formed by the home and school with respect to educational goals and
   practices. Our paper subsequently analyzes one of the most widespread
   such mechanisms: the parent-teacher conference. Using a set of detailed
   transcriptions of conferences between teachers and parents of
   middle-class children, on the one hand, and working-class and poor
   children, on the other, we examine the interaction that occurs in such
   conferences at the micro-level. It is our contention that, despite the
   institutional arrangement which prevails in the US, Bourdieu
   nevertheless provides the conceptual tools necessary to understand this
   interaction. Thus, within our data, stark differences are apparent in
   the amount and quality of the information exchanged in conferences as a
   function of the amount of cultural capital held by the parents.
   Similarly, parents' symbolic capital (relative to that of teachers) is
   associated with differences in the authority situation that
   characterizes the conference, with middle-class parents exhibiting a
   pronounced willingness to criticize teachers, advocate on behalf of
   their children, and demand customized pedagogical assistance for them.
   On the basis of this data, we conclude that institutional mechanisms
   such as parent-teacher conferences can function as an indirect avenue
   through which social class impacts children's school experiences. (C)

AB A single unified frame of reference for determining how sociology should
   be taught does not exist; nor does it exist for describing the optimum
   design for instituting curricula in sociology at different colleges and
   universities. Yet patterns and themes appear to persist at particular
   institutions that reflect the influence of their peculiar historical
   development and social contexts. This perspective underlies the
   examination of sociology at Howard University since its beginning as a
   series of lectures in 1895. Four factors are emphasized: the historical
   mission of the university, the special research and intellectual
   interests of departmental faculty, with particular discussion of the
   influence of E. Franklin Frazier; the struggles of traditional
   perspectives in opposition to the need to respond to new demands in
   society, and the demand of students for new courses outside the boundary
   of the existing curriculum. While I conclude that sociology at Howard
   University has always generally exhibited major facets of mainstream
   sociology, the most enduring thematic focus in research and teaching has
   centered on problems associated with racial and social inequality.

   engage students in active learning, I developed a course that used a
   variety of pedagogical strategies designed to provide experiential and
   service-learning situations to help students connect readings such as
   those by Marx, Olin Wright, and Davis and Moore with the situation of
   social class in contemporary United States. Students were required to
   keep journals of their experiences, and their journal entries provide
   the data for this paper. Though there is considerable room for
   improvement, the data suggest that the pedagogical tools employed were
   successful in promoting a deeper level of learning around issues of
   inequality, particularly social class inequality, as it exists in the
   United States.

AB The early 20th-century French sociologist and philosopher Gabriel Tarde
   was an important critic of Durkheim's ontology of the social. Tarde
   developed a microsociological and ontological critique of the
   philosophical problems of resemblance and of variation underlying
   Durkheim's comparative sociology. Recently, thinkers such as Gilles
   Deleuze, Bruno Latour and Eric Alliez have begun to revisit Tarde and to
   develop a theme of the significance of Tarde's thought as a harbinger of
   postmodern theory. This article examines Tarde's theories in the light
   of this new reception. It is shown that Tarde draws heavily from
   Leibniz's theory of the quantitative continuity of qualitative singulars
   in order to critique Durkheim's statistics-based social realism. While
   some key limitations of Tarde's critique are exposed, it is argued that
   Tarde finds a way to remain faithful to statistical sociology as a
   project even while calling radically into question the qualitative unity
   of the social.

AB East Asians and Westerners perceive the world and think about it in very
   different ways. Westerners are inclined to attend to some focal object,
   analyzing its attributes and categorizing it in an effort to find out
   what rules govern its behavior. Rules used include formal logic. Causal
   attributions tend to focus exclusively on the object and are therefore
   often mistaken. East Asians are more likely to attend to a broad
   perceptual and conceptual field, noticing relationships and changes and
   grouping objects based on family resemblance rather than category
   membership. Causal attributions emphasize the context. Social factors
   are likely to be important in directing attention. East Asians live in
   complex social networks with prescribed role relations. Attention to
   context is important to effective functioning. More independent
   Westerners live in less constraining social worlds and have the luxury
   of attending to the object and their goals with respect to it. The
   physical "affordances" of the environment may also influence perception.
   The built environments of the East are more complex and contain more
   objects than do those of the West. In addition, artistic products of the
   East emphasize the field and deemphasize individual objects, including
   people. Western art renders less of the field and emphasizes individual
   objects and people.

   life using subjective and objective indicators is described. Impetus for
   the research was a need to inform planning and policy decisions in the
   Detroit metropolitan area. The study also addresses theoretical concerns
   about relationships between objective conditions in cities, towns and
   rural areas and people's subjective and behavioral responses to the
   conditions. In addition to measuring subjective well being of Detroit
   area residents, issues explored in the study include travel and
   transportation, neighborhoods and neighboring, parks and recreation
   behavior, housing and residential mobility, and sprawl and open space
   preservation. The program of research also involves parallel studies in
   other world cities.

AB A two-stage model of peer influence was proposed. The model served as a
   framework for examining individual and relationship-specific differences
   in susceptibility to influence. The two stages are (1) The acquisition
   of a peer context and (2) conforming to the behavior of a peer. Data
   from a four-wave longitudinal study were used to assess (1) the initial
   selection of cigarette- and alcohol-using peers and (2) influence from
   peers. Relationship factors and variables identified as risk factors for
   substance use were hypothesized to increase susceptibility to peer
   influence. The results indicated that adolescents who did not value
   school achievement or spending time with parents were more apt than
   others to choose friends who smoked cigarettes more than they did.
   Adolescents who chose friends who drank more than they did not differ
   from other adolescents on any of the risk factors. Thus, low-risk
   adolescents were as likely to acquire a friend context where drinking
   was likely to occur as were adolescents who had more risk factors. When
   the second stage was examined, only high peer acceptance and high
   friendship quality resulted in adolescents being more apt to conform to
   their friend's substance-use behaviors. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

AB In this study we proposed and tested the theory that behavior is
   affected by the orientation of the members of one's social network. We
   collected data from 98 women (some drug users) with the Orientation of
   Social Support (OSS) scale and two other widely used measures: the
   Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ), and the Multidimensional Scale of
   Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Drug use was measured with the
   Addiction Severity Index (ASI). Pairwise correlations showed that the
   OSS had no correlation with the SSQ or the MSPSS. Subjects' ASI scores
   were regressed on the three measures of support. The only variable that
   entered stepwise regression was the OSS scale. This study confirmed our
   theory that it is important to examine the orientation of and not just
   the extent of social support. The paper provides the questionnaire and
   the scoring procedures for measurement of extent of peer pressure. (C)

   current investigation was designed to extend this research by examining
   the likelihood that individuals would consider engaging in hostile
   anonymous aggression. It was expected that highly identified persons
   would be particularly likely to consider these acts, even though the
   acts would not provide a competitive advantage for their team. Data
   collected from 175 university students confirmed the expectations. In
   addition, the results indicated that males were more likely than females
   to report a willingness to consider the hostile aggressive acts and that
   participants were more likely to report a willingness to engage in less
   destructive acts (e.g., tripping an opposing player or coach) than more
   destructive acts (e.g., murdering an opposing player or coach). (C) 2003

   Minority groups constitute a significant and growing percentage of our

   number of minority physicians. There is a tremendous need for medical
   professional schools and health care organizations to implement formal
   cultural competence training for current and future health
   professionals. In this article, we present the findings of an extensive
   literature review that describes how several factors have brought the
   need for cultural competence to the forefront. These factors include a
   greater appreciation for the impact of culture on health, changes in
   U.S. demographics, increased awareness in health care disparities, and
   modifications in legislative and accreditation mandates.

AB Background: Supported housing, integrating clinical and housing
   services, is a widely advocated intervention for homeless people with
   mental illness. In 1992, the US Department of Housing and Urban
   Development (HUD) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   established the HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program.
   Methods: Homeless veterans with psychiatric and/or substance abuse
   disorders or both (N = 460) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1)
   HUD-VASH, with Section 8 vouchers (rent subsidies) and intensive case
   management (n = 182); (2) case management only, without special access
   to Section 8 vouchers (n = 90); and (3) standard VA care (n = 188)
   Primary outcomes were days housed and days homeless. Secondary outcomes
   were mental health status, community adjustment, and costs from 4
   perspectives.
   Results: During a 3-year follow-up, HUD-VASH veterans had 16% more days
   housed than the case management-only group and 25% more days housed than
   the standard care group (P<.001 for both). The case management-only
   group had only 7% more days housed than the standard care group (P =
   .29). The HUD-VASH group also experienced 35% and 36% fewer days
   homeless than each of the control groups (P<.005 for both). There were
   no significant differences on any measures of psychiatric or substance
   abuse status or community adjustment, although HUD-VASH clients had
   larger social networks. From the societal perspective, HUD-VASH was
   $6200 (15%) more costly than standard care. incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratios suggest that HUD-VASH cost $45 more than
   standard care for each additional day housed (95% confidence interval,
   $-19 to $108).
   Conclusions: Supported housing for homeless people with mental illness
   results in superior housing outcomes than intensive case management
   alone or standard care and modestly increases societal costs.

AB Markets can show different types of dynamics, from quiet markets
   dominated by one or a few products, to markets with continual
   penetration of new and reintroduced products. in a previous article we
   explored the dynamics of markets from a psychological perspective using
   a multi-agent simulation model. The main results indicated that the
   behavioral rules dominating the artificial consumer's decision making
   determine the resulting market dynamics, such as fashions, lock-in, and
   unstable renewal. Results also show the importance of psychological
   variables like social networks, preferences, and the need for identity
   to explain the dynamics of markets. in this article we extend this work
   in two directions. First, we will focus on a more systematic
   investigation of the effects of different network structures. The
   previous article was based on Watts and Strogatz's approach, which
   describes the small-world and clustering characteristics in networks.
   More recent research demonstrated that many large networks display a
   scale-free power-law distribution for node connectivity. In terms of
   market dynamics this may imply that a small proportion of consumers may
   have an exceptional influence on the consumptive behavior of others
   (hubs, or early adapters). We show that market dynamics is a
   self-organized property depending on the interaction between the agents'
   decision-making process (heuristics), the product characteristics
   (degree of satisfaction Of unit of consumption, visibility), and the
   structure of interactions between agents (size of network and hubs in a
   social network).

   components of historical contextualism arc then articulated, including
   the historicity of disease, the reification of specific disease
   categories in terms of language and social practice, and finally, in
   contemporary society, the value placed on diagnosis, the
   bureaucratization of disease, and a logically consistent focus on
   boundary management and boundary disputes. It is a contextualism that
   demands a role for the biological as well as the cultural, for practice
   as well as pathological theory.

   medical feminism formed only one of the cherished causes they could

   strict sexism probably seemed inconsistent with progressive medicine.
   For some of these physicians-obviously a small minority defending
   medical women and breaking the barriers of fraternity could be
   consistent with "manly" responsibility. The outcome of the collaboration
   of women and the dissident men physicians in nineteenth-century
   Philadelphia amounted to another seeming paradox: the majority of the
   male medical profession, both locally and nationally, tyrannically
   hindered women's entry into the profession, yet medicine opened its
   doors in advance of law and the clergy; and where this first occurred,
   such as in the community centered on Woman's Medical College, a novel
   gender rearrangement arose based on collaboration and friendship.

AB By the 1880s hay fever (also called june Cold, Rose Cold, hay asthma,
   hay cold, or autumnal catarrh) had become the pride of America's leisure
   class. In mid-August each year, thousands of sufferers fled to the White
   Mountains of New Hampshire, to the Adirondacks in upper New York State,
   to the shores of the Great Lakes, or to the Colorado plateau, hoping to
   escape the dreaded seasonal symptoms of watery eyes, flowing nose,
   sneezing fits, and attacks of asthma, which many regarded as the price
   of urban wealth and education. Through a focus on the White Mountains as
   America's most fashionable hay fever resort in the late nineteenth
   century, this essay explores the embodied local geography of hay fever
   as a disease. The sufferers found in the White Mountains physical
   relief, but also a place whose history affirmed their social identity
   and shaped their relationship to the natural environment. And, they, in
   turn, became active agents in shaping the geography of place: in the
   very material relationships of daily life, in the social contours of the
   region, and in the symbolic space that nature inhabited. In the
   consumption of nature for health and pleasure, this article suggests,
   lies an important, yet relatively unexplored, source for understanding
   changing perceptions of environment and place and the impact of health
   on the local and regional transformation of the North American
   landscape.

AB Whereas it is often suggested that the media have assumed a prominent
   role in the sexual socialization of American youth, empirical evidence
   supporting this premise has been slow to accumulate. To provide both the
   fuel and motivation for future research in this area, this review
   presents a comprehensive overview of the existing state of the field,
   covering research on both magazine and television content, and on both
   high school and college student samples. In addressing the three central
   issues of what, how, and where/to what extent, this review first
   examines the nature and prevalence of sexual content both on TV and in
   magazines. It then describes several theoretical mechanisms outlining
   how potential influence might occur, and then presents findings
   examining such influences. Overall, evidence indicates that frequent and
   involved exposure to sexually oriented genres such as soap operas and
   music videos is associated with greater acceptance of stereotypical and
   casual attitudes about sex, with higher expectations about the
   prevalence of sexual activity and of certain sexual outcomes, and, even
   occasionally, with greater levels of sexual experience. In light of
   these findings, I offer a working conceptual model of the media's role
   as a sexual socialization agent, and conclude by outlining 14 specific
   suggestions for future research. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All

   To address this deficiency, we compared known palm uses among two

   conducted one-hundred-and-forty semi-structured "checklist" interviews

   knowledge of each community about the uses of the 17 palm species common
   to all communities was compared by testing for significant differences
   in the mean number of uses cited per informant and by calculating the
   Jaccard similarity index of known uses of palm species among the four
   communities. The following three hypotheses were confirmed: 1) the use
   of palms differs according to the cultural preferences of each
   community; 2) indigenous communities know significantly more about palm
   uses than folk communities; and 3) part of the indigenous knowledge was
   acquired through contact with Amazonian folk communities.

AB The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, it seeks to contribute
   to the ongoing sociological debate surrounding the immigrant enclave
   hypothesis, originally articulated by Alejandro Portes and his
   associates. It also extends this debate beyond the empirical setting on
   which the previous research has almost exclusively focused, i.e.,
   developed market economies. The current study applies the enclave
   argument to a non-market context by analysing an original survey of 449
   ethnic Koreans living in the city of Yanji, located in the northeastern
   corner of China. In doing so, this study probes into how ethnic enclave
   relates to inequality and stratification within the context of China's
   transitional economy. Multivariate analyses reveal that ceteris paribus
   working in the Korean enclave economy is positively associated with
   significant earnings advantage. Logistic regression models are also
   estimated to explore the causal determinants of enclave participation in
   terms of both immigrant entrepreneurship and employment. Empirical
   results indicate that the ethnic sector typically attracts those who
   lack substantial human capital required for entering 'mainstream'
   (state-managed) tabour markets.

AB Objectives: Discrimination is associated with both mental and physical
   health, and may be a particularly important determinant of health among
   marginalized groups. This study assessed differences in discrimination
   experiences and responses to discrimination between Black and Latino
   active substance users in New York City.
   Methods: 500 Black and 419 Latino active substance users were recruited
   through out-reach workers, service agencies, and word of mouth. We
   collected data about different types of discrimination experienced (eg,
   discrimination due to race, gender, substance use), the domains in which
   it occurred (eg, at work, with police), and participants' responses to
   unfair treatment.
   Results: Discrimination due to drug use was the most commonly reported
   type of discrimination among both Blacks and Latinos. Black respondents
   were more likely than Latinos to report discrimination due to their drug
   use (79% to 70%), race (39% to 23%), poverty (38% to 26%), gender (18%
   to 9%), and sexual orientation (38% to 6%). However, among those
   reporting discrimination due to drug use, Latinos experienced more
   rejection from family (81% to 70%), friends (73% to 60%), police (86% to
   79%), employers (72% to 56%), and medical care professionals (29% to
   18%). Black respondents were more likely to respond actively to
   discrimination, whereas Latino respondents were more likely to
   internalize experiences.
   Conclusions: Substantial differences exist in discrimination experiences
   and responses to discrimination between Black and Latino substance
   users. These differences may help explain racial and ethnic differences
   in health among marginalized populations, and identify avenues for
   effective, targeted intervention.

AB The depopulation of the Great Plains continues to draw the attention of
   rural scholars. However, a number of aspects of migration in the region
   remain poorly understood. For example, what differences exist among
   migrants in terms of their economic characteristics? Recent research
   shows that there is tremendous variability in the amount of income each
   migrant brings to or takes from a region. Using county-level Internal
   Revenue Service data for migration flows between 1995 and 1998, we
   explore the spatial patterns of income and population migration, while
   contrasting the income flows of in-migrants versus out-migrants. The
   results show that income flows out of the Great Plains exceed what might
   be expected given the pattern of net out-migration, and that many of the
   migration flows into the region may be reinforcing pockets of poverty.
   These findings should concern local officials worried about preserving
   public and private services in rural areas in the face of a declining
   population and tax base.

AB Upheaval causes many people to flee intolerable conditions in their own

   pivotal role in the resettlement of refugees up-rooted by these crises.
   The refugee resettlement program in North Dakota primarily assists the
   refugees in making a better life, and it ultimately helps the state's
   quest for population growth, ethnic diversity, and economic development.
   This study deals with refugee resettlement in North Dakota communities,
   specifically Bosnian refugees in Grand Forks. Survey questionnaires and
   interviews were used to gain an understanding of the issues that the
   Bosnians face in adjusting to life in the community. Their concerns
   include the lack of employment opportunities with a livable wage,
   learning English, and job/skills training.

   acts of physical force leaving survivors behind with a diminished sense
   of control that is often shadowed by persistent fear and anxiety. The
   treatment of the victims is a clear and immediate concern; from their
   perspectives the medical consequences require effective attention
   whether they suffered as a result of acts of nature, mental disease,

AB This paper describes an indigenous hunting/fishing/trapping economy in
   the Taimyr Autonomous Region, northern Russia, and traces the
   continuities and developments in property since the collapse of the
   Soviet command economy in 1991. Indigenous relations to hunting grounds
   and renewable resources are discussed with ethnographic case material
   from Dolgan and Nganasan communities. Land tenure is analyzed in terms
   of inclusive and exclusive property and informal and formal resource
   management. The asymmetric growth and distribution of common-pool
   territories and private holdings is a central issue. A number of factors
   when examined together appear to favor common property and traditional
   management including ancestral frames of morality and access,
   crosscutting kin relationships, principles of ownership and mutual aid,
   cooperative hunting, sharing of meat and fish, as well as migration
   patterns of prey species and relative increases in the cost of freight
   transport since 1991. In addition, private holdings often make
   commercial sales and generally have better access to urban centers,
   while they are more closely regulated through land, tax, and environment
   offices of local government.

AB Background: Literature describing temporal variation in the secondary
   sex ratio among humans reports an association between population
   stressors and declines in the odds of male birth. Explanations of this
   phenomenon draw on reports that stressed females spontaneously abort
   male more than female fetuses, and that stressed males exhibit reduced
   sperm motility. This work has led to the argument that population stress
   induced by a declining economy reduces the human sex ratio. No direct
   test of this hypothesis appears in the literature. Here, a test is
   offered based on a comparison of the sex ratio in East and West Germany
   for the years 1946 to 1999. The theory suggests that the East German sex
   ratio should be lower in 1991, when East Germany's economy collapsed,
   than expected from its own history and from the sex ratio in West
   Germany. Methods: The hypothesis is tested using time-series modelling
   methods. Results: The data support the hypothesis. The sex ratio in East
   Germany was at its lowest in 1991. Conclusion: This first direct test
   supports the hypothesis that economic decline reduces the human sex
   ratio.

   preschoolers (N = 275) were interviewed about their social judgments.
   Results showed that although some of the children had negative
   conceptions about adult Arabs and Jews, children, on the whole, did not
   invoke these stereotypes when evaluating peer conflict situations
   between Israeli and Palestinian children. Exposure to the programme was
   linked to an increase in children's use of both prosocial justifications
   to resolve conflicts and positive attributes to describe members of the
   other group. Palestinian children's abilities to identify symbols of
   their own culture increased over time. The results indicate the
   effectiveness of media-based interventions such as Rechov Sumsum/Shara'a

AB The African diaspora to the Americas was one of plants as well as

   force and free maroons to establish them in their gardens. Africans were
   additionally familiar with many Asian plants from earlier crop exchanges
   with the Indian subcontinent. Their efforts established these plants in
   the contemporary Caribbean plant corpus. The recognition of pantropical
   genera of value for food, medicine, and in the practice of syncretic
   religions also appears to have played an important role in survival, as
   they share similar uses among black populations in the Caribbean as well

   seeks to illuminate the botanical legacy of Africans in the

AB Objective: This study investigated whether altruistic social interest
   behaviors such as engaging in helping others were associated with better
   physical and mental health in a stratified random sample of 2016 members
   of the Presbyterian Church throughout the United States. Methods: Mailed
   questionnaires evaluated giving and receiving help, prayer activities,
   positive and negative religious coping, and self-reported physical and
   mental health. Results: Multivariate regression analysis revealed no
   association between giving or receiving help and physical functioning,
   although the sample was highly skewed toward high physical functioning.
   Both helping others and receiving help were significant predictors of
   mental health, after adjusting for age, gender, stressful life events,
   income, general health, positive and negative religious coping, and
   asking God for healing (R-2 = .27). Giving help was a more important
   predictor of better reported mental health than receiving help, and
   feeling overwhelmed by others' demands was an independent predictor of
   worse mental health in the adjusted model. Significant predictors of
   giving help included endorsing more prayer activities, higher
   satisfaction with prayer life, engaging in positive religious coping,
   age, female gender, and being a church elder. Frequency of prayer and
   negative religious coping were not related to giving help. Conclusions:
   Helping others is associated with higher levels of mental health, above
   and beyond the benefits of receiving help and other known
   psychospiritual, stress, and demographic factors. The links between
   these findings and response shift theory are discussed, and implications
   for clinical interventions and future research are described.

   disproportionately for the more educated and for whites (compared to the
   less educated and to African Americans). Such timing shifts imply that
   the underlying period quantum of fertility is considerably higher for
   college-educated women and for whites than suggested by the standard
   total fertility rate. Applying the Bongaarts-Feeney model (1998), we
   decompose observed racial and educational differences in
   age-order-specific fertility rates and TFR into tempo and quantum
   components. We find that a modest part of educational differences and a
   substantial part of racial difference in period fertility can be
   attributed to differential changes in tempo. Analysis by race and
   education shows a clear interaction: higher fertility among African
   Americans is confined to the less educated.

   patterns appeared to follow prevailing trends even after implementation

   analyzed state-level birth data from all 50 states to assess the birth
   response to the enactment of no-fault divorce law in each state. Results
   suggested that birth rates decreased significantly two to four years

   Holding the other five independent variables constant, we show that for
   every additional month in age at menarche, a Chinese Han woman's mean

AB (Micro)organisms, such as bacteria, which cause sexually transmitted
   diseases (STDs) in humans are presented with an interesting ecological
   challenge. These microorganisms need humans to have sexual contact with
   each other in order for the microorganisms to spread to other hosts as
   well as to have subsequent generations of descendants. However, diseases
   tend to lower the sex drive and to render the host less sexually
   attractive. It is argued that, over time, selective advantages sculpted
   organisms which cause STDs to be minimally symptomatic and to indirectly
   increase the number of sexual partners of the host. Neisseria
   gonorrhoeae which cause the STD gonorrhea are used as a prototype for
   these putative sexual dynamics. As a counter to the (micro)organisms'
   biological adaptations, human cultural innovations emerged and became
   integrated into the various traditions of social structures.

   presents research that tests several models that integrate ( 1)

   The research utilized a mail survey of 1,000 property owners in a

   related to attachment and satisfaction. This research demonstrates that
   landscape attributes matter a great deal to constructed meanings; these

AB This article develops an interactive, theoretical model of emotional
   feedback and amplification. Whereas the sociology of emotions typically
   examines how affect arises, this article focuses on the aftermath of an
   evoked emotion as it evolves in ongoing interaction. I argue that
   interactions serve as a stimulus to evoke emotional responses, but as
   interactions continue, these interactions provide an additional stimulus
   that feeds back into the initial emotion, amplifying it. I articulate
   two modes of emotional feedback and amplification: spontaneous and
   managed. Spontaneous amplification is a by-product of unplanned but
   continuous interactions. In contrast, managed amplification results from
   purposeful interactions and can be initiated through either surface
   acting or deep acting. The process of feedback and amplification is more
   likely under structural and cultural conditions that facilitate ongoing
   interactions. An empirical elaboration of the model is drawn from an
   ethnographic study of "TD's Restaurant." Examining how feedback and
   amplification occur in different settings is an ongoing task for
   sociologists interested in emotions, work and occupations, mental
   health, and social movements.

AB This essay explicates the role of countersystem analysis as an essential
   mode of social inquiry. In the process, particular attention is given to
   the place of negation and the future. One underlying theme is the
   asymmetry between the negative and the positive features of social
   activities, the negative being more readily identifiable empirically
   than the positive. A corollary theme, building on the observations of
   George Herbert Mead, is: one engages the present through experience; one
   engages the future through ideas. Furthermore, as Anthony Giddens,
   Ulrich Beck, and Niklas Luhmann suggest, we in late modernity seem to be
   facing a future that is more contingent than it was in early modernity.
   After articulating the foundations of the mode of inquiry we term
   "countersystem analysis," we employ Karl Mannheim as a point of
   departure for critically surveying a constellation of
   scholars-conservatives as well as reformers-who have relied upon some
   version of countersystem analysis in addressing the future. Such an
   orientation serves to advance not only theoretical inquiry but empirical
   investigation as well.

AB External validity refers to the generalization of research findings,
   either from a sample to a larger population or to settings and
   populations other than those studied. While definitions vary,
   discussions generally agree that experiments are lower in external
   validity than other methodological approaches. Further, external
   validity is widely treated as an issue to be addressed through
   methodological procedures. When testing theories, all measures are
   indirect indicators of theoretical constructs, and no methodological
   procedures taken alone can produce external validity. External validity
   can be assessed through determining (1) the extent to which empirical
   measures accurately reflect theoretical constructs, (2) whether the
   research setting conforms to the scope of the theory under test, (3) our
   confidence that findings will repeat under identical conditions, (4)
   whether findings support the theory being tested, and (5) the
   confirmatory status of the theory under test. In these ways, external
   validity is foremost a theoretical issue and can only be addressed by an
   examination of the interplay between theory and methods.

   once held a stellar position but is now treated negatively. Marx was
   once treated negatively but now holds a stellar position. In the 1990s,
   Harriet Martineau, a prominent nineteenth-century publicist, was
   announced as a founder. Alexis de Tocqueville received little attention
   at any time. Some important contemporary sociologists receive very
   little attention. Questions are raised about the adequacy of this

AB Problem sleepiness is emerging as a medical problem in the US and
   Britain. Though an increasingly salient complaint, clinical medicine is
   only peripherally involved in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep
   troubles. Paramount in shaping public perceptions and experiences of
   sleep are the popular media. The apparent chasm between self-reported
   sleep troubles and the routine medical gaze is the point of departure
   for this inquiry. Aided by the idea of rhetorical authority, a case is
   made for the conspicuous influence of newspapers, magazines and the
   Internet in shaping a persuasive cultural directive to become conscious
   of soporific states and their possible deleterious consequences.
   Attending to this cultural directive, a growing number of people are
   self-diagnosing with a novel sleep disorder, excessive daytime
   sleepiness. The increasing significance of popular culture in the
   creation of medical troubles summons an alternative version of medical
   sociology. A limited case for this claim is made by revisiting two key
   ideas in this field: naming diseases and the classic distinction between
   illness and disease.

AB Symbolic interactionism is often mischaracterized as a perspective that
   rejects quantitative research. We argue that the rich conceptual
   tradition of symbolic interactionism allows for the use of quantitative
   data and statistical analysis within a pragmatist epistemology and that
   this is desirable, especially in conjunction with qualitative data. We
   discuss types of quantitative data and their appropriate uses and then
   describe types of contemporary multivariate statistical methods and what
   they offer. To illustrate these data and analytic techniques, we draw
   from examples in our area of specialization, criminology, and from our
   own quantitative work. Researchers can use quantitative data and methods
   in the service of six core symbolic interactionist concerns -meaning,
   variation, comparisons, situations, contexts, and probability-and we
   contend that quantification and statistics pose no threat to the
   interactionist perspective. In fact, the principled, critical use of
   quantitative research can enhance it.

AB As reflective thinkers, symbolic interactionists may well be curious
   about the organ with which we think. Leading neuroscientists are quite
   aware that a working brain depends on other brains. This article
   considers selected neuroscience approaches to topics traditionally
   addressed by symbolic interactionists including some confirmations,
   refinements, and challenges from current neuroscience. Confirmations
   support features of Mead's "objective reality of perspectives" and a
   relational epistemology, the inevitability of ad hoc "accounts,"
   self-consciousness as behavioral control, and "self unity" as constantly
   re-created illusion. Divergence between neuroscience and symbolic
   interaction mainly involves new evidence for the importance of
   unconscious cognition, emotion, and memory in shaping human behavior.
   The rooting of cognitive and perceptual processes in motor activity
   challenges the extremes of the "linguistic turn." Refinement involves
   reasons for attending to the embodied salience of thoughts produced by
   "somatic markers" rather than mere content.

AB Biodemography of human longevity is an emerging interdisciplinary field
   of sociobiological research with deep historical roots. Two research
   questions are examined in this article: (1) What evidence is there for
   the familial transmission of human longevity?, and (2) what are the
   effects of parental age at reproduction on offspring longevity, and in
   particular, are there long-term adverse health consequences associated
   with the trend toward delayed reproduction? The ability of scientists to
   conduct biodemographic studies depends not only on merging theoretical
   and methodological elements from the biological and
   demographic/actuarial sciences, but unique sources of data and
   statistical methods must also be developed. In this article we describe
   how genealogical data have been used for over a century to explore basic
   questions about human longevity, and how similar kinds of data now being
   developed are driving the formation of new testable research hypotheses
   in the field of biodemography.

AB Context Although political violence continues in parts of Central
   America, South America, and Mexico, little is known about its
   relationship to the health of Latino immigrants living in the United
   States.
   Objective To determine (1) rates of exposure to political violence among
   Latino adult primary care patients who have immigrated to the United
   States from Central America, South America, and Mexico and its impact on
   mental health and health-related quality of life and (2) frequency of
   disclosure of political violence to primary care clinicians.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Two-stage cluster design survey of a
   systematic sample of Latino immigrant adults in 3 community-based
   primary care clinics in Los Angeles, conducted from July 2001 to
   February 2002.
   Main Outcome Measures Reports of exposure to political violence in home
   country before immigrating to the United States and communication with
   clinicians about political violence; self-reported measures of
   health-related quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Study Short
   Form 36 (MOS SF-36); symptoms of depression, anxiety, and alcohol
   disorders using the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders
   (PRIME-MD); and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using
   the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).
   Results A total of 638 (69%) of 919 eligible patients participated. The
   nonresponse rates did not differ by age, sex, recruitment sites, or
   clinic sessions. In weighted analyses, 54% of participants reported
   political violence experiences in their home countries, including 8% who
   reported torture. Of those exposed to political violence, 36% had
   symptoms of depression and 18% had symptoms of PTSD vs 20% and 8%,
   respectively, among those not exposed to political violence. Controlling
   for age, sex, country, years lived in the United States, acculturation,
   income, health insurance status, and recruitment site in a subsample of
   512 participants (56%), those who reported political violence exposure
   were more likely to meet symptom criteria for PTSD (adjusted odds ratio
   [AOR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-8.4) and to have symptoms
   of depression (AOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.4-5.4) and symptoms of panic disorder
   (AOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.6-14.4) than participants not reporting political
   violence. Those exposed to political violence reported more chronic pain
   and role limitations due to physical problems, as well as worse physical
   functioning and lower perceptions of general health than those who were
   not exposed to political violence. Only 3% of the 267 patients who had
   experienced political violence reported ever telling a clinician about
   it after immigrating; none reported their current physician asking about
   political violence.
   Conclusion Latino immigrants in primary care in Los Angeles have a high
   prevalence of exposure to political violence before immigrating to the
   United States and associated impairments in mental health and
   health-related quality of life.

   for mental health services.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional survey of 183

   1546 residents (adults and children) conducted November-December 2000.
   Main Outcome Measures Symptom criteria of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
   (PTSD), anxiety, and depression,as measured by the Harvard Trauma
   Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (Hopkins-25).
   Results One adult (aged greater than or equal to16 years) per household
   (n = 170 respondents) who agreed to participate was included in the
   analysis, representing an estimated 93% of households. All respondents
   reported experiencing at least 1 traumatic event with a mean of 8.3
   traumatic events per individual. Of the respondents, 20 (11.8%) had all
   symptom criteria for PTSD. Of the 160 who completed the Hopkins Symptom
   Checklist-25, 87 (54.4%) had anxiety symptoms and 62 (38.8%) had
   symptoms of depression. Witnessing the disappearance of family members
   (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.58; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.35-15.50), being close to death (AOR, 4.19, 95% 6, 1.03-17.00), or
   living with 9 to 15 persons in the same home (AOR, 3.69; 95% CI,
   1.19-11.39) were associated with symptoms of PTSD. There was a
   protective factor found for lacking sufficient food (AOR, 0.08; 95% CI,
   0.01-0.59). Elevated anxiety symptoms were associated with witnessing a
   massacre (AOR, 10.63; 95% CI, 4.31-26.22), being wounded (AOR, 3.22; 95%
   CI, 0.95-10.89), and experiencing 7 to 12 traumatic events (AOR, 2.67;
   95% CI, 1.14-6.27) and 13 to 19 traumatic events (AOR, 2.26; 95% CI,
   0.65-7.89). Elevated symptoms of depression were associated with being a
   woman (AOR, 3.64; 95% CI, 1.47-9.04), being widowed (AOR, 27.55; 95% CI,
   2.54-299.27), being married (AOR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.59-6.33), witnessing
   disappearances (AOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.16-6.19), experiencing 7 to 12
   traumatic events (AOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.64-3.88), or experiencing 13 to
   19 traumatic events (AOR, 7.44; 95% CI, 2.18-25.37).
   Conclusion Psychiatric morbidity related to human rights violations,
   traumatic events, and refugee status was common among Guatemalan
   refugees surveyed 20 years after the Guatemalan civil conflict.

   the following sets of variables: (a)parents' sociodemographic
   characteristics, (b) parents' dyadic adjustment, (c) fathers' substance

   meet current criteria for a psychoactive substance use disorder on
   alcohol or other drugs; moreover, based on reports by parents, none of
   the children was not exposed prenatally to illicit drugs. Results of
   hierarchical-by-blocks regression analyses revealed that each of the
   variable sets made a significant unique contribution to the prediction
   of children's psychosocial adjustment. Furthermore, the following
   variables within the sets were also found to be significant: (a)
   parents' age, (b) weekly family income, (c) frequency of male-to-female
   physical aggression between the parents, (d) frequency of fathers'
   substance use during the previous year, (e) diagnosis of antisocial

AB Recent research has found a positive association between insecure adult
   attachment styles and harmful drinking patterns. In the present study,
   we examined the relation between alcohol-related consequences and two
   dimensions underlying attachment, 'model of self' and 'model of others,'
   among a population of college student drinkers (N = 366). It was
   predicted that a negative model of self would contribute significantly
   to the variance in drinking problems over and above that accounted for
   by level of alcohol consumption. In an attempt to clarify the nature of
   the relationship among these variables, it was further hypothesized that
   coping drinking motives would mediate the relationship between the self
   attachment dimension and alcohol consequences. Hierarchical multiple
   regression analyses revealed results consistent with the predictions.
   There was a significant relationship between negative model of self and
   problems which was fully mediated by coping drinking motives. The
   findings support the basic theoretical supposition that one primary
   function of interpersonal attachment is the regulation of emotions. (C)

AB Studies have shown that women with HIV/AIDS in the USA are less likely
   than men to have access to appropriate health care and to utilize
   services, including the latest antiretroviral drug therapies. One
   explanation for this underutilization is patient dissatisfaction with
   medical care. Dissatisfaction with care has been shown to be associated
   not only with treatment underutilization, but also with discontinuity of
   care and poor clinical outcomes. Using Patient Satisfaction
   Questionnaire data from a national cohort of women with HIV, this study
   examines levels of dissatisfaction across seven established dimensions
   of care, and uses multivariate analysis to identify patient
   characteristics associated with these dimensions (N = 1,303). Women were
   most dissatisfied with access to care and the technical quality of care,
   and least dissatisfied with financial aspects of care and their
   providers' interpersonal manner. Women who reported poor health, who had
   depressive symptomatology, who were not receiving antiretroviral therapy
   (ART), who had no consistent care providers or who were Hispanic/Latina
   were more likely to be dissatisfied across most dimensions of care.
   Implications for enhancing clinical care for women with HIV/AIDS and

AB The purpose of this study was to understand and describe the safer sex
   decision-making processes of a group of African American college women.
   The study participants consisted of 15 women aged 19 to 33, who were
   full-time students attending a four-year university in Texas. The women
   self-identified as having been sexually active with at least one male
   partner within the past year. Semistructured in-depth interviews lasting
   approximately 1.5 hours provided data. Theme and domain analysis of the
   interviews and field notes revealed that women employed both emotional
   and philosophical strategies to determine their safer sex behaviour.
   These strategies involved the use of a 'self-defined' sexual
   arrangements hierarchy. This hierarchy served to define the way women
   ordered and valued different types of sexual arrangement, from casual to
   committed. The resulting hierarchy also guided the safer sex behaviour
   of these women. The implications for intervention programmes that are
   targeted at increasing safer sex behaviour and HIV risk reduction are
   discussed in light of these findings.

AB Gay and bisexual men who indicated they were currently in a primary

   treatment attitudes, sexual risk behaviour and sexual sensation seeking.
   Results indicate non-primary partner sexual activity is common in many
   gay relationships and men in non-exclusive relationships possessed
   greater levels of sexual sensation seeking and treatment-related reduced
   concern about the dangerousness of HIV than men in exclusive
   relationships. Results also suggest that individuals who were members of
   HIV-seroconcordant relationships were more likely to engage in
   unprotected sexual activity with their primary sexual partners than gay
   men who were members of HIV-discordant couples. A series of regression
   analyses revealed that reduced concern about HIV mediated the
   relationship between sexual sensation seeking and sexual risk behaviour.
   The next generation of HIV prevention interventions must address the
   attitudinal shifts that have occurred among some gay men regarding the
   seriousness of HIV and should be sensitive to the dynamics of gay
   relationships.

   fraction of these problem drinkers receive treatment. In this Study,
   self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 145 probation officers
   in nine California counties to identify factors that predicted probation
   officers' use of coercion to mandate alcohol treatment. The
   questionnaire measured characteristics of probation officers,
   characteristics of their caseloads, and perceptions about their
   departments. Principle components analysis combined some of the items
   into six factor-based scales. Multiple regression analyses identified
   two significant predictors of use of coercion into treatment: a belief
   that treatment was effective and a belief that one's peers in the
   department were using coercion frequently. Implications for increasing
   treatment entry of probationers with drinking problems include educating
   probation officers about the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment
   in general and about coerced treatment in particular. Probation
   departments are encouraged to develop management styles that facilitate
   shared normative beliefs about assessing and managing alcohol problems
   among probationers.

AB Why did! a partially bureaucratized administrative system develop in Qin
   China about two millennia before it did in European states? In this
   paper, comparative historical arguments about war and state-making are
   combined with agency theory to answer this question. The Spring and
   Autumn and Warring States eras that preceded the Qin unification of
   China created the necessary conditions for bureaucratization by
   weakening the aristocracy, creating a bureaucratic model, facilitating
   the development of roads, and providing trained and disciplined
   personnel. Comparative analysis shows that the main factor
   differentiating Qin China from other states and empires was the extreme
   weakness of the aristocracy produced by an unusually long period of
   severe warfare. Although Qin China was more bureaucratic than any other
   state or empire prior to the seventeenth century, it was far from
   completely bureaucratic. The persistence of monitoring problems
   prevented its full development, necessitating deviations such as the use
   of severe negative sanctions, the creation of redundant positions, and
   limiting bureaucratization to the top of the administrative system. The
   further development of the bureaucratic administrative system in the Han
   dynasty is also discussed.

AB Hypotheses about police presence and police action at social movement
   protest events in New York State between 1968 and 1973 are tested with
   the aim of understanding the broad mechanisms of social control used by
   authorities during this cycle of mass protest. Contrary to the popular
   perception of overzealous police repression of protest in this period,
   results show that police did not attend the majority of protest events.
   Tests of dominant explanations of police presence using logistic
   regress, on analysis indicate that the best predictor of police presence
   at a protest event was how threatening the event was-police attended
   larger protest events and those that used confrontational tactics. Tests
   (using multinomial logistic regression) of explonations of police
   action, given police presence at an event, indicate that extreme forms
   of police action were also triggered by threatening characteristics of
   events. Events in which subordinate groups and social movement
   organizations participated were also more likely to draw police action.
   Novel contributions include the comparison of dominant explanations of
   protest policing and methods that move beyond the tradition of examining
   repression through police presence or absence.

AB This study examines the concrete modalities of the production and
   recognition of a specific logical theorem in the field of artificial
   intelligence in the 1990s. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and
   textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of
   evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the
   theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the
   draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of
   the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its
   reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and
   by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization
   of debates over and the certification of the theorem were not based on
   the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified
   responses by critics and by the author's responses to
   critiques-responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations.
   This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists
   should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a
   privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social
   forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.

   background were examined in a sample of 2,000 women aged 14 - 24
   interviewed in Kinshasa in 1995. The analysis was guided by the social
   capital framework and the discussion focused on three theoretical
   perspectives: rational adaptation, social disorganization, and
   patrilineal bias. The results from the event history analysis showed
   that poverty, exposure to mass media, patrilinearity, and AIDS awareness
   greatly reduce the risk of premarital sexual activity. In contrast,
   social capital, as measured by the number of siblings, was positively
   associated with sexual permissiveness, suggesting a dilution of adults'
   attention to children in larger families.

   percent of the 352 men who were screened reported that they were
   sexually active during the past year, and 13% reported that they had
   engaged in sexual practices associated with greater risk. The most
   common risk practices in the past year included having multiple sexual
   partners (7%), paying for sex (5%), and having unprotected anal sex
   (4%). Engaging in risky sexual practices was associated with the
   presence of a co-occurring psychiatric disorder and higher scores on a
   drug abuse screening measure. Assessing HIV risk in substance abuse
   settings can help to identify patients who may benefit from HIV-risk
   reduction programs.

   impairment, disability or lost work productivity, and increased use of
   health services. Evidence for these impacts includes cross-sectional
   studies, longitudinal studies, and true experiments (randomized trials
   of specific treatments or treatment programs). With respect to unipolar
   depression, strong evidence demonstrates that depression is associated
   with significant functional impairment and that effective treatment
   helps to restore function. Studies of the effect of depression on work
   disability and health care costs show strong cross-sectional
   associations (i.e., greater disability and higher costs among those with
   depression) and longitudinal associations (i.e., improvement in
   depression is associated with reduced disability and lower costs). All
   of these findings regarding unipolar depression seem as consistent in
   the subgroup of patients with comorbid chronic medical illness as in the
   total population with depressive disorders. Fewer data are available
   regarding social and economic burden of bipolar disorder, but available
   data show cross-sectional associations between mood symptoms and
   functional impairment, disability, and health care costs. Taken
   together, these data describe the substantial social and economic burden
   of mood disorders and the potential benefits of more effective
   treatment. We must recall, however, that economic benefits of treatment
   for mood disorders are secondary to the principal objective of relieving
   human suffering. (C) 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

AB Quality of life (QOL), by almost any definition, is important to people.
   We apply the concept to the relationship between rural communities and
   public land management. A 1999 study of residents in 12 communities
   neighboring the Chugach National Forest in Alaska was used during the
   revision of the Forest's land and resource management plan to assess the
   relationships between quality of life components and possible management
   activities being considered. Specifically, we addressed the following
   five questions: (1) What QOL components are most important to residents
   of the 14 neighboring local communities? (2) How satisfied are residents
   with the current status of the QOL components in their communities? (3)
   How do local respondent perceptions of QOL component importance compare
   with those of their peers nationwide? (4) If proposed forest management
   activities may adversely affect resident perceptions of QOL, what are
   the possible consequences to the communities? (5) How prepared are the
   communities to address any possible adverse consequences on their own?
   Our findings confirm that the Forest, probably not unlike other public
   land management units, has the ability to affect the quality of life of
   the communities neighboring it for better or for worse. However, the
   degree to which the communities' residents themselves are prepared for
   such change is equally significant.

AB Recent research has questioned whether the European Black Death of
   1347-1351 could possibly have been caused by the bubonic plague bacillus
   Yersinia pestis, as has been assumed for over a century. Central to the
   arguments both for and against involvement of Y. pestis has been a
   comparison of the temporal dynamics observed in confirmed outbreaks of
   bubonic plague in early-20th-century India, versus those reconstructed
   for the Black Death from English church records-specifically, from lists
   of institutions (appointments) to vacated beneficies contained in
   surviving bishops' registers. This comparison is, however, based on a
   statistical error arising from the fact that most of the bishops'
   registers give only the dates of institution and not the dates of death.
   Failure to correct for a distributed (as opposed to constant) lag time
   from death to institution has made it took as if the Black Death passed
   slowly through specific localities. This error is compounded by a
   failure to disaggregate the information from the bishops' registers to a
   geographical level that is genuinely comparable to the modem data. A
   sample of 235 deaths from the bishop's register of Coventry and
   Lichfield, the only English register to list both date of death and date
   of institution, shows that the Black Death swept through local areas
   much more rapidly than has previously been thought. This finding is
   consistent with those of earlier studies showing that the Black Death
   spread too rapidly between locales to have been a zoonosis such as
   bubonic plague. A further analysis of the determinants of the lag
   between death and institution, designed to provide a basis for
   reexamining other bishops' registers that do not provide information on
   date of death, shows that the distribution of lags could vary
   significantly by time and space even during a single epidemic outbreak.

AB The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) at conception is highly dependent
   upon the maternal age distribution and age-specific pregnancy rates.
   Live-birth prevalence of DS reflects these factors and fetal deaths.
   Since the introduction of prenatal diagnosis in the early 1970s, the
   role of fetal deaths in the equation has increased. Between 1920 and the
   early 1980s, DS live-birth prevalence decreased in many populations due
   to declining fertility rates, particularly among older women. In the
   late-1970s the trend reversed, as the median age of populations and
   birth rates among older women steadily increased. This paper illustrates
   these interactions using data we have analyzed for New York State (NYS)
   and comparative data obtained from the literature. Between 1983 and 1997
   DS live-birth prevalence in NYS remained stable at about 9.9 per 10,000
   live births. The number of prenatal tests performed increased by 158%,
   and the number of DS fetuses detected prenatally more than quadrupled.
   Fertility rates of women aged 35-49 continued to increase. The
   proportion of DS cases born to these older mothers increased from 23% in
   1985 to 43% in 1997. We estimated that without prenatal diagnosis, DS
   live-birth prevalence would have been 17.0 per 10,000 live births by
   1995. Cultural factors influence demographic trends, birthing
   technologies, physician practices, and women's decision-making regarding
   prenatal screening and diagnosis for DS.

AB In one of the truly classic works in anthropological genetics, Frank
   Livingstone established the interrelationships between agriculture,
   mosquito ecology, malaria, and, consequently, the frequencies of sickle
   cell hemoglobin in West Africa. A major inference from Livingstone's
   study was the recency of malaria as a selective agent in human
   populations, only becoming significant after the adoption of agriculture
   in the last few thousand years. Clines of the abnormal hemoglobin
   alleles might therefore represent continuing waves of advance of
   adaptive alleles. In order to model the complex interaction of several
   hemoglobin alleles, selection, and gene flow spreading adaptive mutants,
   Livingstone turned to computer simulation. Numerous insights concerning
   the competitive increase of different alleles (hemoglobins S, C, and E
   and thalassemia), the rate of allele spread under different migration
   scenarios, including the potential importance of long-range migration,
   came out of these studies. These experiments also stimulated others to
   search for mechanisms that might increase the diffusion rate of
   hemoglobin variants, including kin-structured migration and epidemic
   disease selection. Recent molecular studies have substantiated major
   aspects of Livingstone's work (including the recent origin of falciparum
   malaria) and posed challenges to some of his assumptions (such as the
   number of mutations to hemoglobins S and E). But whatever the fate of
   his specific hypotheses, his emphasis on the interaction of genetics,
   ecology, and culture stands as a model for the anthropological approach
   to the understanding of human variation and evolution.

   community in the Karakoram of Northern Pakistan. Specifically, it aims
   to show how the tremendous social and economic transformations taking
   place in this region are experienced and understood by the people most
   affected by them. The case study draws from ethnographic data collected
   through a range of methods, including personal narratives, focus groups,
   interviews, household surveys, conversations, and participant
   observations. Central to this analysis is the role that social change
   plays in mediating and shaping residents' worries, and perceived
   vulnerabilities within this particular economic and cultural context.
   Furthermore, the effects of the global economy on how people assess
   their dependency on external factors and processes are explored,
   including attention to the ways in which newly introduced products and
   technologies raise concerns about product safety, health security, and
   community cohesiveness. This analysis of local narratives of health
   risks illustrates these points and demonstrates how residents'
   constructions of risk provide a basis for understanding local debates
   and doubts about how "development" and modernity are being approached in
   this mountainous region.

AB Marriage is the central relationship for most adults and has beneficial
   effects for health. At the same time, troubled marriages have negative
   health consequences. This review outlines the physiological pathways
   through which marital relationships influence health based on a
   stress/social support model. In addition, we review recent findings
   suggesting that unhappy marriages are associated with morbidity and
   mortality. We then turn to studies of marital interaction that include
   assessment of physiological pathways through which marital functioning
   influences health: the cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune systems.
   Across these studies, negative and hostile behaviors during marital
   conflict discussions are related to elevations in cardiovascular
   activity, alterations in hormones related to stress, and dysregulation
   of immune function. Using recent conceptualizations of the physiological
   impact of chronic stress, we illustrate how physiological changes
   associated with marital functioning in these studies have long-term
   implications for health outcomes. Finally, we discuss future
   implications of current research for understanding the relationships
   among marital functioning, physiology, and health. (C) 2003 Elsevier

AB Objectives: To assess the emotional and psychosocial responses to a
   serological diagnosis of HSV-2 infection in individuals without previous
   history of genital herpes.
   Methods: 24 individuals who had a positive HSV-2 serology by western
   blot and no clinical history of disease were recruited from four clinics
   (sexually transmitted disease, maternal and infant care, family
   medicine, and virology research) over a 10 month period. In-depth
   qualitative interviews were conducted to elicit an individual's
   responses to the HSV-2 diagnosis.
   Results: Three categories of themes were identified from the interviews.
   Short term emotional responses included surprise, denial, confusion,
   distress, sadness, disappointment, and relief to know. Short term
   psychosocial responses included fear of telling sex partners, anger at
   the source partner, guilt about acquiring or transmitting, and concern
   about transmitting to a child. Perceived ongoing responses included fear
   of telling future partners, concern about transmitting to a sex partner,
   feeling sexually undesirable, feeling socially stigmatised, feeling like
   "damaged goods," sex avoidance due to social responsibility, fear of
   transmitting to a newborn, and relationship concerns relating to the
   diagnosis.
   Conclusions: Individuals exhibit strong emotional and psychosocial
   responses to a serological diagnosis of HSV-2 infection. Many of the
   negative responses may be time limited and influenced by factors that
   are potentially amenable to counselling.

AB Background: The objective of this study was to explore physician and
   practice characteristics according to sex.
   Method: All graduates of a southeastern state's family practice
   residency programs were surveyed.
   Results: Seven hundred fourteen (53.5%; 79.7% men, 20.3% women) surveys
   were returned and analyzed. Practice arrangements and practice settings
   did not differ significantly between the two study groups. Male
   graduates saw a significantly higher percentage of geriatric patients
   (28.9% versus 24.7%; P = 0.008) and made significantly more nursing home
   visits (50.6% versus 35.5%; P = 0.002) and home visits (49.0% versus
   33.8%; P = 0.001) than female graduates. With the exception of skin
   biopsies, a greater percentage of male physicians performed procedures
   than female physicians. Female graduates and male graduates had the same
   initial salary but had a significantly different current salary range.
   No significant differences were seen in personal or career satisfaction.
   Conclusion: Practice patterns of male and female physicians were
   generally similar. However, significant differences were noted in
   geriatric care, procedures, and salary.

AB Background: Trauma surgeons have observed an increased rate of
   Penetrating trauma during periods of increased unemployment.
   Methods: During a 10-year period, the rate of unemployment in a
   metropolitan area was compared with the rate of intentional penetrating
   trauma at two Level I trauma centers. The total number of trauma cases
   was recorded. Assaults, derived from police records, were examined as an
   additional indicator of violent behavior. Pearson correlation
   coefficients were calculated to identify significant correlation between
   study variables. Stepwise maximum-likelihood estimation was used to
   derive a model predicting percent penetrating trauma.
   Results: The rate of unemployment and percent penetrating trauma of
   individuals presenting to the emergency department were significantly
   correlated (P = 0.014). After stepwise estimation, a model was derived
   (r(2) = 0.846, P = 0.014) that estimated percent penetrating trauma on
   the basis of percent unemployment and total number of trauma admissions.
   Conclusion: This long-term ecological study confirms that rates of
   penetrating trauma increase with increasing unemployment rates. This
   should inspire further research to identify areas of greatest need to
   improve delivery of resources and current public policy with the
   ultimate goal of decreasing the incidence of penetrating trauma.

AB Background: Since 1970, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) has
   worked to increase primary care access among underserved groups. This
   study examined whether NHSC alumni physicians were likely to treat a
   high proportion of Medicaid patients in their practices.
   Methods: Using licensure files and hospital discharge data, we
   identified all physicians practicing in South Carolina who attended at
   least one discharge in 1998, excluding physicians who graduated before
   1969, residents, and current NHSC-obligated physicians. The outcome
   studied was ranking in the highest quartile for Medicaid participation.
   Results: Former NHSC participants, after adjustment for personal
   characteristics, education, and specialty, were nearly twice as likely
   to fall into the category of high Medicaid participation. NHSC
   physicians were more likely to practice in community health centers and
   to locate in areas with a health professions shortage and counties with
   high percentages of minorities and people living in poverty.
   Conclusion: NHSC alumni make career choices leading them to serve
   low-income patients.

AB This study tested two hypotheses concerning the cognitive processes
   underlying human mate choice in Western society: (i) mate preference is
   conditional in that the selectivity of individuals' mate preference is
   based on their perception of themselves as long-term partners, and (ii)
   the decision rule governing such conditional mate preference is based on
   translating perception of oneself on a given attribute into a comparable
   selectivity of preference for the same attribute in a mate. Both
   hypotheses were supported. A two-part questionnaire was completed by 978
   heterosexual residents of Ithaca, New York, aged 18-24; they first rated
   the importance they placed on 10 attributes in a long-term partner and
   then rated their perception of themselves on those same attributes. Both
   women and men who rated themselves highly were significantly more
   selective in their mate preference. When the 10 attributes were grouped
   into four evolutionarily relevant categories (indicative of wealth and
   status, family commitment, physical appearance, and sexual fidelity),
   the greatest amount of variation in the selectivity of mate preference
   in each category was explained by self-perception in the same category
   of attributes. We conclude that, in Western society, humans use neither
   an "opposites-attract" nor a "reproductive-potentials-attract" decision
   rule in their choice of long-term partners but rather a "likes-attract"
   rule based on a preference for partners who are similar to themselves
   across a number of characteristics.

AB Generalizing from the sociology of earnings attainment, we develop a
   conceptual model of social embeddedness in conventional and criminal
   activities to explain illegal earnings among criminal offenders. To
   isolate the effects of time-varying factors such as legal earnings, drug
   use, and criminal opportunities, we use data from the National Supported
   Work Demonstration Project to estimate fixed-effects models predicting
   month-to-month changes in illegal earnings. We find that criminal
   earnings are sensitive to embeddedness in conforming work and family
   relationships, criminal experience, and the perceived risks and rewards
   of crime. Moreover, heroin and cocaine use creates a strong earnings
   imperative that is difficult to satisfy in the low-wage labor market,
   and offenders earn far more money illegally when they are using these
   drugs than during periods of abstinence.

   differences in the modal, and normative emotions. A summary of the
   research literature on cultural differences in emotions, in particular
   in antecedent events, subjective feeling, appraisal, and behavior is
   provided. Cultural differences in emotions are understood functionally,
   such that the most prevalent emotional phenomena in a culture are those
   that fit and reinforce the distinct cultural models (i.e. goals and
   practices) of self and relationship. It is argued that a
   culture-sensitive approach to emotional disturbances would entail the
   assessment of emotional phenomena that are dysfunctional to the cultural
   models of self and relationship. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB Despite an extensive body of research on the individual burden of
   migraine, few studies have examined its impact on the family. We aimed
   to assess the impact of migraine on family life both from the
   perspective of those with migraine and from the perspective of their
   partners. A validated computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)
   identified 574 people with migraine from a population sample of 4007 in
   mainland England, and 568 from 4376 in Philadelphia County, in the USA.
   Migraine cases with six or more migraine attacks per year and living as
   married with partners were asked, along with their partners, to
   participate in this study. In a follow-up interview, questions were
   asked of the proband (i.e. subject identified with migraine in the
   survey) about the impact of migraine. Similar questions were also asked
   of the probands' partners regarding the impact of the proband's migraine
   on their participation in social, family and leisure activities and on
   family relationships. The samples from the two countries showed similar
   characteristics, and were combined. Of 389 people with migraine living
   with a household partner, 85% reported substantial reductions in their
   ability to do household work and chores, 45% missed family social and
   leisure activities, and 32% avoided making plans for fear of
   cancellation due to headaches. One half believed that, because of their
   migraine, they were more likely to argue with their partners (50%) and
   children (52%), while majorities (52-73%) reported other adverse
   consequences for their relationships with their partner and children,
   and at work. A third (36%) believed they would be better partners but
   for their headaches. Participating partners (n = 100) partly confirmed
   these findings: 29% felt that arguments were more common because of
   headaches and 20-60% reported other negative effects on relationships at
   home. Compared with subjects who did not have migraine regarding their
   work performance, a statistically significantly higher proportion of
   migraine partners were unsatisfied with work demands placed on them (P =
   0.02), with their level or responsibilities and duties (P = 0.02), and
   with their ability to perform (P = 0.001). Results from this study show
   that the impact of migraine extends to household partners and other
   family members.

AB Understanding different patterns of fish consumption is an important
   component of the assessment of risk from contaminants in fish. While
   there have been extensive studies of fish consumption in Western
   cultures, less attention has been devoted to the role of fish and meat
   in the diets of people in other cultures. A survey of 212 people living
   in Singapore was conducted to examine the relative importance of fish,
   shellfish, and other meat in their diets and to ascertain whether there
   were differences as a function of age, income, education or gender. As
   expected, fish and shellfish played an important role in their daily
   diets. On average, people ate fish in about 10 meals a week, chicken for
   eight meals, and shrimp and pork for about six meals each. While nearly
   8% never ate fish, 18% ate fish at all 21 meals a week and over 20% ate
   shellfish for all 21 meals. Income explained about 14% of the variation
   in the number of fish meals consumed, and age explained about 8% of the
   variation in number of chicken meals per week. There were no gender
   differences in the number of meals of each type. People less than 26
   years old ate significantly more pork, chicken, and other meat meals and
   fewer shellfish meals than older people. People with higher incomes ate
   significantly more fish meals than those with lower incomes. Chinese
   individuals ate significantly more meals of pork, chicken, and other
   meat than other ethnic groups, and they ate only 26% of their meals at
   home, while others ate 33% of their meals at home. The data indicate a
   great deal of variation in the number of meals of fish, shellfish, and
   other meats eaten by the people interviewed, making dietary and risk

   Result(s): Two court cases involving cryopreserved semen and five cases

   Conclusion(s): The state of the law surrounding cryopreservation is
   recent and unsettled. Disposition agreements can provide
   cryopreservation clinics some degree of certainty in this unsettled area
   of law. Those drafting cryopreservation disposition agreements are
   assisted by lessons learned from cryopreservation cases and insight
   gained from law review articles. It is evident that cryopreservation
   agreements will be most successful and most likely to be enforced if
   they are unambiguous, consistent with public policy, and include: a
   duration provision, each individual's contact information, the
   individual's provisions for use of their gametes in case of death, and
   responsibilities of cryopreservation clinic and individuals. Individuals
   must enter into agreements with a true understanding of the contained

AB Background: Exposure to cockroach allergen is prevalent in inner-city
   homes and is associated with an increased risk of cockroach
   sensitization.
   Objective: We sought to determine the prevalence of cockroach allergen
   exposure in suburban middle-class homes and to study its relationship to
   cockroach sensitization.
   Methods: Children with asthma, 6 to 17 years of age, were recruited from
   3 pediatric practices located in counties surrounding Baltimore city and
   from 1 practice located within Baltimore city limits. Participants
   underwent skin prick testing and completed baseline questionnaires. In
   addition, their homes were inspected, and settled dust samples were
   collected for allergen analysis.
   Results: Forty-one percent of the total study population (n = 339) had
   kitchen Bla g 1 levels of greater than 1 U/g. Forty-nine percent were
   white, 53% had annual incomes of greater than $50,000, and 48% of
   mothers had college degrees. Seventy-seven percent of the study
   population resided in a suburban or rural location, and 30% of kitchens
   in these homes had Bla g 1 levels of greater than 1 U/g. Among the
   suburban-rural subgroup, 21% were sensitized to cockroach compared with
   35% of the city group. In multivariate analysis, exposure to kitchen Bla
   g 1 levels of greater than 1 U/g was associated with cockroach
   sensitization for both the total study population (odds ratio, 2.29; 95%
   CI, 1.28-4.11) and the suburban-rural subgroup (odds ratio, 2.37; 95%
   CI, 1.23-4.57).
   Conclusions: Cockroach allergen exposure might be more common in
   suburban middle-class homes of asthmatic children than previously
   thought. Moreover, the data suggest that low-level cockroach exposure is
   a risk factor for cockroach sensitization.

   interdisciplinary clinic, and 98 had normal growth. Results: Cognitive
   development declined in both groups to 1.0-1.5 SD below the norm.
   Children with FTT had lower cognitive scores than children with adequate
   growth through age 4, followed by recovery. By ages 5 and 6, there were
   no differences in cognitive scores based on the children's growth
   history. Using hierarchical linear modeling, child-centered home
   environment and small family size were related to better cognitive
   performance. Conclusions: The low scores of both groups point to the
   need for programs promoting a child-centered home environment.

AB Moral reasoning, moral affect, social problem solving skills, and social
   preferences were assessed in 163 ethnically mixed preschoolers
   (2.86-5.95 years). Participants were rated by their teachers on
   prosocial and coercive strategies of control, success at resource
   control, and aggression (overt and relational). Based on their
   employment of coercive and prosocial strategies of resource control, the
   children were categorized as bistrategic controllers, coercive
   controllers, prosocial controllers, noncontrollers, or typicals.
   Teacher-rated relational aggression was positively associated with moral
   maturity in girls. Bistrategic controllers, although aggressive, were
   morally mature and preferred play partners by their peers. The results
   are discussed in terms of hypotheses that arise from evolutionary theory
   which suggests that highly effective resource controllers would be
   simultaneously aggressive and yet well aware of moral norms. The
   findings are contrasted with alternative hypotheses that might arise
   variously from traditional and prevailing approaches. (C) 2003 Elsevier

AB This study examined the relationship between Food Stamp Program (FSP)
   participation and the obesity of low income individuals using data from
   the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Obesity was defined as
   body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2). The data were
   arranged as a panel with multiple observations per individual, and the
   models of obesity included current and long-term FSP participation,
   additional demographic, socioeconomic and environment characteristics
   and individual fixed effects. Individual fixed effects were used to take
   into account unobserved differences across individuals that did not vary
   over time. In ordinary least squares models, current and long-term FSP
   participation were significantly related to the obesity of low income
   women (P < 0.05), but not of low income men. For low income women,
   current participation in the FSP was associated with a 9.1% increase in
   the predicted probability of current obesity. Participation in the FSP
   in each of the previous five years compared to no participation over
   that time period was associated with approximately a 20.5% increase in
   the predicted probability of current obesity. These models did not
   control for food insecurity, and this omission potentially complicates
   the interpretation of the FSP participation variables.

AB Objective: Anthropologists with an interest in American Indian alcohol
   use have long held that how native people drink has been conditioned by
   aspects of the social organization of their societies prior to the
   disruptive influences of European colonialism. Our goal in this article
   was to explicitly test the importance of these factors in four
   contemporary American Indian cultural groups. Method: Using data on
   adolescent alcohol use drawn from the first full wave of the
   longitudinal Voices of Indian Teens Project (N = 1,651, 51% female), we
   tested whether patterns of quantity-frequency of alcohol use and the
   negative consequences of alcohol use predicted by social organizational
   variables were found among contemporary adolescents and, subsequently,
   whether these differences persisted when other, more proximal, variables
   were included. Results: Cultural differences appeared to account for a
   small percentage of the variance in both quantity-frequency of alcohol
   use and negative consequences in the initial steps of our analyses, but
   the pattern in these data was not consistent with the predictions of
   existing theories regarding aboriginal social organization. Moreover,
   these cultural differences were no longer significant in the final step
   of our analyses, suggesting that the cultural differences that did exist
   were better explained by other factors, at least among these
   adolescents. Conclusions: Although these analyses did not indicate that
   culture was irrelevant in understanding adolescent alcohol use in
   American Indian communities, classic formulations of these effects were
   of limited utility in understanding the experiences of contemporary
   American Indian adolescents.

AB Helicobacter pylori in the developing world is associated with many
   unique challenges not encountered in an industrialized setting. The 20%
   prevalence of infection with H. pylori among adolescents in the United
   States pales in comparison to infection rates exceeding90% by 5 years of
   age in parts of the developing world. While H. pylori within the
   developed world is associated with gastritis, which may lead to peptic
   ulcer and gastric carcinoma, the infection in the developing world
   appears to also be linked with chronic diarrhea, malnutrition and growth
   faltering as well as predisposition to other enteric infections,
   including typhoid fever and cholera. Once identified, treatment of H.
   pylori within the developing world presents increased difficulties due
   to the frequency of antibiotic resistance as well as the frequency of
   recurrence after successful treatment. Control, and possibly
   eradication, of H. pylori could likely be achieved through increased
   standards of living and improved public health, as it has in the
   industrialized world. However, these measures are distant objectives for
   most developing countries, making long-term control of the organism
   dependent on the development and administration of an effective vaccine.

AB This case study investigates the conservation attitudes of two ethnic
   groups, horticulturalist Pimbwe and agropastoralist Sukuma, living
   around Katavi National Park (KNP) in western Tanzania, East Africa.
   Specifically, interest in degazetting KNP was examined (as a reflection
   of attitude towards the Park) relative to type and extent of KNP
   outreach, wildlife-related problems, household wealth and residency
   status. Reported attitudes were then related to fuelwood extraction
   patterns. Attitudinal surveys showed that a lack of KNP outreach (i.e.
   village-level services and visits by KNP staff) and increased land
   wealth and shorter residency time were associated with increased
   interest in seeing KNP degazetted. However, after controlling for
   ethnicity only recognition of village-level Park services was still
   associated with positive attitudes towards KNP. People recognizing KNP
   services also demonstrated more ecologically sustainable wood extraction
   methods. These results suggest that while attitudinal studies seem to be
   a logical step towards making informed decisions about the effectiveness
   of protected area outreach, relating such outreach to behavioural
   changes in resource use through attitudinal assessment is a greater
   challenge, requiring a clear understanding of the relative influence of
   socioeconomic and cultural factors.

   article suggests some of the tasks ahead in reworking our presentation
   of Erving Goffman's sociology to students. An overemphasis on Goffman's
   work on the social self in has resulted in a teaching convention that
   places him among symbolic interactionist theorists. This practice has
   obscured important linkages of Goffman's other work on social rituals
   and social forms to other theoretical traditions, most conspicuously the
   Durkheimian ritual tradition. This article depicts a useful
   participatory exercise for teaching Goffman's dramaturgical sociology

   economic and social resources to depression among African American women
   at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (N = 181) using the
   Conservation of Resources theory as a conceptual framework. Women were
   assessed at 3 time points in conjunction with a dietary change
   intervention. At baseline, 40% of women reported clinically significant
   depression, and 43.3% were below the poverty line. Depressed women
   reported fewer economic assets and greater economic distress than
   nondepressed peers. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated
   that nonwork status, lack of home ownership, low appraisal of one's
   economic situation, low self-esteem, and increased life events were
   significantly associated with depression at baseline. Longitudinal
   multivariate logistic regression models indicated that income, home
   ownership, future economic appraisal, life events, and self-esteem
   predicted depression trajectories at Time 3. These results speak to the
   multifaceted sources of stress in the lives of poor African American
   women. Interventions that address the economic and social factors
   associated with depression are needed.

   groups of Swedes to analyze the relationship between experience,
   knowledge, and people's attitude toward wolves. Although all groups
   support the right of wolves to exist, Swedes who live in areas where
   wolves have been restored have more negative attitudes than the general
   public. Attitudes toward wolves are not strong among the general public,
   thus changes are possible. Experience with wolf predation leads to more
   negative attitudes toward wolves. Hunters in areas with wolves have the
   most accurate knowledge about wolves but at the same time the most
   negative attitudes. But within all four groups as knowledge increases
   attitudes become more positive. Still, the most knowledgeable local
   hunters have less favorable attitudes than the least knowledgeable
   members of the general public. High proportions of the population do not
   care about wolves which makes it difficult to reach them with
   information, but does make them susceptible to rapid changes if wolves
   become a media topic. With the restoration of wolves, hunters, the
   strongest supporters of wolves in the 1970s, are now less supportive
   than the general public. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Teleological-functional explanations account for objects by reference to
   their purpose. They are a fundamental aspect of adults' explanatory
   repertoire. They also play a significant role in children's reasoning
   although prior findings indicate that, in contrast to adults, young
   children broadly extend teleological explanation beyond artifacts (e.g.
   chairs) and biological properties (e.g. eyes) to the properties of
   non-living natural phenomena (e.g. clouds, rocks). The present study
   extends earlier work with American children to explore British
   children's application of teleological explanation. The motivation is
   that while Britain and America are, culturally, as close to a minimal
   pair as the global context affords, there are differences in the
   religiosity of the two nations such that British children might be less
   inclined to endorse purpose-based explanation. Results reveal that young
   British children also possess a promiscuous teleology although they
   differ in the kinds of purposes that they attribute. Additional findings
   include a replication of earlier effects using a modified task with
   young American children. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

AB Kohlberg's moral stage scale is but one of a number of "Piagetian"
   developmental. scales proposed during the latter part of this century.
   Kohlberg claimed that his moral stages fulfilled the criteria for "hard"
   Piagetian stages-invariant sequence, qualitative change, and structured
   wholeness. He also argued that his scoring system measures a dimension
   of thought with a unique structure. To explore these contentions, we
   compare the concepts that define Kohlbergian stages with those
   associated with orders of hierarchical complexity as determined with the
   Hierarchical Complexity Scoring System, a generalized
   content-independent stage-scoring system. We conclude that the sequence
   of conceptual development specified by Kohlberg generally matches the
   sequence identified with the Hierarchical Complexity Scoring System, and
   that contract and authority concepts identified with a methodology that
   employs the Hierarchical Complexity Scoring System match the concepts
   that define theoretically analogous Kohlbergian stages above Kohlberg's
   stage 2. However, we argue that Kohlberg's stages 1 and 2 do not
   accurately describe the development of moral concepts in young children.

   reporting on gender differences in the ability to inhibit an externally
   prohibited response. Overall, females showed more restraint than males,
   but the effect size was very small (r = .03). Further analyses were
   conducted for each of several types of tasks. On one task, called the
   forbidden-object task, gender differences were appreciable, with effect
   sizes ranging from r = .11 to .20, again indicating a female advantage.
   On two other tasks, both of which involved cheating, gender differences
   were generally very small, with effect sizes ranging from -.03 to .06.
   None of the theories under consideration can account for the differences
   in results by task. Discussion focuses on evolutionary-based
   explanations for the differences in results by task. Further avenues for

AB For centuries the Yanesha have practiced complex swidden agriculture
   well adapted to the narrow valleys of the upper Peruvian Amazon. The
   1980s marked a time of increased change in the Paleazu Valley, beginning
   with the construction of a marginal highway (Carretera Marginal) in 1984
   that dissected several native communities. This study employs
   quantitative plant ecology and interviews to describe change in Yanesha
   agriculture in Laguna fifteen years later. Percent cover, planting
   density, field size, and diversities of species (alpha), field-type
   (beta), and height class did not change infields. In 1999, black earth
   and commercial agroforestry were new field types, and upland rice fields
   were absent. In home gardens, species richness persisted, while changes
   in species composition reflected species experimentation and aggregation
   of homes along the roadside (with upland soils). The road facilitated
   the flow of plants, people, and markets to influence Yanesha
   agriculture, and facilitated other agents of change during more than a
   decade of guerrilla, military, Ashaninka, and drug-trafficking
   activities plaguing the Palcazu Valley. This violence punctuated calmer
   periods when "development" was promoted by aid agencies. Agents of
   conservation included community land titles, immigration restrictions, a
   national park, protection forest, and communal reserves.

AB Background. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has been linked to
   gastritis, diarrhea, peptic ulcers, failure-to-thrive, anemia, as well
   as predisposition to gastric malignancies. Because many internationally
   adopted children have diarrhea, failure-to-thrive, and anemia on arrival
   to the US, we determined the prevalence of HP antibodies among these
   children.
   Methods. Serum samples from 226 unselected children from 18 countries
   who were evaluated in the International Adoption Clinic at New England
   Medical Center were tested for antibodies to H. pylori. The results of
   serologic screening were analyzed in relation to age at adoption, site
   of residence prior to adoption, weight and height, and the presence or
   absence of anemia, diarrhea, or intestinal parasites.
   Results. 31% of internationally adopted children had antibodies to H.
   pylori. The presence of H. pylori-antibodies was associated with
   residence in an orphanage (vs. foster care) prior to adoption, older age
   at adoption, and coinfection with intestinal parasites. No direct
   effects on height or weight were identified; no associations with
   diarrhea or anemia were found.
   Conclusions. Internationally adopted children have a high incidence of
   exposure to H. pylori as diagnosed serologically. Residence in an
   orphanage (compared with foster care), older age at adoption, and
   coinfection with intestinal parasites were more common among children
   seropositive for anti-H. pylori antibodies.

AB Background: Sociobehavioral factors influence adherence to inhaled
   corticosteroid (ICS) in adults with asthma and warrant exploration as
   explanations of apparent racial disparities in adherence.
   Objective: The purposes of this study were to identify barriers to
   adherence, potentially modifiable by healthcare providers, in a group of
   African Americans and non-African Americans and to test modifiable
   barriers as explanations of racial-ethnic differences in adherence.
   Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 85 adults (mean age, 47 +/- 15
   years; 61 [72%] female; 55 [65%] African American) with moderate or
   severe persistent asthma to determine modifiable sociobehavioral
   predictors of adherence. These were knowledge of the function of ICS,
   patient-perceived adequacy of communication with the provider, social
   support, attitude (perception of risks/benefits of ICS), depression, and
   self-efficacy. Adherence was calculated from electronic monitoring data
   as the mean of the number of doses recorded per 12 hours divided by the
   number prescribed, truncated at 100%. Past adherence, baseline severity
   of symptoms, and sociodemographics were treated as fixed confounders in
   ordinal logistic modeling.
   Results: Adherence was 60% +/- 30%. In bivariate analyses, favorable
   attitude to ICS (P = .01) was associated with better adherence. Of
   immutable predictors, African American race-ethnicity (P = .001), lower
   educational achievement (P = .01), lower household income (P = .002),
   and more baseline symptoms (P = .003) were associated with poorer
   adherence. In multivariable analysis, controlling for immutable
   predictors, favorable attitude was associated with adherence. Favorable
   attitude was associated with greater adherence in African Americans and
   non-African Americans. Controlling for immutable factors, the
   race-adherence relationship was not mediated by the mutable factors, but
   economic factors (income and insurance) were mediators.
   Conclusion: Attitude is strongly related to adherence but does not
   mediate the effect of race-ethnicity.

AB An overview of the current status of women and minorities in science
   with emphasis on the agricultural sciences is presented. Beginning with
   undergraduate studies through the professorate, women and minorities
   face an uphill battle. In this report, some of the concerns are
   elucidated. Students often face lower expectations from faculty and must
   work twice as hard to prove themselves. Often, a newly hired faculty
   member is given many more responsibilities than their white male
   counterparts. They are expected to serve the minority population, be the
   representative on committees and, at the same time, maintain academic
   productivity. This report summarizes strategies and resources for both
   students and faculty. Sensitivity and the appreciation of differences
   contribute to the awareness of the problem. A major focus for both
   groups is the need for a mentor to guide them through the system.
   Mentoring is only one aspect to aid in forward progression, and it is a
   partnership of mutual trust. Methods to establish dialogue and open
   communication are presented. The overall goal is to allow each
   individual to maintain identity, while contributing to the advancement
   of agricultural sciences through a diversity of ideas.

AB Despite existing laws aiming to prohibit gender and race based wage and
   employment discrimination, there is a disparity in numbers of minorities
   and women represented in higher ranking positions and wage earnings in
   all types of industry including academia. We designed a survey to assess
   the roles that gender and race/ethnicity play in hiring and promotion
   practices in the Animal Sciences, and the perceptions of ADSA/ASAS
   members in regards to hiring, salary, promotion, and collaboration with
   colleagues in relation to race/ethnicity, gender, and/or child rearing.
   The survey was published using Perseus Survey Solutions for the Web, and
   distributed to ADSA/ASAS members via email list serve with a link to
   survey URL. There were 1490 respondents. Seventy percent of respondents
   were male, 30% female, 85% nonminority and 15% minority. Average salary
   for males was $ 66,738, for females $ 45,968, for nonminorities $
   63,134, and for minorities $ 46,816. Stepwise regression and analysis of
   variance indicated no significant difference in salary between genders
   after age, position, and degree were accounted for; however there was a
   significant difference in salaries between nonminorities and minorities
   (P < 0.0001). The proportion of females and minorities in higher-ranking
   positions was significantly less than males and nonminorities,
   respectively. The perception of women and minorities on the effect of
   gender/race (ethnicity) on hiring, promotion, salary, and collaboration
   was also significantly different from males and nonminorities,
   respectively. Approximately 30% of the women and 20% of minorities felt
   that their gender or race/ethnicity, respectively, hindered their
   promotion, salary and collaboration among colleagues compared to
   approximately 5% of men. Significantly fewer females (32%) than males
   (77%) had children, and significantly more females (46%) felt that
   child-rearing leave negatively affected their promotion and salary than
   males (15%). These data indicate that there are issues to be ad-dressed
   regarding women and minorities in Animal Science.

AB Historically labor has been central to human interactions with the
   environment, yet environmentalists pay it scant attention. Indeed, they
   have been critical of those who foreground labor in their politics,
   socialists in particular. However, environmentalists have found the
   nineteenth-century socialist William Morris appealing despite the fact
   that he wrote extensively on labor. This paper considers the place of
   labor in the relationship between humanity and the natural world in the
   work of Morris and two of his contemporaries, the eminent scientist
   Thomas Henry Huxley, and the Fabian socialist Herbert George Wells. I
   suggest that Morris's conception of labor has much to recommend it to
   environmentalists who are also interested in issues of social justice.

AB Environmental literacy is defined as an understanding of natural systems
   combined with how they interact with human social systems. An Ohio study
   measured adults' knowledge of ecological principles as the basis of
   understanding. A telephone survey of 504 Ohio adults measured their
   knowledge of ecological principles along with their demographics. Low
   literacy adults are significantly different from those who exhibit high
   literacy. The lowest literacy group was characterized as less educated,
   below the median household income, older, female, and minority. Low
   literacy adults are less likely to engage in outdoor activities, gain
   information from environmental groups, but are more likely to gain
   information from television. Low literacy adults are more likely than
   high literacy adults to use alternative transportation. In targeting
   environmental education programs to heads of households and Ohio voters,
   adults with low environmental literacy need to be approached differently
   than those with high literacy.

AB Social isolation is a potent but little understood risk factor for
   morbidity and mortality, and its negative consequences are most profound
   among the elderly, the poor, and minorities, some of the fastest growing
   segments of the U.S. population. A steadily increasing number of people
   are living alone and are therefore more likely to experience social
   isolation. We discuss four mechanisms-attractiveness, health behavior,
   stress, and repair and maintenance-by which perceived social isolation
   might affect health. Our studies show that neither attractiveness nor
   health behaviors differ as a function of social isolation, but stress
   and repair and maintenance do seem to be factors. While socially
   isolated young adults did not report more frequent everyday stressors,
   they rated everyday events as more intensely stressful. They were also
   more likely to report passively coping with stressors, and to show
   greater vascular resistance, a mechanism of blood pressure control
   previously associated with passive coping and a risk factor for
   hypertension. Finally, they exhibited less efficacious repair and
   maintenance of physiological functioning, including slower wound healing
   and poorer sleep efficiency. These mechanisms have implications for
   designing appropriate interventions. We advocate a national health care
   plan that promotes preventive medicine, recognizes the significance of
   stress-related disorders, and supports the maintenance of social
   connections across the life span.

AB Twenty-five years ago, George Engel proposed a challenge to the
   biomedical model and its limited view of disease as biologically rooted.
   Building on Engel's work, we present the Interactive Biopsychosocial
   Model (IBM). The IBM argues for a reorientation in biomedicine where
   research, education, and clinical practice: (1) address health in
   addition to illness; (2) aim to decipher interrelated biophysical,
   psychocognitive, and social processes in health and disease, rather than
   seek a single root cause; and (3) take into account the social networks
   of the individual to achieve, maintain, and maximize health and
   well-being for individuals, their significant others, and society. Based
   on an interdisciplinary collaboration of medical and social scientists,
   this paper demonstrates the application of the IBM to understanding and
   generating hypotheses about the longitudinal relationship between
   sexuality and health, and sexuality and chronic illness (diabetes
   mellitus) at older ages. The model provides a dynamic, dyadic, framework
   for building scientific hypotheses about the etiologies and consequences
   of health, well-being, and disease throughout the life course.

AB The concept of a determinant is tied to the idea of a mechanism for
   action. Ideas from epidemiology, particularly the epidemiologic triad of
   agent, host, and environment, can help to make sense of factors that
   affect the absence of disease or that interfere with a mechanism that
   alters health. However, assembling convincing evidence for the existence
   of social determinants of health is a challenge, in part because of the
   difficulties of bridging the social and biological realms. While social
   contexts are measured using aggregates of individuals, disease and
   dysfunction occur at the individual level, leading to difficult problems
   of ecological inference. Although social factors have been shown to be
   associated with differences in mortality from specific causes, these
   factors account for only a small portion of the mortality from any
   individual cause. This suggests that the pathways through which social
   factors influence health are affected by their interactions with other
   factors.

AB Background: Key strategies advocated for lowering personal risk of
   sexual exposure to STD/HIV include having fewer partners and avoiding
   risky partners. However, few studies have systematically examined how
   well people can actually discern their sex partners' risk behaviours.
   Methods: We conducted face to face interviews with 151 heterosexual
   patients with gonorrhoea or chlamydial infection and 189 of their sex
   partners. Interviews examined the patients' perceptions of their sex
   partners' sociodemographic characteristics and risk behaviours.
   Patients' perceptions of partners were then sociometrically compared for
   agreement with partner self reports, using the kappa statistic for
   discrete variables and concordance correlation for continuous variables.
   Results: Agreement was highest for perceived partner age,
   race/ethnicity, and duration of sexual partnership; and lowest for
   knowledge of partner's work in commercial sex, number of other sex
   partners, and for perceived quality of communication within the
   partnership. Index patients commonly underestimated or overestimated
   partners' risk characteristics. Reported condom use was infrequent and
   inconsistent within partnerships.
   Conclusion: Among people with gonorrhoea or chlamydial infection,
   patients' perceptions of partners' risk behaviours often disagreed with
   the partners' self reports. Formative research should guide development
   and evaluation of interventions to enhance sexual health communication
   within partnerships and within social networks, as a potential harm
   reduction strategy to foster healthier partnerships.

AB How power is extended vertically through hierarchies and horizontally
   through industrial networks and markets is a classic issue in sociology
   that was once extensively studied by Weber. Yet it is little studied
   today. Definitions of power exclude power exercise beyond the single
   relation, as does research in exchange networks. In contrast, research
   in organizations recognizes the extension of power, but offers no theory
   to explain how it is produced or to identify the conditions which might
   further or impede it. Here the extension of power beyond the single
   relationship is called power-at-a-distance. New theory offering metric
   predictions is applied to power-at-a-distance in exchange networks. That
   theory identifies the conditions that extend power beyond the dyad and
   the conditions that tend to block that extension. Five experiments on
   contrasting structures broadly support those predictions. Relations
   between power-at-a-distance and power centralization are theorized.
   Practical problems of extending power are addressed and further research
   is proposed.

AB Karl Polanyi's 1944 book, The Great Transformation, has been recognized
   as central for the field of economic sociology, but it has not been
   subject to the same theoretical scrutiny as other classic works in the
   field. This is a particular problem in that there are central tensions
   and complexities in Polanyi's argument. This article suggests that these
   tensions can be understood as a consequence of Polanyi's changing
   theoretical orientation. The basic outline of the book was developed in
   England in the late 1930s when Polanyi was working within a specific
   type of Marxist framework. However, as he was writing the book, he
   developed several new concepts, including fictitious commodities and the
   embedded economy, that led in new directions. Because circumstances did
   not give him the time to revise his manuscript, the book is marked by a
   tension between these different moments in his own theoretical
   development. The result is that Polanyi glimpses the concept of the
   always embedded market economy, but he does not name it or elaborate it.

AB The "embeddedness'' of economic life in social relations has become a
   productive analytical principle and the basis of a penetrating critique
   of economic orthodoxy. But this critique raises another important,
   social and historical question, of how the economy became "disembedded''
   in the first place - how the multitude of transactions designated
   (somewhat arbitrarily) as economic were abstracted from the rest of
   social life and reconstituted as an object, the economy, which behaves
   according to its own logic. This article investigates the social sources
   of some innovations in economic thought that contributed to the
   emergence of the economy, particularly statistical indicators and
   mechanical models. By examining the redefinitions of the object of
   economic research developed by Irving Fisher and Wesley Mitchell in the
   1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century, I argue that the
   abstraction of the economy from the remainder of social life was a
   strategy linked to the position of these innovators within the field of
   economics, conceived as a social structure. Possessing a specialized
   scientific cultural capital, but lacking upper class background,
   contacts, and dispositions that characterized the founders of academic
   economics, Fisher and Mitchell elaborated new definitions of their
   discipline's object of study, and a new type of economic expertise.

   as the industry itself gropes toward a clearer definition of its content
   and contours. Faced with complex foresight horizons, new media firms
   must develop an organizational capacity for learning, innovation, and
   flexible adaptation to constantly changing requirements. We examine how

   Multiple regression analysis suggests that younger, better educated, and
   wealthier people place greater importance than others on wetland
   existence; the analysis also indicates that Republicans seem to value
   wetlands slightly less than Democrats and Independents. Interestingly,
   respondents' community type (e.g., rural, urban, suburban) appears to
   make relatively little difference on the importance of wetland
   existence.

AB We investigated a cluster of patients with tuberculosis (TB) in North
   Carolina and determined the extent of transmission of 1 strain of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A retrospective cohort study was conducted.
   Homeless shelter attendance and medical records for 1999 and 2000 were
   reviewed. The period of exposure to M. tuberculosis was determined, and
   shelter residents were offered TB screening. DNA fingerprinting was
   performed on 72 M. tuberculosis isolates. In addition to the initial
   index cluster of 9 patients, another 16 patients were identified.
   Isolates of M. tuberculosis from all 25 patients shared a matching DNA
   fingerprint pattern. All but 1 patient was male, 22 (88%) were African
   American, and 14 (56%) were human immunodeficiency virus-infected. An
   epidemiological link to a single shelter was identified for all but 1
   patient. Earlier recognition of this shelter as a site of M.
   tuberculosis transmission could have been facilitated through innovative
   approaches to contact investigation and through genetic typing of
   isolates.
