AB Communities at far northern latitudes must respond rapidly to the many
   complex problems that are arising from changing climate. An emerging
   body of theoretical and empirical work has explored the role that
   education plays in enhancing the resilience and adaptability of
   social-ecological systems. To foster effective, local, and timely
   responses of high-latitude communities to climate-driven
   social-ecological change, educators need access to successful and
   efficient teaching tools to foster resilience-promoting feedbacks. The
   potential for existing teaching practices to address this need, however,
   must be investigated and communicated to teachers. Here, I review the
   education and sustainability science literature for attributes of
   resilience to which formal education can contribute, and I investigate
   teaching strategies that help to enhance these attributes. Using
   examples from Alaska, I examine the potential for systems thinking,
   metacognition, scenarios thinking, citizen science, and stewardship
   learning to promote resilience in social-ecological systems. I begin to
   develop a toolbox of teaching strategies for resilience education and
   suggest that policy for formal schools incorporates these tools into
   everyday teaching practice.

AB Communication is essential to resilience, as interactions among humans
   influence how social-ecological systems (SES) respond to change. Our
   research focuses on how specific communication interactions on
   sustainability science teams, such as how people meet with each other;
   the ways in which they categorize themselves and others; the
   decision-making models they use; and their communication competencies
   affect outcomes. We describe research from a two-year study of
   communication in Maine's Sustainability Solutions Initiative, a
   statewide network of sustainability science teams. Our results
   demonstrate that decision making and communication competencies
   influenced mutual understanding, inclusion of diverse ideas, and
   progress toward sustainability-related goals. We discuss our results in
   light of key resilience themes and conclude with recommendations for
   communication design in sustainability teams for improved collaborative
   process and outcomes.

AB The integration of local knowledge and science represents an opportunity
   to enhance the understanding of interrelations among climate, hydrology,
   and socioeconomic systems while providing mutual benefits to scientists
   and rural communities. Insight from rural Alaskans helped to identify a
   social-ecological threshold used to model potential driftwood harvest
   from the Yukon River. Information from residents of Tanana, Alaska, was
   combined with scientific data to model driftwood harvest rates. Modeling
   results estimated that between 1980 and 2010, hydrologic factors alone
   were responsible for a 29% decrease in the annual wood harvest, which
   approximately balanced a 23% reduction in wood demand because of a
   decline in number of households. The community's installation of
   wood-fired boilers in 2007 created a threshold increase (76%) in wood
   demand that is not met by driftwood harvest. Modeling analyses of
   numerous climatic scenarios illustrated that increases in hydrologic
   variability would decrease the reliability of future driftwood harvest.
   Economic analyses demonstrated that increased climatic variability could
   have serious economic consequences for subsistence users while demanding
   more of their time. Lost time is important because it reduces their
   availability for performing other subsistence activities and learning to
   adapt to climate-related challenges. Our research may benefit
   communities by providing a tool that can be used to predict the timing
   and duration of driftwood runs. Information gathered from discussions
   with local stakeholders provided critical information for model
   development and thus provided a better understanding of regional
   social-ecological dynamics. Our research also illustrates the potential
   for regional-scale adaptations to limit the social-ecological impacts of
   environmental change, while providing economic opportunities and energy
   independence that reduce their vulnerability to variations in climate.

AB Recently, social learning has been recognized as a means to foster
   adaptation to changing conditions, and more broadly, social-ecological
   systems resilience. However, the discussion of social learning and
   social-ecological resilience in different cultural contexts is limited.
   In this study we introduce the Korean Village Groves Restoration Project
   (VGRP) through the lens of social learning, and discuss implications of
   the VGRP for resilience in villages impacted by industrialization and
   decline of traditional forest resources. We conducted open-ended
   interviews with VGRP leaders, government and NGO officials, and
   residents in four villages in South Korea, and found that villages
   responded to ecosystem change in ways that could be explained by the
   characteristics of social learning including interaction, integration,
   systems orientation, and reflection. However, the processes of learning
   varied among the four villages, and were associated with different
   levels of learning and different learning outcomes related to changes in
   village grove management and governance. The cultural and historical
   context can be used to help understand social learning processes and
   their outcomes in the Korean cases.

AB We look to a particular social-ecological system, the restoration
   community in Rhode Island, USA and the rivers, wetlands, marshes, and
   estuaries they work to protect, to draw connections between
   communication, community involvement, and ecological restoration project
   success. Offering real-world examples drawn from interviews with 27
   local, state, federal, and nonprofit restoration managers, we synthesize
   the mechanisms that managers found effective to argue that the
   communication employed by resource managers in each phase of the
   restoration process, in prioritization, implementation, and monitoring,
   and for garnering broad-based support, shapes the quality of public
   engagement in natural resources management, which, in turn, can impact
   the stakeholder, learning, and ecological success of restoration
   projects. Despite the possible trade-offs and conflicts between social
   and ecological outcomes, we suggest that managers need to consider their
   desired social-ecological outcomes and work from the outset to
   deliberately design mechanisms for communication and public engagement
   that weave community stakeholders into all phases of restoration
   projects in sustained and consequential ways.

AB In this paper, I address a gap in the literature on environmental social
   science by providing a basic rubric for the conduct of empirical
   research in this interdisciplinary field. Current literature displays a
   healthy diversity of methods and techniques, but this has also been
   accompanied by a lack of consistency in the way in which research in
   this area is done. In part this can be seen as resulting from a lack in
   supporting texts that would provide a basis for this consistency.
   Although relevant methods texts do exist, these are not written with
   this type of research explicitly in mind, and so translating them to
   this field can be awkward. This paper is designed to fill this gap and
   enable more consistency in the conduct of empirical environmental social
   science. Basic types of research designs and methods are covered, as are
   criteria for evaluating these methods.

AB In rural economies with missing or incomplete markets, idiosyncratic
   risk is frequently pooled through informal networks. Idiosyncratic
   shocks, however, are not limited to private goods but can also restrict
   an individual from partaking in or benefiting from a collective
   activity. In these situations, a group must decide whether to provide
   insurance to the affected member. We describe results of a laboratory
   experiment designed to test whether a simple sharing institution can
   sustain risk pooling in a social dilemma with idiosyncratic risk. We
   tested whether risk could be pooled without a commitment device and,
   separately, whether effective risk pooling induced greater cooperation
   in the social dilemma. We found that even in the absence of a commitment
   device or reputational considerations, subjects voluntarily pooled risk,
   thereby reducing variance in individual earnings. In spite of effective
   risk pooling, however, cooperation in the social dilemma was unaffected.

AB Context: Athletic trainers have traditionally conceptualized
   rehabilitation programs in terms of 3 distinct physiologic phases;
   however, these phases appear to neglect athletes' psychosocial responses
   to their injuries.
   Objective: To document injured athletes' psychosocial responses during
   the different phases of injury rehabilitation.
   Design: Qualitative study.
   Setting: National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II university
   in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 8 previously injured athletes
   (4 men and 4 women) participated in the study.
   Data Collection and Analysis: We collected participant data by using
   semistructured interviews, transcribed verbatim and analyzed by directed
   content analysis. Established themes were triangulated to determine
   trustworthiness.
   Results: Initially, athletes' cognitive appraisals were predominately
   negative in nature, leading to negative emotions. These appraisals
   changed after diagnosis and when moving to the
   reaction-to-rehabilitation phase and the reaction-to-sport phase. During
   the reaction-to-rehabilitation phase, athletes reported mixed cognitive
   appraisals and identified frustration as the main emotional response.
   When returning to sport, athletes reflected on the lessons learned, yet
   they expressed some doubts related to their ability to return to play.
   These cognitive appraisals served as a precursor to the resulting
   emotional responses of nervousness and reinjury anxiety, as well as
   excitement. Throughout the various phases of rehabilitation, athletes
   reported seeking out social support: initially from significant others
   and then from their athletic trainers during the
   reaction-to-rehabilitation phase.
   Conclusions: The results appear to support the use of the integrated
   model of psychological response to sport injury and the rehabilitation
   process and the 3 phases of rehabilitation as a framework for
   understanding how physical and psychosocial factors may interact during
   sport-injury rehabilitation. Understanding this interaction may help
   athletic trainers provide better care to their injured athletes.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between children's weight and
   social competence.
   Methods. We used data from the third-and fifth-grade waves of the
   nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,
   Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (n = 8346) to examine changes in
   children's weight and social competence.
   Results. Obesity in third grade was not associated with subsequent
   changes in social competence between third and fifth grade, but social
   competence in third grade was associated with subsequent development of
   obesity. Among normal-weight children, having higher social competence
   in third grade was associated with lower odds of becoming overweight
   (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80 +/- 60.09; P < .05) or obese (OR = 0.20 +/-
   60.08; P < .001). In addition, obese children with higher social
   competence were more likely to lose weight between third and fifth grade
   (OR = 1.43 +/- 60.25; P < .05).
   Conclusions. Obesity and impaired social competence often occur together
   and have serious implications for children's well-being. More knowledge
   about how weight and social competence affect one another could inform
   interventions to promote children's social development and reduce
   obesity.

AB The social context of the early HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States
   provided fertile ground for rumors about transmission. Today, however,
   rumors about HIV/AIDS persist only within the African American public.
   Focus group and public discourse data reveal the content and
   distribution of HIV/AIDS origin and conspiracy rumors. Rumor and
   contemporary legend theory allows reinterpretation of rumors as a
   measure of trust between the African American public and health
   professionals, not as evidence of ignorance or of historical racial
   oppression. To improve public health results in the African American
   community, HIV/AIDS efforts must acknowledge the sources and meanings of
   rumors, include rumors as a measure of trust, and address the underlying
   distrust that the rumors signify.

AB A mail survey of all residents in the surface and ground watersheds of
   an 11 lake area in central Wisconsin was conducted in 2012 to assess the
   behaviors, attitudes, awareness of issues, and attachment to lakes to
   incorporate social information into lake management. Place attachment is
   a complex concept composed of many dimensions to describe an
   individual's relationship to a place. This study tested the dimensional
   structure, validity, and transferability of a previously developed place
   meanings scale. The factors were then further tested to see if any
   differences existed among type of ownership (lakefront property owners
   versus non-lakefront property owners), involvement in lake groups, and
   seasonal residency in the level of meanings assigned to the lakes.
   Significant differences were found among type of ownership, involvement
   in lake groups, and seasonal residency on several place meaning domains.
   The dimensional scale structure revealed through this study differed
   somewhat from the original place meanings scale being tested, although
   the overall consistency on a new population has provided evidence for
   the transferability of place meanings scales in similar settings.
   Implications for management include the need to develop targeted
   outreach plans based on what is valued by residents instead of relying
   only on lake-by-lake segmentation.

   recognize their dependence upon and became united around a common vision
   for a thriving Great Lakes basin. However, in 2063 the environment and
   economy are out of balance; citizens are constantly forced to make
   difficult trade-offs. Climate warming, geopolitical pressures such as
   environmental refugees, an aging population, and a sluggish economy have
   overwhelmed the region's efforts to find a balance that would have
   ensured human prosperity without diminishing the integrity of the Great
   Lakes basin. This narrative illustrates the time period 2013 to 2063,
   depicting how the collision of multiple drivers of change cause
   declining social and environmental conditions, and force a gradual
   transformation in societal values. While society was initially
   complacent, the groundwork for social transformation was laid over three
   decades. Impacts of education programs, opposition to environmentally
   degrading natural resource extraction, and widespread effects of both
   failing social services and physical infrastructure galvanize grassroots
   mobilization of communities around "iceless hockey rink" meetings. These
   meetings act as a catalyst, translating this social movement into
   governance that works towards a common vision based on shared values.
   However, despite innovative technologies and cohesive efforts, it
   becomes obvious that attempts to oppose the complex and interrelated
   forces driving changes in the Great Lakes region are limited. These
   efforts come at huge economic costs, and the harsh reality forces people
   in the region to make difficult decisions that threaten some facets of
   economic, social and environmental well-being while protecting others.

   We still know little about whether and how the auditory hallucinations
   associated with serious psychotic disorder shift across cultural
   boundaries.
   Aims
   To compare auditory hallucinations across three different cultures, by
   means of an interview-based study.
   Method
   An anthropologist and several psychiatrists interviewed participants
   from the USA, India and Ghana, each sample comprising 20 persons who
   heard voices and met the inclusion criteria of schizophrenia, about
   their experience of voices.
   Results
   Participants in the USA were more likely to use diagnostic labels and to
   report violent commands than those in India and Ghana, who were more
   likely than the Americans to report rich relationships with their voices
   and less likely to describe the voices as the sign of a violated mind.
   Conclusions
   These observations suggest that the voice-hearing experiences of people
   with serious psychotic disorder are shaped by local culture. These
   differences may have clinical implications.

AB Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the association
   between type of health insurance (Medicaid vs. private) and uptake of
   diagnostic testing for fetal aneuploidy after a positive screening test
   result.
   Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women who
   underwent aneuploidy screening in the first and/or second trimesters of
   pregnancy and received positive results. The characteristics of and
   outcomes for women with Medicaid were compared with those of women with
   private insurance in both univariable and multivariable analyses.
   Results In this study, 75 women with Medicaid and 75 with private
   insurance were analyzed. Those with Medicaid were younger (33.8 vs. 36.9
   years, p < 0.01), and more likely to be of non-white race/ethnicity (88
   vs. 27%, p < 0.01), unmarried (65 vs. 19%, p < 0.01), non-English
   speaking (12 vs. 0%, p < 0.01), and multiparous (76 vs. 59%, p = 0.02).
   They also were less likely to undergo diagnostic testing after a
   positive aneuploidy screen (35 vs. 57%, p < 0.01). In multivariable
   analysis, those with Medicaid remained significantly less likely to
   undergo diagnostic testing (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval,
   0.09-0.80).
   Conclusion Women with Medicaid are less likely than women with private
   insurance to undergo diagnostic testing after positive screening for
   aneuploidy. These results emphasize the potential importance of improved
   counseling for low-income women.

AB Microevolutionary projections use empirical estimates of genetic
   covariation between physical or psychological phenotypes and
   reproductive success to forecast changes in the population distributions
   of those phenotypes over time. The validity of these projections depends
   on relatively consistent heritabilities of fertility-relevant outcomes
   and consistent genetic covariation between fertility and other physical
   or psychological phenotypes across generations. However,
   well-documented, rapidly changing mean trends in the level and timing of
   fertility may have been accompanied by differences in the genetic
   mechanisms of fertility. Using a sample of 933 adult twin pairs from the
   Midlife Development in the United States study, we demonstrate that
   genetic influences on completed fertility and age at first birth were
   trivial for the 1920-1935 birth cohort, but rose substantially for the
   1936-1955 birth cohort. For the 1956-1970 birth cohort, genetic
   influences on completed fertility, but not age at first birth,
   persisted. Because the heritability of fertility is subject to change
   dynamically with the social context, it is difficult to project
   selection pressures or the rate at which selection will occur.

AB Objective: This study sought to determine how socioeconomic status (SES)
   changes during the transition from adolescence into adulthood, and to
   understand the effects of SES on drinking behaviors in early adulthood
   among U.S. Whites and Blacks. Method: Secondary data analysis was
   conducted using three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a school-based sample of
   adolescents (Grades 7-12) followed through adulthood (age range: 25-31
   years). Through latent class analysis, SES was operationalized as
   economic (i.e., income, home ownership) and human capital (i.e.,
   education, occupation). Drinking behavior was categorized into no
   past-year use, current drinking without weekly heavy episodic drinking
   (BED), and weekly BED. Models were stratified by race: Whites (n =
   5,248) and Blacks (n = 1,875). Results: For Whites, four economic
   capital groups (persistently low, upward, downward, and persistently
   high) and five human capital groups (persistently low, upward with work,
   upward with school, downward with work, and persistently high) were
   found. Blacks had roughly similar SES groups as Whites but with lower
   economic and human capital levels across all groups and without downward
   groups in either domain. Among both Whites and Blacks, lower economic
   and human capital groups reported higher abstinence. Persistently low
   Blacks, however, reported higher BED, whereas persistently low Whites
   did not. Moreover, economically upward Whites reported lower BED,
   whereas upwardly mobile Blacks did not. Conclusions: Racial disparities
   were evident by economic and human capital during the transition into
   adulthood. Although abstinence profiles were similar for Whites and
   Blacks, both persistently low and upward trajectory groups signified
   differential BED risks. Future research should examine the mechanisms by
   which SES trajectories affect drinking behaviors.

AB Studies have established a graded association between mental health and
   socioeconomic status (SES). However, scarce research has examined the
   impact of substance use disorders (SUD) and depression comorbidity on
   SES. We use data from the Woodlawn Study, a longitudinal cohort study,
   which recruited a cohort of first graders from Chicago starting
   1966-1967 (N=1242). Analyses focus on those interviewed in young
   adulthood and followed up through midlife. Regression analyses adjusting
   for childhood confounders showed that young adults with depression and
   SUD comorbidity had higher likelihood of having any periods of
   unemployment, higher likelihood of being unemployed for 3 or more
   months, and lower household income in midlife than those with neither
   disorder. Moreover, young adults with SUD without depression had higher
   odds of having any periods of unemployment and higher odds of being
   unemployed for 3 or more months than those with neither disorder.
   Findings point to the possibility of social selection where depression
   and SUD comorbidity contributes to a downward drift in SES. Clinical
   interventions that integrate the treatment of SUD and depression may be
   more effective at reducing socioeconomic disparities among minority
   populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coyote (Canis latrans) has dramatically expanded its range to
   include the cities and suburbs of the western US and those of the
   Eastern Seaboard. Highly adaptable, this newcomer's success causes
   conflicts with residents, necessitating research to understand the
   distribution of coyotes in urban landscapes. Citizen science can be a
   powerful approach toward this aim. However, to date, the few studies
   that have used publicly reported coyote sighting data have lacked an
   in-depth consideration of human socioeconomic variables, which we
   suggest are an important source of overlooked variation in data that
   describe the simultaneous occurrence of coyotes and humans. We explored
   the relative importance of socioeconomic variables compared to those
   describing coyote habitat in predicting human-coyote encounters in
   highly-urbanized Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, USA using 707
   public reports of coyote sightings, high-resolution land cover, US
   Census data, and an autologistic multi-model inference approach. Three
   of the four socioeconomic variables which we hypothesized would have an
   important influence on encounter probability, namely building density,
   household income, and occupation, had effects at least as large as or
   larger than coyote habitat variables. Our results indicate that the
   consideration of readily available socioeconomic variables in the
   analysis of citizen science data improves the prediction of species
   distributions by providing insight into the effects of important factors
   for which data are often lacking, such as resource availability for
   coyotes on private property and observer experience. Managers should
   take advantage of citizen scientists in human-dominated landscapes to
   monitor coyotes in order to understand their interactions with humans.

AB Collaboration between different actors is crucial for responding to the

   highlight the importance of information sharing, social cohesion and
   mutual goals that constitute social capital. We test and demonstrate how
   these ties relate to each other and which ones are crucial for
   collaboration in a government funded collaborative network for forest
   biodiversity and Siberian Jay conservation in Finland. Our analysis
   shows that short-term governance networks operate on trust. Seemingly,
   differences in goals can be put aside for a collective good; that is,
   being able to cooperate and find solutions to conservation issues.
   Additionally, exchange and flow of information are a necessity in
   network functions. However, a network may be successful despite
   difficulties in flow of information, as our case of Siberian Jay Network
   shows. Using both qualitative and quantitative evidence, our analysis
   serves as a test for the usefulness of social network analysis method in
   bringing depth to understanding of both formal and informal governance

AB Federally funded research on the ethical, legal, and social implications
   (ELSI) of genomics includes a programmatic charge to consider
   policy-relevant questions and to communicate findings in venues that
   help inform the policy-making process. In addressing this goal,
   investigators must consider the range of policies that are relevant to
   human genetics; how foundational research in bioethics, law, and the
   social sciences might inform those policies; and the potential
   professional issues that this translational imperative raises for ELSI
   investigators. We review these questions in light of experiences from a
   consortium of federally funded Centers of Excellence in ELSI Research,
   and offer a set of policy recommendations for program design and
   evaluation of ELSI research. We conclude that it would be a mistake to
   require that ELSI research programs demonstrate a direct impact on
   science or health policy; however, ELSI researchers can take steps to
   increase the relevance of their work to policy makers. Similarly,
   funders of ELSI research who are concerned with facilitating policy
   development can help by building cross-disciplinary translational
   research capacities, and universities can take steps to make
   policy-relevant research more rewarding for scholars in the humanities,
   social sciences, and law.

AB Sociological research on moral panics, long understood as "struggles for
   cultural power," has focused on the social groups and media conditions
   that enable moral panics to emerge, and on the consequences of moral
   panics for the social control systems of societies. In this article I
   turn instead to modeling the specific cultural process of how the
   conditions for a moral panic are turned into an actual moral panic,
   moving the understanding of moral panic away from its Durkheimian
   origins and towards a process-relational cultural sociology. Drawing on
   Roland Barthes' theory of myth and Kenneth Burke's dramatism, the paper
   posits the cultural process of resignification via synecdoche and
   metanarrative as the driver of the disproportion, concern, hostility,
   consensus, and volatility of moral panics. This process can be carefully
   traced in the case of the Salem Witch Trials; a retrospective reading
   reveals the same process at work in the "Mods and Rockers" panic
   analyzed by Stanley Cohen. Beyond moral panics, theorizing
   resignification as a non-exclusive counterpoint to framing and
   ideational embeddedness enriches the theoretical repertoire of cultural
   sociology. "Deep culture" and mythological signification can, using the
   schema proposed here, be understood as practical
   accomplishments-rhetorical responses to particular situations that, when
   performed successfully, legitimate violence and other forms of
   domination.

AB Although many researchers have estimated crash modification factors
   (CMFs) for specific treatments (or countermeasures), there is a lack of
   studies that explored the heterogeneous effects of roadway
   characteristics on crash frequency among treated sites. Generally, the
   CMF estimated by before-after studies represents overall safety effects
   of the treatment in a fixed value. However, as each treated site has
   different roadway characteristics, there is a need to assess the
   variation of CMFs among the treated sites with different roadway
   characteristics through crash modification functions (CMFunctions). The
   main objective of this research is to determine relationships between
   the safety effects of adding a bike lane and the roadway characteristics
   through (1) evaluation of CMFs for adding a bike lane using
   observational before-after with empirical Bayes (EB) and cross-sectional
   methods, and (2) development of simple and full CMFunctions which are
   describe the CMF in a function of roadway characteristics of the sites.
   Data was collected for urban arterials in Florida, and the
   Florida-specific full SPFs were developed. Moreover, socio-economic
   parameters were collected and included in CMFunctions and SPFs (1) to
   capture the effects of the variables that represent volume of bicyclists
   and (2) to identify general relationship between the CMFs and these
   characteristics. In order to achieve better performance of CMFunctions,
   data mining techniques were used.
   The results of both before-after and cross-sectional methods show that
   adding a bike lane on urban arterials has positive safety effects (i.e.,
   CMF <1) for all crashes and bike crashes. It was found that adding a
   bike lane is more effective in reducing bike crashes than all crashes.
   It was also found that the CMFs vary across the sites with different
   roadway characteristics. In particular, annual average daily traffic
   (AADT), number of lanes, AADT per lane, median width, bike lane width,
   and lane width are significant characteristics that affect the variation
   in safety effects of adding a bike lane. Some socio-economic
   characteristics such as bike commuter rate and population density also
   have significant effect on the variation in CMFs. The findings suggest
   that full CMFunctions showed better model fit than simple CMFuncttions
   since they account for the heterogeneous effects of multiple roadway and
   socio-economic characteristics. The proposed CMFunctions provide
   insights into bike lane design and selection of sites for bike lane
   installation for reducing crashes. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   interventions and thus, by extension, the potential for data to be
   analyzed that may shed light on the influence of such demographic
   variables on safety and/or efficacy. English-language publications
   retrieved from PubMed and from references of retrieved papers describing
   clinical studies of curative interventions were read and demographic,
   recruitment year, and intervention-type details were noted. Variables of
   interest included participation by sex, age, and race; changes in
   participation rates by recruitment year; and differences in
   participation by intervention type. Of 151 publications, 23% reported
   full demographic data of study enrollees, and only 6% reported
   conducting efficacy analyses by demographic variables. Included studies
   recruited participants from 1991 to 2011. No study conducted safety
   analyses by demographic variables. The representation of women, older
   people, and nonwhites did not reflect national or international burdens
   of HIV infection. Participation of demographic subgroups differed by
   intervention type and study location. Rates of participation of
   demographic groups of interest did not vary with time. Limited data
   suggest efficacy, particularly of early therapy initiation followed by
   treatment interruption, may vary by demographic variables, in this case
   sex. More data are needed to determine associations between demographic
   characteristics and safety/efficacy of curative interventions. Studies
   should be powered to conduct such analyses and cure-relevant measures
   should be standardized.

AB More than 130 million women worldwide have undergone female genital
   cutting (FGC). FGC is practiced in parts of Africa and Asia, in
   societies with various cultures and religions. Reasons for the
   continuing practice of FGC include rite of passage, preserving chastity,
   ensuring marriageability, religion, hygiene, improving fertility, and
   enhancing sexual pleasure for men. The World Health Organization has
   classified FGC into four types depending on the extent of tissue
   removed. Immediate complications include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis,
   and death. Long-term complications include pain, scarring, urinary
   issues, and poor obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Efforts are being made
   nationally and internationally to eradicate this practice. In December
   2012, the UN General Assembly accepted a resolution on the elimination
   of FGC. Although it is illegal to perform FGC in the United States,
   women from countries where the practice occurs have been and are still
   immigrating here. Many enter as refugees from war-torn, famine-stricken,
   or politically unstable countries. They bring along with them their
   cultural pride, health complications, and fears of being judged when
   visiting a health provider. A deeper understanding of the history,
   cultural beliefs, medical complications, and methods of surgical
   reconstruction is necessary to provide culturally and linguistically
   competent care to this unique group of women.

   Qualitative in-depth interviews with 48 Muslim Americans reveal they
   experience more intense forms of questioning and contestation about
   their status as an American once they are identified as a Muslim.
   Because Islam has become synonymous with terrorism, patriarchy,
   misogyny, and anti-American sentiments, when participants were
   identified as Muslims they were treated as if they were a threat to
   American cultural values and national security. Their racialization
   occurred when they experienced de-Americanization, having privileges
   associated with citizenship such as being viewed as a valued member of
   society denied to them. This article highlights the importance of gender
   in the process of racialization. It also demonstrates the need for race
   scholarship to move beyond a black and white paradigm in order to
   include the racialized experiences of second and third generations of

   walkable urban form varies by neighborhood sociodemographic composition,
   region, and urbanicity across the United States. Using linear regression
   models and 2000-2001 US Census data, we investigated the relationship
   between 5 neighborhood census characteristics (income, education,
   racial/ethnic composition, age distribution, and sex) and 5 walkability
   indicators in almost 65,000 census tracts in 48 states and the District
   of Columbia. Data on the built environment were obtained from the RAND
   Corporation's (Santa Monica, California) Center for Population Health
   and Health Disparities (median block length, street segment, and node
   density) and the US Geological Survey's National Land Cover Database
   (proportion open space and proportion highly developed). Disadvantaged
   neighborhoods and those with more educated residents were more walkable
   (i.e., shorter block length, greater street node density, more developed
   land use, and higher density of street segments). However, tracts with a
   higher proportion of children and older adults were less walkable (fewer
   street nodes and lower density of street segments), after adjustment for
   region and level of urbanicity. Research and policy on the
   walkability-health link should give nuanced attention to the gap between
   persons living in walkable areas and those for whom walkability has the
   most to offer.

   status had a differential effect on continuous depression outcomes
   between the intervention and usual care over 18 months. They also
   assessed differences between the intervention and usual care in quality
   of depression care and dichotomous clinical outcomes (a decrease of at
   least 50% in depressive symptom severity and patient-rated improvement
   on the Patient Global Improvement Scale).
   Results: The treatment effect was significantly associated with
   insurance status. Compared with patients with commercial insurance,
   those with no insurance or with public coverage had greater recovery
   from depression symptoms with collaborative care than with usual care
   over the 18-month follow-up period. At the 12-month follow-up, the
   effect size for depression improvement compared with usual care among
   women with no insurance or with public coverage was 0.81 (95% CI=0.41,
   0.95), whereas it was 0.39 (95% CI=70.08, 0.84) for women with
   commercial insurance.
   Conclusions: Collaborative depression care adapted to
   obstetrics-gynecology settings had a greater impact on depression
   outcomes for socially disadvantaged women with no insurance or with
   public coverage compared with women with commercial insurance.

AB The health and healthcare of sexual minorities have recently been
   identified as priorities for health research and policy.
   To compare the health and healthcare experiences of sexual minorities
   with heterosexual people of the same gender, adjusting for age,
   race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
   Multivariate analyses of observational data from the 2009/2010 English
   General Practice Patient Survey.
   The survey was mailed to 5.56 million randomly sampled adults registered
   with a National Health Service general practice (representing 99 % of
   England's adult population). In all, 2,169,718 people responded (39 %
   response rate), including 27,497 people who described themselves as gay,
   lesbian, or bisexual.
   Two measures of health status (fair/poor overall self-rated health and
   self-reported presence of a longstanding psychological condition) and
   four measures of poor patient experiences (no trust or confidence in the
   doctor, poor/very poor doctor communication, poor/very poor nurse
   communication, fairly/very dissatisfied with care overall).
   Sexual minorities were two to three times more likely to report having a
   longstanding psychological or emotional problem than heterosexual
   counterparts (age-adjusted for 5.2 % heterosexual, 10.9 % gay, 15.0 %
   bisexual for men; 6.0 % heterosexual, 12.3 % lesbian and 18.8 % bisexual
   for women; p < 0.001 for each). Sexual minorities were also more likely
   to report fair/poor health (adjusted 19.6 % heterosexual, 21.8 % gay,
   26.4 % bisexual for men; 20.5 % heterosexual, 24.9 % lesbian and 31.6 %
   bisexual for women; p < 0.001 for each).
   Adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and health status, sexual
   minorities were about one and one-half times more likely than
   heterosexual people to report unfavorable experiences with each of four
   aspects of primary care. Little of the overall disparity reflected
   concentration of sexual minorities in low-performing practices.
   Sexual minorities suffer both poorer health and worse healthcare
   experiences. Efforts should be made to recognize the needs and improve
   the experiences of sexual minorities. Examining patient experience
   disparities by sexual orientation can inform such efforts.

AB This article argues that neoliberalism is a critical public issue
   influencing the apparently private troubles of college students and
   teachers. For example, earning a college degree has become ever more
   important for success; yet, because of declining state support for
   public education, students are taking on extraordinary levels of debt.
   As a result, learning is being pushed aside by vocational and other
   considerations that result from neoliberal policy imperatives. For
   teachers, the decline of the tenure system means fewer full-time faculty
   members to do more work and fewer people who have the protection to
   speak out against neoliberal excess. Unless sociology teachers (along
   with teachers in other disciplines) do something to change the current
   system, higher education will continue to decline.

AB In this study we explore how absence from sociology classes is
   understood by undergraduate students at University College Dublin. The
   authors use Scott and Lyman's (1968) concept of accounts to explore
   absence sociologically. Drawing on data generated via focus groups, an
   open-ended questionnaire, and an online survey with students, we outline
   the different excuses and justifications for missing classes used by
   students and present their understanding of attendance at classes as an
   optional feature of student life. Individual students' attendance
   differed across courses, throwing doubt on the usefulness of
   individual-level frameworks for understanding attendance. We argue that
   decisions to attend are influenced by a variety of contextual issues,
   including knowledge of legitimate accounts for the setting, pedagogic
   approaches in use, and students' perceptions of the usefulness of
   classes. We conclude that to counter the trend of declining attendance
   and enhance student learning, it is important to better understand how
   both local norms, values, curriculum design, and assessment practices
   combine to facilitate students' absences. Focusing on accounts allows us
   to better understand student absence rather than accepting this as an
   inevitable feature of contemporary student behavior about which nothing
   much can be done.

AB Instructors at non-research institutions are less able to expose their
   students to research firsthand. Utilizing human subject pools (HSPs) in
   class may be a solution. Given that HSPs tend to be used in introduction
   to psychology classes at research institutions, we examine a community
   college HSP to answer three questions: (1) Do community college students
   positively assess the educational value of HSP experience? (2) Can
   sociology students perceive HSP experience to be as educationally
   effective as psychology students? (3) Can online students perceive HSP
   experience to be as educationally effective as in-person students?
   Results indicate that not only did community college students hold
   positive evaluations of their HSP experience, but sociology and online
   students also felt they benefited as much as psychology or in-person
   students. HSPs were also considered particularly effective by students
   taking research methods. HSP participation may be a viable teaching tool
   for sociology instructors at non-research schools.

AB Instructing students in sociological theory is a foundational part of

   Sociology can find a number of activities designed to improve students'
   understanding of sociological theory in their general theory courses,
   but there are fewer activities designed to improve student learning in
   more substantive coursework like the sociology of religion. The purpose
   of this note is to describe and evaluate an activity designed to
   illustrate one such theory: Peter Berger's theory of secularization.
   Evidence of student learning is based on multiple forms of assessment
   including a pretest-posttest design, students' exam responses, and
   students' open-ended reflections about their experience during the
   simulation. Implications for the sociology of religion and the broader

AB Sociology instructors have begun adding student response systems to
   support conceptual application in college courses. While little has been
   published about how these devices affect learning behavior in our

   learning by encouraging engagement through collaborative talk. This
   paper presents mixed-methods data examining clicker use in two sociology
   courses (2007 to 2013). Survey, observation, and interview data suggest
   student response systems may enhance class discussions by supporting

AB AimsThis study examined the impact of tobacco retail outlets on
   cessation outcomes over time among non-treatment-seeking smokers and
   assessed differences by neighborhood poverty and individual factors.
   DesignObservational longitudinal cohort study using geospatial data. We
   used generalized estimating equations to examine cessation outcomes in
   relation to the proximity and density of tobacco retail outlets near the
   home.
   SettingEight large Designated Media Areas across the United States.
   ParticipantsA total of 2377 baseline smokers followed over three waves
   from 2008 to 2010.
   MeasurementsOutlet addresses were identified through North American
   Industry Classification System codes and proximity and density measures
   were constructed for each participant at each wave. Outcomes included
   past 30-day abstinence and pro-cessation attitudes.
   FindingsSmokers in high poverty census tracts living between 500m and
   1.9km from an outlet were over two times more likely to be abstinent
   than those living fewer than 500m from an outlet (P<0.05). Density
   within 500m of home was associated with reduced abstinence [odds ratio
   (OR)=0.94; confidence interval (CI)=0.90, 0.98) and lower pro-cessation
   attitudes (Coeff=-0.07, CI=-0.10, -0.03) only in high poverty areas. In
   low poverty areas, density within 500m was associated with greater
   pro-cessation attitudes (OR=0.06; CI=0.01, 0.12). Gender, education and
   heaviness of smoking did not moderate the impact of outlet proximity and
   density on cessation outcomes.
   ConclusionsIn the United States, density of tobacco outlets within 500m
   of the home residence appears to be negatively associated with smoking
   abstinence and pro-cessation attitudes only in poor areas.

AB Contemporary human biology research employs a unique skillset for
   biocultural analysis. This skillset is highly appropriate for the study
   of health disparities because disparities result from the interaction of
   social and biological factors over one or more generations. Health
   disparities research almost always involves disadvantaged communities
   owing to the relationship between social position and health in
   stratified societies. Successful research with disadvantaged communities
   involves a specific approach, the community partnership model, which
   creates a relationship beneficial for researcher and community.
   Paramount is the need for trust between partners. With trust
   established, partners share research goals, agree on research methods
   and produce results of interest and importance to all partners. Results
   are shared with the community as they are developed; community partners
   also provide input on analyses and interpretation of findings. This
   article describes a partnership-based, 20 year relationship between
   community members of the Akwesasne Mohawk Nation and researchers at the
   University at Albany. As with many communities facing health disparity
   issues, research with Native Americans and indigenous peoples generally
   is inherently politicized. For Akwesasne, the contamination of their
   lands and waters is an environmental justice issue in which the
   community has faced unequal exposure to, and harm by environmental
   toxicants. As human biologists engage in more partnership-type research,
   it is important to understand the long term goals of the community and
   what is at stake so the research circle can be closed and helicopter'
   style research avoided. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 27:6-15, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

AB ObjectivesObesity is treated within medicine, public health, and applied
   sciences as a biomedical fact with urgent health implications; obesity
   is also, however, a social fact and one that reveals biomedical concerns
   can lead to social suffering. Translation of social science-oriented
   obesity research for broader public good requires navigation of the
   space between these polemical and seemingly mutually exclusive
   positions.
   MethodsUsing examples from our own current programs of biocultural
   research, we explain the opportunities and ongoing challenges of efforts
   to bridge the chasm between critique and intervention when the topic
   under discussion is obesity. The examples range from cross-population
   analyses of human variation and the implications for how we measure and
   classify obesity to biocultural research into fat-stigma to
   translational research conducted as part of a larger collaboration
   across multiple institutions.
   Results and ConclusionsTranslation of social science-oriented obesity
   research for broader public good requires collaborative work across
   disciplines and fields, as well as between academics, professionals
   working in public health and medicine, policy makers, and other key
   stakeholders. Translation efforts must acknowledge and develop practical
   programs addressing the obesity crisis, but also are compelled to
   question core assumptions upon which obesity-reduction interventions
   have thus far been based. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 27:61-68, 2015. (c) 2014

AB OBJECTIVES: Less than 1 in 5 patients receive hepatocellular carcinoma
   surveillance; however, most studies were performed in racially and
   socioeconomically homogenous populations, and few used guideline-based
   definitions for surveillance. The study objective was to characterize
   guideline-consistent hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance rates and
   identify determinants of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among a
   racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort of cirrhotic patients.
   METHODS: We retrospectively characterized hepatocellular carcinoma
   surveillance among cirrhotic patients followed between July 2008 and
   July 2011 at an urban safety-net hospital. Inconsistent surveillance was
   defined as at least 1 screening ultrasound during the 3-year period,
   annual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds every 12
   months, and biannual surveillance was defined as screening ultrasounds
   every 6 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to
   identify predictors of surveillance.
   RESULTS: Of 904 cirrhotic patients, 603 (67%) underwent inconsistent
   surveillance. Failure to recognize cirrhosis was a significant barrier
   to surveillance use (P < .001). Inconsistent surveillance was associated
   with insurance status (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.03-1.98), multiple primary care visits per year (OR, 2.63; 95%
   CI, 1.86-3.71), multiple hepatology visits per year (OR, 3.75; 95% CI,
   2.64-5.33), African American race (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.99),
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cause (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.98), and
   extrahepatic cancer (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77). Only 98 (13.4%) of
   730 patients underwent annual surveillance, and only 13 (1.7%) of 786
   had biannual surveillance.
   CONCLUSIONS: Only 13% of patients with cirrhosis receive annual
   surveillance, and less than 2% of patients receive biannual
   surveillance. There are racial and socioeconomic disparities, with lower
   rates of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance among African Americans
   and underinsured patients. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To present the 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV major depressive
   disorder (MDD) and severe MDD; to examine sociodemographic correlates
   and comorbidity; and to describe impairment and service use.
   Method: Data are from the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent
   Supplement (NCS-A), a nationally representative survey of 10,123
   adolescents aged 13 to 18 years that assesses DSM-IV disorders using the
   Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0. One
   parent or surrogate of each participating adolescent was also asked to
   complete a self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of MDD were 11.0% and 7.5%,
   respectively. The corresponding rates of severe MDD were 3.0% and 2.3%.
   The prevalence of MDD increased significantly across adolescence, with
   markedly greater increases among females than among males. Most cases of
   MDD were associated with psychiatric comorbidity and severe role
   impairment, and a substantial minority reported suicidality. The
   prevalence of severe MDD was about one-fourth of that of all MDD cases;
   estimates of impairment and clinical correlates were of 2- to 5-fold
   greater magnitude for severe versus mild/moderate depression, with
   markedly higher rates for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Treatment in
   any form was received by the majority of adolescents with 12-month
   DSM-IV MDD (60.4%), but only a minority received treatment that was
   disorder-specific or from the mental health sector.
   Conclusion: Findings underscore the important 'public health
   significance of depression among US adolescents and the urgent need to
   improve screening and treatment access in this population.

AB Background: Understanding mechanisms linking neighborhood context to
   health behaviors may provide targets for increasing lifestyle
   intervention effectiveness. Although associations between home
   neighborhood and obesogenic behaviors have been studied, less is known
   about the role of worksite neighborhood.
   Purpose: To evaluate associations between worksite neighborhood context
   at baseline (2006) and change in obesogenic behaviors of adult employees
   at follow-up (2007-2009) in a worksite randomized trial to prevent
   weight gain.
   Methods: Worksite property values were used as an indicator of worksite
   neighborhood SES (NSES). Worksite neighborhood built environment
   attributes associated with walkability were evaluated as explanatory
   factors in relationships among worksite NSES, diet, and physical
   activity behaviors of employees. Behavioral data were collected at
   baseline (2005-2007) and follow-up (2007-2009). Multilevel linear and
   logistic models were constructed adjusting for covariates and accounting
   for clustering within worksites. Product-of-coefficients methods were
   used to assess mediation. Analyses were performed after study completion
   (2011-2012).
   Results: Higher worksite NSES was associated with more walking (OR =
   1.16, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.30, p = 0.01). Higher density of residential
   units surrounding worksites was associated with more walking and eating
   five or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables, independent of
   worksite NSES. Residential density partially explained relationships
   among worksite NSES, fruit and vegetable consumption, and walking.
   Conclusions: Worksite neighborhood context may influence employees'
   obesogenic behaviors. Furthermore, residential density around worksites
   could be an indicator of access to dietary and physical activity-related
   infrastructure in urban areas. This may be important given the
   popularity of worksites as venues for obesity prevention efforts.

AB Research emphasises the role that social structures play in shaping
   national HIV prevalence. This study examined how social, economic, and
   political contexts that may represent the confluence of individual
   capabilities and environmental affordances or constraints are associated
   with national HIV prevalence. Based on social-ecological perspectives,
   we examined social-structural dimensions in relation to national HIV
   prevalence. The study identified six publicly available nation-level
   social, political, and economic indices and examined their associations
   with national 2009 HIV prevalence across 225 nations. National indices,
   (a) education expenditures, (b) unemployment rate, (c) homicide rate,
   (d) freedom of religion, and (e) women's social rights, altogether
   explained 43% of the variability in national HIV prevalence. Education
   expenditures, homicide rate, and freedom of religion were significant
   predictors of national HIV prevalence in the multivariate analysis. The
   present study identified nation-level factors that capture social,
   economic, and political contexts to explain between-nation differences
   in HIV prevalence. Findings extend current literature on the
   social-structural foundation of HIV-risk and the relationship between
   human rights and health. National safeguards that afford individuals the
   power to promote general quality of life and protection from structural
   violence may be most important to lowering overall rates of HIV
   transmission.

AB Little is known about late 19th and early 20th century BMIs on the US
   Central Plains. Using data from the Nebraska state prison, this study
   demonstrates that the BMIs of dark complexioned blacks were greater than
   for fairer complexioned mulattos and whites. Although modern BMIs have
   increased, late 19th and early 20th century BMIs in Nebraska were in
   normal ranges; neither underweight nor obese individuals were common.
   Farmer BMIs were consistently greater than those of non-farmers, and
   farm labourer BMIs were greater than those of common labourers. The BMIs
   of individuals born in Plains states were greater than for other
   nativities, indicating that rural lifestyles were associated with better
   net current biological living conditions.

AB To face an unequal world requires us to interpret and explain it, to be
   sure, but also to engage it, that is, to recognize that we are part of
   it and that we are partly responsible for it. In other words, inequality
   is not just something external to us, but also invades our own world. I
   begin, therefore, by examining the global community of sociology through
   the lens of inequality. I then consider two recent perspectives on our
   unequal world from outside sociology: the moral radicalism of Pope
   Francis that emphasizes exclusion from market society, and the
   innovative research of the economist Thomas Piketty that emphasizes
   unequal inclusion in market society. These two faces of global
   inequality mirror the social movements reverberating from the economic
   crisis of 2008 but which have their roots in a reaction to a broader
   wave of marketization, the third to engulf modern capitalism. To explore
   the meaning of third-wave marketization, otherwise known as
   neoliberalism, and the social movements it provokes I draw on two
   concepts from Karl Polanyi - fictitious commodities' and
   countermovement' - as well as a theory of the dynamics of capitalism. I
   conclude with three challenges facing a global sociology that centers
   social movements: to develop a theory that speaks to the globally
   diverse experiences of commodification; to develop a methodology that
   recognizes that we are unavoidably participants in the world we study;
   and to develop a politics that defends a particular vision of that
   world, a vision that has defined the sociological tradition from its
   beginning, namely one that upholds the centrality of civil society
   against the over-extension of market and state.

AB Purpose: We identified clinical and regional factors associated with the
   use of urethroplasty vs repeat endoscopic management for urethral
   stricture disease.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed claims for patients 18 to 65 years
   old in the 2007 to 2011 MarketScan (R) Commercial Claims and Encounters
   Database with a diagnosis of urethral stricture. The primary outcome was
   treatment with urethroplasty vs repeat endoscopic management, defined as
   more than 2 dilations or direct vision internal urethrotomies. The
   likelihood of urethroplasty vs repeat endoscopic management was
   determined for each major metropolitan area in the United States.
   Multivariate logistic regression was done to identify factors associated
   with urethroplasty.
   Results: We identified 41,056 patients with urethral stricture, yielding
   a diagnosis rate of 296/100,000 men in MarketScan. Repeat endoscopic
   management and urethroplasty were performed in 2,700 and 1,444 patients,
   respectively. Compared to patients treated with repeat endoscopic
   management those with urethroplasty were younger (median age 44 vs 54
   years) and more likely to have a Charlson comorbidity score of 0 (84% vs
   77%), have traveled out of a metropolitan area for care (34% vs 17%) and
   have a reconstructive urologist in the treatment metropolitan area (76%
   and 62%, each p < 0.001). When controlling for age and Charlson
   comorbidity score, travel out of a metropolitan area (OR 2.7, 95% CI
   2.2-3.3) and a reconstructive urologist in the treatment metropolitan
   area (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.7-2.5) were associated with a greater likelihood
   of urethroplasty vs repeat endoscopic management.
   Conclusions: Despite the well established benefits of urethroplasty
   compared to repeat endoscopic management a strong bias for repeat
   endoscopic management exists in many regions in the United States.

AB Sociology of gender has developed beyond a personality-centered idea of
   "sex-roles" to an approach that stresses interaction and social
   structure. At the same time, there has been a concurrent development in
   the psychological sex-differences and medical literatures toward
   including the biological bases of sex-typed behavior and gender
   identities. In this paper, while we conceptualize gender as a social
   structure, we focus only on the individual level of analysis: testing
   the relative strength of (maternal circulating) prenatal hormones,
   childhood socialization, and the power of expectations attached to adult
   social roles (cultural interactionist) as explanations for women's
   self-reported feminine and masculine selves. Our findings are complex,
   and support some importance of each theory. Prenatal hormones, childhood
   socialization, and cultural interactionism were all influential factors
   for gendered selves. While cultural expectations predicted only feminine
   selves, prenatal hormones were more robust predictors of masculine sense
   of self. While personality may be a relatively stable characteristic
   influenced by the body and childhood socialization, our results
   reinforce the importance of studying how the social world responds to
   and reinforces gendered personality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB In social environments, it is crucial that decision-makers take account
   of the impact of their actions not only for oneself, but also on other
   social agents. Previous work has identified neural signals in the
   striatum encoding value-based prediction errors for outcomes to oneself;
   also, recent work suggests that neural activity in prefrontal cortex may
   similarly encode value-based prediction errors related to outcomes to
   others. However, prior work also indicates that social valuations are
   not isomorphic, with social value orientations of decision-makers
   ranging on a cooperative to competitive continuum; this variation has
   not been examined within social learning environments. Here, we combine
   a computational model of learning with functional neuroimaging to
   examine how individual differences in orientation impact neural
   mechanisms underlying 'other-value' learning. Across four experimental
   conditions, reinforcement learning signals for other-value were
   identified in medial prefrontal cortex, and were distinct from
   self-value learning signals identified in striatum. Critically, the
   magnitude and direction of the other-value learning signal depended
   strongly on an individual's cooperative or competitive orientation
   toward others. These data indicate that social decisions are guided by a
   social orientation-dependent learning system that is computationally
   similar but anatomically distinct from self-value learning. The
   sensitivity of the medial prefrontal learning signal to social
   preferences suggests a mechanism linking such preferences to biases in
   social actions and highlights the importance of incorporating
   heterogeneous social predispositions in neurocomputational models of
   social behavior. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Research has documented racial and ethnic disparities in
   utilization, access, continuity, and quality of care for psychiatric
   disorders including treatment for substance use disorders among those
   with similar need in the general community. Currently, the extent of
   racial and ethnic disparities in treatment within US. correctional
   facilities is unknown.
   Methods: This study examines race/ethnic disparities in treatment for
   drug dependent inmates using the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State
   Correctional Facilities. Fixed effects logistic regression is used to
   analyze treatment outcomes for 5180 inmates housed within 286 prisons.
   The analysis accounts for differences in background characteristics
   (i.e., age, gender, marital status, foreign born status, veteran
   status), socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., education, employment
   prior to incarceration), mental health (i.e., diagnosis with a serious
   mental illness), and incarceration experiences (i.e., current
   conviction, previous incarceration episodes, time served, additional
   sentencing requirements, external social support, disciplinary
   violations).
   Results: The findings identify a remarkable unmet need among drug
   dependent inmates in that less than one-half of drug dependent inmates
   had received any type of treatment in prison at the time of the
   interview with the most common treatment type being self-help groups.
   Compared to whites, drug dependent Latino inmates have significantly
   lower odds of utilizing treatment, yet there are no significant black
   white disparities found.
   Conclusion: The current study suggests that treatment for drug dependent
   inmates needs to be expanded to include clinically or medically based
   treatment since the failure to address addictions in the criminal legal
   system has been identified as the single most significant reason for
   rearrest and recidivism once released. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB This study tested a proposed community resilience model by investigating
   the role of institutions, capital assets, community and
   socio-demographic variables as determinants of households' participation
   in Ghana's collaborative forest management (CFM) program and outcomes of
   the program. Quantitative survey data were gathered from 209 randomly
   selected households from two forest-dependent communities. Regression
   analysis shows that households' participation in the CFM program was
   predicted by community location, past connections with institutions, and
   past bonding social capital. Community location and past capitals were
   the strongest predictors of the outcomes of the CFM program as judged by
   current levels of capitals. Participation in the CFM program also had a
   positive effect on human capital but had minimal impact on the other
   capitals influencing household well-being and resilience, suggesting
   that the impact of co-management on household resilience may be modest.
   In all, the findings highlight the need for co-management policies to
   pay attention to the historical context of community interaction
   processes influencing access to capital assets and local institutions to
   successfully promote equitable resilience. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB What makes people willing to pay costs to benefit others? Does such
   cooperation require effortful self-control, or do automatic, intuitive
   processes favor cooperation? Time pressure has been shown to increase
   cooperative behavior in Public Goods Games, implying a predisposition
   towards cooperation. Consistent with the hypothesis that this
   predisposition results from the fact that cooperation is typically
   advantageous outside the lab, it has further been shown that the time
   pressure effect is undermined by prior experience playing lab games
   (where selfishness is the more advantageous strategy). Furthermore, a
   recent study found that time pressure increases cooperation even in a
   game framed as a competition, suggesting that the time pressure effect
   is not the result of social norm compliance. Here, we successfully
   replicate these findings, again observing a positive effect of time
   pressure on cooperation in a competitively framed game, but not when
   using the standard cooperative framing. These results suggest that
   participants' intuitions favor cooperation rather than norm compliance,
   and also that simply changing the framing of the Public Goods Game is
   enough to make it appear novel to participants and thus to restore the
   time pressure effect.

AB Markets are central to modern society, so their failures can be
   devastating. Here, we examine a prominent failure: price bubbles.
   Bubbles emerge when traders err collectively in pricing, causing misfit
   between market prices and the true values of assets. The causes of such
   collective errors remain elusive. We propose that bubbles are affected
   by ethnic homogeneity in the market and can be thwarted by diversity. In
   homogenous markets, traders place undue confidence in the decisions of
   others. Less likely to scrutinize others' decisions, traders are more
   likely to accept prices that deviate from true values. To test this, we
   constructed experimental markets in Southeast Asia and North America,
   where participants traded stocks to earn money. We randomly assigned
   participants to ethnically homogeneous or diverse markets. We find a
   marked difference: Across markets and locations, market prices fit true
   values 58% better in diverse markets. The effect is similar across
   sites, despite sizeable differences in culture and ethnic composition.
   Specifically, in homogenous markets, overpricing is higher as traders
   are more likely to accept speculative prices. Their pricing errors are
   more correlated than in diverse markets. In addition, when bubbles
   burst, homogenous markets crash more severely. The findings suggest that
   price bubbles arise not only from individual errors or financial
   conditions, but also from the social context of decision making. The
   evidence may inform public discussion on ethnic diversity: it may be
   beneficial not only for providing variety in perspectives and skills,
   but also because diversity facilitates friction that enhances
   deliberation and upends conformity.

AB Previous research emphasizes people's dispositions as a source of
   differences in moral views. We investigate another source of moral
   disagreement, self-interest. In three experiments, participants played a
   simple economic game in which one player divides money with a partner
   according to the principle of equality (same payoffs) or the principle
   of equity (payoffs proportional to effort expended). We find, first,
   that people's moral judgment of an allocation rule depends on their role
   in the game. People not only prefer the rule that most benefits them but
   also judge it to be more fair and moral. Second, we find that
   participants' views about equality and equity change in a matter of
   minutes as they learn where their interests lie. Finally, we find limits
   to self-interest: when the justification for equity is removed,
   participants no longer show strategic advocacy of the unequal division.
   We discuss implications for understanding moral debate and disagreement.

AB Problem/Condition: At the end of 2010, an estimated 872,990 persons in
   the United States were living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) infection. Approximately one in four of the estimated HIV
   infections diagnosed in 2011 were attributed to heterosexual contact.
   Heterosexuals with a low socioeconomic status (SES) are
   disproportionately likely to be infected with HIV.
   Reporting Period: June December 2010.
   Description of System: The National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System
   (NHBS) collects HIV prevalence and risk behavior data in selected
   metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) from three populations at high
   risk for HIV infection: men who have sex with men, injecting drug users,
   and heterosexuals at increased risk for HIV infection. Data for NHBS are
   collected in rotating cycles in these three different populations. For
   the 2010 NHBS cycle among heterosexuals, men and women were eligible to
   participate if they were aged 18-60 years, lived in a participating MSA,
   were able to complete a behavioral survey in English or Spanish, and
   reported engaging in vaginal or anal sex with one or more opposite-sex
   partners in the 12 months before the interview. Persons who consented to
   participate completed an interviewer-administered, standardized
   questionnaire about HIV-associated behaviors and were offered anonymous
   HIV testing. Participants were sampled using respondent-driven sampling,
   a type of chain-referral sampling. Sampling focused on persons of low
   SES (i.e., income at the poverty level or no more than a high school
   education) because results of a pilot study indicated that heterosexual
   adults of low SES were more likely than those of high SES to be infected
   with HIV. To assess risk and testing experiences among persons at risk
   for acquiring HIV infection through heterosexual sex, analyses excluded
   participants who were not low SES, those who reported ever having tested
   positive for HIV, and those who reported recent (i.e., in the 12 months
   before the interview) male-male sex or injection drug use. This report
   summarizes unweighted data regarding HIV-associated risk, prevention,
   and testing behaviors from 9,278 heterosexual men and women interviewed
   in 2010 (the second cycle of NHBS data collection among heterosexuals).
   Results: The median age of participants was 35 years; 47% were men. The
   majority of participants were black or African American (hereafter
   referred to as black) (72%) or Hispanic/Latino (21%). Most participants
   (men: 88%; women: 90%) reported having vaginal sex without a condom with
   one or more opposite-sex partners in the past 12 months; approximately
   one third (men: 30%; women: 29%) reported anal sex without a condom with
   one or more opposite-sex partners. The majority of participants (59%)
   reported using noninjection drugs in the 12 months before the interview;
   nearly one in seven (15%) had used crack cocaine. Although most
   participants (men: 71%; women: 77%) had ever been tested for HIV, this
   percentage was lower among Hispanic/Latino participants (men: 52%;
   women: 62%). Approximately one third (34%) of participants reported
   receiving free condoms in the 12 months before the interview; 11%
   reported participating in a behavioral HIV prevention program.
   Interpretation: A substantial proportion of heterosexuals interviewed
   for the 2010 NHBS heterosexual cycle reported engaging in behaviors that
   increase the risk for HIV infection. However, HIV testing was suboptimal
   among the overall sample, including among groups disproportionately
   affected by HIV infection (i.e., blacks and Hispanics/Latinos).
   Public Health Action: Increasing coverage of HIV testing and other HIV
   prevention services among heterosexuals at increased risk is important,
   especially among groups disproportionately affected by HIV infection,
   such as blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy for
   the United States delineates a coordinated national response to reduce
   infections and HIV-related health disparities among disproportionately
   affected groups. NHBS data can guide national and local planning efforts
   to maximize the impact of HIV prevention programs.

AB How do student-athletes form opinions? This is a particularly important
   question given ongoing debates about whether student-athletes should be
   paid and/or allowed to unionize. These debates concern the rights and
   benefits accrued directly to student-athletes, and thus, understanding
   their attitudes is of obvious import. Yet, virtually no recent work has
   delved into how student-athletes form opinions on these issues. We fill
   this gap with a theoretical framework that predicts changes in social
   context alter opinions. This leads to the hypothesis that opinions will
   change once a student-athlete completes his/her career and finds
   him/herself in a distinct social network. We test the prediction with a
   survey, implemented in 2012, of one of the most notable athletic
   conferences in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA): the
   Big Ten. We find that post-career student-athletes demonstrate higher
   levels of support for pay for play and unionization. Our results suggest
   that studentathletes' opinions seem to depend on their extant social
   contexts. While our data, from 2012, neither speak to current opinions
   -given the quickly evolving landscape of college athletics - nor
   demonstrate what reforms may be "best," they do accentuate the power of
   social context in shaping student-athletes' attitudes.

AB Among non-European regions colonized by Europeans, regions that were
   relatively richer five centuries ago (like Mexico, Peru, and India) tend
   to be poorer today, while regions that originally were relatively poorer
   (like the United States, Chile, and Australia) tend now to be richer.
   Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (abbreviated AJR) established the
   generality of this reversal of fortune. Chanda, Cook, and Putterman
   (abbreviated CCP) have now reanalyzed it, taking as a unit of analysis
   populations rather than geographic regions. That is, India's population
   was Indian 500 y ago and is still overwhelmingly Indian today, whereas
   the United States' population was Native American 500 years ago but is
   overwhelmingly Old World (especially European) today. Reversals of
   fortune disappeared when CCP analyzed populations rather than geographic
   regions: for instance, the geographic region of the modern United States
   has become relatively richer since AD 1500, but the predominantly
   European population now occupying the United States was already
   relatively rich in AD 1500. Evidently, European colonists carried
   ingredients of wealth with them. I discuss the biological and cultural
   baggage transported by European immigrants and associated with wealth.
   Among that baggage, AJR emphasize institutions, CCP emphasize social
   capital, and I identify many different elements only loosely coupled to
   each other. This paper discusses the problem, especially acute in the
   social sciences, of "operationalizing" intuitive concepts (such as mass,
   temperature, wealth, and innovation) so that they can be measured. Basic
   concepts tend to be harder to define, operationalize, and measure in the
   social sciences than in the laboratory sciences.

AB Background: Adoption of electronic health record systems has increased
   the availability of patient-level electronic health information.
   Objective: To examine public support for secondary uses of electronic
   health information under different consent arrangements.
   Design: National experimental survey to examine perceptions of uses of
   electronic health information according to patient consent (obtained vs.
   not obtained), use (research vs. marketing), and framing of the findings
   (abstract description without results vs. specific results).
   Setting: Nationally representative survey.
   Participants: 3064 African American, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white
   persons (response rate, 65%).
   Measurements: Appropriateness of health information use described in
   vignettes on a scale of 1 (not at all appropriate) to 10 (very
   appropriate).
   Results: Mean ratings ranged from a low of 3.81 for a marketing use when
   consent was not obtained and specific results were presented to a high
   of 7.06 for a research use when consent was obtained and specific
   results were presented. Participants rated scenarios in which consent
   was obtained as more appropriate than when consent was not obtained
   (difference, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.34]; P < 0.001). Participants rated
   scenarios in which the use was marketing as less appropriate than when
   the use was research (difference, -2.03 [CI, -2.27 to -1.78]; P <
   0.001). Unconsented research uses were rated as more appropriate than
   consented marketing uses (5.65 vs. 4.52; difference, 1.13 [CI, 0.87 to
   1.39]).
   Limitations: Participants rated hypothetical scenarios. Results could be
   vulnerable to nonresponse bias despite the high response rate.
   Conclusion: Although approaches to health information sharing emphasize
   consent, public opinion also emphasizes purpose, which suggests a need
   to focus more attention on the social value of information use.

AB The purpose of the study is to examine how several well-known correlates
   of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) might work together to contribute to
   the occurrence of this behavior. Specifically, we examined models
   including child abuse, psychiatric comorbidity, and disinhibition,
   testing how these factors may work together to lead to NSSI in the past
   month. Participants (n=194; 144 female: age 13-18 years) were recruited
   from a short-term, acute adolescent residential unit. Within 48 hours of
   admission to the hospital participants completed structured clinical
   interviews assessing mental disorders and patterns of NSSI. Following
   the interviews, participants completed a self-report questionnaire
   assessing childhood abuse and a computerized continuous performance
   task. Consistent with study hypotheses, results revealed that the
   association between child abuse and NSSI is partially mediated by
   comorbidity. Although disinhibition is associated with comorbidity,
   contrary to our hypothesis, disinhibition does not mediate the relation
   between child abuse and NSSI. Collectively, these findings provide new
   information about how comorbidity may increase risk for NSSI, and
   critically, discuss the potential importance of creating targeted
   programs to reduce the prevalence of child abuse. (c) 2014 Elsevier

AB Background and objectives: School immunization requirements have ensured
   high vaccination rates and have helped to control vaccine-preventable
   diseases. However, vaccine exemptions have increased in the last decade.
   This study compared New York State private versus public schools with
   respect to medical and religious exemption rates.
   Methods: This retrospective study utilizes New York State Department of
   Health Immunization Survey data from the 2003 through 2012 academic
   years. Schools were categorized as private or public, the former further
   categorized by religious affiliation. Rates of medical and religious
   vaccine exemptions were compared by school category.
   Results: From 2003 to 2012, religious exemptions increased in private
   and public schools from 0.63% to 1.35% and 0.17% to 0.29% (Spearman's R:
   0.89 and 0.81), respectively. Among private schools, increases in
   religious exemption rates during the study period were observed in
   Catholic/Eastern Orthodox, Protestant/Other Christian, Jewish, and
   secular schools (Spearman's R = 0.66, 0.99, 0.89, and 0.93),
   respectively. Exemption rate ratios in private schools compared to
   public schools were 1.39 (95% CI 1.15-1.68) for medical and 3.94(95% CI:
   3.20-4.86) for religious exemptions. Among private school students, all
   school types except for Catholic/Eastern Orthodox and Episcopal
   affiliates were more likely to report religious exemptions compared to
   children in public schools.
   Conclusions: Medical and religious exemption rates increased over time
   and higher rates were observed among New York State private schools
   compared to public schools. Low exemption rates are critical to minimize
   disease outbreaks in the schools and their community. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Objectives: Churches and faith institutions can frequently influence
   health behaviors among older African Americans. The church is a
   centerpiece of spiritual and social life among African American
   congregants. We explored its influence on influenza immunization
   coverage during the 2012-2013 influenza season.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among congregation
   members ages 50-89 years from six churches in the Atlanta region in
   2013-2014. We computed descriptive statistics, bivariate associations,
   and multivariable models to examine factors associated with immunization
   uptake among this population.
   Results: Of 208 study participants, 95 (45.7%) reported receiving the
   influenza vaccine. Logistic regression showed that increased trust in
   their healthcare providers' vaccine recommendations was a positive
   predictor of vaccination among participants who had not experienced
   discrimination in a faith-based setting (OR: 14.8 [3.7, 59.8]), but was
   not associated with vaccination for participants who had experienced
   such discrimination (OR: 1.5 [0.2, 7.0]). Belief in vaccine-induced
   influenza illness (OR: 0.1 [0.05, 0.23]) was a negative predictor of
   influenza vaccination.
   Conclusion: Members of this older cohort of African Americans who
   expressed trust in their healthcare providers' vaccine recommendations
   and disbelief in vaccine-induced influenza were more likely to obtain
   seasonal influenza immunization. They were also more likely to act on
   their trust of healthcare provider's vaccine recommendations if they did
   not encounter negative influenza immunization attitudes within the
   church. Having healthcare providers address negative influenza
   immunization attitudes and disseminate vaccine information in a
   culturally appropriate manner within the church has the potential to
   enhance future uptake of influenza vaccination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Extensive experimental psychology research has attempted to parse the
   complex relationship between psychosocial stress, mood, cognitive
   performance, and physiological changes. To do so, it is necessary to
   have effective, validated methods to experimentally induce psychosocial
   stress. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) is the most commonly used
   method of experimentally inducing psychosocial stress, but it is
   resource intensive. Less resource intense psychosocial stress tasks
   include the Socially Evaluative Cold Pressor Task (SECPT) and a
   computerized mental arithmetic task (MAT). These tasks effectively
   produce a physiological and psychological stress response and have the
   benefits of requiring fewer experimenters and affording data collection
   from multiple participants simultaneously. The objective of this study
   was to compare the magnitude and duration of these three experimental
   psychosocial stress induction paradigms. On each of four separate days,
   participants completed either a control non-stressful task or one of the
   three experimental stressors: the TSST, SECPT, or MAT. We measured mood,
   working memory performance, salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (AA),
   and heart rate. The TSST and SECPT exerted the most robust effects on
   mood and physiological measures. TSST effects were generally evident
   immediately post-stress as well as 10- and 20-minutes after stress
   cessation, whereas SECPT effects were generally limited to the duration
   of the stressor. The stress duration is a key determinant when planning
   a study that utilizes an experimental stressor, as researchers may be
   interested in collecting dependent measures prior to stress cessation.
   In this way, the TSST would allow the investigator a longer window to
   administer tasks of interest.

   whether gay (n = 22) or straight (n = 19) messengers were effective at
   encouraging voters (n = 972) to support same-sex marriage and whether
   attitude change persisted and spread to others in voters' social
   networks. The results, measured by an unrelated panel survey, show that
   both gay and straight canvassers produced large effects initially, but
   only gay canvassers' effects persisted in 3-week, 6-week, and 9-month
   follow-ups. We also find strong evidence of within-household
   transmission of opinion change, but only in the wake of conversations
   with gay canvassers. Contact with gay canvassers further caused
   substantial change in the ratings of gay men and lesbians more
   generally. These large, persistent, and contagious effects were
   confirmed by a follow-up experiment. Contact with minorities coupled
   with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a
   cascade of opinion change.

AB Merit and justice play a crucial role in ethical theory and political
   philosophy. Some theories view justice as allocation according to merit;
   others view justice as based on criteria of its own, and take merit and
   justice as two independent values. We study experimentally how these
   views are perceived. In our experiment subjects played two games (both
   against the computer): a game of skill and a game of luck. After each
   game they observed the earnings of all the subjects in the session, and
   thus the differences in outcomes. Each subject could reduce the winnings
   of one other person at a cost. The majority of the subjects used the
   option to subtract. The decision to subtract and the amount subtracted
   depended on whether the game was one of skill or luck, and on the
   distance between the earnings of the subject and those of others.
   Everything else being equal, subjects subtracted more in luck than in
   skill. In skill game, but not in luck, the subtraction becomes more
   likely, and the amount larger, as the distance increases. The results
   show that individuals considered favorable outcomes in luck to be
   undeserved, and thus felt more justified in subtracting. In the skill
   game instead, they considered more favorable outcomes (their own as well
   as others') as signal of ability and perhaps effort, which thus deserved
   merit; hence, they felt less motivated to subtract. However, a larger
   size of the unfavorable gap from the others increased the unpleasantness
   of poor performance, which in turn motivated larger subtraction. In
   conclusion, merit is attributed if and only if effort or skill
   significantly affect the outcome. An inequality of outcomes is viewed
   differently depending on whether merit causes the difference or not.
   Thus, merit and justice are strongly linked in the human perception of
   social order.

AB Diffusion of innovation can be interpreted as a social spreading
   phenomenon governed by the impact of media and social interactions.
   Although these mechanisms have been identified by quantitative theories,
   their role and relative importance are not entirely understood, as
   empirical verification has so far been hindered by the lack of
   appropriate data. Here we analyse a dataset recording the spreading
   dynamics of the world's largest Voice over Internet Protocol service to
   empirically support the assumptions behind models of social contagion.
   We show that the rate of spontaneous service adoption is constant, the
   probability of adoption via social influence is linearly proportional to
   the fraction of adopting neighbours, and the rate of service termination
   is time-invariant and independent of the behaviour of peers. By
   implementing the detected diffusion mechanisms into a dynamical
   agent-based model, we are able to emulate the adoption dynamics of the
   service in several countries worldwide. This approach enables us to make
   medium-term predictions of service adoption and disclose dependencies
   between the dynamics of innovation spreading and the socio-economic
   development of a country.

AB Background: Measures of socioeconomic disadvantage may enable improved
   targeting of programs to prevent rehospitalizations, but obtaining such
   information directly from patients can be difficult. Measures of U.S.
   neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage are more readily available but
   are rarely used clinically.
   Objective: To evaluate the association between neighborhood
   socioeconomic disadvantage at the census block group level, as measured
   by the Singh validated area deprivation index (ADI), and 30-day
   rehospitalization.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting: United States.
   Patients: Random 5% national sample of Medicare patients discharged with
   congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or myocardial infarction between
   2004 and 2009 (n = 255 744).
   Measurements: Medicare data were linked to 2000 census data to construct
   an ADI for each patient's census block group, which were then sorted
   into percentiles by increasing ADI. Relationships between neighborhood
   ADI grouping and 30-day rehospitalization were evaluated using
   multivariate logistic regression models, controlling for patient
   sociodemographic characteristics, comorbid conditions and severity, and
   index hospital characteristics.
   Results: The 30-day rehospitalization rate did not vary significantly
   across the least disadvantaged 85% of neighborhoods, which had an
   average rehospitalization rate of 21%. However, within the most
   disadvantaged 15% of neighborhoods, rehospitalization rates increased
   from 22% to 27% with worsening ADI. This relationship persisted after
   full adjustment, with the most disadvantaged neighborhoods having a
   rehospitalization risk (adjusted risk ratio, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05 to
   1.12]) similar to that of chronic pulmonary disease (adjusted risk
   ratio, 1.06 [CI, 1.04 to 1.08]) and greater than that of uncomplicated
   diabetes (adjusted risk ratio, 0.95 [CI, 0.94 to 0.97]).
   Limitation: No direct markers of care quality or access.
   Conclusion: Residence within a disadvantaged U.S. neighborhood is a
   rehospitalization predictor of magnitude similar to chronic pulmonary
   disease. Measures of neighborhood disadvantage, such as the ADI, could
   potentially be used to inform policy and care after hospital discharge.

AB Social and structural factors including HIV stigma are theorized to
   drive global disparities in HIV prevalence. This study tests whether HIV
   self-stigma, or experiences of stigma at the individual level, is
   associated with engagement in unprotected sex among people living with
   HIV (PLWH) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where 37.4% of adults are
   living with HIV compared with 0.8% worldwide. It further explores
   whether depressive symptoms, HIV status disclosure to sex partners,
   and/or condom use attitudes mediate potential associations between HIV
   self-stigma and unprotected sex. Participants, including 924 PLWH, were
   recruited from primary care clinics and completed baseline, 6-, 12-, and
   18-month survey assessments between 2008 and 2011. Hierarchical linear
   modeling analyses were used to examine longitudinal within-subjects
   associations between HIV self-stigma, mediators, and unprotected sex
   with both HIV-negative/unknown and HIV-positive partners. Results
   demonstrate that HIV self-stigma was prospectively associated with
   greater likelihood of unprotected sex with HIV-negative/unknown
   partners. None of the variables explored significantly mediated this
   association. HIV self-stigma was also prospectively associated with
   greater likelihood of unprotected sex with HIV-positive partners via the
   mediators of greater depressive symptoms and more negative condom use
   attitudes. The current study suggests that HIV self-stigma undermines
   HIV secondary prevention and care efforts among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal.
   It is therefore critical to address HIV stigma at the social/structural
   level to reduce HIV self-stigma at the individual level and ultimately
   curb global disparities in HIV prevalence. In the absence of widespread
   social/structural change, interventions that treat depressive symptoms
   and encourage more positive condom use attitudes despite the existence
   of HIV stigma may buffer associations between HIV self-stigma and
   unprotected sex with HIV-positive partners among PLWH in KwaZulu-Natal.

TI The prevalence and burden of bipolar depression
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS

BP S3
EP S11

PD DEC 2014
PY 2014
AB Background: Bipolar disorder is characterized by debilitating episodes
   of depression and mood elevation (mania or hypomania). For most
   patients, depressive symptoms are more pervasive than mood elevation or
   mixed symptoms, and thus have been reported in individual studies to
   impose a greater burden on affected individuals, caregivers, and
   society. This article reviews and compiles the literature on the
   prevalence and burden of syndromal as well as subsyndromal presentations
   of depression in bipolar disorder patients.
   Methods: The PubMed database was searched for English-language articles
   using the search terms "bipolar disorder," "bipolar depression,"
   "burden," "caregiver burden," "cost," "costs," "economic,"
   "epidemiology," "prevalence," "quality of life," and "suicide." Search
   results were manually reviewed, and relevant studies were selected for
   inclusion as appropriate. Additional references were obtained manually
   from reviewing the reference lists of selected articles found by
   computerized search.
   Results: In aggregate, the findings support the predominance of
   depressive symptoms compared with mood elevation/mixed symptoms in the
   course of bipolar illness, and thus an overall greater burden in terms
   of economic costs, functioning, caregiver burden, and suicide.
   Limitations: This review, although comprehensive, provides a study-wise
   aggregate (rather than a patient-wise meta-analytic) summary of the
   relevant literature on this topic.
   Conclusions: In light of its pervasiveness and prevalence, more
   effective and aggressive treatments for bipolar depression are warranted
   to mitigate its profound impact upon individuals and society. Such
   studies could benefit by including metrics not only for mood outcomes,
   but also for illness burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Tobacco use is a leading cause of deaths and Disability
   Adjusted Life Years lost worldwide, particularly in South-East Asia.
   Health risks associated with exclusive use of one form of tobacco alone
   has a different health risk profile when compared to dual use. In order
   to tease out specific profiles of mutually exclusive categories of
   tobacco use, we carried out this analysis. Methods: The Global Adult
   Tobacco Survey (GATS) data was used to describe the profiles of three
   mutually exclusive tobacco use categories ("Current smoking only,"
   "Current smokeless tobacco [SLT] use only," and "Dual use") in four
   World Health Organization South-East Asia Region countries, namely
   Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Thailand. GATS was a nationally
   representative household-based survey that used a stratified multistage
   cluster sampling design proportional to population size. Prevalence of
   different forms of usage were described as proportions. Logistics
   regression analyses was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) with 95%
   confidence intervals. All analyses were weighted, accounted for the
   complex sampling design and conducted using SPSS version 18. Results:
   The prevalence of different forms of tobacco use varied across
   countries. Current tobacco use ranged from 27.2% in Thailand to 43.3% in
   Bangladesh. Exclusively smoking was more common in Indonesia (34.0%) and
   Thailand (23.4%) and less common in Bangladesh (16.1%) and India (8.7%).
   Exclusively using SLT was more common in Bangladesh (20.3%) and India
   (20.6%) and less common on Indonesia (0.9%) and Thailand (3.5%). Dual
   use of smoking and SLT was found in Bangladesh (6.8%) and India (5.3%),
   but was negligible in Indonesia (0.8) and Thailand (0.4%). Gender, age,
   education and wealth had significant effects on the OR for most forms of
   tobacco use across all four countries with the exceptions of SLT use in
   Indonesia and dual use in both Indonesia and Thailand. In general, the
   different forms of tobacco use increased among males and with increasing
   age; and decreased with higher education and wealth. The results for
   urban versus rural residence were mixed and frequently not significant
   once controlling for the other demographic factors. Conclusion: This
   study addressed the socioeconomic disparities, which underlie health
   inequities due to tobacco use. Tobacco control activities in these
   countries should take in account local cultural, social and demographic
   factors for successful implementation.

AB Objective. This study evaluates changes in physical activity and active
   transportation associated with installation of new bicycle boulevards.
   Methods. This natural experiment study uses data from a longitudinal
   panel of adults with children (n = 353) in Portland, OR. Activity and
   active transportation outcomes were measured with GPS and accelerometers
   worn for up to 5 days in 2010-11 and 2012-13. The effect of the
   treatment was estimated using difference in differences estimation and
   multivariate regression models.
   Results. In five of the seven models, the interaction term was not
   significant, indicating that after controlling for the main effects of
   time and exposure separately, there was no correlation between being in
   a treatment area and minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity
   (MVPA) per day, bicycling >10 mm, walking >20 min, minutes of walking
   (if >20), or making a bike trip. Significant covariates included rain,
   being female, living closer to downtown, and attitudes towards
   bicycling, walking, and car safety.
   Conclusion. This study could not confirm an increase in physical
   activity or active transportation among adults with children living near
   newly installed bicycle boulevards. Additional pre/post studies are
   encouraged, as well as research on the length of time after installation
   that behavior change is likely to occur. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Objective. To examine disparities in park availability, features, and
   characteristics by income and the percentage of foreign-born population
   within a predominately-Hispanic border community.
   Methods. This study occurred in 2010-2011 in El Paso, Texas. All census
   tracts (n = 112) were categorized as low, medium, or high income and
   percent foreign-born. The number of parks intersecting each tract was
   determined using ArcGIS and park features (facilities, amenities) and
   characteristics (aesthetic features, park and neighborhood
   quality/safety concerns) were assessed via park audits (n = 144).
   Analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests examined differences
   across income and percent foreign-born tertiles for all park measures.
   Results. The medium income tertile had more parks than the high tertile,
   and more park facilities than the low or high tertiles, but no
   differences in park amenities were observed across income groups. As
   well, none of park availability, facilities, or amenities differed
   across percent foreign-born tertiles. Finally, parks in the high income
   tertile had significant fewer park and neighborhood quality/safety
   concerns and parks in the high percent foreign-born tertile had
   significantly greater park and neighborhood quality/safety concerns.
   Conclusion. Identifying disparities in park availability, features, and
   characteristics can aid policymakers and citizens in improving the
   contribution of parks to community health for all. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Objective. This study is to examine changes in residents' physical
   activities, social interactions, and neighborhood cohesion after they
   moved to a walkable community in Austin, Texas.
   Methods. Retrospective surveys (N = 449) were administered in 2013-2014
   to collect pre- and post-move data about the outcome variables and
   relevant personal, social, and physical environmental factors.
   Walkability of each resident's pre-move community was measured using the
   Walk Score. T tests were used to,examine the pre-post move differences
   in the outcomes in the whole sample and across sub-groups with different
   physical activity levels, neighborhood conditions, and neighborhood
   preferences before the move.
   Results. After the move, total physical activity increased significantly
   in the whole sample and all sub-groups except those who were previously
   sufficiently active; lived in communities with high walkability, social
   interactions, or neighborhood cohesion; or had moderate preference for
   walkable neighborhoods. Walking in the community increased in the whole
   sample and all subgroups except those who were previously sufficiently
   active, moved from high-walkability communities, or had little to no
   preference for walkable neighborhoods. Social interactions and
   neighborhood cohesion increased significantly after the move in the
   whole sample and all sub-groups.
   Conclusion. This study explored potential health benefits of a walkable
   community in promoting physically and socially active lifestyles,
   especially for populations at higher risk of obesity. The initial result
   is promising, suggesting the need for more work to further examine the
   relationships between health and community design using pre-post
   assessments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A recurring theme in the sociology of human rights is the vast
   decoupling that exists between the formal codification of these rights
   in principle and their implementation in practice, fueling much debate
   about the effectiveness of international law. Yet, despite this
   disjuncture, a deeper question remains: given all the barriers that have
   impeded the realization of human rights, why have they become so widely
   institutionalized? Revisiting previous work in this journal, I argue
   that one important component of the expansion of human rights is the
   rise of the universal, egalitarian individual as the primary entity of
   social organization in world society. Additionally, I explore how the
   nature of human rights law itself promotes widespread decoupling that,
   in turn, fuels ongoing efforts to close the gap between principle and
   practice. Indeed, while human rights law envisions an ideal world that
   is practically unrealizable, it inspires a never-ending, global crusade
   to bring about that vision.

AB Objective: John Henryism Active Coping (JHAC) is defined as a strong
   behavioral predisposition to cope with stressors in an effortful and
   determined manner. The well-known inverse relationship between
   socioeconomic status (SES) and blood pressure (BP) has been hypothesized
   to be stronger for individuals who have high JHAC than those with low
   JHAC, suggesting that JHAC may place people with low SES at higher
   cardiovascular risk. Previous studies testing this hypothesis have
   presented mixed findings; therefore, this study was conducted to test
   the JHAC hypothesis by examining the main and interaction effects of SES
   and JHAC on cardiovascular risk (measured by BP and arterial stiffness
   [AS]).
   Methods: The sample was 102 Korean Americans (aged 21-60 years).
   Measures included age, sex, body mass index, smoking, SES (measured by
   income and education), JHAC (measured by the 12-item JHAC Scale), BP,
   and AS.
   Results: In terms of the SES measures, only education was significantly
   related to systolic BP (p = 0.003), diastolic BP (p = 0.001), and AS (p
   < 0.000). The interaction effects of education and JHAC on systolic BP
   and AS were also significant (p = 0.019 and p = 0.018, respectively),
   indicating that the inverse relationships of education to systolic BP
   and AS were more prominent in subjects with lower JHAC scores.
   Conclusion: Contrary to the JHAC hypothesis, JHAC may be associated with
   low cardiovascular risk in people with low education in certain groups.
   Studies are recommended to examine potential beneficial effects ofJHAC
   on cardiovascular health in a larger sample and to identify their
   mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Blood sport-the practice of pitting animals against each other (or
   against humans) in bloody combat to the death-is a tragic form of human
   entertainment that has been resilient since antiquity. While animal
   blood sport is a form of human driven sport related violence that
   involves the abuse and suffering of other animals (Young 2012), it also
   provides an "identity prop" (Dunning 1999): all male competitive sports
   and games provide men with a way to demonstrate masculinity by
   feminizing opponents (Dundes 1997). This theoretical argument has not
   been systematically analyzed in the sociology of sport, and my essay is
   an attempt to fill that gap. I examine animal blood sport with a focus
   on its connection to the validation of masculinity and heterosexuality.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have suggested disparities in quality of
   health care and time to treatment across socioeconomic groups. Such
   differences can be of greatest consequence in the setting of emergent
   medical conditions. Surgical or endovascular treatment of ruptured
   cerebral aneurysms within the first 3 days of aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (aSAH) is associated with improved outcome. We hypothesize
   that race and payer status disparities effect the time to treatment for
   ruptured aneurysms.
   METHODS: Discharge data were collected from the Nationwide Inpatient
   Sample during the years 2002-2010. International Classification of
   Diseases, 9th Edition; Clinical Modification codes were used to identify
   patients with aSAH who were treated by either surgical clipping or
   endovascular coil embolization. Time to procedure was dichotomized into
   1) treatment in 3 days or less or 2) treatment in greater than 3 days.
   Time to treatment was evaluated according to demographic factors,
   including race, payer status, and median zip code income via
   multivariable analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 78,070 aSAH admissions were treated by either
   aneurysm clip ligation or coil embolization. Hispanic race and Medicaid
   payer status were associated with increased time to treatment (P <
   0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Racial and socioeconomic factors are associated with delayed
   time to treatment in aSAH. Identification of factors underlying these
   delays and standardization of care may allow for more uniform treatment
   protocols and improved patient care.

AB Terrorism involving nuclear or radiologic weapons can devastate
   populations, city infrastructures, and entire sociopolitical systems. In
   our age of nuclear medicine and therapeutic radiation delivery, the
   unauthorized and illegal acquisition of radioactive materials needed for
   such an attack is always a possibility and risk. Physicians handling
   high-energy isotopes for medical radiotherapy must be aware of the basic
   security requirements as outlined by the Nuclear Regulation Commission,
   which include background checks and authorized access, physical
   protection during radionuclide use, and physical protection during its
   transit. The Leksell Gamma Knife and its Category 1 cobalt-60
   radioactive source are discussed because of their significant potential
   for deployment in a weaponized device. Although this article presents a
   perspective relating to American rules and regulations, these
   precautions are applicable anywhere that similar situations exist.
   Understanding these materials and the security they require is essential
   to preventing the disastrous outcomes should these isotopes fall into
   terrorists' hands.

AB In this review, we discuss the dynamic linkages between culture and the
   genetic evolution of the human species. We begin by briefly describing
   the framework of gene-culture coevolutionary (or dual-inheritance)
   models for human evolutionary change. Until recently, the literature on
   gene-culture coevolution was composed primarily of mathematical models
   and formalized theory describing the complex dynamics underlying human
   behavior, adaptation, and technological evolution, but had little
   empirical support concerning genetics. The rapid progress in the fields
   of molecular genetics and genomics, however, is now providing the kinds
   of data needed to produce rich empirical support for gene-culture
   coevolutionary models. We briefly outline how theoretical and
   methodological progress in genome sciences has provided ways for the
   strength of selection on genes to be evaluated, and then outline how
   evidence of selection on several key genes can be directly linked to
   human cultural practices. We then describe some exciting new directions
   in the empirical study of gene-culture coevolution, and conclude with a
   discussion of the role of gene-culture evolutionary models in the future
   integration of medical, biological, and social sciences.

AB Background: This study examined age group differences in and correlates
   of treatment use and perceived treatment need for substance use
   disorders (SUD) and mental health (MH) problems as well as self-reported
   barriers to treatment among people 65+ years old vs. 26-34,35-49, and
   50-64 years old.
   Methods: Data are from the 2008 to 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and
   Health (NSDUH) (N = 96,966). Age group differences were examined using
   descriptive bivariate analyses and binary logistic regression analyses.
   Results: The 65+ age group was least likely to use treatment and
   perceive treatment need, but the 50-64 age group was more similar to the
   younger age groups than the 65+ age group. Controlling for age, other
   predisposing, and enabling factors, alcohol and illicit drug dependence
   and comorbid SUD and MH problems increased the odds of SUD treatment
   use. Of MH problems, anxiety disorder had the largest odds for MH
   treatment use. Bivariate analyses showed that lack of readiness to stop
   using and cost/limited insurance were the most frequent barriers to SUD
   and MH treatment, respectively, among older adults, and they were less
   likely than younger age groups to report stigma/confidentiality concerns
   for MH treatment.
   Conclusions: Older adults will become a larger portion of the total U.S.
   population with SUD and/or MH problems. Healthcare providers should be
   alert to the need to help older adults with SUD and/or MH problems
   obtain treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Methods: Data were drawn from the first four waves of on ongoing
   prospective cohort study of YMSM who were ages 18 to 19 at baseline and
   were assessed each 6 months for substance use via calendar based
   methods. Latent growth curve modeling was utilized to assess changes
   over time for four drug use categories: alcohol, marijuana, inhalant

   (race/ethnicity, perceived familial socioeconomic status; SES).
   Results: Use of all substances increased steadily across the follow-up

   18-mo follow-up visit compared to other racial/ethnic groups, while
   rates of change across groups were similar. Marijuana use at 18 months
   was highest for Hispanics who also indicated the highest rate of change.
   Finally, YMSM who reported higher perceived SES reported the lowest use
   and lowest rates of change for other drug use. Controlling for perceived
   SES, differences in patterns of drug use by race/ethnicity were evident
   but differences were not as large.
   Conclusions: Increases in substance use in the emerging adulthood of
   YMSM indicate the need for structural and behavioral interventions
   tailored to address substance use in these young men before chronic
   patterns of use develop. Differences in patterns of drug use across
   racial/ethnic and SES groups suggest that interventions need to consider
   person-level differences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB This research examines how people watch "bad" television-television
   programs that the viewers themselves label as "trash," "stupid," and
   "awful." Such viewers experience a normative contradiction; while they
   have created or embraced a symbolic boundary between "good" and "bad"
   television, they find themselves transgressing that boundary by
   consuming and, in some cases, enjoying the shows that they condemn. By
   conducting 40 in-depth interviews, this research identifies the
   strategies used by television viewers to deal with this normative
   contradiction. Beyond "traditional viewing," we show how viewers employ
   "ironic consumption," a "camp sensibility," and frame their viewing as a
   "guilty pleasure" to consume "bad" television. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Research on cultural omnivorousness has mainly focused on consumption
   practices among economic and cultural elites and the dissemination of
   omnivorous tastes through the media. Through ethnographic research this
   paper argues for the significance of physical points of purchase in the
   production and inculcation of omnivorous taste. Focusing on the workers
   at upscale butcher shops, this paper examines how workers at new elite
   retail establishments use skilled performances to construct and
   communicate notions of taste and quality in their products. I explain
   how the "meat philosophy" of these shops makes them distinct from other
   meat retail outlets, fits with omnivorous tastes, and underpins the work
   their cultural workers do. I then show how craft butchers and counter
   workers at these shops use "functional aesthetics" and "interactive
   service," respectively, to prepare and sell meat, as well as to teach
   "good" taste in meat to customers. Exploring the intersection of
   restructured tastes and values in food, new places for elite
   consumption, and the recoding of occupations in the postindustrial city,
   this paper furthers our understanding of cultural omnivorousness and,
   more broadly, the sociology of taste. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB eHealth is characterized by technology-enabled processes, systems, and
   applications that expedite accurate, real-time health information,
   feedback, and skill development to advance patient-centered care. When
   designed and applied in a culturally competent manner, eHealth tools can
   be particularly beneficial for traditionally marginalized ethnic
   minority groups, such as Latinos, a group that has been identified as
   being at the forefront of emerging technology-use in the United States.
   In this analytic overview, we describe current eHealth research that has
   been conducted with Latino patient populations. In addition, we
   highlight cultural and linguistic factors that should be considered
   during the design and implementation of eHealth interventions with this
   population.
   With increasing disparities in preventive care information, behaviors,
   and services, as well as health care access in general, culturally
   competent eHealth tools hold great promise to help narrow this gap and
   empower communities.

   and 2012. Tanzania's social and economic development is reshaping the

   mechanisms of pubertal guidance, and new meanings of manhood are arising
   from globalization. Traditional masculinity norms, including pressures
   to demonstrate virility and fertility, remain strong. Adolescent boys in
   modernizing Tanzania receive inadequate guidance on their burgeoning

AB Objectives. We describe trends in receipt of preventive dental care
   among Medicaid-enrolled children in Pennsylvania between 2005 and 2010,
   comparing the US children of immigrants with their co-ethnic peers in
   nonimmigrant families.
   Methods. We analyzed Pennsylvania Medicaid claims, birth records, and
   census data for children born in Pennsylvania and enrolled in Medicaid
   for 10 or more months during any of the calendar years assessed.
   Results. Receipt of preventive dental care was more likely among Latino
   children in immigrant families than among their peers in nonimmigrant
   families; also, it was more likely among White children in immigrant
   families than among their peers in nonimmigrant families. Rates of
   preventive dental care use among African American and Asian children in
   immigrant and nonimmigrant families were comparable. From 2005 to 2010,
   the percentage of Latino children in nonimmigrant families who received
   preventive dental care increased from 33% to 61%. Changes in other
   groups were significant but less dramatic.
   Conclusions. Receipt of preventive dental care has increased among
   Medicaid-enrolled children in Pennsylvania, with marked gains among
   Latino children. Within each racial/ethnic group, the children of
   immigrants were either more likely than or equally likely as children in
   nonimmigrant families to receive care.

AB Objectives. We estimated the distribution of predicted long-term
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk among young adults in the United
   States.
   Methods. Our data were derived from National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health participants (n = 14 333; average age: 28.9 years). We
   used a Framingham-derived risk prediction function to calculate 30-year
   risks of "hard" and "general" CVD by gender and race/ethnicity.
   Results. Average 30-year risks for hard and general CVD were 10.4% (95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 10.1%, 10.7%) and 17.3% (95% CI = 17.0%,
   17.7%) among men and 4.4% (95% CI = 4.3%, 4.6%) and 9.2% (95% CI = 8.9%,
   9.5%) among women. Average age-adjusted risks of hard and general CVD
   were higher among Blacks and American Indians than among Whites and
   lower among Asian/Pacific Islander women than White women. American
   Indian men continued to have a higher risk of general CVD after
   adjustment for socioeconomic status. Four percent of women (95% CI =
   3.6%, 5.0%) and 26.2% of men (95% CI = 24.7%, 27.8%) had a 20% or higher
   risk of general CVD. Racial differences were detected but were not
   significant after adjustment for socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions. Average CVD risk among young adults is high.
   Population-based prevention strategies and improved detection and
   treatment of high-risk individuals are needed to reduce the future
   burden of CVD.

AB Objectives. We sought to examine the prospective influence of social
   capital and social network ties on smoking relapse among adults.
   Methods. In 2010, a 2-year follow-up study was conducted with the 2008
   Montreal Neighborhood Networks and Healthy Aging Study (MoNNET-HA)
   participants. We asked participants in 2008 and 2010 whether they had
   smoked in the past 30 days. Position and name generators were used to
   collect data on social capital and social connections. We used
   multilevel logistic analysis adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic
   factors to predict smoking relapse in 2010.
   Results. Of the 1400 MoNNET-HA follow-up participants, 1087 were
   nonsmokers in 2008. Among nonsmokers, 42 were smokers in 2010. Results
   revealed that participants with higher network social capital were less
   likely (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.47,
   0.96), whereas socially isolated participants (OR = 3.69; 95% CI = 1.36,
   10.01) or those who had ties to smokers within the household (OR = 4.22;
   95% CI = 1.52, 11.73) were more likely to report smoking in 2010.
   Conclusions. Social network capital reduced the chances of smoking
   relapse. Smoking cessation programs might aim to increase network
   diversity so as to prevent relapse.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the independent and joint effects of race,
   individual socioeconomic status (SES), and neighborhood SES on mortality
   risk.
   Methods. We conducted a prospective analysis involving 52 965
   non-Hispanic Black and 23 592 non-Hispanic White adults taking part in
   the Southern Community Cohort Study. Cox proportional hazards modeling
   was used to determine associations of race and SES with all-cause and
   cause-specific mortality.
   Results. In our cohort, wherein Blacks and Whites had similar individual
   SES, Blacks were less likely than Whites to die during the follow-up
   period (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73,
   0.84). Low household income was a strong predictor of all-cause
   mortality among both Blacks and Whites (HR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.45, 2.12).
   Being in the lowest (vs highest) category with respect to both
   individual and neighborhood SES was associated with a nearly 3-fold
   increase in all-cause mortality risk (HR = 2.76; 95% CI = 1.99, 3.84).
   There was no significant mortality-related interaction between
   individual SES and neighborhood SES among either Blacks or Whites.
   Conclusions. SES is a strong predictor of premature mortality, and the
   independent associations of individual SES and neighborhood SES with
   mortality risk are similar for Blacks and Whites.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although end-of-life care in the ICU accounts for a large
   proportion of health-care costs, few studies have examined the
   association between costs and satisfaction with care. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the association of ICU costs with
   family-and nurse-assessed quality of dying and family satisfaction.
   METHODS: This was an observational study surveying families and nurses
   for patients who died in the ICU or within 30 h of transfer from the
   ICU. A total of 607 patients from two Seattle hospitals were included in
   the study. Survey data were linked with administrative records to obtain
   ICU and hospital costs. Regression analyses assessed the association
   between costs and outcomes assessing satisfaction with care: nurse-and
   family-assessed Quality of Death and Dying (QODD-1) and Family
   Satisfaction in the ICU (FS-ICU).
   RESULTS: For family-reported outcomes, patient insurance status was an
   important modifier of results. For underinsured patients, higher daily
   ICU costs were significantly associated with higher FS-ICU and QODD-1 (P
   < .01 and P = .01, respectively); this association was absent for
   privately insured or Medicare patients (P = .50 and P = .85, QODD-1 and
   FS-ICU, respectively). However, higher nurse-assessed QODD-1 was
   significantly associated with lower average daily ICU cost and total
   hospital cost (P < .01 and P = .05, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Family-rated satisfaction with care and quality of dying
   varied depending on insurance status, with underinsured families rating
   satisfaction with care and quality of dying higher when average daily
   ICU costs were higher. However, patients with higher costs were assessed
   by nurses as having a poorer quality of dying. These findings highlight
   important differences between family and clinician perspectives and the
   important role of insurance status.

AB As interest in the concept of ecosystem services (ES) has grown, so has
   its scope. This paper considers some limitations of the ES paradigm by
   examining one category of ES: cultural services, including the
   environmental basis for esthetic, spiritual, and recreational
   experiences, cultural heritage, sense of place, and ways of life. It
   examines whether cultural ES can be assessed in terms of purely
   individual benefits or if social/collective considerations must be
   included; and whether the concept of 'services' even provides an
   appropriate framework for understanding such values. To pursue these
   questions I consider the recent literature on the assessment and
   valuation of 'cultural services' and assess the adequacy of this
   perspective against several examples from American Indian communities of
   the Pacific Northwest. Three characteristics of these situations from
   Indian Country are problematic for an ES framework: the social
   construction of environmental experience, the symbolic character of
   environmental knowledge, and the multidimensionality of environmental
   value. On the basis of this analysis, I propose a model of culturally
   reflexive stewardship as potentially a more productive and theoretically
   consistent framework for characterizing such socially constructed
   environmental values and practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Because of the secularity of sociology, religion remains a relatively
   marginal field of study and the in-sights of the sociology of religion
   are generally ignored or overlooked within other subfields. But religion
   can be a force that deeply influences personal, community, and national
   life in nonobvious ways through shaping the social and political
   structures of society. Consequently, including an analysis of religion
   as a fundamental factor of social life could greatly enrich and even
   transform many subfields of sociology. In this essay, I focus on the
   sociology of migration and immigration, my area of research, and show
   how religion plays a central role in social, economic, and political
   processes surrounding migration. Drawing on case studies of migration
   and immigration of groups from India based on my research and that of
   others, I discuss how religion, through a variety of indirect and direct
   mechanisms, shapes migration patterns, remittance use, social
   incorporation into receiving societies, and forms of political
   mobilization.

AB Through examples from our own research and that of others, we argue that
   there is much to learn about religion through the study of its presence
   in secular organizations where it is "hidden in plain sight." Making
   "invisible religion" visible furthers arguments about why sociologists
   should care about religion and shows how religion can be conceptualized
   to help us understand religious history, social change, and social
   processes. Additionally, we show that better understanding how
   individuals piece together a bricolage of meanings, including those
   forged from religious beliefs and practices, will come only from also
   paying attention to the social contexts-many of them secular-that
   contribute to shaping individual lives. We conclude by suggesting that
   sociologists of religion model how sociologists of gender and race have
   conceived of gender and race at individual and structural levels in ways
   that integrate their concerns more thoroughly with the discipline of
   sociology.

   is a sui generis analytic category. The author then suggests how this
   third cause can be remedied by no longer thinking of religion as an

   be studied. Doing so would shift religion to a pragmatic, native

AB General concepts that illuminate topics across subfields are highly
   valued in sociology. Because the discipline encompasses a large number
   of diverse subfields, though, many of the concepts that are most useful
   within subfields are domain-specific. In practice, a dialectical
   relationship exists between the two. General concepts gain attention by
   drawing on and organizing domain-specific concepts. Research within
   subfields draws on general concepts to modify domain-specific concepts.
   In many instances, research demonstrates that general concepts must be
   specified in terms of other variables and contexts to inform empirical
   research. I illustrate these processes with examples from the study of
   religion in sociology, suggesting that this perspective is more helpful
   for understanding the disciplinary contributions of sociology of
   religion than bemoaning its apparent marginality.

AB Background In chronic illness self-care, social support may influence
   some health behaviors more than others.
   Purpose Examine social support's association with seven individual
   chronic illness self-management behaviors: two healthy "lifestyle"
   behaviors (physical activity, diet) and five more highly skilled and
   diabetes-specific (medical) behaviors (checking feet, oral medication
   adherence, insulin adherence, self-monitored blood glucose, primary care
   appointment attendance).
   Methods Using cross-sectional administrative and survey data from 13,366
   patients with type 2 diabetes, Poisson regression models estimated the
   adjusted relative risks (ARR) of practicing each behavior at higher vs
   lower levels of social support.
   Results Higher emotional support and social network scores were
   significantly associated with increased ARR of both lifestyle behaviors.
   Both social support measures were also associated with increased ARR for
   checking feet. Neither measure was significantly associated with other
   medical behaviors.
   Conclusions Findings suggest that social support diminished in
   importance as self-care progresses from lifestyle to more skilled
   "medical" behaviors.

AB Religion is a powerful force in many people's lives, impacting decisions
   about life, death, and everything in between. It may be difficult, then,
   to imagine that something as seemingly innocuous as the usage of brand
   name products might influence individuals' commitment to religion.
   However, we demonstrate across 6 studies that when brands are a highly
   salient tool for self-expression, individuals are less likely to report
   and demonstrate strong religious commitment. We suggest that a desire to
   maintain consistency among self-identitiesis one important driver of
   this relationship and find that the effect is mitigated when the
   perceived distance between brands and religious values is minimized.

AB Children and adults make rich causal inferences about the physical and
   social world, even in novel situations where they cannot rely on prior
   knowledge of causal mechanisms. We propose that this capacity is
   supported in part by constraints provided by event structure-the
   cognitive organization of experience into discrete events that are
   hierarchically organized. These event-structured causal inferences are
   guided by a level-matching principle, with events conceptualized at one
   level of an event hierarchy causally matched to other events at that
   same level, and a boundary-blocking principle, with events causally
   matched to other events that are parts of the same superordinate event.
   These principles are used to constrain inferences about plausible causal
   candidates in unfamiliar situations, both in diagnosing causes
   (Experiment 1) and predicting effects (Experiment 2). The results could
   not be explained by construal level (Experiment 3) or
   similarity-matching (Experiment 4), and were robust across a variety of
   physical and social causal systems. Taken together, these experiments
   demonstrate a novel way in which noncausal information we extract from
   the environment can help to constrain inferences about causal structure.

AB Millions of acres of dry, frequent-fire woodlands and forests in western
   North America are the focus of multi-million dollar ecosystem
   restoration and fuel treatment activities. Societal awareness and
   engagement with these ecosystems has intensified due to recent mega
   fires and projections for increased vulnerability of these systems to
   fire, insects, and drought-related stressors. Also, the importance of
   goods and services provided by dry forests has expanded to include many
   values, such as watershed protection, habitat for biodiversity, and
   recreation as well as timber. Public awareness of fire and other risks
   associated with current conditions in dry forests generally is high and
   broad support exists for active management over passive alternatives.
   Efforts to integrate scientific principles with societal goals in dry
   forest restoration programs are encouraging but significant social
   barriers remain related to funding, conflicting goals (e.g., smoke vs.
   human health and restoration vs. preservation of species habitat), and
   stakeholder trust. The limited area restored relative to the extensive
   vulnerable area suggests that the seriousness and complexity of the
   threats are not fully appreciated or not given sufficient priority for
   funding, despite stated preferences for restorative management. Hence,
   challenges remain. Societal choices ultimately determine the goals,
   extent, and methodology of dry forest restoration programs with science
   stimulating and informing policy and management decisions.

AB Despite a well-established literature on the sociology of sex work and
   sociology of sex and place, currently we know very little about how and
   why sex workers choose to work on the streets that they do. Using the
   case study of a city in upstate New York and drawing upon Michel de
   Certeau's (1984) theory of spatial patterns, this study builds on these
   literatures by discussing the importance of place and space in relation
   to sex work, namely how and why sex workers choose their locations for
   business. Data are drawn from semistructured interviews with female and
   male sex workers, police officers, and an outreach worker. The findings
   reveal the ways in which these spaces of street sex work are reworked by
   sex workers in response to strategies imposed by the police, community
   residents, and others. Within these spaces, sex workers employ a number
   of tactics to maximize business and minimize detection, arrest, and
   violence from clients and other sex workers. Directions for future
   research are also discussed.

AB Sociologists theorize that people comply with the dictates of states and
   other organizations out of self-interest or because of the perceived
   legitimacy of those in authority. Some organizations, however, are based
   on lies, or secrets, and it would seem that these should be very
   short-lived, given how easy it is for the truth to escape. This article
   lays the foundations of a sociology of deception, focusing on lies and
   secrets successfully maintained for years or even decades. The ideas of
   Goffman and Simmel provide a theoretical starting point. Then Bernard
   Madoff's Ponzi scheme is considered as a case study. Drawing on that and
   other examples, the article culminates in a theory that distinguishes
   between barriers to knowing, barriers to asking, barriers to telling,
   barriers to perceiving, barriers to believing, and barriers to acting.
   Together, these may counter the natural entropic tendency for
   information to leak and diffuse, in part because the effectiveness of
   one sort of barrier may offset imperfections in others.

AB Does the experience of cultural consumption have its own sui generis

   ranking? Four criteria are proposed that are observable in
   microsociological detail: (1) bodily self-absorption in the cultural
   experience, creating an intense internal interaction ritual; (2)
   collective effervescence among the audience; (3) Goffmanian front-stage
   self-presentation in settings of cultural consumption; and (4) verbal
   discourse during and around the cultural experience. Data from highly
   committed opera fanatics in Buenos Aires are used to document the
   extreme pole of cultural consumption that rejects external social
   hierarchies in favor of pure musical experience. This individualized and
   internal style of music consumption resembles religious mysticism, and
   what Weber in his typology of orientations to religious experience
   called virtuoso religiosity, as distinct from typical social class
   orientations to religion and to music.

   Durkheim's theory on its own terms, this paper elaborates his typology
   of suicide by sketching suicide's socioemotional structure. We integrate
   social psychological, psychological, and psychiatric advances in emotion
   research and argue that (1) egoistic, or attachment-based suicides, are
   driven primarily by sadness/hopelessness; (2) anomic/fatalistic, or
   regulative suicides, are driven by shame; and (3) mixed-types exist and

AB Emile Durkheim's ideas on religion have long served as foundational
   blocks for sociological theories. Yet, a mystery remains over where
   Durkheim's insights into religion came from and especially the event
   that opened his eyes to religion's importance in social life. Durkheim
   never supplied details on this conversion, but he did credit Robertson
   Smith for his new understanding. Did Smith really play the key role in
   Durkheim's turn to religion? This essay examines Durkheim's revelation
   in 1895 by starting from a novel anglethe first edition of The Division
   of Labor and his original stage model with the cult of nature as the
   starting point for religion. Tracing the implications of his initial
   choice of naturism as the elementary religion, a choice he would later
   soundly reject as the product of [a] delirious interpretation, offers
   new insights into why Durkheim found Smith's ideas so inspirational. It
   also sheds light on why Durkheim overhauled his theory of solidarity,
   discarding his famous distinction between mechanical and organic
   solidarity. In Robertson Smith's work, Durkheim discovered a more
   inclusive and enduring basis of solidarity in the social universe.

AB Purpose: The burden of cancer in Africa is an enlarging public health
   challenge. Breast cancer in Ghana is the second most common cancer among
   Ghanaian women and the proportion of diagnosed patients who complete
   prescribed treatment is estimated to be very limited, thereby
   potentially adding to lower survival and poor quality of life after
   diagnosis. The objective of this study was to identify the patient and
   system factors related to incomplete treatment of breast cancer among
   patients.
   Methods: This study was conducted at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital
   in Kumasi, Ghana. We interviewed 117 breast cancer patients and next of
   kin of breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2008 to 2010.
   Results: Islamic religion, seeking treatment with traditional healers,
   and lack of awareness about national health insurance coverage of breast
   cancer treatment were predictors of incomplete treatment.
   Conclusions: The results of this study support that Ghanaian women with
   diagnosed breast cancer have multiple addressable and modifiable patient
   factors that may deter them from completing the prescribed treatment.
   The results highlight the need for developing and testing specific
   interventions about the importance of completing treatment with a
   special focus on addressing religious, cultural, and system navigation
   barriers in developing countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Ecosystem-based management requires the promotion and integration of
   locally relevant ecosystem services. This needs an understanding of
   which ecosystem services local people value and how local valuation
   varies with socio-cultural and market factors. We convened ten focus
   group discussions and performed 105 household surveys from major
   indigenous groups and recent settlers about local values of various
   forest-based ecosystem services in changing landscapes of southwest
   Ethiopia. We found that the extent of ecosystem service use and
   assessment depends on socio-cultural background and gender of the
   informants, as well as income and cultural contributions of these
   services. Ecosystem service values vary in space and time where local
   people reported that they increasingly value services as they become
   scarce or in response to increased demands due to emerging markets or
   changes in production systems. Local people mostly appreciated a few
   services of high market value while most ecosystem services are not
   traded in local markets and hence not highly valued. Some low-rated
   ecosystem services such as fodder and medicinal plants were nonetheless
   widely used demonstrating the need to also conserve low rated ecosystem
   services that are used universally. We suggest promoting socio-cultural
   and other non-marketable ecosystem services to reduce the
   over-exploitation or exclusion of specific biodiversity components in
   conservation activities.

AB As men age, they lose bone and are susceptible to fracture. Despite
   having lower fracture rates than women, men have worse fractures than
   women do. Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in
   fracture rates exist, yet data on rates of bone loss by race/ethnicity
   and SES among men are limited. We examined annualized percentage change
   in bone mineral density (%BMD) at the hip (N=681), spine (N=663), and
   forearm (N=636) during 7 years of follow-up among men aged 30-79 years
   at baseline. Multivariable models tested whether race/ethnicity, income,
   or genetic ancestry predicted annualized %BMD after controlling for an
   extensive set of covariates. Annualized %BMD ranged from -0.65(0.04)%
   (femoral neck) to +0.26(0.03)% (1/3 distal radius), and changes were
   consistent across age groups with the exception of the ultradistal
   radius, where annualized declines increased with age. Neither
   self-identified race/ethnicity nor genetic ancestry were associated with
   annualized %BMD. In contrast, income was strongly associated
   (dose-response) with annualized %BMD at total hip (independent of
   confounders, self-identified race/ethnicity, and genetic ancestry).
   Fully adjusted least-square mean change in annualized %BMD at the total
   hip were -0.24(0.12)% and -0.16(0.06)% steeper among men with low and
   moderate incomes, respectively, than among men with higher incomes
   (overall p=0.0293). Results show a linear decline in bone that begins
   relatively early in life among men, that rates of bone loss do not vary
   with race/ethnicity (self-identified or objectively measured), and that
   income plays an important role in relation to bone loss at the hip.
   These data suggest that fracture risk in men may be driven in part by
   income-related differences in bone loss, but also, that the known higher
   fracture risk among white men is not the result of racial/ethnic
   differences in bone loss, but rather, early life exposures that lead to
   attainment of higher peak bone mass among minorities. (c) 2014 American

AB Objective. This meta-analysis systematically compiles intervention
   research designed to increase medication adherence among
   underrepresented adults.
   Method. Comprehensive searching located published and unpublished
   studies with medication adherence behavior outcomes. Studies were
   included if samples were adults living in North America who had any of
   the following backgrounds or identities: African American, Native
   American, Latino, Latino American, Asian, Asian American, Pacific
   Islander, Native Alaskan, or Native Hawaiian. Random-effect analyses
   synthesized data to calculate effect sizes as a standardized mean
   difference and variability measures. Exploratory moderator analyses
   examined the association between specific efforts to increase the
   cultural relevance of medication adherence studies and behavior
   outcomes.
   Results. Data were synthesized across 5559 subjects in 55 eligible
   samples. Interventions significantly improved medication adherence
   behavior of treatment subjects compared to control subjects
   (standardized mean difference = 0.211). Primary studies infrequently
   reported strategies to enhance cultural relevance. Exploratory moderator
   analyses found no evidence that associated cultural relevance strategies
   with better medication adherence outcomes.
   Conclusion. The modest magnitude of improvements in medication adherence
   behavior documents the need for further research with clear testing of
   cultural relevance features. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Deficits in real world social functioning are common in people with

   also appear to contribute to real-world social dysfunction. In this
   study, we combined data from three separate studies of people with
   schizophrenia (total n = 561) who were assessed with identical methods.
   We examined the prediction of real-world social functioning, rated by
   high contact clinicians, and compared the influence of negative symptoms
   and social skills measured with performance-based methods on these
   outcomes. Negative symptom severity accounted for 20% of the variance in
   real-world social functioning, with social skills adding an incremental
   2%. This 2% variance contribution was the same when social skills were
   forced into a regression model prior to negative symptom severity. When
   we examined individual negative symptoms, prediction of real-world
   social functioning increased to 28%, with active and passive social
   avoidance entering the equation. Adding depression into the predictor
   model improved the prediction of real-world social functioning
   significantly, but minimally (4% variance). Social skills contribute to
   real-world social outcomes, but treating negative symptoms appears to be
   a possible path for improving real-world social functioning in this
   population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Violence is a dynamic event, not a static state. The cause of violence,
   therefore, cannot lie in static variables such as individual
   propensities (eg self-control) or aggregate properties (eg inequality).
   But what changes cause violence? A new theory developed by Donald Black
   traces violent acts to movements of social time. Social time moves when
   actors' statuses rise or fall (vertical time), when relationships
   increase or decrease in intimacy (relational time), and when cultural
   diversity expands or contracts (cultural time). The present paper
   applies the new theory to one particular type of violence - that
   committed in the name of family honour. Typically perpetrated by men
   against their female relatives, family honour violence is triggered by
   several movements of social time, but particularly vertical time, in the
   form of challenges from below by women seeking to make independent
   lifestyle decisions.

AB Erich Fromm argues that the only reliable way to solve the environmental
   crisis is to alter current social formations in a way in which biophilia
   can flourish, so humankind can solve its existential dichotomy as well
   as meet survival needs in an ecologically sound way. However, society's
   preoccupation with the non-alive elements such as technique, the
   mechanical, gadgets, and commodities shows that the modern social
   character is far from biophilous. Instead, modern societies are
   inherently ecologically destructive due to systematic processes and
   attraction to its progress is a less acute form of, what Fromm terms,
   necrophilia. His insights can help formulate a social theory of
   environmental degradation that includes structural and ideational
   variables. Prescriptively, this means appeals for value changes must
   correspond with fitting appeals for structural changes in social
   systems. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Western Social Science

AB In this paper I argue for the important role of churches and
   denominations in anthropological analyses of Protestant Christianity.
   While many authors have emphasized subjects and subjectivity in their
   discussions of Protestant individualism, I argue that Protestant
   individualism puts greater, not less, emphasis on Christian social
   groups as moral formations. Denominationalism cannot be reduced to the
   intrusion of politics into religious practice without repeating the
   structures that underscore the secularization hypothesis. In order to
   explore this issue, I analyze the missiological theories and strategies
   behind the colonial Lutheran Mission New Guinea's attempts to constitute
   Christian institutions of sacred unity while also confronting the
   problem of New Guinea's extraordinary linguistic diversity. In opting to
   evangelize in church languages that they would teach to potential
   converts rather than in using local vernacular languages, the mission
   began to equate real Christian conversion with the capacity of local
   people to overcome ethnic or linguistic differences. Contrary to
   analyses that identify sincere speakerhood as the crucial component of
   Protestant practice, I argue that the Lutheran Mission sacrificed sacred
   speaking for the creation of sacred Christian groups as remnant
   churches.

AB Objective. To examine perceived independence, overprotection, and
   support, and their association with the employment participation of
   young adults with rheumatic disease.
   Methods. One hundred and forty-three young adults, ages 18 to 30 years,
   with systemic lupus erythematosus (54.5%) and juvenile arthritis (45.5%)
   completed a 30-min online questionnaire of their work and education
   experiences. Information collected was demographic, health (e.g., pain,
   fatigue, disease activity), work context (e.g., career satisfaction,
   helpfulness of job accommodation/benefits, and workplace activity
   limitations), and psychosocial (e.g., independence, social support, and
   overprotection). Log-Poisson regression analysis examined factors
   associated with employment status.
   Results. Over half of respondents were employed (59%) and 26% were
   enrolled in school. Respondents reported moderate to high perceptions of
   independence and social support. However, 27% reported that "quite a
   bit" to "a great deal" of overprotection characterized their
   relationships with those closest to them. At the bivariate level,
   employed participants and those indicating greater perceived
   independence reported greater social support and less overprotection.
   Multivariable analysis revealed that being employed was associated with
   older age, more job accommodations/benefits perceived as being helpful,
   and greater perceived independence.
   Conclusion. This is one of the first studies examining the employment of
   young adults with rheumatic diseases. Findings highlight the importance
   of psychosocial perceptions such as independence and overprotection, in
   addition to support related to working. Additional research is needed to
   better understand the role of those close to young adults with rheumatic
   diseases in supporting independence and encouraging employment.

AB Background. The results of several studies conducted in the United
   States show no association between intake of 100 percent fruit juice and
   early childhood caries (ECC). The authors examined this association
   according to poverty and race/ethnicity among U.S. preschool children.
   Methods. The authors analyzed data from the 19992004 National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2,290 children aged 2 through
   5 years. They used logistic models for caries (yes or no) to assess the
   association between caries and intake of 100 percent fruit juice,
   defined as consumption (yes or no), ounces (categories) consumed in the
   previous 24 hours or usual intake (by means of a statistical method from
   the National Cancer Institute).
   Results. The association between caries and consumption of 100 percent
   fruit juice (yes or no) was not statistically significant in an
   unadjusted logistic model (odds ratio [OR], 0.76; 95 percent confidence
   interval [CI], 0.57-1.01), and it remained nonsignificant after
   covariate adjustment (OR, 0.89; 95 percent CI, 0.63-1.24). Similarly,
   models in which we evaluated categorical consumption of 100 percent
   juice (that is, 0 oz; > 0 and <= 6 oz; and > 6 oz), unadjusted and
   adjusted by covariates, did not indicate an association with ECC.
   Conclusions. Our study findings are consistent with those of other
   studies that show consumption of 100 percent fruit juice is not
   associated with ECC.
   Practical Implications. Dental practitioners should educate their
   patients and communities about the low risk of developing caries
   associated with consumption of 100 percent fruit juice. Limiting
   consumption of 100 percent fruit juice to 4 to 6 oz per day among
   children 1 through 5 years of age should be taught as part of general
   health education.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of cyber dating abuse among youth
   aged 14 to 19 years seeking care at school-based health centers and
   associations with other forms of adolescent relationship abuse (ARA),
   sexual violence, and reproductive and sexual health indicators.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted during the 20122013
   school year (participant n = 1008). Associations between cyber dating
   abuse and study outcomes were assessed via logistic regression models
   for clustered survey data.
   RESULTS: Past 3-month cyber dating abuse was reported by 41.4% of this
   clinic-based sample. More female than male participants reported cyber
   dating abuse victimization (44.6% vs 31.0%). Compared with no exposure,
   low-(" a few times") and high-frequency (" once or twice a month" or
   more) cyber dating abuse were significantly associated with physical or
   sexual ARA (low: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.8, 95% confidence interval
   [CI] 1.8-4.4; high: aOR 5.4, 95% CI 4.0-7.5) and nonpartner sexual
   assault (low: aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.5; high: aOR 4.1, 95% CI 2.8-5.9).
   Analysis with female participants found an association between cyber
   dating abuse exposure and contraceptive nonuse (low: aOR 1.8, 95% CI
   1.2-2.7; high: aOR 4.1, 95% CI 2.0-8.4) and reproductive coercion (low:
   aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.4-6.2; high: aOR 5.7, 95% CI 2.8-11.6).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cyber dating abuse is common and associated with ARA and
   sexual assault in an adolescent clinic-based sample. The associations of
   cyber dating abuse with sexual behavior and pregnancy risk behaviors
   suggest a need to integrate ARA education and harm reduction counseling
   into sexual health assessments in clinical settings.

AB BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in clinical screening for
   pediatric social determinants of health, but little evidence on formats
   that maximize disclosure rates on a wide range of potentially sensitive
   topics. We designed a study to examine disclosure rates and hypothesized
   that there would be no difference in disclosure rates on face-to-face
   versus electronic screening formats for items other than highly
   sensitive items.
   METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of electronic versus
   face-to-face social screening formats in a pediatric emergency
   department. Consenting English-speaking and Spanish-speaking adult
   caregivers familiar with the presenting child's household were
   randomized to social screening via tablet computer (with option for
   audio assist) versus a face-to-face interview conducted by a fully
   bilingual/bicultural researcher.
   RESULTS: Almost all caregivers (96.8%) reported at least 1 social need,
   but rates of reporting on the more sensitive issues (household violence
   and substance abuse) were significantly higher in electronic format, and
   disclosure was marginally higher in electronic format for financial
   insecurity and neighborhood and school safety. There was a significant
   difference in the proportion of social needs items with higher
   endorsement in the computer-based group (70%) than the face-to-face
   group (30%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric clinical sites interested in incorporating
   caregiver-reported socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral needs
   screening should consider electronic screening when feasible,
   particularly when assessing sensitive topics such as child safety and
   household member substance use.

EP 330
PD WIN 2014

AB Objective: Although human aging is characterized by loss of fertility
   and progressive decline in physical abilities, later life is associated
   with better psychological health and welt-being. Furthermore, there has
   been an unprecedented increase in average lifespan over the past century
   without corresponding extensions of fertile and healthy age spans. We
   propose a possible explanation for these paradoxical phenomena.
   Method: We reviewed the relevant literature on aging, well-being, and
   wisdom.
   Results: An increase in specific components of individual wisdom in
   later life may make up for the loss of fertility as well as declining
   physical health. However, current data on the relationship between aging
   and individual wisdom are not consistent and do not explain increased
   longevity in the general population during the past century. We propose
   that greater societal wisdom (including compassion) may account for the
   notable increase in average lifespan over the last century. Data in
   older adults with serious mental illnesses are limited, but suggest that
   many of them too experience improved psychosocial functioning, although
   their longevity has not yet increased, suggesting persistent stigma
   against mental illness and inadequate societal compassion.
   Conclusions: The proposed construct of societal wisdom needs more
   investigation. Research should also focus on the reasons for discrepant
   findings related to age-associated changes in different components of
   individual wisdom. Studies of wisdom and well-being are warranted in
   older people with serious mental illnesses, along with campaigns to
   enhance societal compassion for these disenfranchised individuals.
   Finally, effective interventions to enhance wisdom need to be developed
   and tested.

AB In a time of increasing religious diversity, interfaith political
   coalitions have become important settings for interreligious
   interaction, but little research has explored the types of religious
   expression that are generated therein. Prevailing theories in the
   sociology of religion indicate that interaction with religious others
   results in dilution of traditional religious commitments or production
   of stronger boundaries. But emerging perspectives in cultural sociology
   shift attention from individual religious commitments to the ways in
   which settings shape different styles of religious expression. Insights
   about edge spaces drawn from urban theory suggest that religiously
   diverse settings can be generative of new types of religious practices.
   We apply these insights to the study of interfaith activism by drawing
   on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with religious advocacy
   professionals and activists working in interfaith coalitions.
   Conceptualizing the sites of these interfaith encounters as edge spaces,
   we analyze variation in the types of religious expression that occur in
   interfaith settings. We find that both aggregative and integrative
   practices are produced, but these vary depending on the goals and
   structure of the setting, as well as participants' accountability to
   outside religious gatekeepers.

AB Objective, To examine cross-sectional baseline data from the Consortium

   Rheumatoid Arthritis registry for the association between socioeconomic
   status (SES) with clinical and self-report health outcomes.
   Methods. We analyzed data on 937 African Americans who provided
   comprehensive sociodemographic data in addition to self-reported health
   outcomes. SES measures included educational attainment, homeownership,
   household income, and occupation. Outcomes included measures of disease
   activity, joint damage, a.utoantibody status, and self-reported
   measures. Multivariable linear, logistic, and zero-inflated Poisson
   regression models were used to estimate associations of each SES measure
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outcomes, controlling for sex, age,
   disease duration, comorbid conditions, body mass index, smoking,
   methotrexate/leflunomide use, and biologic agent use.
   Results. The mean age was 54 years, 86% were women, and the mean RA
   disease duration was 7.8 years. Approximately 24% had less than a high
   school degree, 56% had a nonprofessional occupation, 75% had a household
   income <=$30,000, and 55% were nonhomeowners. In multivariable
   regression models, significantly increased associations of disease
   activity measures and self-reported health outcomes were observed with
   low household income (<=$30,000/year) and nonhomeownership. Education
   less than high school was primarily associated with self-reported health
   outcomes. Among participants with disease duration <2 years,
   associations of SES were confined to self-reported measures.
   Conclusion. Our results indicate significant socioeconomic disparities
   in self-reported physical and mental health, clinical disease activity
   measures, and autoantibody status among African Americans with RA not
   explained by differences in demographics, medication use, and health
   behaviors.

AB Study Objectives: Chronic sleep restriction is prevalent in the U.S.
   population and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The
   primary reasons for reduced sleep are unknown. Using population data on
   time use, we sought to identify individual characteristics and behaviors
   associated with short sleep that could be targeted for intervention
   programs.
   Design: Analysis of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS).
   Setting: Cross-sectional annual survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of
   Labor Statistics.
   Participants: Representative cohort (N = 124,517) of Americans 15 years
   and older surveyed between 2003 and 2011.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Results: Telephone survey of activities over 24 hours.
   Relative to all other waking activities, paid work time was the primary
   waking activity exchanged for sleep. Time spent traveling, which
   included commuting to/from work, and immediate pre- and post-sleep
   activities (socializing, grooming, watching TV) were also reciprocally
   related to sleep duration. With every hour that work or educational
   training started later in the morning, sleep time increased by
   approximately 20 minutes. Working multiple jobs was associated with the
   highest odds for sleeping = 6 hours on weekdays (adjusted OR 1.61, 95%
   CI 1.44; 1.81). Self-employed respondents were less likely to be short
   sleepers compared to private sector employees (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72;
   0.95). Sociodemographic characteristics associated with paid work (age
   25-64, male sex, high income, and employment per se) were consistently
   associated with short sleep.
   Conclusions: U.S. population time use survey findings suggest that
   interventions to increase sleep time should concentrate on delaying the
   morning start time of work and educational activities (or making them
   more flexible), increasing sleep opportunities, and shortening morning
   and evening commute times. Reducing the need for multiple jobs may
   increase sleep time, but economic disincentives from working fewer hours
   will need to be offset. Raising awareness of the importance of
   sufficient sleep for health and safety may be necessary to positively
   influence discretionary behaviors that reduce sleep time, including
   television viewing and morning grooming.

AB The social model of disability, which defines disability as the product
   of social discrimination rather than the physical, cognitive, or sensory
   differences of individuals, became the dominant logic of the
   international disability field with the 2006 passage of the UN
   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As such,
   grassroots disability associations around the world are advocating for
   new rights. These campaigns promote a new identity frame of disabled
   persons as a universally oppressed group. This identity, however, does
   not benefit all groups equally and actually threatens some. Using
   qualitative methods, I compare the usage of the disability identity by
   two grassroots associations in Nicaragua. Ex-Contra soldiers with
   disabilities use the identity to obfuscate their discredited history as
   "traitors" and, instead, represent themselves as unjustly discriminated
   against disabled persons deserving special benefits and human rights
   protections. Ex-Sandinista soldiers with disabilities also make claims,
   but only reluctantly as disabled, preferring to self-identify as war
   wounded. Because of changes in law, however, Ex-Sandinista soldiers are
   increasingly unable to make claims as war heroes, but must instead
   access benefits as persons with disabilities "in general." This case
   demonstrates how actors strategically use the social model of disability
   in relation to local political culture and group identity.

AB This article examines how collective memory narratives about the
   Holocaust and corresponding performances of classroom emotional labor
   and emotion management are used to teach immigrants in Germany the
   normative civic emotion associated with citizenship. In 2005, following
   legal changes which increased naturalization opportunities, Germany
   created a series of nation-wide orientation classes and integration
   projects aimed at preparing foreign residents for membership. This
   research, based on participant observation in orientation classes and
   interviews with integration workers in Frankfurt am Main, shows that
   civic emotion and associated practices of feeling management play a key
   role in citizen-making projects. Although the emotional content of
   citizenship in most countries is largely positive, consisting of
   feelings like national pride and loyalty, German civic emotion is both
   unique and contested. Most integration workers taught migrants a
   distinctly negative form of civic emotion, which combined sadness and
   shame for the Nazi-era with a rejection of national pride. Some
   attempted to negotiate alternative forms of "safe," specifically
   non-national pride, and a minority of subjects argued that it was time
   for Germans to "stop carrying shame" for the Holocaust altogether and
   re-embrace patriotism. Thus, the emphasis that subjects put on teaching
   the "correct" kinds of civic emotion, along with their disputes over
   what those were, show that even the most intimate and invisible aspect
   of belonging, what individuals feel toward their country, can become
   fertile ground for struggles over citizenship and national identity.

AB A much-theorized but seldom-tested theory is that elites achieve
   cohesion via the social network they form through their affiliations
   with local clubs, religious institutions, civic groups, and other
   voluntary associations. But few scholars have considered how increasing
   diversity with respect to elites' gender, race, and social class may
   undermine such cohesion. We use primary data from interviews with 312
   elites in a large Midwestern city to construct the network of
   affiliations local elites formed with one another. Results from
   bootstrapping analyses suggest that the most influential elites in the
   sample achieved a disproportionately high level of cohesion by virtue of
   the particular voluntary associations with which they affiliated. Not
   only were the most influential elites more connected to one another
   through multiple redundant associational pathways, but their affiliation
   networks were less segregated by gender, race, and social class than
   were the networks formed by less elite members of the sample.
   Instrumental variables regression analyses further show that the most
   influential elites were especially crucial to increasing cohesion and
   reducing segregation in the overall network. We discuss some of the
   mechanisms through which such integration enhances elites' cohesion and
   power.

AB Scholars typically suggest that deliberation, defined as communication
   guided by reason-giving and inclusion, works best behind a veil of
   ignorance or when personal differences are bracketed. In this article we
   explore deliberation within ethnically diverse groups. We operationalize
   ethnicity in three ways: as an aspect of individual identity, as an
   identity that is made salient through priming, and as an enactment
   relative to interactions in particular situations. In this way, we can
   explore the applicability of our previous experimental results to
   ethnically diverse groups. We find similar results: within ethnically
   diverse groups, deliberation matters; participants are more likely to
   reconsider their positions when deliberating than when simply talking
   about politics. Ethnicity has no adverse effects on the quality of
   deliberation, indicating that bracketing has no significant impact. On
   the contrary, when conceptualized as a relational enactment, ethnicity
   is correlated with increased levels of reason-giving and inclusion, and
   hence higher quality deliberation. This suggests deliberation works in
   multiethnic groups in much the same way asif not better thanit does in
   homogeneous groups. Deliberation is a robust form of political
   communication that not only helps manage, but also embraces diverse
   subjective experiences as a part of the political process.

AB Contemporary scholarship understates the resilience of everyday life in
   humanitarian crisis. Disaster may seem like a fleeting
   momentcolloquially, we say the world stood still or everything changed
   in a blinkbut in the Buduburam Refugee Camp, a predominately Liberian
   refugee camp in Ghana, people experienced calamitous tragedy accumulated
   over years of daily activities. Though they remained politically and
   economically out of place, residents constructed buildings and other
   ordinary material objects to forge a new lived environment. As residents
   engaged with this new lived environmentfrom building homes to managing
   rainwaterthey regularly participated in moral boundary work that helped
   establish how good people ought to act in inhumane circumstances. Moral
   boundary work did not obviate inequality or conflict, but it did help
   mediate between immediate bodily needs and the wider social order. More
   broadly, the study documents the crucial role that seemingly mundane
   material objects play in moral boundary work. Material objects like
   signs, garbage cans, and homes can operate like sociospatial props in
   the stories that people tell about their daily lives. These stories
   reinforce the moral boundaries that divide good and bad people and
   ultimately help make a shared moral order possible.

AB In this essay, I argue that the very form of the grammatical
   construction a sociology of culture and cognition (which is a
   specification of the more general schema a sociology of [X]) is
   symptomatic of a deeply entrenched form of Primitive Classification
   (which I will refer to as the Comtean schema) that governs the way in
   which sociologists conceive of their place in, and engage with other
   denizens of, the social science landscape. I will also argue that while
   this style of disciplinary engagement might have worked in the past when
   it came to dealing with the standard (nineteenth-century) social science
   disciplines and even some late-twentieth-century upstarts, it will not
   work as a way to engage the now-sprawling postdisciplinary field that I
   will refer to as Cognitive Social Science (CSS). The takeaway point is
   that if sociologists want to be part of CSS (and it is in their interest
   to be part of it because this constitutes the future of the behavioral
   sciences), then they will have to give up the Comtean-schematic thought
   style.

   socio-demographic/work factors associated with violence.
   MethodsIn 2010, 130 taxi drivers, working in a large city in the Western
   US, were administered a survey evaluating workplace violence events.
   ResultsThe study population was male (94%), mean age 45, married (54%),
   foreign-born (55%), with 24% speaking Arabic at home. Drivers drove at
   night (51%), for an average of 9.7 years and 41hr/week. Almost half
   reported a history of violence during their driving careers: physical
   assault, weapon confrontation, or robbery. In the prior 12 months, 12%
   were physically assaulted, 8% robbed, and 6% confronted with a weapon.
   Night drivers reported more assaults over their lifetime compared to day
   drivers (mean=1.64 [sd 4.29] vs. mean=0.53 [sd 1.05], P=0.047).
   ConclusionsTaxi drivers experience violence at work. Strategies are
   needed to prevent violence especially in night drivers. Am. J. Ind. Med.

AB People physically distance themselves from competitors and the disliked,
   and cooperate less with those who are further away. We examine whether
   social interaction can also impact the space people perceive between
   themselves and others by measuring the influence of competitive dynamics
   on visual perception. In 2 experiments, participants played a ball toss
   game until they reached a target score. In Experiment 1, a confederate
   stood across the room from the participant and either (a) played the
   same game competitively, (b) played the same game cooperatively, or (c)
   observed the participant without playing, while in Experiment 2, 2
   participants played the same versions of the game with each other. After
   the game, participants provided an estimate of the distance between
   themselves and the other player. Participants in Experiment 1 who
   competed with the confederate consistently judged her to be more distant
   than participants who cooperated with the confederate or played alone.
   In Experiment 2, players who lost the competition perceived more
   distance between themselves and their opponents than did players who
   won, suggesting that the experience of losing a competition drives this
   perceptual distancing. These findings demonstrate the power of a
   socially distancing interaction to create perceptual distance between
   people.

AB "Mirror neurons" describe complementary affective neural activity that
   occurs in the brains of two different primates because they are both
   doing or observing the same action. Empathy, sympathy, and other
   emotional responses involving "taking the role of the other" are
   inferred to be the consequence of these emotional capacities. Mirror
   neurons were first described in the 1980s using the results of brain
   imaging studies. But, a similar conclusion about "mirroring capacity" is
   also reflected in over one hundred years of observational research in
   sociology. Early sociologists described how the social order is
   maintained and reproduced using the concept of the "looking glass self"
   which they view as an entity that exists between the biological being
   and a social being.

AB Balancing ecological and social outcomes of conservation actions is
   recognized in global conservation policy but is challenging in practice.
   Compensation to land owners or users for foregone assets has been
   proposed by economists as an efficient way to mitigate negative social
   impacts of human displacement from protected areas. Joint empirical
   assessments of the conservation and social impacts of protected area
   establishment involving compensation payments are scarce. We synthesized
   social and biological studies related to the establishment of the Derema
   forest corridor in Tanzania's biodiverse East Usambara Mountains. This
   lengthy conservation process involved the appropriation of approximately
   960 ha of native canopy agroforest and steep slopes for the corridor and
   monetary compensation to more than 1100 claimants in the surrounding
   villages. The overarching goals from the outset were to conserve
   ecological processes while doing no harm to the local communities. We
   evaluated whether these goals were achieved by analyzing 3 indicators of
   success: enhancement of forest connectivity, improvement of forest
   condition, and mitigation of negative impacts on local people's
   livelihoods. Indicators of forest connectivity and conditions were
   enhanced through reductions of forest loss and exotic species and
   increases in native species and canopy closure. Despite great efforts by
   national and international organizations, the intervention failed to
   mitigate livelihood losses especially among the poorest people. The
   Derema case illustrates the challenges of designing and implementing
   compensation schemes for conservation-related displacement of people.
   Resultados Ecologicos y Sociales de un area Protegida Nueva en Tanzania
   Resumen El equilibrio de los resultados ecologicos y sociales de las
   acciones de conservacion esta reconocido en la politica de conservacion
   global pero es un reto en la practica. La compensacion para los duenos
   de los terrenos o para los usuarios de bienes predeterminados ha sido
   propuesta por los economistas como una forma eficiente de mitigar los
   impactos sociales negativos del desplazamiento humano de las areas
   protegidas. Los calculos empiricos conjuntos de la conservacion y los
   impactos sociales del establecimiento de areas protegidas que involucran
   los pagos de compensacion son escasos. Sintetizamos los estudios
   sociales y biologicos relacionados con el establecimiento del corredor
   boscoso Derema en las biodiversas montanas de Usambara Oriental en
   Tanzania. Este largo proceso de conservacion involucro la apropiacion de
   approximate to 960 ha de dosel de agrobosque nativo y pendientes
   empinadas para el corredor y compensaciones monetarias para mas de 1100
   demandantes en las aldeas alrededor. Las metas dominantes al inicio
   fueron conservar los procesos ecologicos a la vez que no se causaba dano
   a las comunidades locales. Evaluamos si estas metas se lograron al
   analizar 3 indicadores de exito: el mejoramiento de la conectividad
   forestal, la mejoria de la condicion forestal y la mitigacion de los
   impactos negativos sobre el bienestar de los locales. Los indicadores de
   la conectividad y las condiciones forestales mejoraron por medio de las
   reducciones en la perdida forestal y de especies exoticas y el aumento
   en las especies nativas y el cierre del dosel. A pesar de los grandes
   esfuerzos hechos por organizaciones nacionales e internacionales, la
   intervencion fallo en la mitigacion de perdidas del bienestar,
   especialmente entre los habitantes pobres. El caso Derema ilustra los
   retos de disenar e implementar esquemas de compensacion para el
   desplazamiento de personas por causa de la conservacion.

AB Young children with autism often experience limited social motivation
   and responsiveness that restricts establishment of crucial social
   momentum. These characteristics can lead to decreased opportunities for
   parental engagement and the social learning associated with these
   moments. Early social interventions that capitalize on pre-existing
   interests may be able to re-establish this developmentally critical
   feedback loop, in which both child and parent social behaviors
   simultaneously increase and influence one another. This investigation
   examined the moment-by-moment, micro-transactional relationship between
   parent and child social behavior gains observed in an early intervention
   study. Time-window sequential analyses revealed the presence of
   clinically and statistically significant sequential associations between
   parent and child social behaviors during an embedded social interaction
   intervention, but not in a comparable motivational intervention that
   utilized highly preferred toys and objects. Specifically, the onset of
   parent eye contact, directed positive affect, or offer of a reinforcing
   incentive predicted the immediate occurrence of child eye contact and
   positive affect in the experimental social intervention condition.
   Additionally, child verbal initiations, positive affect, and eye contact
   immediately predicted the onset of parent positive affect during this
   social intervention paradigm. Theoretical implications for the social
   developmental trajectory of autism are discussed.

AB Using a nationally representative sample of couples aged 51+ in the
   United States (N = 1,923 couples), the current study investigated
   whether both partners' perceptions of relationship support and strain
   are associated with an individual's self-rated health and functional
   limitations. The sample had an average age of 67.17 years (SD = 9.0;
   range 50-97). Actor-Partner Interdependence Models adjusting for couple
   interdependencies were applied using multilevel models. After accounting
   for age, education, gender, race, and couple differences in length of
   marriage, results indicate that individual perceptions of support were
   significantly associated with higher self-rated health and fewer
   functional limitations. These individual-level benefits increased if the
   spouse also perceived positive support and low strain. Finally, the
   negative association of an individual's perceived support on functional
   limitations was greater in those with a spouse reporting low levels of
   perceived strain. Findings are discussed relative to theory on
   behavioral and psychological pathways between partners' perceptions of
   support and health.

AB Nearly half of U.S. adults have health literacy (HL) difficulties, and
   lack the ability to effectively obtain, process, and understand health
   information. Poor HL is associated with depression, yet mechanisms of
   this relation are unclear. This study examined whether social support
   mediated the relation between HL and depressive symptoms in 200
   low-socioeconomic status (SES), racially/ethnically diverse smokers
   enrolled in cessation treatment. Mediation analyses were conducted using
   bootstrapping and controlling for SES and nicotine dependence. In simple
   mediation models, social support [Interpersonal Support Evaluation List
   (ISEL) total, subscales (Appraisal, Belonging, Tangible)] mediated the
   effect of HL on depression, such that lower HL was associated with lower
   perceived support, which predicted higher depressive symptoms (ps <
   .05). A multiple mediation model, with ISEL subscales entered
   simultaneously as mediators, was significant (p < .05) but only the
   Belonging subscale demonstrating independent significance (p < .05).
   Thus, social support may be a critical factor underlying the
   HL-depression relationship in low-SES, racially/ethnically diverse
   smokers.

AB To learn how household characteristics might affect carbon storage on
   exurban residential parcels, we conducted a web survey of 126 southeast
   Michigan exurban homeowners. We measured several behaviors that may
   affect carbon storage: the proportion of parcel mown (or left unmown
   with woody vegetation), the number of large trees retained, the number
   of trees planted, how leaf litter was managed, the use of fertilizer,
   and the use of irrigation. We investigated whether these behaviors might
   be related to parcel size, homeowners' concern for having a yard that
   fits neighborhood norms, or household demographic characteristics. We
   found that owners of large (>0.53 ha) parcels were consistently
   different from small and medium parcel owners in their management
   behaviors. Large parcel owners mowed a smaller proportion of their
   parcels. They also were less likely to fertilize and irrigate, had
   planted more trees, and had more large trees on their parcels. In
   addition, they reported being less affected by a desire for their yard
   to fit neighborhood norms. Our results suggest that parcel size and
   neighborhood norms together affect landscape behaviors that affect
   carbon storage. We conclude that for large parcels, size alone may
   promote carbon-storing management behaviors. However, for smaller
   parcels, governance should promote appropriate design at the scale of
   whole blocks or subdivisions in order to drive adoption and acceptance
   across neighborhoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effects of social network characteristics on
   physical health among people with serious mental illness using social
   transactions that are reciprocal, and the combination of objective and
   subjective health measures. The sample consisted of a probability sample
   of 231 adults with serious mental illness who resided in permanent
   supportive housing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Path analyses were
   conducted to examine the relationships between social network
   characteristics and two aspects of medical comorbidity, objective health
   and subjective health. Bivariate statistics showed that individuals with
   medical comorbidity were more likely to have contact with their network
   members and had a higher level of reciprocal positive tangible support
   when compared to those who did not have medical comorbidity. The results
   of the path analyses revealed that none of the social network
   characteristics were associated with better physical health. The lack of
   a significant relationship between social networks and better physical
   health is contrary to prior research findings. However, this is the
   first study to include both types of social transactions simultaneously
   as predictors of better physical health for individuals with serious
   mental illness. A longitudinal study would provide more insight into the
   temporal relationship of social networks and physical health conditions
   of people with serious mental illness. Furthermore, the transactional
   nature of social relationships, particularly for those with mental
   health issues, requires greater exploration.

AB The present study reveals that Election Day differentially affects the
   color preferences of US Republicans and Democrats. Voters' preferences
   for Republican red and Democratic blue were assessed, along with several
   distractor colors, on and around the 2010 interim and 2012 presidential
   elections. On non-Election Days, Republicans and Democrats preferred
   Republican red equally, and Republicans actually preferred Democratic
   blue more than Democrats did. On Election Day, however, Republicans' and
   Democrats' color preferences changed to become more closely aligned with
   their own party's colors. Republicans liked Republican red more than
   Democrats did, and no longer preferred Democratic blue more than
   Democrats did. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   color preferences are determined by people's preferences for
   correspondingly colored objects/entities (Palmer & Schloss in
   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 107:8877-8882, 2010).
   They further suggest that color preferences are calculated at a given
   moment, depending on which color-object associations are currently most
   activated or salient. Color preferences are thus far more dynamic and
   context-dependent than has previously been believed.

   as a detached role, and others as a precarious role. All the teenagers
   use folk theories to navigate the social world, but how they use them
   varies depending on how they experience being a rider. Finally, riding
   in groups shifts their experiences and interpretations in complex ways
   that make riding more enjoyable, but filled with additional emotional
   tensions. Building from previous theories and studies on strangers and

AB The incidence of skin cancer among U.S. Hispanics increased 1.3 %
   annually from 1992 to 2008. However, little research has focused on skin
   cancer prevention among the rapidly growing Hispanic population. In this
   study, we examined theory-driven, psychosocial correlates of sun
   protection behaviors in a population-based sample of 787 Hispanic adults
   (49.6 % female, mean age = 41.0 years) residing in five southern or
   western U.S. states. Participants completed an English- or
   Spanish-language online survey in September 2011. The outcomes of focus
   were sunscreen use, shade seeking, and use of sun protective clothing.
   The correlates included suntan benefits, sun protection benefits and
   barriers, skin color preference, perceived natural skin protection,
   photo-aging concerns, perceived skin cancer risk, skin cancer worry,
   skin cancer fatalism, and sun protection descriptive norms. Results of
   multiple linear regression analyses revealed the following: sun
   protection barriers were negatively associated with each outcome;
   descriptive norms were positively associated with each outcome;
   perceived natural skin protection was inversely associated with
   sunscreen use; skin cancer worry was positively associated with shade
   seeking and use of sun protective clothing; skin cancer fatalism was
   negatively associated with shade seeking; and skin color preference was
   negatively associated with use of sun protective clothing. A number of
   additional statistically significant associations were identified in
   bivariate correlation analyses. This study informs the potential content
   of interventions to promote engagement in sun protection behaviors among
   U.S. Hispanics.

AB BackgroundDespite higher cure rates, childhood acute lymphoblastic
   leukemia (ALL) may continue to result in considerable family strain. We
   sought to (i) measure incidence of divorce, reduced career
   opportunities, changes to work hours, home relocation, and changes to
   family planning at one year after ALL diagnosis; and (ii) Identify
   family and patient factors associated with these events.
   ProcedureWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 159 children with
   average risk-ALL enrolled and treated on COG protocol AALL0331 at 31
   selected sites. Eligibility criteria included age 2 years and English or
   Spanish comprehension. Parents completed surveys at three time points
   during the first 12 months of therapy.
   ResultsParents were at significantly increased risk of loss of
   employment (46% vs. 9.1%, P0.001) than peers nationally. 13%
   divorced/separated, 27% relocated homes, 22% decided not to have more
   children, 51% declined occupational opportunities, and 68% decreased
   work hours. In adjusted analyses, relocation correlated with less
   maternal education (OR: 4.27 [95% CI: 1.43-12.82]). Declining parental
   opportunities associated with family income <$50,000 (OR: 4.25 [95% CI:
   1.50-12.02]) and child <5 years old (OR: 4.21 [95% CI: 1.73-10.25]).
   Deciding not to have more children correlated with smaller family size
   2-3 versus 4-5 (OR: 3.62 [95% CI: 1.10-11.96]).
   ConclusionFamilies experience a high incidence of major life changes in
   the first year of ALL treatment. Understanding these burdens helps
   health care providers to provide appropriate anticipatory guidance and
   support. No unifying factor was associated with the different family
   events. Ongoing follow-up is planned to measure long-term outcomes.

   light on concrete social identification practices and placing these
   practices in cultural context. Gay men's autobiographical accounts,

   feature of American culture: a voluntaristic trope of personal striving
   through social attachments. Citing examples from stories about
   friendship, love, role models, city life, identity politics, and
   religion, the analysis shows how gay men frame their life stories using
   a voluntaristic model of identity. The study also provides evidence of
   change over time in the practices through which gay men construct social
   identities. Younger men report greater ease in finding gay role models,
   especially in professional settings, than do older men. Their accounts
   also support the notion that a therapeutic ethos is becoming ever more

AB The past 70 years has seen the rise of a new type of actor that falls
   outside traditional conceptions of regulation and value. Fair trade
   organizations regulate production and distribution processes globally
   and provide the infrastructure for a market in which value lies in a
   product's utility and conditions of production and terms of exchange.
   Fair trade emerged to address persistent economic, social, and
   environmental inequalities between global North and South. But what
   explains the rise of the fair trade market over this time period? Using
   time series regression analysis, I evaluate the claims of several
   theoretical traditions and use world society theory to inform economic
   sociology on understanding how social forces shape global markets. I
   find that only after a shift in world cultural norms do processes of
   unequal exchange become problematized so that moves toward
   liberalization in international trade are countered by movements toward
   regulation.

AB With the rise of molecular genetics and the cornucopia of techniques it
   provides, a number of biomedical researchers in both the public and
   private sectors have turned to the human genome to search for variations
   among the world's populations, with the purpose of tracing human
   evolution and migration patterns and predicting genetic disorders. The
   human genome also offers insight into an individual's genealogy, which
   has never before been charted with such precision. Whereas 18th- and
   19th-century scholars fetishized external characteristics in order to
   classify humans, more recent scholars have turned to the internal
   sequence of the genome. But how does one define populations? Should they
   be based on race? Can one speak of race at the molecular level? This
   essay explores the history of the biology of race with a view to compare
   and contrast modern molecular biological studies with the more
   pernicious actions of early-20th-century eugenicists. The key linking
   the two practices is the search for biological entities that do not
   overlap among the races. A critical difference is that modern studies
   use molecular biology to include previously excluded populations in the
   treatment of certain diseases. While the intentions are quite different,
   a number of scholars feel that genetic essentialism might be the end
   result.

AB Objective: Cultural factors are associated with health behaviors among
   American Indians. Accordingly, the objective of our study was to
   investigate whether cultural identity, defined as the primary language
   spoken at home, is associated with: 1) higher total physical activity
   levels, and 2) levels of leisure-time physical activity recommended for
   health benefits in a diverse sample of American Indians.
   Design: Cross-sectional analysis of 5,207 American Indian adults 18 to
   82 years. Participants resided on the Oglala Sioux (n=2,025) and
   Cheyenne River Sioux (n=1,528) reservations in South Dakota, and the
   Gila River Indian Community (n=1,654) in Arizona.
   Results: Bicultural participants in South Dakota, but not Arizona,
   reported significantly higher total physical activity compared to the
   English-only group (P<.05). About 35% of English only speakers, 39% of
   American Indian/Alaska Native only speakers, and 39% of participants
   speaking both languages met the 150 minutes/week activity threshold.
   Odds of being sufficiently active were higher among bicultural
   respondents in both regions when compared to respondents endorsing only
   English, controlling for sociodemographic and health-related covariates
   (P<.05).
   Conclusion: Bicultural respondents among tribal members in South Dakota
   had significantly higher total physical activity, and higher levels of
   sufficient leisure-time activity in both South Dakota and Arizona,
   compared to those who spoke either language exclusively. Interventions
   that encourage American Indians to develop their bicultural efficacy and
   to draw on resources for healthy living that may be available in all the
   cultures with which they identify are recommended.

AB Objectives: Traditional physical activity (PA) programs have not been

   is limited information regarding the components of PA programs that
   drive participation in African American girls. The purpose of our
   investigation was to describe the facilitators, barriers, and components
   of a tailored afterschool PA program potentially inspire the
   participation American mother-daughter dyads.
   Methods: Six focus groups (n=12 mother-daughter dyads; daughters, 7-10
   yrs in age) were conducted between March and May 2012. Focus group
   semi-structured interviews were transcribed, coded, and systematically
   analyzed using NVivo.
   Results: Mothers reported a preference for non-traditional (dancing,
   household chores) types of PA. While daughters preferred to participate
   in both dance-based and traditional types (walking, riding bikes) of PA.
   Participants felt that the use of a culturally tailored dance program
   would be appealing because it highlights the cultural and historical
   legacy of the African American culture. Mothers wanted programs that
   would allow them time to spend with their daughters. Top three dance
   styles that mothers wanted to participate in were African, hip-hop, and
   Salsa/samba, while daughters reported that they would enjoy
   participating in hip-hop, African, and jazz. The most common responses
   given for resources needed for participating in a culturally tailored
   afterschool dance program were the location of the program,
   transportation, and childcare for siblings.
   Conclusions: Our investigation highlights some cultural factors related
   to facilitators and barriers of PA that should be addressed in designing
   PA studies for African American girls and their mothers.

AB Objectives: To examine differences in health-related quality of life
   (HRQL) by obesity status in a community-based sample of urban Latinos.
   To determine if sex moderates the relationship between HRQL and obesity
   status in this cohort.
   Design, Setting and Participants: Cross-sectional study of 202
   foreign-born Latinos with low levels of acculturation, living in an
   urban setting.
   Main outcome measure: Health-related quality of life by the Medical
   Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12).
   Methods: Including the entire study cohort, t-tests were used to
   determine the unadjusted difference between obese and non-obese
   participants on SF-12 physical and mental functioning scores (PCS and
   MCS, respectively). Linear regression was used to estimate the adjusted
   difference in SF-12 scores between obese and non-obese participants
   after adjusting for potential confounders. The association between
   obesity status and HRQL summary scores were then assessed separately in
   men and women both with and without adjustment for potential
   confounders.
   Results: There was a small but statistically significant unadjusted
   difference between obese and non-obese participants in the physical
   functioning domain of HRQL (-2.2, 95% CI -4.0, -.4), which was no longer
   significant in multivariate analysis (difference -1.5, 95% Cl -3.3, .3).
   There were no significant differences in mental functioning scores in
   unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Sex did not moderate the relationship
   between obesity status and HRQL scores in stratified analyses.
   Conclusions: Our results in an under-studied population suggest that
   obesity may have little impact on HRQL in urban Latinos. Future studies
   with larger and more diverse Latino populations are needed to further
   investigate the relationship between obesity and HRQL, and explore how
   acculturation impacts the association between these two factors.

AB Objective: To evaluate the accuracy of self-reported diabetes among
   multi-ethnic older adults by psychosocial factors and assess predictors
   of diabetes risk, diagnosis, and control.
   Design and Methods: The 2006 Health and Retirement Study (N=5,594) was
   used to determine agreement between self-reported diabetes and measured
   diabetes (HbA1c >= 6.5%) by age, sex, race/ethnicity, nativity,
   education, health insurance coverage, body mass index, depressive
   symptoms, and prior report of racial discrimination. We also examined
   associations between these factors and pre-diabetes (HbA1c >= 6.0-<6.5%)
   among individuals without diabetes, and those with undiagnosed and
   poorly controlled (HbA1c >= 8.0%) diabetes.
   Results: Accuracy of self-reported diabetes was good (ie, sensitivity >=
   80% and specificity >= 95%) among all demographic subgroups and across
   most social strata. Among those who reported racial discrimination,
   sensitivity of self-reported diabetes was lower among Blacks who
   reported racial discrimination in comparison to Blacks who did not
   report racial discrimination (82.7% vs 89.0%) an association that was
   marginally statistically significant (P=.05). Blacks and Hispanics had
   higher odds of pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and poor glycemic
   control.
   Conclusions: Self-reported diabetes corresponded well with HbA1c
   assessed disease for all social strata examined in this sample of
   multi-ethnic older adults. Blacks with a history of racial
   discrimination may be less likely to know diabetes status.

AB Objective: Language barriers may be significant contributors to diabetes
   disparities. We sought to assess the association of English speaking
   ability with glycemic control among Latinos with diabetes.
   Methods: We analyzed 167 Latinos from a cross-sectional survey of adults
   with type 2 diabetes. The main outcome was HbA1c >= 7.0%. The main
   predictor was self-reported English speaking ability. Adjusted analyses
   accounted for age, sex, education, annual income, health insurance
   status, duration of diabetes, birth in the United States, and years in
   the United States.
   Results: In unadjusted analyses, point estimates for the odds of having
   a high HbA1c revealed a U-shaped curve with English speaking ability.
   Those who spoke English very well (OR=2.32, 95% CI, 1.00-5.41) or not at
   all (OR=4.11, 95% CI 1.35-12.54) had higher odds of having an elevated
   HbA1c than those who spoke English well, although this was only
   statistically significant for those who spoke no English. In adjusted
   analyses, the U-shaped curve persisted with the highest odds among those
   who spoke English very well (OR=3.20, 95% CI 1.05-9.79) or not at all
   (OR 4.95, 95% CI 1.29-18.92).
   Conclusions: The relationship between English speaking ability and
   diabetes management is more complex than previously described.
   Interventions aimed at improving diabetes outcomes may need to be
   tailored to specific subgroups within the Latino population.

AB Objectives: The Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos
   (HCHS/SOL) Sociocultural Ancillary Study aims to examine associations
   between sociocultural and psychosocial factors and cardiovascular
   disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome prevalence in Hispanics/Latinos.
   The conceptual framework is based on the Reserve Capacity and Lifespan
   Biopsychosocial Models, which emphasize multiple risk and protective
   pathways underlying socioeconomic and ethnic influences in health. This
   study describes the rationale, participants, and procedures for the
   HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary Study.
   Design and Setting: The Sociocultural Ancillary Study to the HCHS/SOL is
   a cross-sectional cohort study with future opportunities for prospective
   investigation.
   Participants: Participants were 5,313 adults, aged 18-74 years, of
   self-identified Hispanic/Latino descent and representing multiple
   Hispanic/Latino background groups, recruited from the Bronx, N.Y.,
   Chicago, Ill., Miami, Fla., and San Diego, Calif.
   Intervention: Participants completed an interview-administered
   sociocultural assessment battery within 9 months of their HCHS/SOL
   clinical baseline exam.
   Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are CVD and metabolic syndrome
   and its component risk factors.
   Results: The Sociocultural Ancillary Study sample is broadly
   representative of the HCHS/SOL cohort. Weighted demographics are: 55%
   male, 56% 18-44 years, 44% >= 45 years, and 37% Mexican, 20% Cuban, 16%
   Puerto Rican, 12% Dominican, 8% Central American, and 5% South American
   descent.
   Conclusions: By testing theoretically driven hypotheses concerning
   sociocultural and psychosocial factors in CVD, the Sociocultural
   Ancillary Study seeks to inform future prevention and intervention
   efforts for US Hispanic/Latinos.

AB Objective: There is consistent evidence demonstrating that pet-keeping,
   particularly of dogs, is beneficial to human health. We explored
   relationships between maternal race and prenatal dog-keeping, accounting
   for measures of socioeconomic status that could affect the choice of
   owning a pet, in a demographically diverse, unselected birth cohort.
   Design: Self-reported data on mothers' race, socioeconomic
   characteristics and dog-keeping practices were obtained during prenatal
   interviews and analyzed cross-sectionally. Robust methods of covariate
   balancing via propensity score analysis were utilized to examine if race
   (Black vs White), independent of other participant traits, influenced
   prenatal dog-keeping.
   Setting: A birth cohort study conducted in a health care system in
   metropolitan Detroit, Michigan between September 2003 and November 2007.
   Participants: 1065 pregnant women (n = 775 or 72.8% Black), between ages
   21 and 45, receiving prenatal care.
   Main Outcome Measures: Participant's self-report of race/ethnicity and
   prenatal dog-keeping, which was defined as her owning or caring for >= 1
   dog for more than 1 week at her home since learning of her pregnancy,
   regardless of whether the dog was kept inside or outside of her home.
   Results: In total, 294 women (27.6%) reported prenatal dog-keeping.
   Prenatal dog-keeping was significantly lower among Black women as
   compared to White women (20.9% vs 45.5%, P<.001), and remained
   significantly different even after propensity score analysis was
   applied.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that there are persistent racial
   differences in dog-keeping not fully explained by measures of
   socioeconomic status. Racial differences in prenatal dog-keeping may
   contribute to childhood health disparities.

AB Background: While effects of age, race, place of residence, and marital
   status on receipt of treatment among female breast cancer patients have
   been well documented, place of birth is a relatively less studied
   factor. The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between
   birth place and type of surgery performed for early-stage breast cancer
   among US women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.
   Methods: Eligible cases (n = 119,560) were selected from the SEER
   registries for the period 2004-2009. US-born and foreign-born patients
   of different racial/ethnic groups were compared to US-born non-Hispanic
   Whites (NHW) with respect to receipt of breast conserving surgery (BCS)
   or mastectomy. Results of multivariable logistic regression analyses
   were expressed as adjusted odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95%
   confidence intervals (CI).
   Results: The proportion of BCS was highest in foreign-born Whites
   (62.5%) and lowest in foreign-born Asians (50.3%). Relative to US-born
   NHW, BCS was more common in foreign-born Whites (OR=1.21. 95% CI:
   1.15-1.28) and foreign-born Blacks (OR=1.21. 95% CI: 1.15-1.28). In
   contrast, foreign-born Asians received less BCS compared to both US-born
   NHW (OR=.76, 95% CI:.72-0.80) and US-born Asians (OR=.74, 95% CI:
   .64-.86).
   Conclusions: Foreign-born Asian breast cancer patients are less likely
   to receive BSC compared to US-born Whites or Asian-Americans, whereas
   foreign-born Whites and foreign-born Blacks are more likely to receive
   BCS than US-born Whites. Further studies are needed to understand
   cultural and or health systems factors that may explain these
   observations.

AB Background: 'Syndemic factors', defined as co-occurring psychological
   conditions including major depressive disorder, substance and alcohol
   use, and intimate partner violence, have been shown to increase HIV
   incidence among MSM in the United States. However, this relationship has
   not been well characterized in the general population, particularly in
   the context of poverty.
   Design: Prospective cohort study including a nationally-representative
   sample of 34 427 men and women in the National Epidemiologic Survey on
   Alcohol and Related Conditions wave 1 (2001-2002) and wave 2
   (2004-2005).
   Methods: Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to
   assess the association between syndemic factors and newly diagnosed HIV
   infection, and to assess how living below the poverty line (based on
   2001 US Poverty Guidelines) modified this relationship.
   Results: The proportion of participants reporting new HIV diagnosis in
   the past year was 0.22%, increasing from 0.19% among individuals with no
   syndemic factor to 5.1% among those with four syndemic factors.
   Adjusting for potentially confounding factors, each additional syndemic
   factor was associated with a 47% increase in odds of HIV infection
   [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI)
   1.30-1.65]. The effect of syndemic factors was stronger among
   individuals living below federal poverty guidelines (aOR 1.96, 95% CI
   1.57-2.44) compared to those living above poverty guidelines (aOR 1.21,
   95% CI 1.07-1.36).
   Conclusions: Among the US general population, the association between
   co-occurring syndemic factors and incident HIV infection was stronger in
   the setting of poverty. Mental health interventions, particularly in
   socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, should be considered to reduce
   transmission of HIV. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar

AB Although major research efforts have focused on how specific components
   of foodstuffs affect health, relatively little is known about a more
   fundamental aspect of diet, the frequency and circadian timing of meals,
   and potential benefits of intermittent periods with no or very low
   energy intakes. The most common eating pattern in modern societies,
   three meals plus snacks every day, is abnormal from an evolutionary
   perspective. Emerging findings from studies of animal models and human
   subjects suggest that intermittent energy restriction periods of as
   little as 16 h can improve health indicators and counteract disease
   processes. The mechanisms involve a metabolic shift to fat metabolism
   and ketone production, and stimulation of adaptive cellular stress
   responses that prevent and repair molecular damage. As data on the
   optimal frequency and timing of meals crystalizes, it will be critical
   to develop strategies to incorporate those eating patterns into health
   care policy and practice, and the lifestyles of the population.

AB Some cross-cultural evidence suggests lethal coalitionary aggression in
   humans is the product of residence and descent rules that promote
   fraternal interest groups, i.e., power groups of coresident males bonded
   by kinship. As such, human lethal coalitions are hypothesized to be
   homologous to chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) border patrols. However,
   humans demonstrate a unique metagroup social structure in which
   strategic alliances allow individuals to form coalitions transcending
   local community boundaries. We test predictions derived from the
   fraternal interest group and strategic alliance models using lethal
   coalition data from a lowland South American population, the Yanomamo.
   Yanomamo men who kill an enemy acquire a special status, termed unokai.
   We examine the social characteristics of co-unokais or men who jointly
   kill others. Analyses indicate co-unokais generally are (i) from the
   same population but from different villages and patrilines, (ii) close
   agemates, and (iii) maternal half-first cousins. Furthermore, the
   incident rate for co-unokai killings increases if men are similar in
   age, from the same population, and from different natal communities.
   Co-unokais who have killed more times in the past and who are more
   genetically related to each other have a higher probability of
   coresidence in adulthood. Last, a relationship exists between lethal
   coalition formation and marriage exchange. In this population, internal
   warfare unites multiple communities, and co-unokais strategically form
   new residential groups and marriage alliances. These results support the
   strategic alliance model of coalitionary aggression, demonstrate the
   complexities of human alliance formation, and illuminate key differences
   in social structure distinguishing humans from other primates.

AB Ongoing debates in the academic community and in the public policy arena
   continue without clear resolution about the significance of global
   climate change for the risk of increased conflict. Sub-Saharan Africa is
   generally agreed to be the region most vulnerable to such climate
   impacts. Using a large database of conflict events and detailed
   climatological data covering the period 1980-2012, we apply a multilevel
   modeling technique that allows for a more nuanced understanding of a
   climate-conflict link than has been seen heretofore. In the aggregate,
   high temperature extremes are associated with more conflict; however,
   different types of conflict and different subregions do not show
   consistent relationship with temperature deviations. Precipitation
   deviations, both high and low, are generally not significant. The
   location and timing of violence are influenced less by climate anomalies
   (temperature or precipitation variations from normal) than by key
   political, economic, and geographic factors. We find important
   distinctions in the relationship between temperature extremes and
   conflict by using multiple methods of analysis and by exploiting our
   time-series cross-sectional dataset for disaggregated analyses.

AB Computer-mediated communication is driving fundamental changes in the
   nature of written language. We investigate these changes by statistical
   analysis of a dataset comprising 107 million Twitter messages (authored
   by 2.7 million unique user accounts). Using a latent vector
   autoregressive model to aggregate across thousands of words, we identify
   high-level patterns in diffusion of linguistic change over the United
   States. Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's
   sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the
   relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic
   and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support
   for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population
   size. However, demographic similarity - especially with regard to race -
   plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial
   demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather
   than moving towards a single unified "netspeak'' dialect, language
   evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault
   lines in spoken American English.

AB Advances in genomics are contributing to the development of more
   effective, personalized approaches to the prevention and treatment of
   infectious diseases. Genetic sequencing technologies are furthering our
   understanding of how human and pathogen genomic factors - and their
   interactions - contribute to individual differences in immunologic
   responses to vaccines, infections and drug therapies. Such understanding
   will influence future policies and procedures for infectious disease
   management. With the potential for tailored interventions for particular
   individuals, populations or subpopulations, ethical, legal and social
   implications (ELSIs) may arise for public health and clinical practice.
   Potential considerations include balancing health-related benefits and
   harms between individuals and the larger community, minimizing threats
   to individual privacy and autonomy, and ensuring just distribution of
   scarce resources. In this Opinion, we consider the potential application
   of pathogen and host genomic information to particular viral infections
   that have large-scale public health consequences but differ in
   ELSI-relevant characteristics such as ease of transmission, chronicity,
   severity, preventability and treatability. We argue for the importance
   of anticipating these ELSI issues in advance of new scientific
   discoveries, and call for the development of strategies for identifying

AB It is vitally important for humans to detect living creatures in the
   environment and to analyze their behavior to facilitate action
   understanding and high-level social inference. The current study
   employed naturalistic point-light animations to examine the ability of
   human observers to spontaneously identify and discriminate socially
   interactive behaviors between two human agents. Specifically, we
   investigated the importance of global body form, intrinsic joint
   movements, extrinsic whole-body movements, and critically, the
   congruency between intrinsic and extrinsic motions. Motion congruency is
   hypothesized to be particularly important because of the constraint it
   imposes on naturalistic action due to the inherent causal relationship
   between limb movements and whole body motion. Using a free response
   paradigm in Experiment 1, we discovered that many naive observers (55%)
   spontaneously attributed animate and/or social traits to
   spatially-scrambled displays of interpersonal interaction. Total
   stimulus motion energy was strongly correlated with the likelihood that
   an observer would attribute animate/social traits, as opposed to
   physical/mechanical traits, to the scrambled dot stimuli. In Experiment
   2, we found that participants could identify interactions between
   spatially-scrambled displays of human dance as long as congruency was
   maintained between intrinsic/extrinsic movements. Violating the motion
   congruency constraint resulted in chance discrimination performance for
   the spatially-scrambled displays. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that
   scrambled point-light dancing animations violating this constraint were
   also rated as significantly less interactive than animations with
   congruent intrinsic/extrinsic motion. These results demonstrate the
   importance of intrinsic/extrinsic motion congruency for biological
   motion analysis, and support a theoretical framework in which early
   visual filters help to detect animate agents in the environment based on
   several fundamental constraints. Only after satisfying these basic
   constraints could stimuli be evaluated for high-level social content. In
   this way, we posit that perceptual animacy may serve as a gateway to
   higher-level processes that support action understanding and social
   inference.

AB Direct reciprocity and conditional cooperation are important mechanisms
   to prevent free riding in social dilemmas. However, in large groups,
   these mechanisms may become ineffective because they require single
   individuals to have a substantial influence on their peers. However, the
   recent discovery of zero-determinant strategies in the iterated
   prisoner's dilemma suggests that we may have underestimated the degree
   of control that a single player can exert. Here, we develop a theory for
   zero-determinant strategies for iterated multiplayer social dilemmas,
   with any number of involved players. We distinguish several particularly
   interesting subclasses of strategies: fair strategies ensure that the
   own payoff matches the average payoff of the group; extortionate
   strategies allow a player to perform above average; and generous
   strategies let a player perform below average. We use this theory to
   describe strategies that sustain cooperation, including generalized
   variants of Tit-for-Tat and Win-Stay Lose-Shift. Moreover, we explore
   two models that show how individuals can further enhance their strategic
   options by coordinating their play with others. Our results highlight
   the importance of individual control and coordination to succeed in
   large groups.

AB BACKGROUND Socioeconomic status (SES) plays an important role in
   colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, although the independent and joint
   effects with nativity and neighborhood factors have yet to be evaluated.
   METHODS With nearly one-third of all US Hispanics residing in
   California, the authors obtained information from the California Cancer
   Registry to examine the associations between neighborhood SES and
   mortality in all 33,146 Hispanic individuals diagnosed with CRC from
   1988 through 2010, with a particular focus on associations among US-born
   and foreign-born Hispanics. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
   calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for
   overall and CRC-specific mortality. RESULTS Hispanics residing in lower
   SES neighborhoods demonstrated a higher rate of overall and CRC-specific
   mortality than those residing in high SES neighborhoods (SES quintile
   1[low] vs quintile 5 [high]: HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05-1.26] and HR, 1.16
   [95% CI, 1.03-1.30], respectively). Nativity modified the associations
   between SES and mortality (P for interaction, .02 for overall and P for
   interaction, .01 for CRC-specific mortality) such that the SES
   associations were observed only among US-born (P for trend<.01 for
   overall and CRC-specific mortality) but not among foreign-born
   Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS Neighborhood SES demonstrates significant
   differential effects on overall and CRC-specific mortality between
   US-born and foreign-born Hispanics. Future efforts should investigate
   the underlying contextual and individual-level factors that could
   account for these differential associations by nativity. (c) 2014

AB Background: Most major diseases have important social determinants. In
   this context, classification of disease based on etiologic or anatomic
   criteria may be neither mutually exclusive nor optimal.
   Methods and Findings: Units of analysis comprised large metropolitan
   central and fringe metropolitan counties with reliable mortality rates -
   (n = 416). Participants included infants and adults ages 25 to 64 years
   with selected causes of death (1999 to 2006). Exposures included that
   residential segregation and race-specific social deprivation variables.
   Main outcome measures were obtained via principal components analyses
   with an orthogonal rotation to identify a common factor. To discern
   whether the common factor was socially mediated, negative binomial
   multiple regression models were developed for which the dependent
   variable was the common factor. Results showed that infant deaths,
   mortality from assault, and malignant neoplasm of the trachea, bronchus
   and lung formed a common factor for race-gender groups (black/white and
   men/women). Regression analyses showed statistically significant,
   positive associations between low socio-economic status for all
   race-gender groups and this common factor.
   Conclusions: Between 1999 and 2006, deaths classified as "assault" and
   "lung cancer", as well as "infant mortality" formed a socially mediated
   factor detectable in population but not individual data. Despite
   limitations related to death certificate data, the results contribute
   important information to the formulation of several hypotheses: (a)
   disease classifications based on anatomic or etiologic criteria fail to
   account for social determinants; (b) social forces produce
   demographically and possibly geographically distinct population-based
   disease constellations; and (c) the individual components of
   population-based disease constellations (e. g., lung cancer) are
   phenotypically comparable from one population to another but
   genotypically different, in part, because of socially mediated
   epigenetic variations. Additional research may produce new taxonomies
   that unify social determinants with anatomic and/or etiologic
   determinants. This may lead to improved medical management of
   individuals and populations.

AB A classic question of social science is how knowledge informs practice.
   Research on physicians' decisions about medical knowledge has focused on
   doctors' personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus,
   producing divergent findings. This study asks, instead, How is decision
   making about the use of knowledge influenced by features of work? From
   observations of one team's decisions in multiple clinical and
   administrative contexts, the author argues that making decisions is
   contingent upon temporal features of physicians' tasks. Physicians
   receive feedback at different speeds, and they must account for these
   speeds when judging what they can prioritize. This finding explains
   doctors' perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long
   feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product
   of shorter feedback loops. In these latter scenarios, physicians
   consider and deploy scientific knowledge after-and not before, as is
   usually assumed-determining a fruitful plan of action.

AB Social exclusion is a complex social phenomenon with powerful negative
   consequences. Given the impact of social exclusion on mental and
   emotional health, an understanding of how perceptions of social
   exclusion develop over the course of a social interaction is important
   for advancing treatments aimed at lessening the harmful costs of being
   excluded. To date, most scientific examinations of social exclusion have
   looked at exclusion after a social interaction has been completed. While
   this has been very helpful in developing an understanding of what
   happens to a person following exclusion, it has not helped to clarify
   the moment-to-moment dynamics of the process of social exclusion.
   Accordingly, the current protocol was developed to obtain an improved
   understanding of social exclusion by examining the patterns of
   event-related brain activation that are present during social
   interactions. This protocol allows greater precision and sensitivity in
   detailing the social processes that lead people to feel as though they
   have been excluded from a social interaction. Importantly, the current
   protocol can be adapted to include research projects that vary the
   nature of exclusionary social interactions by altering how frequently
   participants are included, how long the periods of exclusion will last
   in each interaction, and when exclusion will take place during the
   social interactions. Further, the current protocol can be used to
   examine variables and constructs beyond those related to social
   exclusion. This capability to address a variety of applications across
   psychology by obtaining both neural and behavioral data during ongoing
   social interactions suggests the present protocol could be at the core
   of a developing area of scientific inquiry related to social
   interactions.

AB Context: Few empirical studies have examined social support from
   athletic trainers (ATs) and its buffering effect during injury recovery.
   Objective: To examine the effect of social support received from ATs
   during injury recovery on reported symptoms of depression and anxiety at
   return to play among a cohort of collegiate athletes.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Two Big 10 Conference universities.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 594 injuries sustained by 387
   collegiate athletes (397 injuries by 256 males, 197 injuries by 131
   females) on 9 sports teams.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Data were collected during the 2007-2011
   seasons. Social support was measured using the 6-item Social Support
   Questionnaire. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Center for
   Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Anxiety was measured by the
   State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. We used generalized estimation equation
   regression models to examine the effect of the social support from ATs
   on the odds of symptoms of depression and anxiety at return to play.
   Results: In 84.3% (n = 501) of injury events, injured athletes received
   social support from ATs during their recovery. Of these, 264 (53.1%)
   athletes reported being very satisfied with this social support. Whether
   or not athletes received social support from ATs during recovery did not
   affect the symptoms of depression or anxiety experienced at return to
   play. However, compared with athletes who were dissatisfied with the
   social support received from ATs, athletes who were very satisfied or
   satisfied with this social support were 87% (95% confidence interval =
   0.06, 0.30) and 70% (95% confidence interval = 0.13, 0.70) less likely
   to report symptoms of depression at return to play, respectively.
   Similar results were observed for anxiety.
   Conclusions: Our findings support the buffering effect of social support
   from ATs and have important implications for successful recovery in both
   the physical and psychological aspects for injured athletes.

AB Cities are a locus for struggles over the ability for historically
   marginalized groups to feed themselves. These stratified spaces
   represent a distinct expression of the conventional agrifood system: the
   undernutrition/malnutrition paradox. By investigating the food politics
   of two organizations - Food Not Bombs in Orlando, FL and People's
   Grocery in West Oakland, CA - this article advances scholarship on how
   activists are working to heal and prevent further individual and social
   metabolic rifts tied to urban food systems. Particularly regarding food
   access, strategies to resist and transform the conditions producing
   experiential and cognitive alienation and the commodification of land
   and labor often emerge from interstitial spaces. Yet, radical food
   politics is embedded within ongoing processes of neoliberalization that
   complicate and oftentimes blunt their transformative potential. In
   short, this article investigates the potential for and challenges faced
   by 'actually existing radical projects' working to lessen/end hunger and
   diet-related health problems.

AB In recent decades, sports franchises have exploited their privileged
   relationship to the state in order to expand the scope of their local
   monopoly powers. This article examines efforts by the owners of the
   United Center, the home arena of the Chicago Bulls and Chicago
   Blackhawks, to eliminate competition from local peanut vendors. The
   owners benefited from court rulings rejecting the legitimacy of
   government intervention in local markets at the same time that they
   successfully lobbied municipal politicians to intervene on their behalf
   by passing anti-vendor legislation. This story not only offers a case
   study in how teams' monopolistic privilege has extended to concessions
   markets, but also contributes to a broader understanding of how the
   neoliberal state works to minimize risk and maximize profitability for
   large-scale real estate investments like sports arenas. The
   methodological approach is interdisciplinary, drawing on legal and
   business history, urban geography and sociology, and radical political
   economy.

AB Objectives. We examined the association between survival of infants with
   severe congenital heart defects (CHDs) and community-level indicators of
   socioeconomic status.
   Methods. We identified infants born to residents of Arizona, New Jersey,
   New York, and Texas between 1999 and 2007 with selected CHDs from 4
   population-based, statewide birth defect surveillance programs. We
   linked data to the 2000 US Census to obtain 11 census tract-level
   socioeconomic indicators. We estimated survival probabilities and hazard
   ratios adjusted for individual characteristics.
   Results. We observed differences in infant survival for 8 community
   socioeconomic indicators (P < .05). The greatest mortality risk was
   associated with residing in communities in the most disadvantaged
   deciles for poverty (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.49; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 1.11, 1.99), education (AHR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.16,
   1.96), and operator or laborer occupations (AHR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.16,
   1.96). Survival decreased with increasing numbers of indicators that
   were in the most disadvantaged decile. Community-level mortality risk
   persisted when we adjusted for individual-level characteristics.
   Conclusions. The increased mortality risk among infants with CHDs living
   in socioeconomically deprived communities might indicate barriers to
   quality and timely care at which public health interventions might be
   targeted.

AB Objectives. We sought to determine whether the socioeconomic environment
   was associated with no participation in physical activity among
   adolescents in Boston, Massachusetts.
   Methods. We used cross-sectional data from 1878 urban adolescents living
   in 38 neighborhoods who participated in the 2008 Boston Youth Survey, a
   biennial survey of high school students (aged 14-19 years). We used
   multilevel multiple regression models to determine the association
   between neighborhood-level exposures of economic deprivation, social
   fragmentation, social cohesion, danger and disorder, and students'
   reports of no participation in physical activity in the previous week.
   Results. High social fragmentation within the residential neighborhood
   was associated with an increased likelihood of being inactive (odds
   ratio = 1.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.14, 2.05). No other
   neighborhood exposures were associated with physical inactivity.
   Conclusions. Social fragmentation might be an important correlate of
   physical inactivity among youths living in urban settings. Interventions
   might be needed to assist youths living in unstable neighborhoods to be
   physically active.

AB Intervention programs that change environments have the potential for

   programs. We began a cluster randomized, multi-component multi-level
   intervention to improve weight, diet, and physical activity among
   low-socioeconomic status public housing residents. Here we describe the
   rationale, intervention design, and baseline survey data. After
   approaching 12 developments, ten were randomized to intervention (n = 5)
   or assessment-only control (n = 5). All residents in intervention
   developments are welcome to attend any intervention component: health
   screenings, mobile food bus, walking groups, cooking demonstrations, and
   a social media campaign; all of which are facilitated by community
   health workers who are residents trained in health outreach. To evaluate
   weight and behavioral outcomes, a subgroup of female residents and their
   daughters age 8-15 were recruited into an evaluation cohort In total,
   211 households completed the survey (RR = 46.44%). Respondents were
   Latino (63%), Black (24%), and had <= high school education (64%).
   Respondents reported <= 2 servings of fruits & vegetables/day (62%),
   visiting fast food restaurants 1 + times/week (32%), and drinking soft
   drinks daily or more (27%). The only difference between randomized
   groups was race/ethnicity, with more Black residents in the intervention
   vs. control group (28% vs. 19%, p=0.0146). Among low-socioeconomic
   status urban public housing residents, we successfully recruited and
   randomized families into a multi-level intervention targeting obesity.
   If successful, this intervention model could be adopted in other public
   housing developments or entities that also employ community health
   workers, such as food assistance programs or hospitals. (C) 2014

AB Aim. - The objective of this study is to examine the relationship
   between self-reported birth weight and the adult occurrence of type 2
   diabetes mellitus in a large multi-ethnic population of women.
   Methods. - Baseline data from the Women's Health Initiative
   Observational Study [n = 75,993] was used to examine the association
   between participant birth weight category and prevalent type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. Models were adjusted for age, ethnicity, body mass index and
   other pertinent risk factors. Sub-analyses were performed stratifying by
   ethnicity.
   Results. - There was a strong inverse association between birth weight
   and type 2 diabetes mellitus with a birth weight of <6 pounds (lbs) (OR:
   1.16, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.33) significantly associated with an increased
   risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a birth weight of >= 10 lbs (OR:
   0.72, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.92) associated with a decreased risk of type 2
   diabetes mellitus compared to women who reported their birth weight
   between 7 and 8 lbs 15 ounces (oz). Stratifying by ethnicity, the
   inverse association between birth weight and type 2 diabetes mellitus
   was only apparent in White women, but not Black, Hispanic or Asian
   women.
   Conclusion. - Lower birth weight was associated with increased T2D risk
   in American White and Black post-menopausal women. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Topographically isolated communities of the southern Appalachian
   Mountains provide an ideal area in which to examine the impact of
   environmental and social connections on the economy of land sales. Our
   objective was to identify whether the price of land in a small
   Appalachian county of southwestern Virginia, USA, from 1786 to 1830, was
   influenced by area, month or year of sale, water availability, presence
   of tree species that were proxies of site quality, grantor/grantee
   residency, or familial relationship between grantor and grantee. The
   multiple regression model identified four significant factors that
   influenced the price of land during early European settlement of the
   southern Appalachian Mountains. Larger areas of land sold for lower
   prices. Landowners sold land to relatives at a lower price than to
   nonrelatives. The presence of surface water or red maple (Acer rubrum)
   on the property was associated with lower land prices. The negative
   relationship between water and price of land was likely a reflection
   that the parcels sold at the highest prices were in towns where streams
   or rivers were no longer relied upon as a water source. The model
   explained 39% of the variation and demonstrated a blend of environmental
   and social factors that influenced land sale patterns during early
   European settlement of the Appalachian Mountains.

AB Background. Less than half of women with ovarian cancer and blacks
   specifically receive therapy adherent to National Comprehensive Cancer
   Network (NCCN) guidelines. The purpose is to assess the effect of
   neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) on black-white treatment
   differences in a population-based analysis in a highly-segregated
   community.
   Methods. Illinois State Cancer Registry data for invasive epithelial
   ovarian cancer cases diagnosed in Cook County, IL in non-Hispanic white
   (NHW) or black (NHB) women from 1998 to 2009 was analyzed. As few women
   receive NCCN-adherent care, variables were constructed to assess extent
   of treatment, including receipt of: 1) debulking surgery; 2) any
   surgery; 3) multi-agent chemotherapy; and 4) any chemotherapy. Two
   measures (concentrated affluence and disadvantage) were used to estimate
   neighborhood-level SES. Multivariable logistic regression was used to
   compute odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% Cl), with
   generalized linear mixed models to account for hierarchical data.
   Results. 2766 (81.0%) NHW and 647 (19.0%) NHB women were diagnosed.
   Adjusting for covariates, NHB were less likely to receive debulking
   surgery (OR: 039; 95% CI: 030-0.50), any surgery.(OR: 038; 95% CI:
   0.29-0.49), multi-agent chemotherapy (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.45-0.71) and
   any chemotherapy (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.45-0.74). Concentrated affluence
   but not disadvantage was significant in final models for multi-agent and
   any chemotherapy, but not debulking or any surgery.
   Conclusions. Results identify black-white differences consistent across
   treatments that persist despite adjustment for neighborhood-level SES.
   Impact. Results advance inequality awareness beyond "ideal"
   NCCN-adherent care, indicating inequality exists in delivery of even the
   most basic oncologic care. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundRates of alcohol-related outcomes are sensitive to policy
   differences in politically distinct, adjacent territories. Factors that
   shape these cross-border effects, particularly when the policy
   differences are longstanding, remain poorly understood. We compared the
   ability of 2 classes of variables with theoretical relevance to the
   U.S.-Mexico border contextbar attendance and alcohol-related
   social-cognitive variablesto explain elevated drinking on the U.S. side
   of the border relative to other areas of the United States.
   MethodsData were collected from multistage cluster samples of adult
   Mexican Americans on and off the U.S.-Mexico border (current drinker
   N=1,351). Structural equation models were used to test drinking context
   (frequency of bar attendance) and 6 different social-cognitive variables
   (including alcohol-related attitudes, norms, motives, and beliefs) as
   mediators of border effects on a composite drinking index.
   ResultsThe border effect on drinking varied by age (with younger adults
   showing a stronger effect), consistent with previous findings and known
   risk factors in the region. Contrary to theoretical expectations, 6
   different social-cognitive variablesdespite relating strongly with
   drinkingwere comparable in border and nonborder areas (within and across
   age) and played no role in elevated drinking on the border. Conversely,
   elevated drinking among border youth was mediated by bar attendance.
   This mediated moderation effect held after adjusting for potential
   sociodemographic and neighborhood-level confounders.
   ConclusionsIncreased drinking among U.S.-Mexico border youth is
   explained by patterns of bar attendance, but not by more permissive
   alcohol-related social-cognitive variables in border areas: Border youth
   attend bars and drink more than their nonborder counterparts, despite
   having comparable alcohol-related beliefs, attitudes, norms, and motives
   for use. Alcohol's heightened availability and visibility on both sides
   of the border may create opportunities for border youth to drink that
   otherwise would not be considered.

AB BackgroundIt has been observed in several studies that infants with
   anotia/microtia are more common among Hispanics compared with other
   racial/ethnic groups. We examined the association between selected
   Hispanic ethnicity and acculturation factors and anotia/microtia in the
   National Birth Defects Prevention Study.
   MethodsWe examined data from mothers of 351 infants with isolated
   anotia/microtia and 8435 unaffected infants from the National Birth
   Defects Prevention Study with an expected delivery date from 1997 to
   2007. Sociodemographic, maternal, and acculturation factors (e.g., age,
   maternal education, household income, body mass index, gestational
   diabetes, folic acid, smoking, alcohol intake, study center, parental
   birthplace, and years lived in the United States, maternal language)
   were assessed as overall risk factors and also as risk factors among
   subgroups of Hispanics (United States- and foreign-born) versus
   non-Hispanic whites.
   ResultsCompared with non-Hispanic whites, both United States- and
   foreign-born Hispanic mothers demonstrated substantially higher odds of
   delivering infants with anotia/microtia across nearly all strata of
   sociodemographic and other maternal factors (adjusted odds ratios range:
   2.1-11.9). The odds of anotia/microtia was particularly elevated among
   Hispanic mothers who emigrated from Mexico after age five (adjusted odds
   ratios=4.88; 95% confidence interval=2.93-8.11) or who conducted the
   interview in Spanish (adjusted odds ratios=4.97; 95% confidence
   interval=3.00-8.24).
   ConclusionWe observed that certain sociodemographic and acculturation
   factors are associated with higher risks of anotia/microtia among
   offspring of Hispanic mothers. Birth Defects Research (Part A)

AB This paper analyzes how racial and ethnic disparities in exposure to
   industrial air toxics in U.S. cities vary with neighborhood income, and
   how these disparities vary regionally across the country. Exposure is
   estimated at the census block-group level using geographic microdata
   from the Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators of the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that racial and ethnic
   disparities in pollution exposure are strongest among neighborhoods with
   median incomes below $25,000, while income-based disparities are
   stronger among neighborhoods with median incomes above that level. We
   also find considerable differences in the patterns of disparity across
   the ten EPA regions. In the two regions with the highest median exposure
   (the Midwest and South Central regions), for example, African-Americans
   and Hispanics face significantly higher exposures than whites, whereas
   in the region with the next highest exposure (the Mid-Atlantic), the
   reverse is true. We show that the latter result is attributable to
   intercity variations - minorities tend to live in the less polluted
   cities in the region - rather than to within-city variations. (C) 2014

AB Introduction Reducing cancer disparities is a major public health
   objective. Disparities often are discussed in terms of either race and
   ethnicity or socioeconomic status (SES), without examining interactions
   between these variables.Methods Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER)-18 data, excluding Alaska Native and Louisiana
   registries, from 2002 to 2008, were used to estimate five-year,
   cause-specific survival by race/ethnicity and census tract SES.
   Differences in survival between groups were used to assess absolute
   disparities. Hazard ratios were examined as a measure of relative
   disparity. Interactions between race/ethnicity and neighborhood SES were
   evaluated using proportional hazard models.Results Survival increased
   with higher SES for all racial/ethnic groups and generally was higher
   among non-Hispanic white and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) than
   non-Hispanic black and Hispanic cases. Absolute disparity in breast
   cancer survival among non-Hispanic black vs non-Hispanic white cases was
   slightly larger in low-SES areas than in high-SES areas (7.1% and 6.8%,
   respectively). In contrast, after adjusting for stage, age, and
   treatment, risk of mortality among non-Hispanic black cases compared
   with non-Hispanic white cases was 21% higher in low-SES areas and 64%
   higher in high-SES areas. Similarly, patterns of absolute and relative
   disparity compared with non-Hispanic whites differed by SES for Hispanic
   breast cancer, non-Hispanic black colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer
   cases. Statistically significant interactions existed between
   race/ethnicity and SES for colorectal and female breast
   cancers.Discussion In health disparities research, both relative and
   absolute measures provide context. A better understanding of the
   interactions between race/ethnicity and SES may be useful in directing
   screening and treatment resources toward at-risk populations.

AB Synthetic biology enthusiasts often tout the emerging field for its
   present and future potential to revolutionize the life sciences. In the
   biosecurity arena, which has received considerable government and
   non-government attention, many are concerned that synthetic biology may
   prove to be an easier and cheaper way to conduct bioterrorism. To
   evaluate these claims, this article will focus on contrasting two
   different frameworks that have been used for understanding the
   development, diffusion and adoption of synthetic biology. In contrasting
   these frameworks, I will draw on examples from biotechnology and
   information technology because they are often used as analogies in
   synthetic biology discussions. I conclude that the critical elements for
   successful development, transfer, and use of synthetic biology
   methodologies and tools for harm are not purely material or technical,
   but involve important social dimensions that underpin technical work,
   requiring time, teams of experts, appropriate political, legal, and
   funding structures, and the development of new (still unknown)
   techno-organizational processes. To date, there have been few studies
   that have explored these socio-technical mechanisms of synthetic biology
   diffusion through in-depth examination at a micro and macro level.
   However, by having a more nuanced understanding of various synthetic
   biology approaches and how they are (or are not) able to travel easily
   to new settings, one can create a more refined spectrum of factors
   shaping threats from state and non-state actors related to synthetic
   biology. This article ends by outlining new research agendas important
   to support and pursue in order to improve biosecurity policymaking.

AB A health disparities view suggests that low family income status acts as
   a risk factor for poor cognitive functioning. A biosystems view suggests
   that poor sleep and poor stress response system functioning are also
   risk factors. These views are rarely integrated to test multiplicative
   risk or protective effects from social-cultural and biological
   variables. We investigated interactions among familial income,
   children's sleep and respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSA
   reactivity, indexing parasympathetic nervous system reactivity) in the
   prediction of cognitive performance of school-aged children.
   Participants were 282 children (146 boys; 35% African American and 65%
   European American; M age = 9.42 years, SD = .71). Mothers reported on
   family income. Children's sleep quality (efficiency) and duration
   (minutes) were assessed via a week of actigraphy. Children's RSA
   reactivity to an attention demanding and frustrating star tracing
   challenge was assessed in the lab. Children completed standardized
   cognitive assessments examining attention, processing speed, and
   crystallized cognitive functioning. Findings show that more optimal
   sleep efficiency and RSA reactivity interact to confer protection
   against poor cognitive performance, particularly for children from lower
   income homes. Results build on the literature and suggest that
   interactions between biological systems and socioeconomic variables are
   key for understanding children's cognitive performance. (C) 2014 Wiley

AB Objectives: This study assesses the independent and combined effects of
   (1) perceived peer norms, (2) best friend use, and (3) being in the
   presence of others who use on middle school adolescents' consumption of
   marijuana and alcohol, and how the effects of these sources of social
   influence evolve over time as youth progress through middle school.
   Methods: The analytic sample consisted of 11,667 adolescents (50%
   female; >65% Hispanic) in 6th, 7th or 8th grade from 16 middle schools
   across three school districts in Southern California. Participants were
   assessed at 5 time points from 2008 to 2011.
   Results: All sources of social influence were predictive of alcohol and
   marijuana consumption. As youth grew older, spending time with other
   adolescents who drink increased adolescents' likelihood of drinking
   alcohol, whereas perceived norms became less influential. Furthermore,
   as adolescents spent more time around other youths who drink, the
   predictive value of perceived norms on alcohol consumption decreased.
   Similarly, as youth grew older, the influence of best friend's use and
   spending time with other adolescents who use marijuana remain stable,
   whereas perceived norms became less influential.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that perceived peer norms may be more
   influential in early adolescence; whereas proximal social determinants
   (e.g., being in the presence of other peers who consume) become more
   influential as youth enter middle adolescence. Prevention programs
   should continue to address misperception of norms with younger
   adolescents to decrease the chances of initiation, but also utilize
   strategies such as refusal skills and alternate coping mechanisms for
   older adolescents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: The current research examines whether measures associated
   with Akers' social learning theory are related to non-medical use of
   prescription stimulants for academic reasons among college students.
   Methods: We examine data from a sample of 549 undergraduate students at
   one public university in the Southeastern United States. We estimate
   several logistic regression models to test our hypotheses.
   Results: The findings indicated that roughly 17% of students reported
   non-medical use of prescription stimulants for academic reasons during
   the past year. In separate models, all four of the social learning
   measures were significantly correlated to non-medical use. In the
   complete model, the risk of non-medical prescription stimulant use for
   academic reasons was increased for respondents who reported more of
   their friends used and also for respondents who believed that
   prescription stimulants were an effective study aid.
   Conclusions: The current research fills an important gap in the
   literature regarding theoretical explanations for non-medical
   prescription stimulant use. Given the high prevalence of non-medical
   prescription stimulant use and the known risks associated with
   non-medical use this research can help inform intervention strategies
   for college populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Exposures associated with coal mining have long been linked
   to occupational disease. More recently, investigators have suggested
   that this industry may affect community health. Methods: We explored
   associations between age-adjusted, county-level respiratory disease
   hospitalization rates (RHRs) in West Virginia and total, surface, and
   underground coal production, taking into account relevant
   sociodemographic and behavioral covariates. RHRs were calculated for
   2005 to 2009, and analyses were performed to assess the effect of coal
   production after adjusting for sociodemographic factors. Results: After
   controlling for percent below poverty, percent urban, and smoking,
   neither total nor underground tonnage was associated with RHR. Surface
   coal production, however, was significantly related with RHR (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Surface coal production makes a small but significant
   contribution to RHR in West Virginia after accounting for other
   important sociodemographic and behavioral determinants of health.

   tobacco and other substances), and (2) executive dysfunction. Moreover,
   the evidence supports that stress and insufficient cognitive resources
   contribute to executive dysfunction and that executive dysfunction is
   evident among individuals who smoke cigarettes, are obese, abuse
   alcohol, and use illicit drugs. Collectively these data support the dual

AB Obesity is now the second leading cause of death and disease in the
   United States leading to health care expenditures exceeding $147 billion
   dollars. The socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority
   groups are at significantly increased risk for obesity. Despite this,
   low income and minority individuals are underrepresented in the current
   obesity treatment literature. Additionally, weight loss outcomes for
   these high risk groups are well below what is typically produced in
   standard, well-controlled behavioral interventions and reach and access
   to treatment is often limited. The use of telecommunications technology
   may provide a solution to this dilemma by expanding dissemination and
   allowing for dynamic tailoring. Further gains may be achieved with the
   use of material incentives to enhance uptake of new behaviors.
   Regardless of what novel strategies are deployed, the need for further
   research to improve the health disparities associated with obesity in
   disadvantaged groups is critical. The purpose of this manuscript is to
   review the weight loss intervention literature that has targeted
   socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority populations
   with an eye toward understanding outcomes, current limitations, areas
   for improvement and need for further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All

   one's relative predict perceived criticism from that relative and (b) to
   explore differences between African Americans and Whites in attributions
   and perceived criticism. A new measure, the Attributions of Criticism
   Scale, was employed in the present study to assess attributions of
   perceived criticism. Results showed that the attributions scale
   demonstrated good psychometric properties in a sample of African
   American (n = 78) and White (n = 165) community participants. As
   hypothesized, attributions were correlated with perceptions of
   criticism. When racial differences in attributions and perceived
   criticism were explored, results showed that African Americans made more
   positive attributions but also perceived more destructive criticism than
   Whites. No racial differences were observed on overall and constructive
   criticism, but there was some evidence to suggest that African Americans
   made more negative attributions than Whites. However, these results were
   inconsistent across recruitment method. Taken together, these findings
   suggest that positive and negative attributions are important factors in
   the perception of criticism and that mean levels of attributions and
   perceived criticism may differ by race. Possible explanations for
   effects as well as clinical implications and directions for future
   research are considered.

AB Background
   It is unclear whether associations between fetal growth and psychiatric
   and socioeconomic problems are consistent with causal mechanisms.
   Aims
   To estimate the extent to which associations are a result of unmeasured
   confounding factors using a sibling-comparison approach.
   Method
   We predicted outcomes from continuously measured birth weight in a
   Swedish population cohort (n=3291773), while controlling for measured
   and unmeasured confounding.
   Results
   In the population, lower birth weight (<= 2500g) increased the risk of
   all outcomes. Sibling-comparison models indicated that lower birth
   weight independently predicted increased risk for autism spectrum
   disorder (hazard ratio for low birth weight=2.44, 95% CI 1.99-2.97) and
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although attenuated,
   associations remained for psychotic or bipolar disorder and educational
   problems. Associations with suicide attempt, substance use problems and
   social welfare receipt, however, were fully attenuated in sibling
   comparisons.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest that fetal growth, and factors that influence it,
   contribute to psychiatric and socioeconomic problems.

   with a history of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and significant
   psychosocial barriers, which initially served as a barrier to BMT at two
   different centers; we modified our standard consent and education
   process and was able to successfully proceed with BMT and subsequently
   cure her CML. Despite unique challenges, AYA and transgender patients
   with significant psychosocial barriers may achieve successful outcomes
   with BMT. Research is needed regarding guidelines for cross-sex hormone
   therapy administration for patients undergoing BMT and other issues,
   which may be unique to the transgender experience.

AB ObjectivesChanges in sleep patterns often occur in older adults.
   Previous studies have documented associations between sleep duration,
   sleep quality, and obesity risk in older individuals, yet few studies
   have examined these trends in lower-income countries. The present
   cross-sectional study uses nationally representative datasets from six
   countries to examine these relationships.
   MethodsTwo hypotheses related to obesity risk and sleep patterns were
   tested using data from the first wave of the World Health Organization's
   Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE). This longitudinal study
   draws on samples of older adults (> 50 years old) in six middle-income
   countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation, and South
   Africa). Self-report data were used to measure sleep duration, sleep
   quality, lifestyle and sociodemographic information, while
   anthropometric measurements were collected to assess body mass index
   (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Multiple linear regressions were
   used to examine the relationship between sleep patterns and obesity risk
   while controlling for lifestyle factors.
   ResultsShorter sleep durations in both men and women were significantly
   associated with higher BMI and WC measures (P<0.05). Low sleep quality
   did not significantly contribute to increased obesity risk.
   Surprisingly, high sleep quality was significantly associated with
   increased male BMI and WC in China and India (P<0.01).
   ConclusionsThis study documented an association between short sleep
   duration and increased obesity risk, which is important given the global
   increase of obesity-related diseases. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 26:803-812,

AB Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Access
   to care has been identified as a significant factor affecting
   hypertension treatment and control. We examined disparities in access to
   care among US adults with self-reported hypertension.
   Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2011 data, we
   identified US adults with self-reported hypertension. Access to care was
   assessed based on responses to questions about health insurance, having
   an identified personal doctor, and cost barriers to visiting a doctor.
   We assessed access to care by geographic location (ie, US state) and
   selected sociodemographic characteristics.
   Overall, 159,947 eligible participants reported having hypertension.
   Among them, 19.1% had no health insurance, 18.1% had no personal doctor,
   and 23.6% could not visit a doctor because of cost. Among those with
   hypertension by state, age-standardized prevalence of no health
   insurance ranged from 6.3% in Hawaii to 28.1% in Texas. The prevalence
   of those without a personal doctor ranged from 9.2% in Massachusetts to
   32.7% in Nevada, and the prevalence of cost barrier to visiting a doctor
   ranged from 10.8% in North Dakota to 35.1% in Tennessee. By
   sociodemographic characteristics, the prevalence with no health
   insurance was highest among those aged 18-44 years (25.9%), Hispanics
   (28.1%), those with less than a high school education (32.8%), and those
   with a household income of less than $25,000 (31.6%). Similar disparity
   patterns were noted for estimates of the other access-to-care variables.
   Among US hypertensive adults, approximately 20% reported access-to-care
   challenges, with significant geographic and sociodemographic variations.

AB Previous studies have described racial and socioeconomic disparities in
   the treatment of infertility. Patient factors such as attitudes and
   awareness may be contributing factors. Since primary care is often the
   setting that serves as an entry into other areas of medicine, we sought
   to evaluate mens attitudes and awareness of male infertility in the
   primary care setting. To do this, we performed a cross-sectional survey
   of mens attitudes toward mens health issues in 210 men from two primary
   care clinic waiting rooms in Atlanta, Georgia. The survey was
   self-administered with closed-ended question items and was approximately
   20 min in length. Of the 310 men approached, 210 agreed to participate
   and returned completed surveys. Overall, 52% of men said they were
   "very" or "somewhat" familiar with infertility and 25% were familiar
   with treatments for infertility. Some men had heard of surgery (21%) and
   medication (35%) as treatments for male infertility. Awareness and
   familiarity with the condition was greater in high socioeconomic status
   men (i.e. college graduates or those with income >$100 k per year) but
   did not differ by race on multivariate analysis. Attitudes toward
   infertility varied by race with non-Caucasian men being more likely to
   indicate that infertility is a serious condition, to be concerned about
   infertility, and to believe it decreases a mans quality-of-life.
   Therefore, a lack of awareness, but not negative attitudes, may
   contribute to previously-described disparities in the treatment of
   infertility.

AB Urban ecosystems are increasingly influenced by residential yard care
   decisions. This had led researchers to focus on homeowner education
   programs when it comes to yard care. Typically, the success of programs
   designed to influence yard care is based on whether the target subject
   changes his or her behavior in a more environmentally conscious manner.
   This threshold, however, fails to consider if individuals share this
   information with their friends and neighbors, thus having a possible
   spillover effect. In this paper, we focus on the transmission of new
   lawn management information among neighbors and consider (1) if
   individuals discuss information they learned in a short-term educational
   program, (2) what factors are associated with diffusion, (3) what
   information individuals share, and (4) what barriers to transmission
   exist. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, we used data from
   a mailed survey, group discussions, and mailed information exchanges.
   Results indicate that best management practices for yards can diffuse
   through the neighborhood (approximately 34 % shared information with
   their neighbors in a one-month period). In addition, factors such as (1)
   attending a group discussion, 2) individual social connectedness, (3)
   length of home ownership, and (4) the presence of children in the
   household were found to be positively related to increased sharing of
   information. Also, for lawns, the content of information shared tended
   to be about increasing grass height and reducing fertilizer
   applications. Finally, we find barriers to sharing ideas based on
   spatial, temporal, or perception factors but overcoming some of these
   barriers is possible.

AB Recent phylogenetic analyses suggest that monogamy precedes the
   evolution of cooperative breeding involving non-breeding helpers. The
   rationale: only through monogamy can helper recipient relatedness
   coefficients match those of parent offspring. Given that humans are
   cooperative breeders, these studies imply a monogamy bottleneck during
   hominin evolution. However, evidence from multiple sources is not
   compelling. In reconciliation, we propose that selection against
   cooperative breeding under alternative mating patterns will be mitigated
   by: (i) kin discrimination, (ii) reduced birth-intervals, and (iii)
   constraints on independent breeding, particularly for premature and
   post-fertile individuals. We suggest that such alternatives require
   consideration to derive a complete picture of the selection pressures
   acting on the evolution of cooperative breeding in humans and other
   animals.

   interactional context of the application of a label is accomplished such
   that the label smarter than you think is made to stick to the student.
   In doing so, I demonstrate how labeling theory can be productively
   extended to consider positive labeling as well as the interactional
   contexts that mediate these labeling processes. In closing, I propose
   that this approach could help develop labeling theory into a complex and
   nuanced theory of the social constitution of human behavior.

AB Objective: The increasing global health burden imposed by eating
   disorders warrants close examination of social exposures associated with
   globalization that potentially elevate risk during the critical
   developmental period of adolescence in low-and middle-income countries
   (LMICs). The study aim was to investigate the association of peer
   influence and perceived social norms with adolescent eating pathology in
   Fiji, a LMIC undergoing rapid social change.
   Method: We measured peer influence on eating concerns (with the
   Inventory of Peer Influence on Eating Concerns; IPIEC), perceived peer
   norms associated with disordered eating and body concerns, perceived
   community cultural norms, and individual cultural orientations in a
   representative sample of school-going ethnic Fijian adolescent girls (n
   = 523). We then developed a multivariable linear regression model to
   examine their relation to eating pathology (measured by the Eating
   Disorder Examination-Questionnaire; EDE-Q).
   Results: We found independent and statistically significant associations
   between both IPIEC scores and our proxy for perceived social norms
   specific to disordered eating (both p < .001) and EDEQ global scores in
   a fully adjusted linear regression model.
   Discussion: Study findings support the possibility that peer influence
   as well as perceived social norms relevant to disordered eating may
   elevate risk for disordered eating in Fiji, during the critical
   developmental period of adolescence. Replication and extension of these
   research findings in other populations undergoing rapid social
   transition-and where globalization is also influencing local social
   norms-may enrich etiologic models and inform strategies to mitigate
   risk. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Despite growing emphasis on transitional care to reduce costs and
   improve quality, few studies have examined transitional care
   improvements in socioeconomically disadvantaged adults. It is important
   to consider these patients separately as many are high-utilizers, have
   different needs, and may have different responses to interventions.
   To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent transitional care improvement
   program on 30-day readmissions, emergency department (ED) use,
   transitional care quality, and mortality.
   Clustered randomized controlled trial conducted at a single urban
   academic medical center in Portland, Oregon.
   Three hundred eighty-two hospitalized low-income adults admitted to
   general medicine or cardiology who were uninsured or had public
   insurance.
   Multicomponent intervention including (1) transitional nurse coaching
   and education, including home visits for highest risk patients; (2)
   pharmacy care, including provision of 30 days of medications after
   discharge for those without prescription drug coverage; (3)
   post-hospital primary care linkages; (4) systems integration and
   continuous quality improvement.
   Primary outcomes included 30-day inpatient readmission and ED use.
   Readmission data were obtained using state-wide administrative data for
   all participants (insured and uninsured). Secondary outcomes included
   quality (3-item Care Transitions Measure) and mortality. Research staff
   administering questionnaires and assessing outcomes were blinded.
   There was no significant difference in 30-day readmission between
   C-TraIn (30/209, 14.4 %) and control patients (27/173, 16.1 %), p =
   0.644, or in ED visits between C-TraIn (51/209, 24.4 %) and control
   (33/173, 19.6 %), p = 0.271. C-TraIn was associated with improved
   transitional care quality; 47.3 % (71/150) of C-TraIn patients reported
   a high quality transition compared to 30.3 % (36/119) control patients,
   odds ratio 2.17 (95 % CI 1.30-3.64). Zero C-TraIn patients died in the
   30-day post-discharge period compared with five in the control group
   (unadjusted p = 0.02).
   C-TraIn did not reduce 30-day inpatient readmissions or ED use; however,
   it improved transitional care quality.

AB Young blacks receiving dialysis have an increased risk of death compared
   with whites in the United States. Factors influencing this disparity
   among the young adult dialysis population have not been well explored.
   Our study examined the relation of neighborhood socioeconomic status
   (SES) and racial differences in mortality in United States young adults
   receiving dialysis. We merged US Renal Data System patient-level data
   from 11,027 black and white patients ages 18-30 years old initiating
   dialysis between 2006 and 2009 with US Census data to obtain
   neighborhood poverty information for each patient. We defined low SES
   neighborhoods as those neighborhoods in US Census zip codes with >= 20%
   of residents living below the federal poverty level and quantified race
   differences in mortality risk by level of neighborhood SES. Among
   patients residing in low SES neighborhoods, blacks had greater mortality
   than whites after adjusting for baseline demographics, clinical
   characteristics, rurality, and access to care factors. This difference
   in mortality between blacks and whites was significantly attenuated in
   higher SES neighborhoods. In the United States, survival between young
   adult blacks and whites receiving dialysis differs by neighborhood SES.
   Additional studies are needed to identify modifiable factors
   contributing to the greater mortality among young adult black dialysis
   patients residing in low SES neighborhoods.

AB The recent trend toward health care consumerism is largely the product
   of market practices, which have instilled the notion of health care as a
   product to be purchased by informed, empowered consumers, rather than a
   service bestowed upon a patient by a paternalistic provider. In recent
   years, health care consumerism has been facilitated by
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of pharmaceutical products. In
   this paper, we use the case of DTCA for antidepressant medications to
   examine medicalization techniques used to promote consumerism and
   establish and expand the antidepressant market. We used content analysis
   of DTCA from the 1997-2006 issues of a broad sample of women's, men's,
   and common readership magazines to identify techniques of
   medicalization, and we analyzed in-depth interviews with magazine
   readers and antidepressant users to examine how such messages are
   received. Findings are presented within a framework of economic
   sociology, which allowed us to unveil the links between emotions and
   social action that undergird responses to medicalization techniques and
   consumption of advertised products.

AB The aim of this article is to theorize how materials can play an active,
   constitutive, and causally effective role in the production and
   sustenance of cultural forms and meanings. It does so through an
   empirical exploration of the Museum of Modern Art of New York (MoMA).
   The article describes the museum as an "objectification machine" that
   endeavors to transform and to stabilize artworks as meaningful "objects"
   that can be exhibited, classified, and circulated. The article explains
   how the extent to which the museum succeeds in this process of
   stabilization ultimately depends on the material properties of artworks
   and, more specially, on whether these behave as "docile" or "unruly"
   objects. Drawing on different empirical examples, the article explores
   how docile and unruly objects shape organizational dynamics within the
   museum and, through them, the wider processes of institutional and
   cultural reproduction. The article uses this empirical example to
   highlight the importance of developing a new "material sensibility" that
   restores heuristic dignity to the material within cultural sociology.

AB Social scientists are well-trained to observe and chart social trends,
   but less experienced at presenting scientific findings in formats that
   can inform social change work. In this article, I propose a new
   theoretical concept that provides a mechanism by which social science
   research can be more effectively applied for proactive policy,
   organizational, and program development. The approach is to use the
   metaphor of "desire paths" from landscape architecture to show how
   social scientists can identify and analyze social desire paths that
   appear on the social structural landscape. Social desire paths usually
   emerge because existing formal structures do not meet individual or
   group needs. Such paths are generally started at the individual level,
   followed by others through individual actions, and ultimately leave an
   (usually informal) imprint on the social structure, even though the
   motivations behind those actions are not usually social change. Using
   what we know about the sociology of interests and what we have learned
   from trying to apply social science findings to policy, I propose seven
   criteria for phenomena to be defined as social desire paths. I then
   apply the criteria to two case studies related to housing, and discuss
   social desire paths usefulness to social scientists involved in any
   research that captures interests, deviance, or innovation; and that also
   has the potential to inform formal structures such as policy,
   organizations, program development, and participatory democracy.

   almost day-to-day account of Durkheim building a network of scholars and

   The result was a sophisticated intellectual movement that could
   jocularly refer to Durkheim as its sacred object, a symbol of itself. In
   effect, we have the collective production of the biography of a
   collective movement making new discoveries, which is what the

AB BackgroundThis study examines the social relationships of elementary
   school children with high-functioning autism, focusing on how gender
   relates to social preferences and acceptance, social connections,
   reciprocal friendships, and rejection.
   MethodPeer nomination data were analyzed for girls with and without ASD
   (n=50) and boys with and without ASD (n=50). Girls and boys with ASD
   were matched by age, gender, and IQ. Each child with ASD was matched by
   age and gender to a typically developing classmate.
   ResultsConsistent with typically developing populations, children with
   ASD preferred, were accepted by, and primarily socialized with
   same-gender friends. With fewer nominations and social relationships,
   girls and boys with ASD appear more socially similar to each other than
   to the same-gender control group. Additionally, girls and boys with ASD
   showed higher rates of social exclusion than their typically developing
   peers. However, boys with ASD were more overtly socially excluded
   compared to girls with ASD, who seemed to be overlooked, rather than
   rejected.
   ConclusionsOur data suggest a number of interesting findings in the
   social relationships of children with ASD in schools. Like typically
   developing populations, children with ASD identify with their own gender
   when socializing and choosing friends. But given the social differences
   between genders, it is likely that girls with ASD are experiencing
   social challenges that are different from boys with ASD. Therefore,
   gender is an important environmental factor to consider when planning
   social skills interventions at school.

AB Background The main strategy for alleviating heart disease has been to
   target individuals and encourage them to change their health behaviours.
   Although important, emphasis on individuals has diverted focus and
   responsibility away from neighbourhood characteristics, which also
   strongly influence people's behaviours. Although a growing body of
   research has repeatedly demonstrated strong associations between
   neighbourhood characteristics and cardiovascular health, it has
   typically focused on negative neighbourhood characteristics. Only a few
   studies have examined the potential health enhancing effects of positive
   neighbourhood characteristics, such as perceived neighbourhood social
   cohesion.
   Methods Using multiple logistic regression models, we tested whether
   higher perceived neighbourhood social cohesion was associated with lower
   incidence of myocardial infarction. Prospective data from the Health and
   Retirement Study-a nationally representative panel study of American
   adults over the age of 50-were used to analyse 5276 participants with no
   history of heart disease. Respondents were tracked for 4 years and
   analyses adjusted for relevant sociodemographic, behavioural, biological
   and psychosocial factors.
   Results In a model that adjusted for age, gender, race, marital status,
   education and total wealth, each SD increase in perceived neighbourhood
   social cohesion was associated with a 22% reduced odds of myocardial
   infarction (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.94. The association between
   perceived neighbourhood social cohesion and myocardial infarction
   remained even after adjusting for behavioural, biological and
   psychosocial covariates.
   Conclusions Higher perceived neighbourhood social cohesion may have a
   protective effect against myocardial infarction.

AB Background Clustered obese parents and children are prevalent, but there
   is little knowledge about whether and how child-parent resemblance
   varies by sociodemographic groups.
   Methods This paper used nationally representative data from the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES: 1988-1994). We
   matched 4958 parents with 6765 children aged 2-16 years old for whom we
   had complete data on body mass index (BMI), overweight and obesity
   status. Correlation coefficients and. statistics between parents' and
   children's BMI and body weight status were calculated for different
   sociodemographic groups. Multivariate linear and logistic regression
   models were fit to study the child-parent resemblance and socioeconomic
   and demographic differences in the resemblance.
   Results The child-parent correlation coefficients for BMI were greater
   in Caucasians than in minorities and greater in groups with higher
   socioeconomic status. The mother-child resemblance in BMI was negatively
   associated with child age (p<0.001). The mother-daughter resemblance in
   overweight was significantly lower in non-Hispanic blacks (OR=0.53, 95%
   CI (0.36 to 0.78)) and Mexican Americans (OR=0.58, 95% CI (0.36 to
   0.93)) than in Caucasians. The father-child resemblance in overweight
   was significantly lower in high school graduates compared with those
   with less-than-high-school-graduate fathers (OR=0.53, 95% CI (0.37 to
   0.77) for father-son dyads and OR=0.69, 95% CI (0.50 to 0.96) for
   father-daughter dyads). Similar results were found for parent-child
   resemblance in obesity.
   Conclusions Child-parent resemblance in body weight status exists across
   sociodemographic groups in the USA, but it varies by demographics and
   socioeconomic status.

AB The barriers that people with disabilities face around the world are not
   only inherent in the limitations resulting from the disability itself,
   but, More importantly, these barriers rest with the societal
   technologies of exclusion. A multiple regression analysis was conducted
   to examine the statistical relationship between the national level of
   development, the level of democratization, and the level of education of
   a country's population on one hand, and expressed concern for people
   with disabilities on another hand. The results reveal that a greater
   worry for the well-being of people with disabilities is correlated with
   a high level of country development, a decreased value of political
   stability and absence of violence, a decreased level of government
   effectiveness, and a greater level of law enforcement. There is a direct
   correlation between concern for people with disabilities and people's
   awareness about disabilities. Surprisingly, the level of education has
   no impact on the compassion toward people with disabilities. A
   comparison case for in depth illustration is discussed. (C) 2014

AB Social relationships and attachment are core developmental elements of
   human existence and survival that evolve over the lifetime of an
   individual. The internal and external factors that influence them
   include the presence of illness in the individual or in their immediate
   environment. The developmental aspects of attachment and social
   relationships have become increasingly of interest and relevance in
   light of early developmental epigenetic modification of gene expression
   patterns that may influence subsequent behavioral patterns and outcomes.
   This review examines extant literature on attachment and social
   relationships in bipolar cohorts. Despite many methodological
   challenges, the findings indicate that social relationships and capacity
   for attachment are significantly compromised in individuals with bipolar
   disorder compared to other mood disorders and normal controls. Though
   extant research is limited, research clearly points toward the
   importance of social relationships on the etiology, course, and
   consequences of bipolar disorder. We highlight a number of key
   considerations for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   problems. However, there is limited information about the best ways to
   facilitate it. The "social model" approach developed in California
   offers useful suggestions for facilitating peer support in residential
   recovery settings. Key principles include using 12-step or other
   mutual-help group strategies to create and facilitate a recovery
   environment, involving program participants in decision making and
   facility governance, using personal recovery experience as a way to help
   others, and emphasizing recovery as an interaction between the
   individual and their environment. Although limited in number, studies
   have shown favorable outcomes for social model programs. Knowledge about
   social model recovery and how to use it to facilitate peer support in
   residential recovery homes varies among providers. This article presents
   specific, practical suggestions for enhancing social model principles in
   ways that facilitate peer support in a range of recovery residences.

AB Increasingly, people with diverse health conditions turn to social media
   to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with
   similar health concerns. This unstructured medium may represent a
   platform on which individuals with severe mental illness naturally
   provide and receive peer support. Peer support includes a system of
   mutual giving and receiving where individuals with severe mental illness
   can offer hope, companionship, and encouragement to others facing
   similar challenges. In this study we explore the phenomenon of
   individuals with severe mental illness uploading videos to YouTube, and
   posting and responding to comments as a form of naturally occurring peer
   support. We also consider the potential risks and benefits of
   self-disclosure and interacting with others on YouTube. To address these
   questions, we used qualitative inquiry informed by emerging techniques
   in online ethnography. We analyzed n = 3,044 comments posted to 19
   videos uploaded by individuals who self-identified as having
   schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. We found
   peer support across four themes: minimizing a sense of isolation and
   providing hope; finding support through peer exchange and reciprocity;
   sharing strategies for coping with day-to-day challenges of severe
   mental illness; and learning from shared experiences of medication use
   and seeking mental health care. These broad themes are consistent with
   accepted notions of peer support in severe mental illness as a voluntary
   process aimed at inclusion and mutual advancement through shared
   experience and developing a sense of community. Our data suggest that
   the lack of anonymity and associated risks of being identified as an
   individual with severe mental illness on YouTube seem to be overlooked
   by those who posted comments or uploaded videos. Whether or not this
   platform can provide benefits for a wider community of individuals with
   severe mental illness remains uncertain.

AB The current study investigated ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
   activity during impression formation of individuals varying on distinct
   dimensions of social status. In a block-design functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment, participants were presented with
   photographs of faces paired with a colored background indicating their
   lower, same, or higher financial status, or lower, same, or higher moral
   status. Participants were asked to form an impression of the targets,
   but were not instructed to explicitly evaluate them based on social
   status. Building on previous findings (Cloutier, Ambady, Meagher, &
   Gabrieli, 2012), a region of interest analysis revealed the interaction
   of status dimension and level in VMPFC, finding not only preferential
   response to targets with higher compared to lower moral status as
   previously demonstrated, but also greater response to targets with lower
   compared to higher financial status. The implications of these results
   are discussed with an emphasis towards better understanding the impact
   of social status on social cognition and uncovering the neural
   substrates of person evaluation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Glacier shrinkage caused by climate change is likely to trigger
   diminished and less consistent stream flow in glacier-fed watersheds
   worldwide. To understand, model, and adapt to these
   climate-glacier-water changes, it is vital to integrate the analysis of
   both water availability (the domain of hydrologists) and water use (the
   focus for social scientists). Drawn from a case study of the Santa River
   watershed below Peru's glaciated Cordillera Blanca mountain range, this
   paper provides a holistic hydro-social framework that identifies five
   major human variables critical to hydrological modeling because these
   forces have profoundly influenced water use over the last 60 years: (1)
   political agendas and economic development; (2) governance: laws and
   institutions; (3) technology and engineering; (4) land and resource use;
   and (5) societal responses. Notable shifts in Santa River water
   use-including major expansions in hydroelectricity generation,
   large-scale irrigation projects, and other land and resource-use
   practices did not necessarily stem from changing glacier runoff or
   hydrologic shifts, but rather from these human variables. Ultimately,
   then, water usage is not predictable based on water availability alone.
   Glacier runoff conforms to certain expected trends predicted by models
   of progressively reduced glacier storage. However, societal forces
   establish the legal, economic, political, cultural, and social drivers
   that actually shape water usage patterns via human modification of
   watershed dynamics. This hydro-social framework has widespread
   implications for hydrological modeling in glaciated watersheds from the
   Andes and Alps to the Himalaya and Tien Shan, as well as for the
   development of climate change adaptation plans. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The dynamics and relationships between society and nature are complex
   and difficult to predict. Anthropogenic activities affect the ecological
   integrity of our natural resources, specifically our streams. Further,
   it is well-established that the costs of these activities are born
   unequally by different human communities. This study considered the
   utility of integrating stream health metrics, based on stream health
   indicators, with socio-economic measures of communities, to better
   characterize these effects. This study used a spatial multi-factor model
   and bivariate mapping to produce a novel assessment for watershed
   management, identification of vulnerable areas, and allocation of
   resources. The study area is the Saginaw River watershed located in
   Michigan. In-stream hydrological and water quality data were used to
   predict fish and macroinvertebrate measures of stream health. These
   measures include the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI), Hilsenhoff
   Biotic Index (HBI), Family IBI, and total number of Ephemeroptera,
   Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Stream health indicators were
   then compared to spatially coincident socioeconomic data, obtained from
   the United States Census Bureau (2010), including race, income,
   education, housing, and population size. Statistical analysis including
   spatial regression and cluster analysis were used to examine the
   correlation between vulnerable human populations and environmental
   conditions. Overall, limited correlation was observed between the
   socio-economic data and ecological measures of stream health, with the
   highest being a negative correlation of 0.18 between HBI and the social
   parameter household size. Clustering was observed in the datasets with
   urban areas representing a second order clustering effect over the
   watershed. Regions with the worst stream health and most vulnerable
   social populations were most commonly located nearby or down-stream to
   highly populated areas and agricultural lands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Longer lives and fertility far below the replacement level of 2.1 births
   per woman are leading to rapid population aging in many countries. Many
   observers are concerned that aging will adversely affect public finances
   and standards of living. Analysis of newly available National Transfer
   Accounts data for 40 countries shows that fertility well above
   replacement would typically be most beneficial for government budgets.
   However, fertility near replacement would be most beneficial for
   standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age
   structure on families as well as governments. And fertility below
   replacement would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of
   providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account.
   Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and
   very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately
   low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard
   of living.

AB Neurogenesis is restricted in the adult mammalian brain; most neurons
   are neither exchanged during normal life nor replaced in pathological
   situations. We report that stroke elicits a latent neurogenic program in
   striatal astrocytes in mice. Notch1 signaling is reduced in astrocytes
   after stroke, and attenuated Notch1 signaling is necessary for
   neurogenesis by striatal astrocytes. Blocking Notch signaling triggers
   astrocytes in the striatum and the medial cortex to enter a neurogenic
   program, even in the absence of stroke, resulting in 850 +/- 210 (mean
   +/- SEM) new neurons in a mouse striatum. Thus, under Notch signaling
   regulation, astrocytes in the adult mouse brain parenchyma carry a
   latent neurogenic program that may potentially be useful for neuronal
   replacement strategies.

   together key organizations to assist state hospital associations and
   hospitals by providing education and coaching support, addressing both
   the technical aspects of preventing CAUTI and CAUTI-specific
   socio-adaptive challenges. At the local level, engaging health care
   workers, from physicians and nurses to other ancillary services, is
   critical. This includes (1) making the importance of addressing CAUTI
   stakeholder specific, (2) ensuring support from leaders of essential
   disciplines, (3) underscoring the importance of the collaborative nature
   of CAUTI prevention, and (4) identifying champions within the
   organization to lead and be accountable for the work. Sustainability is
   ensured by integrating the process into the health care worker's daily

   vulnerable road users. In particular, road traffic injuries, the leading
   cause of injuries, account for 27% of the total injury and violence
   mortality in EMR according to WHO. Violence including suicide, homicide
   and war-related injury has also been increasing over the past two
   decades for both females and males. There is need for greater interest

AB BACKGROUND: Although it is well established that African Americans (AA)
   experience greater social stressors than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), the
   extent to which early life adversity and cumulative social stressors
   such as perceived discrimination, neighborhood violence, subjective
   social status, and socioeconomic status contribute to disparity in
   coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke between AA and NHW are not well
   understood. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to propose a
   conceptual model based upon McEwen's Allostatic Load Model suggesting
   how the relationships among social context, early life adversity,
   psychological stress, inflammation, adaptation, and epigenetic signature
   may contribute to the development of CHD and ischemic stroke. We
   hypothesize that social context and prior life adversity are associated
   with genome-wide as well as gene-specific epigenetic modifications that
   confer a proinflammatory epigenetic signature that mediates an enhanced
   proinflammatory state. Exposure to early life adversity, coupled with an
   increased allostatic load places individuals at greater risk for
   inflammatory based diseases, such as CHD and ischemic stroke. RESULTS:
   Based on a review of the literature, we propose a novel model in which
   social context and psychological stress, particularly during early life,
   engenders a proinflammatory epigenetic signature, which drives a
   heightened inflammatory state that increases risk for CHD and stroke. In
   the proposed model, a proinflammatory epigenetic signature and
   adaptation serve as mediator variables. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the
   extent to which epigenetic signature bridges the psycho-social
   environment with inflammation and risk for CHD may yield novel
   biomarkers that can be used to assess risk, development, and progression
   of CHD/stroke. Epigenetic biomarkers may be used to inform preventive
   and treatment strategies that can be targeted to those most vulnerable,
   or to those with early signs of CHD, such as endothelial dysfunction.
   Furthermore, epigenetic approaches, including lifestyle modification and
   stress reduction programs, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction,
   offer promise to reduce health inequity linked to social disadvantage,
   as emerging evidence demonstrates that adverse epigenetic marks can be
   reversed.

AB IMPORTANCE Many changes in the economy, policies related to nutrition,
   and food processing have occurred within the United States since 2000,
   and the net effect on dietary quality is not clear. These changes may
   have affected various socioeconomic groups differentially.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate trends in dietary quality from 1999 to 2010 in
   the US adult population and within socioeconomic subgroups.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Nationally representative sample of 29
   124 adults aged 20 to 85 years from the US 1999 to 2010 National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010
   (AHEI-2010), an 11-dimension score (range, 0-10 for each component score
   and 0-110 for the total score), was used to measure dietary quality. A
   higher AHEI-2010 score indicated a more healthful diet.
   RESULTS The energy-adjusted mean of the AHEI-2010 increased from 39.9 in
   1999 to 2000 to 46.8 in 2009 to 2010 (linear trend P <.001). Reduction
   in trans fat intake accounted for more than half of this improvement.
   The AHEI-2010 component score increased by 0.9 points for
   sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice (reflecting decreased
   consumption), 0.7 points for whole fruit, 0.5 points for whole grains,
   0.5 points for polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 0.4 points for nuts and
   legumes over the 12-year period (all linear trend P <.001). Family
   income and education level were positively associated with total
   AHEI-2010, and the gap between low and high socioeconomic status widened
   over time, from 3.9 points in 1999 to 2000 to 7.8 points in 2009 to 2010
   (interaction P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although a steady improvement in AHEI-2010 was
   observed across the 12-year period, the overall dietary quality remains
   poor. Better dietary quality was associated with higher socioeconomic
   status, and the gap widened with time. Future efforts to improve
   nutrition should address these disparities.

AB Conflict in creative work is sometimes thought to emanate from the
   contentious personalities of creative workers. Drawing on several months
   of ethnographic field work at an advertising agency and semi-structured
   interviews with advertising professionals, I propose an alternate
   explanation for this antagonism, grounded in creative workers' and their
   market-oriented colleagues' competing definitions of good work. As an
   illustration of this larger struggle, I focus on the tension that arises
   during creative assessment. I find that while creative workers designate
   ideas as "creative" based on novelty and relevance, not all sources of
   novelty and relevance are considered legitimate. Sources that originate
   from outside their professional domain are dismissed as not novel (e.g.,
   "overused") or irrelevant (e.g., "constraints"). Consequently, I suggest
   that creative assessment can be understood as a form of professional
   boundary work, a conceptualization with implications for our
   understanding of conflict in the creative workplace and the evaluation
   of creativity more generally. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Bourdieu argued that cultural tastes have tangible social and economic
   consequences. Some work suggests that moral differences might have
   similar effects, but it is not yet clear how morality is distributed
   across the social landscape, and hence where moral variation is likely
   to occur. This research note examines the relationships between several
   well-established morality measures and an extensive set of demographic
   variables using Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a statistical technique
   that better captures uncertainty in parameter estimates. Results show
   that gender, age cohort, and religious affiliation predict the widest
   range of moral constructs, followed by education and marital status.
   Comparison with earlier work suggests that gender, age, and religious
   affiliation are important predictors of morality generally. (C) 2014

AB Living in a lower socioeconomic status neighborhood has been shown to
   alter stress system function and is associated with a number of adverse
   health outcomes, but its influence on musculoskeletal pain (MSP)
   outcomes after traumatic stress exposures such as motor vehicle
   collision (MVC) has not been assessed. We performed a multicenter,
   prospective study that enrolled 948 European-American individuals within
   24 hours of MVC who were discharged home after emergency department
   evaluation. Follow-up evaluations were completed via telephone or
   Internet survey 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after MVC on 91%, 89%, and
   91% of participants, respectively. A robust aggregate measure of census
   tract neighborhood disadvantage was derived, and individual-level
   characteristics assessed included socioeconomic and demographic
   characteristics, pain prior to MVC, litigation status, and opioid use.
   MSP was assessed in the emergency department; MSP and pain interference
   with daily activity were assessed at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year.
   After adjustment for individual-level factors, living in more
   disadvantaged neighborhoods was associated with increased MSP (P =

   0.0001). The relationship between neighborhood disadvantage and MSP was
   moderated by a common single nucleotide polymorphism, rs2817038, 5' of
   the gene encoding FKBP5, a functional regulator of glucocorticoid
   receptor sensitivity (interaction P-value = 0.0015). These data support
   the hypothesis that low neighborhood socioeconomic status increases the
   likelihood of worse MSP outcomes after traumatic stress exposures such

AB We described the prevalence of overweight and obesity among low-income
   women in rural West Virginia (WV) and urban Los Angeles County (LA
   County). Both communities participated in the national Communities
   Putting Prevention to Work program during 2010-2012. In each community,
   we completed health assessments on adult women recruited from
   public-sector clinics serving low-income populations. All participants
   answered survey questions regarding socio-demographics and diets. In
   both jurisdictions, we assessed obesity using objectively measured
   height and weight (calculated BMI). As part of each community case
   study, we performed multivariable regression analyses to describe the
   relationships between overweight and obesity and selected covariates
   (e.g., dietary behaviors). Overweight and obesity were prevalent among
   low-income women from WV (73%, combined) and LA County (67%, combined).
   In both communities, race and ethnicity appeared to predict the two
   conditions; however, the associations were not robust. In LA County, for
   example, African American and Hispanic women were 1.4 times (95% CI =
   1.12, 1.81) more likely than white women to be overweight and obese.
   Collectively, these subpopulation health data served as an important
   guide for further planning of obesity prevention efforts in both
   communities. These efforts became a part of the subsequent Community
   Transformation Grants portfolio. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The worldwide financial crisis that began in 2007 was set off by the
   collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the USA. The crisis
   simultaneously reverberated to banks around the world, and eventually
   brought about a worldwide recession. The biggest banks in the developed
   world got in trouble because they were pursuing the same strategies to
   make profit as the American banks. They had joined the market in the USA
   for mortgage-backed securities and funded them by borrowing in the
   asset-backed commercial paper market. When the housing market turned
   down, they suffered the same fate as their US counterparts. Financial
   deregulation played a complex role in this process. Most of the banks
   that participated in this market came from countries where financial
   deregulation occurred. But not all banks from countries with financial
   deregulation entered this market. Countries with high levels of
   financial deregulation also experienced deeper recessions, suggesting
   that in the home market, banks had taken on riskier loans as well. Our
   study makes a broader theoretical point, suggesting that subsequent
   studies of global finance and financial markets need to consider the
   identities and strategies of the banks as their tactics explain a lot
   about how the global markets for different financial products are
   structured.

AB Economics is often described as the most politically influential social
   science and yet economic advice is often largely irrelevant to prominent
   policy debates. We draw on literatures in political science, sociology
   and science and technology studies to explain this apparent
   contradiction. Existing research suggests that the influence of
   economics is mediated by local circumstances and meso-level social
   structures, and that much of it flows through indirect channels. We
   elaborate three sites of analysis useful for unpacking these influences:
   the broad professional authority of economics, the institutional
   position of economists in government, and the role of economics in the
   cognitive infrastructure of policymaking, including the diffusion of
   economic styles of reasoning and the establishment of economic policy
   devices for seeing and deciding.

   resolve the tension between respecting cultural norms or child-rearing

   child maltreatment. Cultural competency and respect for cultural
   diversity does not imply universal tolerance of all practices. The
   United Nations provides a standard of universal child rights, protecting
   them from harmful practices. Pediatric providers must respect
   cross-cultural differences while maintaining legal and ethical standards
   of safety and wellbeing for children, promoting evidence-based

AB Objective We examined the relationship between childhood socioeconomic
   status (SES) and glucoregulation in later life and used a life-course
   framework to examine critical periods and underlying pathways.
   Methods Data came from the Midlife in the US (MIDUS) national study (n =
   895). Childhood SES indicators retrospectively reported at MIDUS I were
   used to create a childhood SES disadvantage index. Adult SES
   disadvantage and potential pathways were measured at MIDUS I and
   included waist circumference, depressive symptoms, and physical
   activity. Glucose and hemoglobin A1c, measured approximately 9 to 10
   years later at MIDUS II, were used to create the ordinal outcome measure
   (no diabetes/prediabetes/diabetes).
   Results Childhood SES disadvantage predicted increased odds of
   prediabetes and diabetes net of age, sex, race, and smoking (odds ratio
   = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.22). Childhood SES disadvantage
   predicted adult SES disadvantage ( = .26, p = .001) and the three key
   mediators: waist circumference ( = 0.10, p = .002), physical activity (
   = -0.11, p = .001), and depressive symptoms ( = 0.07, p = .072). When
   childhood and adult SES disadvantage were in the same model, only adult
   SES predicted glucoregulation (odds ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence
   interval = 1.01-1.13). The SES disadvantage measures were no longer
   significantly associated with glucoregulation after including waist
   circumference, physical activity, and depressive symptoms, all of which
   were significant predictors of glucoregulation.
   Conclusions The consequences of childhood SES disadvantage are complex
   and include both critical period and pathway effects. The lack of a
   direct effect of childhood SES on glucoregulation does not negate the
   importance of early environment but suggests that early-life
   socioeconomic factors propel unequal life-course trajectories that
   ultimately influence health.

AB Objective To determine why lower social integration predicts higher
   mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD).
   Methods The association between social integration and mortality was
   examined prospectively in 1019 outpatients with stable CHD from the
   Heart and Soul Study. Baseline social integration was assessed with the
   Berkman Social Network Index. Cox proportional hazards models were used
   to determine the extent to which demographic and disease-relevant
   confounders and potential biological, behavioral, and psychological
   mediators explained the association between social integration and
   mortality.
   Results During a mean (standard deviation) follow-up period of 6.7 (2.3)
   years, the age-adjusted annual rate of mortality was 6.3% among socially
   isolated patients and 4.1% among nonisolated patients (age-adjusted
   hazard ratio [HR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-2.05, p <
   .001). After adjustment for demographic and disease-relevant
   confounders, socially isolated patients had a 50% greater risk of death
   than did nonisolated patients (HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.07-2.10). Separate
   adjustment for potential biological (HR = 1.53, CI = 1.05-2.25) and
   psychological mediators (HR = 1.52, CI = 1.08-2.14) did not
   significantly attenuate this association, whereas adjustment for
   potential behavioral mediators did (HR = 1.30, CI = 0.91-1.86).
   C-reactive protein and hemoglobin A1c were identified as important
   biological and omega-3 fatty acids, smoking, and medication adherence as
   important behavioral potential mediators, with smoking making the
   largest contribution.
   Conclusions In this sample of outpatients with baseline stable CHD, the
   association between social integration and mortality was largely
   explained by health-related behavioral pathways, particularly smoking.

AB Hypotheses on the benefits of the practice of partible paternity are

   paternity refers to the institution of multiple males considered to
   contribute to the conception of a single offspring. Analyses focus on
   patterns of primary and secondary co-fatherhood among men, genealogical
   relationships between co-fathers, and relation between band co-residence
   and co-fatherhood. Results indicate that men who had more secondary
   fatherhood also had more primary fatherhood; cofathers are more closely
   related, on average, than men who are not co-fathers; and co-fathers
   were also more likely to reside together than men who were not
   co-fathers, even after controlling for relatedness. Results are most
   consistent with women choosing co- fathers of offspring in ways that
   maximize likelihood and amount of investment (multiple investors
   hypothesis) and men competing for more mates with at least partially
   affiliative outcomes (mate competition and male alliance hypotheses).

   burials, focusing on changing proportions of juveniles 5-19 years of

AB We aimed to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES)
   and suicide associated with the introduction and diffusion of selective

   used to estimate county-level suicide rates among persons aged 25 years
   or older using death certificate data collated by the National Center
   for Health Statistics from 1968 to 2009; SES was measured using the
   decennial US Census. The National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were used to measure
   SSRI use. Once SSRIs became available in 1988, a 1% increase in SSRI
   usage was associated with a 0.5% lower suicide rate. Prior to the
   introduction of SSRIs, SES was not related to suicide. However, with
   each 1% increase in SSRI use, a 1-standard deviation (SD) higher SES was
   associated with a 0.6% lower suicide rate. In 2009, persons living in
   counties with SES 1 SD above the national average were 13.6% less likely
   to commit suicide than those living in counties with SES 1 SD below the
   national average-a difference of 1.9/100,000 adults aged a parts per
   thousand yen25 years. Higher SSRI use was associated with lower suicide
   rates among US residents aged a parts per thousand yen25 years; however,
   SES inequalities modified the association between SSRI use and suicide.

AB The impact of stress on human health is a topic of wide-spread relevance
   and one that is particularly amenable to multidisciplinary
   investigation. Stress impacts both our psychological and physical health
   and, thus, may leave evidence on our psyche, our physical body and our
   genome. We are interested in the effect of extreme stressors, such as
   war, on health from the perspective of long-term and multigenerational
   effects. We integrate sociocultural, biological, and epigenetic data
   from the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Between May and
   August, 2010, we measured sociocultural stress exposure among 25
   mother-newborn dyads and we measured health outcomes in newborns. We
   also collected maternal venous blood, placental tissue, and umbilical
   cord blood to assay for methylation changes to test for a possible
   epigenetic mechanism that mediates the effects of stress on health. We
   provide a qualitative description of the wide range of stress exposures
   experienced by mothers in our study. As we have shown previously,
   maternal war stress is strongly associated with newborn birthweight and
   changes in newborn methylation at the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1. New
   results presented here demonstrate that maternal war stress and
   birthweight are also associated with genome-wide changes in maternal
   methylation levels. In sum, these results suggest that stress may
   influence gene expression across a broad spectrum in the individual who
   directly experiences the stress, i.e., the mother, whereas potential
   heritable effects in the newborn may be focused on specific genes that
   are uniquely sensitive to environmental cues. (C) 2014 Wiley

AB Adult stature variation is commonly attributed to differential
   stress-levels during development. However, due to selective mortality
   and heterogeneous frailty, a population's tall stature may be more
   indicative of high selective pressures than of positive life conditions.
   This article examines stature in a biocultural context and draws
   parallels between bioarchaeological and living populations to explore
   the multidimensionality of stature variation in the past. This study
   investigates: 1) stature differences between archaeological populations
   exposed to low or high stress (inferred from skeletal indicators); 2)
   similarities in growth retardation patterns between archaeological and
   living groups; and 3) the apportionment of variance in growth outcomes
   at the regional level in archaeological and living populations.
   Anatomical stature estimates were examined in relation to skeletal
   stress indicators (cribra orbitalia, porotic hyperostosis, linear enamel
   hypoplasia) in two medieval bioarchaeological populations. Stature and
   biocultural information were gathered for comparative living samples
   from South America. Results indicate 1) significant (P<0.01) differences
   in stature between groups exposed to different levels of skeletal
   stress; 2) greater prevalence of stunting among living groups, with
   similar patterns in socially stratified archaeological and modern
   groups; and 3) a degree of regional variance in growth outcomes
   consistent with that observed for highly selected traits. The
   relationship between early stress and growth is confounded by several
   factors-including catch-up growth, cultural buffering, and social
   inequality. The interpretations of early life conditions based on the
   relationship between stress and stature should be advanced with caution.

   duration of episode. We selected nine potential independent variables on
   the basis of Pearson correlation coefficients. We derived two final
   models using multiple regression analysis employing an iterative
   process.
   Results: In our severity model, being married was associated with a
   higher YMRS score (p = 0.05), whereas higher social interaction scores
   with non-family members were associated with a lower YMRS score (p =
   0.011). In the episode duration model, longer duration was associated
   with a higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score (p = 0.03) and
   higher social interaction scores with non-family members (p = 0.0003),
   younger age (p = 0.04), higher number of persons in one's family social
   network (p = 0.017), and higher instrumental support scores (p =
   0.0062).
   Conclusions: In late life mania, more social interaction with one's
   community appears to be associated with less severe symptoms at
   presentation for treatment, however, it can also be associated with
   slightly longer the duration of episode. Two aspects of the Duke Social
   Support Index are associated with a shorter episode duration prior to
   seeking treatment: being part of a larger family network and a having a
   higher level of instrumental support prior to treatment. The
   Instrumental Support Subscale measures the degree of assistance that is
   available for the respondent in performing daily tasks. These findings
   suggest that in older adults with BD, close social interactions and
   support are important in limiting the length of the illness episode
   prior to treatment. Social interactions involving non-family members may
   be less important in moderating the intensity of the symptoms at
   presentation. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: This study explored adolescents' views on the sources and
   types of social support they would prefer when trying to eat more
   healthfully and be more active, as well as their opinions regarding
   means of enhancing social support in interventions. Methods: A total of
   28 adolescents (14 males, 14 females) ages 13 to 18 years participated
   in 4 focus groups that were stratified by gender and age to enhance
   participation. Results: As expected, participants most readily named
   parents and friends as important sources of support and described
   wanting instrumental and emotional support from parents, companionship
   and emotional support from friends, and informational support from
   professionals. The focus groups revealed rich information regarding
   parents' and peers' behaviors that are and are not received as
   emotionally supportive, the helpfulness of parents' concurrent changes
   in lifestyle, and the importance of parents not ignoring or colluding
   with unhealthful behavior. Most participants expressed a need for
   frequent contact and a trusting relationship with professionals.
   Opinions were mixed regarding inclusion of others in appointments, use
   of electronic communications and social media, and group treatment
   formats. Conclusion: Results have implications for enhancing social
   support in behavioral weight management interventions that are
   developmentally relevant for adolescents.

AB Social interactions are central to most animals and have a fundamental
   impact upon the phenotype of an individual. Social behavior (social
   interactions among conspecifics) represents a central challenge to the
   integration of the functional and mechanistic bases of complex behavior.
   Traditionally, studies of proximate and ultimate elements of social
   behavior have been conducted by distinct groups of researchers, with
   little communication across perceived disciplinary boundaries. However,
   recent technological advances, coupled with increased recognition of the
   substantial variation in mechanisms underlying social interactions,
   should compel investigators from divergent disciplines to pursue more
   integrative analyses of social behavior. We propose an integrative
   conceptual framework intended to guide researchers towards a
   comprehensive understanding of the evolution and maintenance of
   mechanisms governing variation in sociality.

AB Why do citizens in religious groups and more religious countries give
   money to charitable causes? In this article we aim to theoretically and
   empirically unravel the influence of religious composition on giving to
   non-profit organizations across countries. Building on theories and
   research in sociology, social psychology, and economics we formulate
   hypotheses about individual-and contextual-level differences in
   engagement in religious and secular charitable giving. We test our
   hypotheses with multi-level analyses using data from the European Social
   Survey that include 21 European countries complemented with matching
   data from the United States (N-1=41,314; N-2=22). The results show no
   relationship between country-level devoutness and engagement in
   religious or secular giving. We do find that citizens in countries with
   a higher level of religious heterogeneity are more likely to engage in
   religious giving but not secular giving. We test two explanations for
   the relationship between giving and religious heterogeneity. We find
   support for the minority hypothesis that people belonging to a religious
   minority have a higher likelihood of giving but not for the group size
   hypothesis that the relative size of the religious denomination to which
   people belong to decreases their engagement in charitable giving.

AB BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy breast reconstruction increased approximately
   20% between 1998 and 2008 in the United States and has been found to
   improve body image, self-esteem, and quality of life. These procedures,
   however, tend to be less common among minority women, which may be due
   to variations in health care access. The Department of Defense provides
   equal health care access, thereby affording an exceptional environment
   in which to assess whether racial variations persist when access to care
   is equal. METHODS: Linked Department of Defense cancer registry and
   medical claims data were used. The receipt of reconstruction was
   compared between white women (n=2974) and black women (n=708) who
   underwent mastectomies to treat incident histologically confirmed breast
   cancer diagnosed from 1998 through 2007. RESULTS: During the study
   period, postmastectomy reconstruction increased among both black (27.3%
   to 40.0%) and white (21.8% to 40.6%) female patients with breast cancer.
   Receipt of reconstruction did not vary significantly by race (odds
   ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.15). Reconstruction
   decreased significantly with increasing age, tumor stage, and receipt of
   radiotherapy and was significantly more common in more recent years and
   among active service-women, TRICARE Prime (health maintenance
   organization) beneficiaries, and women whose sponsor was an officer.
   CONCLUSIONS: The receipt of breast reconstruction did not vary by race
   within this equal-access health system, indicating that the racial
   disparities reported in previous studies may have been due in part to
   variations in access to health care. Additional research to determine
   why a large percentage of patients with breast cancer do not undergo
   reconstruction might be beneficial, particularly because these
   procedures have been associated with noncosmetic benefits. Published
   2014. This article is a U. S. Government work and is in the public

AB Natural resource managers are often expected to achieve both
   environmental protection and economic development even when there are
   fundamental trade-offs between these goals. Adaptive management provides
   a theoretical structure for program administrators to balance social
   priorities in the presence of trade-offs and to improve conservation
   targeting. We used the case of Mexico's federal Payments for
   Hydrological Services program (PSAH) to illustrate the importance of
   adaptive management for improving program targeting. We documented
   adaptive elements of PSAH and corresponding changes in program
   eligibility and selection criteria. To evaluate whether these changes
   resulted in enrollment of lands of high environmental and social
   priority, we compared the environmental and social characteristics of
   the areas enrolled in the program with the characteristics of all
   forested areas in Mexico, all areas eligible for the program, and all
   areas submitted for application to the program. The program successfully
   enrolled areas of both high ecological and social priority, and over
   time, adaptive changes in the program's criteria for eligibility and
   selection led to increased enrollment of land scoring high on both
   dimensions. Three factors facilitated adaptive management in Mexico and
   are likely to be generally important for conservation managers: a
   supportive political environment, including financial backing and
   encouragement to experiment from the federal government; availability of
   relatively good social and environmental data; and active participation
   in the review process by stakeholders and outside evaluators. Mejorando

AB Conservation planning is integral to strategic and effective operations
   of conservation organizations. Drawing upon biological sciences,
   conservation planning has historically made limited use of social data.
   We offer an approach for integrating data on social well-being into
   conservation planning that captures and places into context the spatial
   patterns and trends in human needs and capacities. This hierarchical
   approach provides a nested framework for characterizing and mapping data
   on social well-being in 5 domains: economic well-being, health,
   political empowerment, education, and culture. These 5 domains each have
   multiple attributes; each attribute may be characterized by one or more
   indicators. Through existing or novel data that display spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity in social well-being, conservation scientists,
   planners, and decision makers may measure, benchmark, map, and integrate
   these data within conservation planning processes. Selecting indicators
   and integrating these data into conservation planning is an iterative,
   participatory process tailored to the local context and planning goals.
   Social well-being data complement biophysical and threat-oriented social
   data within conservation planning processes to inform decisions
   regarding where and how to conserve biodiversity, provide a structure
   for exploring socioecological relationships, and to foster adaptive
   management. Building upon existing conservation planning methods and
   insights from multiple disciplines, this approach to putting people on
   the map can readily merge with current planning practices to facilitate
   more rigorous decision making.

AB Social isolation has been shown to be a risk factor for inadequate diet
   among older adults living in Western Europe and North America. This
   article investigates whether socially isolated older adults (65+) living
   in Eastern Europe also experience an increased risk of dietary
   inadequacy.
   The study used SHARE IV survey data collected in the Czech Republic (n =
   2,867), Poland (n = 772), and Hungary (n = 1,353). Logistic regression
   models were estimated for each country separately to predict the
   likelihood of two proxies for dietary adequacy, having three meals a day
   and/or a serving of fruits or vegetables, by social isolation.
   Social isolation was associated with lower likelihood of having three
   meals a day among Czech older adults (OR 0.39) and with lower likelihood
   of having a daily serving of fruits or vegetables among Czech (OR 0.62)
   and Polish older adults (OR 0.35). No association between social
   isolation and either one of the outcomes was found in Hungary.
   Socially isolated Eastern European older adults may be at a higher risk
   of dietary inadequacy, particularly in the Czech Republic and Poland.

AB Although sociologists have long studied public emergency rooms (ERs) and
   their service delivery to the urban poor, little is known about how
   crime control and criminal justice contact affect ER admission
   decisions-a critical oversight given the documented increase in
   incarceration rates, intensification of policing, and proliferation of
   crime control language in public institutions. Using ethnographic
   methods and a count of ER admission decisions (N = 1,114), this article
   describes the continual rushing and delaying of medical resources to
   patients based on their perceived criminality or actual relationship to
   the criminal justice system. These dynamics develop through four
   processes: (1) widespread administration of pain medication, which
   associates waiting patients with criminal narcotics; (2) deployment of
   criminal stigma along race and gender lines to select some qualified
   patients over others; (3) patrolling of waiting rooms by police; and (4)
   rushing of beds to vast numbers of arrestees, inmates, and witnesses.
   Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of
   the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources,
   but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are
   policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.

AB As efforts are made to contain health care spending, the decision to
   stop trying to cure severely ill patients and focus on comfort care has
   become an economic as well as a moral issue. This article examines the
   intricate intersection of economics and morality in U. S. hospice care.
   Using historical, interview, and ethnographic methods, I explain the
   resonance between hospice practitioners' moral motivations and
   policymakers', insurers', and providers' efforts to economize near the
   end of life. Drawing on theoretical literature on morality in markets, I
   analyze the moralization of economic scarcity. I argue that rather than
   posing an external financial constraint on the achievement of moral
   goals, scarcity itself can bear moral meanings. In the case of hospice
   care, the view that "less is better" and the wish to save patients from
   over-treatment converge with financial interests to limit spending on
   end-of-life care and imbue financial constraints with positive moral
   meanings.

AB In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the sociology of religion
   enjoyed a remarkable growth in both theory and empirical research. The
   scholarly consensus argues that the early secularization thesis
   associated with modernization theory was misleading and simplistic, or
   that it was primarily relevant to northern Europe. Beyond the European
   framework, there is ample evidence that religion continues to play a
   major role in society, culture and politics. With urbanization in the
   developing world, there has come increasing piety and religious
   revivalism. Religion will be a major factor in political and ideological
   struggles across the globe in this century. One negative aspect of this
   focus on political conflict, however, has been an over-concentration on
   radical Islam and other manifestations of religious violence.

   from Fox's detailed mapping of the punk subculture and Thornton's
   reworking of Bourdieu's cultural capital, I investigate how
   skateboarders distinguish themselves from the "mainstream" and from one
   another. The informal social hierarchy of skateboarding is a continuum
   that stretches from the outsiders to the core, and various identities
   mark distinctive statuses or levels of "authenticity" along this
   continuum. Focusing on how one gains status within the subculture, I
   argue that through socialization elite skateboarders are able to
   reproduce beyond their finite numbers, reproduce the dominant
   understanding of "authenticity," and maintain the current hierarchical
   structure within the subculture.

   theory course. Data collected over the past five semesters illustrate
   the positive effects of these activities on student motivation and use

   of higher-level cognitive learning strategies such as critical thinking
   and are more intrinsically motivated as a result of taking the course.
   This quantitative investigation of students' use of cognitive and

AB Undergraduate students often have trouble interpreting cultures other
   than that with which they are familiar in a way that takes into account
   the symbols and meanings that explain behaviors, objects, and
   ideologies. Instead, many fall into the trap of making ethnocentric
   assumptions and coming to conclusions that are informed by their own
   cultural perspectives. This in-class active learning exercise makes the
   familiar strange, using Horace Miner's well-known 1956 essay Body Ritual
   among the Nacirema to introduce students to an etic, cultural
   outsider-like description of American culture. Using short excerpts from
   Miner's article, students draw pictures of Miner's descriptions,
   producing a wide variety of interpretations. This activity demonstrates
   that when students overlook or misunderstand cultural meaning, they can

AB A sustainable world is one in which human needs are met equitably and
   without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet their
   needs. Human well-being is described by four primary elements-basic
   human needs, economic needs, environmental needs, and subjective
   well-being. These elements can interact in a myriad of ways to influence
   overall well-being. What makes changes in human well-being sustainable
   for a population or a nation? Two major interactional concepts can push
   changes in human well-being toward a sustainable state in space and
   time-social equity and intergenerational equity. The concept of social
   equity distributes well-being over space, ensuring the fair treatment of
   all members of society promoting spatial sustainability of a well-being
   decision. The concept of intergenerational equity distributes well-being
   through time, ensuring the well-being of present and future generations
   of a population or nation, promoting temporal sustainability of a
   well-being decision. The roles of social and intergenerational equity in
   terms of their influence on human well-being are examined with a focus
   on more sustainable decision-making.

   socioeconomic deprivation and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
   subtype with causes of death [breast cancer (BC)-specific and
   non-BC-specific] among non-metastatic invasive BC patients. We
   identified 3,312 patients younger than 75 years (mean age 53.5 years;
   621 [18.8 %] TNBC) with first primary BC treated at an academic medical
   center from 1999 to 2010. We constructed a census-tract-level
   socioeconomic deprivation index using the 2000 U.S. Census data and
   performed a multilevel competing-risk analysis to estimate the hazard
   ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of BC-specific and
   non-BC-specific mortality associated with neighborhood socioeconomic
   deprivation and TNBC subtype. The adjusted models controlled for patient
   sociodemographics, health behaviors, tumor characteristics, comorbidity,
   and cancer treatment. With a median 62-month follow-up, 349 (10.5 %)
   patients died; 233 died from BC. In the multivariate models,
   neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation was independently associated with
   non-BC-specific mortality (the most- vs. the least-deprived quartile: HR
   = 2.98, 95 % CI = 1.33-6.66); in contrast, its association with
   BC-specific mortality was explained by the aforementioned patient-level
   covariates, particularly sociodemographic factors (HR = 1.15, 95 % CI =
   0.71-1.87). TNBC subtype was independently associated with
   non-BC-specific mortality (HR = 2.15; 95 % CI = 1.20-3.84), while the
   association between TNBC and BC-specific mortality approached
   significance (HR = 1.42; 95 % CI = 0.99-2.03, P = 0.057). Non-metastatic
   invasive BC patients who lived in more socioeconomically deprived
   neighborhoods were more likely to die as a result of causes other than
   BC compared with those living in the least socioeconomically deprived
   neighborhoods. TNBC was associated with non-BC-specific mortality but
   not BC-specific mortality.

   the South. Survey data for this sample of middle-school students (Grade
   6 to Grade 8) were part of the Rural Adaptation Project. Data were
   analyzed using ordered logistic regression. Results show that being
   female, having a low income, and having negative relationships with
   parents and peers are risk factors that increase the probability of
   reporting high levels of depressive symptoms and low levels of
   self-esteem. In contrast, supportive relationships with parents and
   peers, high religious orientation, ethnic identity, and school
   satisfaction increased the probability of reporting low levels of
   depressive symptoms and high levels of self-esteem. There were few
   school-level characteristics associated with levels of depressive
   symptoms and self-esteem. Implications are discussed.

   Ninety youth (M age = 8.98 years, SD = 1.68) with a primary diagnosis of
   generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and/or separation anxiety
   disorder, and a parent participated. Regression analyses indicated that
   positive affect and emotion regulation coping were related to adaptive
   measures of social functioning, whereas positive affect, negative
   affect, reluctance to share emotional experiences with peers, and
   lability/negativity were related to maladaptive measures of social
   functioning in the expected directions. For youth high in
   lability/negativity and low in emotion regulation coping, the
   relationship between diagnostic severity and social problems was
   exacerbated. This research contributes to our understanding of the
   interplay of social and emotional variables and suggests that efforts to
   facilitate child emotional functioning may improve social functioning
   for anxious youth, or vice versa.

AB Connecting with others increases happiness, but strangers in close
   proximity routinely ignore each other. Why? Two reasons seem likely:
   Either solitude is a more positive experience than interacting with
   strangers, or people misunderstand the consequences of distant social
   connections. To examine the experience of connecting to strangers, we
   instructed commuters on trains and buses to connect with a stranger near
   them, to remain disconnected, or to commute as normal (Experiments 1a
   and 2a). In both contexts, participants reported a more positive (and no
   less productive) experience when they connected than when they did not.
   Separate participants in each context, however, expected precisely the
   opposite outcome, predicting a more positive experience in solitude
   (Experiments 1b and 2b). This mistaken preference for solitude stems
   partly from underestimating others' interest in connecting (Experiments
   3a and 3b), which in turn keeps people from learning the actual
   consequences of social interaction (Experiments 4a and 4b). The pleasure
   of connection seems contagious: In a laboratory waiting room,
   participants who were talked to had equally positive experiences as
   those instructed to talk (Experiment 5). Human beings are social
   animals. Those who misunderstand the consequences of social interactions
   may not, in at least some contexts, be social enough for their own
   well-being.

AB Anthropogenic land cover types greatly influence the urban heat island
   (UHI) effects. This study examined effects of composition and spatial
   pattern of anthropogenic land cover features on land surface temperature
   (LST) in Phoenix, Arizona, USA, using a land cover map derived from high
   resolution satellite data and ASTER LST data. The spatial pattern of
   land cover features was measured by local Moran's I-a continuous spatial
   autocorrelation index, which can effectively describe dispersed or
   clustered patterns of land cover features. Our results showed that the
   composition and spatial pattern of buildings have minimal impacts on
   LST, while those of paved surfaces alter LST more drastically. The local
   Moran's I of paved surfaces have a stronger positive correlation with
   nighttime (r(2) = 0.38) than daytime (r(2) = 0.17) temperatures,
   suggesting that clustered paved surfaces create stronger warming effects
   at night. We further controlled for land cover compositions to minimize
   their effects on LST, and found that the magnitude of warming effects
   caused by clustered paved surfaces differed among landscapes of varying
   land cover compositions. Correlations between local Moran's I of paved
   surfaces and LST becomes stronger when paved surface fraction exceeds
   50%. These results illustrated aggregate warming effects of clustered
   paved surfaces, and provide insights on UHI mitigation for land managers
   and urban planners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past two decades, most states have adopted laws enabling
   charter schools, as charter advocates successfully presented charters as
   the solution to core problems in urban public education. Yet some states
   with large urban centers, notably Washington and Kentucky, resisted this
   seemingly inexorable trend for years. What explains their resistance?
   Furthermore, why did Washington-a state with a strong teachers' union
   and long-standing Democratic political control (resources for charter
   resistance identified in prior research)-ultimately adopt charters in
   2012 while Kentucky has not? I use comparative-historical narrative
   analysis to trace differences in charter battles in the urban centers of
   the two states. I find that supporters framed charters as the solution
   in both cases but varied in their ability to name public schools as the
   problem in the first place. I identify the source of the discursive
   resources used by opponents of charter schools in state-level
   "educational ecosystems'': the cultural and institutional legacies of a
   range of state educational policies.

   fishing. Three rural fishing communities in Alaska served as case
   studies for this project: Chenega Bay in Prince William Sound, Kokhanok
   in Bristol Bay, and Tyonek in Cook Inlet. In all three communities, both
   old and young residents note that younger people are not participating
   in fishing as much as they did in the past, and there is concern that
   fishing traditions will not continue. However, research findings show
   how important fishing is as a social, cultural, and community activity
   for families. Residents noted fishing provided for a quality of life
   that included values associated with family, community, culture, and
   freedom.

AB Objectives. We analyzed beer, spirits, and alcopop magazine
   advertisements to determine adherence to federal and voluntary
   advertising standards. We assessed the efficacy of these standards in
   curtailing potentially damaging content and protecting public health.
   Methods. We obtained data from a content analysis of a census of 1795
   unique advertising creatives for beer, spirits, and alcopops placed in
   nationally available magazines between 2008 and 2010. We coded creatives
   for manifest content and adherence to federal regulations and industry
   codes.
   Results. Advertisements largely adhered to existing regulations and
   codes. We assessed only 23 ads as noncompliant with federal regulations
   and 38 with industry codes. Content consistent with the codes was,
   however, often culturally positive in terms of aspirational depictions.
   In addition, creatives included degrading and sexualized images,
   promoted risky behavior, and made health claims associated with
   low-calorie content.
   Conclusions. Existing codes and regulations are largely followed
   regarding content but do not adequately protect against content that
   promotes unhealthy and irresponsible consumption and degrades
   potentially vulnerable populations in its depictions. Our findings
   suggest further limitations and enhanced federal oversight may be
   necessary to protect public health.

   Adults with type 2 diabetes (N = 119; 29 % Latino, 61 % Black, 25 %
   White) completed validated measures of diabetes distress and social
   support. Multiple linear regression evaluated the moderating role of
   social support in the relationship between diabetes burden, indicated by
   prescription of insulin and presence of complications, and distress.
   Greater support satisfaction was significantly associated with lower
   distress after controlling for burden. Support satisfaction and number
   of supports significantly moderated the relationship between diabetes
   burden and distress. Post hoc probing revealed a consistent pattern:
   Insulin was significantly associated with more diabetes distress at low
   levels of support but was not at high levels of support.
   Findings support the stress-buffering hypothesis and suggest that social
   support may protect against diabetes distress.

   We investigated whether perceived stress and health behaviors mediated
   the relation between the three types of SES and perceived health.
   Participants (N = 508) attending a public clinic completed a
   computerized survey assessing objective SES (income, education,
   employment); health behaviors; perceived stress; and perceived health.
   They also indicated their social standing relative to others (subjective
   SES) and provided their current address to determine neighborhood SES.
   In a structural equation model including all three SES types, lower
   objective and subjective SES were related to poorer perceived health.
   When mediators were included in the model, there were significant
   indirect effects of (a) SES on health through stress and (b) SES on
   health through stress and health-compromising behaviors.
   Interventions to reduce the impact of stressors could improve the health

AB Emerging research has revealed that everyday discrimination and

   racial/ethnic minorities. The present study examined the association
   between self-reported everyday discrimination and count of chronic
   health conditions, and explored the moderating role of objective and
   subjective socioeconomic position on the discrimination-health relation.
   We utilized nationally representative data of Latino adults (N = 2,554)
   from the National Latino and Asian American Study. Weighted negative
   binomial regression modeling was used to estimate the association
   between self-reported everyday discrimination and count of chronic
   health conditions, and to test whether this relation was modified by
   markers of socioeconomic position. Binomial regressions revealed that
   everyday discrimination was associated with a greater count of chronic
   conditions. However, moderation analyses indicated that household income
   moderated the discrimination-health relation, controlling for
   sociodemographic variables. More specifically, the adverse effects of
   discrimination were stronger for Latinos in middle-income tertiles
   compared to their lower income counterparts, such that as frequency of
   discrimination increased, Latinos with medium levels of household income
   were predicted to have greater counts of chronic conditions. This was
   only marginally significant among those in the high-income tertile. Our
   findings suggest that identifying segments of the Latino population that
   may be at greatest (and lowest) risk of ill health in the context of
   perceiving being discriminated against may prove useful for
   understanding Latino health "paradoxes," and may have implications for
   tailoring prevention and intervention efforts to particular segments of
   the Latino population.

AB The present exploratory study examined the role of acculturation in the
   perception of the risks of smoking following a smoking cessation
   induction intervention among Latino caregivers of children with asthma.
   The sample consisted of 131 Latino smokers (72.9 % female; 18.3 % born
   in the U.S.) who were caregivers of a child with asthma. Caregivers were
   randomized to one of two smoking cessation interventions that were part
   of a home-based asthma program. Self-report measures of risk-perception
   were assessed at baseline, end of treatment (2 months after baseline),
   and 2- and 3-months post-treatment. At baseline, caregivers, regardless
   of level of acculturation, reported moderate to high levels of concern
   about the effects of secondhand smoke on their child's health as well as
   perceived risk regarding the effect of smoking on their own health.
   However, caregivers who were low in acculturation had a greater increase
   in concern about the effects of smoking on their child from pre-to post
   treatment compared to those who were high in acculturation (p = .001).
   Lastly, level of acculturation moderated the association between
   caregivers' concern about smoking on their child's health and their
   motivation to quit smoking (p < .05), but not cessation rates or reduced
   secondhand smoke exposure (p > .05). Specifically, motivation to quit at
   3 months was greater for those with low acculturation. Though
   exploratory, these findings suggest that risk perception may be more
   easily influenced in low versus high acculturated populations and this
   should be considered in the design of clinical interventions and
   potentially mass media campaigns seeking to influence risk of caregiver
   behavior on child health with ethnic and racial minorities.

   potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across
   Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral
   resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected
   abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer.
   We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation
   frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea
   purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each
   neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera
   across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant
   genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that
   both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher
   human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower
   heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted
   to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active
   pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis
   mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More
   densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of
   flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between
   people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral
   resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee
   communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar
   radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee
   communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban
   neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as
   those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.

AB Background: Adult offspring of Holocaust survivors comprise an
   informative cohort in which to study intergenerational transmission of
   the effects of trauma exposure. Lower cortisol and enhanced
   glucocorticoid sensitivity have been previously demonstrated in
   Holocaust survivors with PTSD, and in offspring of Holocaust survivors
   in association with maternal PTSD. In other work, reduction in the
   activity of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11
   beta-HSD-2), which inactivates cortisol, was identified in Holocaust
   survivors in comparison to age-matched, unexposed Jewish controls.
   Therefore, we investigated glucocorticoid metabolism in offspring of
   Holocaust survivors to evaluate if similar enzymatic decrements would be
   observed that might help to explain glucocorticoid alterations
   previously shown for Holocaust offspring.
   Methods: Holocaust offspring (n = 85) and comparison subjects (n = 27)
   were evaluated with clinical diagnostic interview and self-rating
   scales, and asked to collect a 24-h urine sample from which
   concentrations of cortisol and glucocorticoid metabolites were assayed
   by GCMS. 11 beta-HSD-2 activity was determined as the ratio of urinary
   cortisone to cortisol.
   Results: Significantly reduced cortisol excretion was observed in
   Holocaust offspring compared to controls (p = .046), as had been shown
   for Holocaust survivors. However, 11 beta-HSD-2 activity was elevated
   for offspring compared to controls (p = .008), particularly among those
   whose mothers had been children, rather than adolescents or adults,
   during World War II (p = .032). The effect of paternal Holocaust
   exposure could not be reliably investigated in the current sample.
   Conclusions: The inverse association of offspring 11 beta-HSD-2 activity
   with maternal age at Holocaust exposure is consistent with the influence
   of glucocorticoid programming. Whereas a tong standing reduction in 11
   beta-HSD-2 activity among survivors is readily interpreted, in the
   context of Holocaust related deprivation, understanding the directional
   effect on offspring will require replication and further exploration.

   Method: This study investigates state differences in the effectiveness
   of primary enforcement laws by assessing whether a state's academic
   achievement, health ranking, economic prosperity, violent crime rates,
   government effectiveness, gender distribution, or proportion of rural
   roads moderate the relationship between those laws and seat belt
   compliance rates.
   Results: Aggregate state-level academic achievement, health ranking,
   government effectiveness, and proportion of rural roads uniquely
   moderated the seat belt use differences between primary and secondary
   enforcement states.
   Conclusions: This evidence suggests that cultural, social, and
   demographic differences among regions may be important factors in
   explaining state-level differences in the effectiveness of primary
   enforcement of seat belt laws. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Although childhood socioeconomic disadvantage has been
   linked with adolescent tobacco and alcohol use in cross-sectional
   research, less is known about the influence of changes in socioeconomic
   status during childhood. Upward socioeconomic mobility may attenuate the
   negative influence of earlier socioeconomic disadvantage on health,
   while downward mobility may counter the health benefits of earlier
   socioeconomic advantage. This study evaluated the influence of common
   trajectories of family income during childhood on smoking and alcohol
   use during adolescence.
   Methods: Data utilized were part of the 15-year longitudinal Study of
   Early Child Care and Youth Development. A 5-class trajectory model (two
   stable, one downward, and two upward income trajectories) was developed
   previously with this sample (N = 1356). Logistic regression analyses
   were conducted to determine whether children of the more disadvantaged
   income trajectories were more likely to engage in tobacco and alcohol
   use at age 15 relative to those of the most advantaged trajectory.
   Results: Family income trajectory was significantly associated with
   ever-smoking (p = .02) and past-year alcohol use at age 15 years (p =
   .008). Children from the less advantaged trajectories were more likely
   to have ever-smoked than children of the most advantaged trajectory (all
   p's < .05). Children of the downwardly mobile trajectory were more
   likely to have used alcohol within the past year than children of the
   most advantaged trajectories as well as the most disadvantaged
   trajectory (all p's < .05).
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that childhood socioeconomic disadvantage
   influences adolescent smoking, while downward socioeconomic mobility
   influences adolescent alcohol use. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Mozambique is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa most affected
   by the HIV epidemic. Multiple and concurrent sexual partnerships
   (MSP/CP) have been recognized as one of the key drivers in the rapid
   spread of HIV in the region. Though HIV prevention programs have been
   successful in increasing condom use and HIV testing, reducing the
   practice of MSP/CP has been more difficult. Grounding their
   interventions in social and behavior change theory, four organizations
   in Mozambique joined efforts to implement a year-long, multimedia
   national campaign for HIV prevention with emphasis on the reduction of
   MSP/CP. Evaluating its impact and identifying the factors that hinder or
   contribute to its success are critical to building effective programs in
   the future. With data from a 2011 population-based survey of 1427
   sexually active women and men, multivariate causal attribution (MCA)
   analysis was used to estimate the impact of the campaign in the four
   regions of Mozambique with the highest levels of HIV prevalence. The
   analysis tested the psychosocial pathways through which the campaign was
   expected to affect MSP. The results indicate that exposure (recall) was
   high; 81.2% of the respondents could recall one or more of the
   communication campaign components. The campaign had a significant
   indirect impact on MSP through its negative effect on attitudes that
   favor MSP, and its positive effect on knowledge and discussion of MSP
   risk with sex partner. This study demonstrates the value of identifying
   appropriate psychosocial factors and using them to design the campaign
   communication strategy, and evaluate the causal pathways by which it has
   an impact. The campaign was successful in changing MSP behavior by
   working through two psychosocial variables.

AB While overall HIV prevalence in Malawi has decreased, it is still high
   in the southern region of the country. Behavioral prevention activities
   are crucial to continue the reduction in HIV prevalence. Behavior change
   is influenced by many factors. Previous work indicates knowledge about
   HIV transmission, self-efficacy to protect oneself from exposure, and
   accurate risk perception of one's susceptibility all impact sexual
   behavior. The current study looks at the effects of a behavior change
   communication program in Malawi called the BRIDGE II Project on
   psychosocial and behavioral variables. The program sought to address
   barriers to individual action and confront societal norms related to
   sexual risk behavior through a mix of community-based activities and
   mass media messages delivered through local radio stations. Using cohort
   data (n = 594), we examined the effect of BRIDGE exposure on three
   variables that affect HIV behaviors: knowledge, self-efficacy, and risk
   perception, as well as two behavioral outcomes: HIV testing and condom
   use at last sex. Data were collected at baseline and for a midterm
   evaluation. Regression analyses showed exposure to BRIDGE was
   significantly associated with knowledge level (beta = 0.20, p < .001)
   and self-efficacy (beta = 0.35, p < .001) at midterm when controlling
   for baseline scores, but not risk perception. Psychosocial variables did
   not show a significant relationship to either behavioral outcome.
   However, program exposure was a significant predictor of both HIV
   testing in the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 1.40, p < .001) and condom
   use at last sex (OR = 1.26, p < .05). This study suggests such a
   communication intervention may play an important role in not only
   affecting HIV-related behaviors themselves, but also critical factors
   that affect HIV behaviors, including knowledge and self-efficacy. It is
   recommended that communication efforts around HIV risk reduction be
   increased.

AB In this study, the language abilities of 30 children with
   Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) aged 4-6 years were examined using a
   standardized measure of language. Relations of language to multiple
   parental report measures of functional communication, social skills, and
   attention problems were investigated. Difficulties in core language
   skills were observed, and more than 1/3 of the children struggled on at
   least one language index. Language abilities were significantly related
   to parental report of functional communication, social interaction and
   communication, and social skills, such that language difficulties may be
   a risk factor for communication and social interaction challenges and
   communication-related adaptive behavior in children with NF1. Though
   receptive language abilities were an area of particular difficulty for
   many children with NF1, they were not significantly related to parental
   ratings of social functioning and functional communication. Few
   significant relations were found between language and parent-reported
   attention problems, although some trends were noted. Hence attention
   difficulties in children with NF1 may contribute to, but do not appear
   to fully account for, language difficulties. In sum, there is an
   increased risk of language difficulties for young children with NF1, and
   lab-measured language difficulties appear to relate to everyday
   communication and social interaction functioning. Published by Elsevier

AB Background: HIV disproportionately affects black men in the United
   States: most diagnoses are for black gay, bisexual, and other men who
   have sex with men (collectively referred to as MSM). A better
   understanding of the social conditions in which black men live and work
   may better explain why HIV incidence and diagnosis rates are higher than
   expected in this population.
   Methods: Using data from the National HIV Surveillance System and the US
   Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we examined the relationships
   of HIV diagnosis rates and 5 census tract-level social determinants of
   health variables for 21,948 black MSM and non-MSM aged >= 15 years
   residing in 17 areas in the United States. We examined federal poverty
   status, marital status, education level, employment status, and vacancy
   status and computed rate ratios (RRs) and prevalence odds ratios (PORs),
   using logistic regression with zero-inflated negative binomial modeling.
   Results: Among black MSM, HIV diagnosis rates decreased as poverty
   increased (RR: 0.54). At the time of HIV diagnosis, black MSM were less
   likely than black non-MSM to live in census tracts with a higher
   proportion below the poverty level (POR: 0.81) and with a higher
   proportion of vacant houses (POR: 0.86). In comparison, housing vacancy
   was positively associated with HIV diagnosis rates among black non-MSM
   (RR: 1.65). HIV diagnosis rates were higher for black MSM (RR: 2.75) and
   non-MSM (RR: 4.90) whose educational level was low. Rates were
   significantly lower for black MSM (RR: 0.06) and non-MSM (RR: 0.26) as
   the proportion unemployed and the proportion married increased.
   Conclusions: This exploratory study found differences in the patterns of
   HIV diagnosis rates for black MSM and non-MSM and provides insight into
   the transmission of HIV infection in areas that reflect substantial
   disadvantage in education, housing, employment, and income.

AB The belief that ethnic majorities dominate ethnic minorities informs
   research on intergroup processes. This belief can lead to the social
   heuristic that the ethnic majority sets an upper limit that minority
   groups cannot surpass, but this possibility has not received much
   attention. In three studies of perceived income, we examined how this
   heuristic, which we term the White ceiling heuristic leads people to
   inaccurately estimate the income of a minority group that surpasses the
   majority. We found that Asian Americans, whose median income has
   surpassed White median income for nearly three decades, are still
   perceived as making less than Whites, with the least accurate
   estimations being made by people who strongly believe that Whites are
   privileged. In contrast, income estimates for other minorities were
   fairly accurate. Thus, perceptions of minorities are shaped both by
   stereotype content and a heuristic.

AB Background: Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon and unidimensional
   measurements have proven inadequate to the challenge of assessing its
   dynamics. Dynamics between poverty and public health intervention is
   among the most difficult yet important problems faced in development. We
   sought to demonstrate how multidimensional poverty measures can be
   utilized in the evaluation of public health interventions; and to create
   geospatial maps of poverty deprivation to aid implementers in
   prioritizing program planning.
   Methods: Survey teams interviewed a representative sample of 3,749
   female heads of household in 259 enumeration areas across Zambezia in
   August-September 2010. We estimated a multidimensional poverty index,
   which can be disaggregated into context-specific indicators. We produced
   an MPI comprised of 3 dimensions and 11 weighted indicators selected
   from the survey. Households were identified as "poor'' if were deprived
   in >33% of indicators. Our MPI is an adjusted headcount, calculated by
   multiplying the proportion identified as poor (headcount) and the
   poverty gap (average deprivation). Geospatial visualizations of poverty
   deprivation were created as a contextual baseline for future evaluation.
   Results: In our rural (96%) and urban (4%) interviewees, the 33%
   deprivation cut-off suggested 58.2% of households were poor (29.3% of
   urban vs. 59.5% of rural). Among the poor, households experienced an
   average deprivation of 46%; thus the MPI/adjusted headcount is 0.27 (=
   0.58x0.46). Of households where a local language was the primary
   language, 58.6% were considered poor versus Portuguese-speaking
   households where 73.5% were considered non-poor. Living standard is the
   dominant deprivation, followed by health, and then education.
   Conclusions: Multidimensional poverty measurement can be integrated into
   program design for public health interventions, and geospatial
   visualization helps examine the impact of intervention deployment within
   the context of distinct poverty conditions. Both permit program
   implementers to focus resources and critically explore linkages between
   poverty and its social determinants, thus deriving useful findings for
   evidence-based planning.

AB The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse between a motor neuron
   and skeletal muscle. Defects in NMJ transmission cause muscle weakness,
   termed myasthenia. The muscle protein Dok-7 is essential for activation
   of the receptor kinase MuSK, which governs NMJ formation, and DOK7
   mutations underlie familial limb-girdle myasthenia (DOK7 myasthenia), a
   neuromuscular disease characterized by small NMJs. Here, we show in a
   mouse model of DOK7 myasthenia that therapeutic administration of an
   adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the human DOK7 gene
   resulted in an enlargement of NMJs and substantial increases in muscle
   strength and life span. When applied to model mice of another
   neuromuscular disorder, autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular
   dystrophy, DOK7 gene therapy likewise resulted in enlargement of NMJs as
   well as positive effects on motor activity and life span. These results
   suggest that therapies aimed at enlarging the NMJ may be useful for a
   range of neuromuscular disorders.

AB The innovations of science often point to ideas and behaviors that must
   spread and take root in communities to have impact. Ideas, practices,
   and behaviors need to go from accepted truths on the part of a few
   scientists to commonplace beliefs and norms in the minds of the many.
   Moving from scientific discoveries to public good requires social
   influence. We introduce a structured influence process (SIP) framework
   to explain how social networks (i. e., the structure of social
   influence) and human social motives (i. e., the process of social
   influence wherein one person's attitudes and behaviors affect another's)
   are used collectively to enact social influence within a community. The
   SIP framework advances the science of scientific communication by
   positing social influence events that consider both the "who" and the
   "how" of social influence. This framework synthesizes core ideas from
   two bodies of research on social influence. The first is network
   research on social influence structures, which identifies who are the
   opinion leaders and who among their network of peers shapes their
   attitudes and behaviors. The second is research on social influence
   processes in psychology, which explores how human social motives such as
   the need for accuracy or the need for affiliation stimulate behavior
   change. We illustrate the practical implications of the SIP framework by
   applying it to the case of reducing neonatal mortality in India.

AB Fashions and fads are important phenomena that influence many individual
   choices. They are ubiquitous in human societies, and have recently been
   used as a source of data to test models of cultural dynamics. Although a
   few statistical regularities have been observed in fashion cycles, their
   empirical characterization is still incomplete. Here we consider the
   impact of mass media on popular culture, showing that the release of
   movies featuring dogs is often associated with an increase in the
   popularity of featured breeds, for up to 10 years after movie release.
   We also find that a movie's impact on breed popularity correlates with
   the estimated number of viewers during the movie's opening weekend-a
   proxy of the movie's reach among the general public. Movies' influence
   on breed popularity was strongest in the early 20th century, and has
   declined since. We reach these conclusions through a new, widely
   applicable method to measure the cultural impact of events, capable of
   disentangling the event's effect from ongoing cultural trends.

AB Background: Girl education is believed to be the best means of reducing
   girl child marriage (marriage <18 years) globally. However, in South
   Asia, where the majority of girl child marriages occur, substantial
   improvements in girl education have not corresponded to equivalent
   reductions in child marriage. This study examines the levels of
   education associated with female age at marriage over the previous 20
   years across four South Asian nations with high rates (>20%) of girl
   child marriage-Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan.
   Methods: Cross-sectional time series analyses were conducted on
   Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) from 1991 to 2011 in the four focal
   nations. Analyses were restricted to ever-married women aged 20-24
   years. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the
   effect of highest level of education received (none, primary, secondary
   or higher) on age at marriage (<14, 14-15, 16-17, 18 and older).
   Results: In Bangladesh and Pakistan, primary education was not
   protective against girl child marriage; in Nepal, it was protective
   against marriage at <14 years (AOR = 0.42) but not for older
   adolescents. Secondary education was protective across minor age at
   marriage categories in Bangladesh (, 14 years AOR = 0.10; 14-15 years
   AOR =.25; 16-17 years AOR = 0.64) and Nepal (<14 years AOR = 0.21; 14-15
   years AOR = 0.25; 16-17 years AOR = 0.57), but protective against
   marriage of only younger adolescents in Pakistan (<14 years AOR = 0.19;
   14-15 years AOR = 0.23). In India, primary and secondary education were
   respectively protective across all age at marriage categories (<14 years
   AOR = 0.34, AOR = 0.05; 14-15 years AOR = 0.52, AOR = 0.20; 16-17 years
   AOR = 0.71, AOR = 0.48).
   Conclusion: Primary education is likely insufficient to reduce girl
   child marriage in South Asia, outside of India. Secondary education may
   be a better protective strategy against this practice for the region,
   but may be less effective for prevention of marriage among older
   relative to younger adolescents.

AB The size of cities is known to play a fundamental role in social and
   economic life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying
   network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in
   detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the
   urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total
   number of contacts and the total communication activity grow
   superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined
   scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that
   affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability
   that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains
   largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and
   scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as
   cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying
   epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should
   provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear
   increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that
   applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the
   creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious
   diseases.

   factors that influence structural brain development. In recent years,
   research investigating associations between socioeconomic status (SES)
   and brain development have found significant links between SES and
   changes in brain structure, especially in areas related to memory,
   executive control, and emotion. This review focuses on studies examining
   links between structural brain development and SES disparities of the
   magnitude typically found in developing countries. We highlight how
   highly correlated measures of SES are differentially related to
   structural changes within the brain.

AB Beginning slowly in the late 1970s, but accelerating in the 1990s,
   scholars in the engineering and social sciences tried to work across
   theoretical and cultural-disciplinary gaps to understand disasters
   holistically and to provide the science needed for policies that reduce
   risk. Alliances of social scientists and engineers specializing in
   structural, ocean, and environmental engineering have tackled problems
   relating, for example, to earthquakes and tsunamis, while at the same
   time advancing studies of crosscutting ideas such as community
   resilience. Much of that alliance began not in the basic research or
   laboratory world, but with partnerships of scholars working at the focal
   point of hazard-oriented policy systems and public education. This paper
   considers how scholars, research centers, and funding agencies have
   worked to advance an integrated research agenda.

AB While the construction of sanitation infrastructure is one of
   humankind's greatest public health and environmental engineering
   achievements, its benefits are not yet enjoyed by all. In addition to
   the billions of people not yet reached by sanitation infrastructure, at
   least half of systems constructed in developing contexts are abandoned
   in the years following initial construction. In this research, we target
   the problem of postconstruction onsite sanitation infrastructure
   abandonment in rural Guatemala using legitimacy and status theory.
   Legitimacy and status are established theoretical concepts from
   organizational theory that reflect cultural alignment and normative
   support. Crisp set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA), which uses
   Boolean algebra to discover combinations of theoretical conditions that
   produce an outcome of interest, allowed us to describe the various
   pathways that have caused socially sustainable uptake. We find that
   three combinations of legitimacy and status theory explain 85% of
   household cases at a consistency of 0.97. The most practically useful
   pathway covers 50% of household cases and shows that the combination of
   consequential legitimacy (a moral understanding of outcomes) and
   comprehensibility legitimacy (a cognitive model connecting outcomes to
   processes) is a powerful way to achieve socially sustainable sanitation
   infrastructure.

AB Social neuroscience has called for new experimental paradigms aimed
   toward real-time interactions. A distinctive feature of interactions is
   mutual information exchange: One member of a pair changes in response to
   the other while simultaneously producing actions that alter the other.
   Combining mathematical and neurophysiological methods, we introduce a
   paradigm called the human dynamic clamp (HDC), to directly manipulate
   the interaction or coupling between a human and a surrogate constructed
   to behave like a human. Inspired by the dynamic clamp used so
   productively in cellular neuroscience, the HDC allows a person to
   interact in real time with a virtual partner itself driven by
   well-established models of coordination dynamics. People coordinate hand
   movements with the visually observed movements of a virtual hand, the
   parameters of which depend on input from the subject's own movements. We
   demonstrate that HDC can be extended to cover a broad repertoire of
   human behavior, including rhythmic and discrete movements, adaptation to
   changes of pacing, and behavioral skill learning as specified by a
   virtual "teacher." We propose HDC as a general paradigm, best
   implemented when empirically verified theoretical or mathematical models
   have been developed in a particular scientific field. The HDC paradigm
   is powerful because it provides an opportunity to explore parameter
   ranges and perturbations that are not easily accessible in ordinary
   human interactions. The HDC not only enables to test the veracity of
   theoretical models, it also illuminates features that are not always
   apparent in real-time human social interactions and the brain correlates
   thereof.

AB The authors examine the popularity of boys' given names in Beijing
   before and after the onset of the Cultural Revolution to clarify how
   exogenous and endogenous factors interact to shape fashion. Whereas
   recent work in the sociology of culture emphasizes the importance of
   endogenous processes in explaining fashion, their analysis demonstrates
   two ways in which politics shaped cultural expression during the
   Cultural Revolution: by promoting forms of expression reflecting
   prevailing political ideology and by limiting individuals' willingness
   to act differently. As argued by Lieberson and developed further in this
   article, the second condition is important because endogenous fashion
   cycles require a critical mass of individuals who seek to differentiate
   themselves from common practice. Exogenous factors can influence the
   operation of the endogenous factors. The authors discuss the
   implications of their study for understanding the nature of conformity
   under authoritarian regimes and social conditions supporting individual
   expression.

AB Background: Physicians' assumptions about patients' socioeconomic status
   (SES) have been shown to influence clinical decision making in adult
   patients. The goal of this study is to assess the factors associated
   with pediatric pulmonologists' (PPs') subjective ratings of their
   patients' SES, and whether these factors differ by patient
   race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Parents of children with asthma (n = 171) presenting for
   pulmonary care reported their SES using the MacArthur Subjective SES
   10-rung ladder. The PPs (n = 7) also estimated each family's SES.
   Two-level linear regression models with random intercepts (level 1: PP's
   SES ratings; level 2: PPs) were used to assess the predictors of
   PP-estimated family SES. The analyses were then stratified by
   race/ethnicity.
   Results: Parental educational, insurance type, age, and race/ethnic
   background were associated with PPs' SES ratings. Black/African American
   families were rated lower than white families, accounting for other
   demographic factors (b = -0.60, p < 0.01), but families of other
   races/ethnicities were not (b = -0.10, p = 0.29). Even when comparing
   families with the same level of parental education, black/African
   American families, but not families of other backgrounds, were judged to
   have lower SES than white families (from 0.77 rungs lower among parents
   with some college, to 1.2 rungs lower among parents with high school or
   less; both p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Racial differences in PPs' ability to estimate families'
   subjective SES in asthma care may be a function of unconscious societal
   biases about race and class. Collecting subjective SES from families and
   PPs during the office visit could facilitate discussions about material
   and psychosocial needs and resources that influence treatment
   effectiveness.

AB Background: Partnerships between corporate entities and non-governmental
   organizations (NGOs) involved in delivering community focused health and
   well-being programs are becoming increasingly valuable especially in the
   context of promoting healthy lifestyles around the globe. The Mondelez
   International Foundation (MIF) has funded healthy lifestyles community
   based programs targeting children and youth through partnership with
   seven global NGOs. To assess collective impact of these programs, it is
   crucial to identify best practices and common impact indicators that can
   be measured across programs. MIF therefore organized the Healthy
   Lifestyles Evaluation Workshop to explore these pertinent questions.
   Objective: Share best practices and identify common impact indicators to
   measure the success of current and future MIF funded healthy lifestyles
   programs.
   Methods: Analysis of the Program Impact Pathways (PIPs) and measured
   output of each of the seven programs.
   Results: Individual and combined analysis of PIPs of the seven NGO
   programs led to identification of three critical impact indicators:
   nutrition knowledge, physical activity, and healthier eating, and also
   enabled NGOs to identify pathways to improve program delivery among the
   target population.
   Conclusions: This workshop enabled MIF and partner NGOs to came together
   to align on metrics and future engagement approaches for promoting and
   evaluating community based healthy lifestyles programs.

AB The substantial economic impact of influenza on society results
   primarily from lost work time and reduced productivity of patients and
   caregivers and increased use of medical resources. Additionally, since
   the 1980s, aging of the US population has meant rising influenza-related
   morbidity and mortality. According to the most current published data on
   this topic, in 2003 the total economic burden of influenza epidemics in
   the USA across all age groups was US$87.1 billion. As of February 2013,
   overall vaccine effectiveness for the 2012/2013 season was estimated to
   be 56 %. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National
   Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases has concluded that more
   effective vaccines and vaccination strategies are needed. Moderate
   efficacy of the influenza vaccine, continued questions regarding the
   value of treatment with antivirals, and a growing self-care movement
   have led to increased use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, which
   play a vital role in managing symptoms associated with mild to moderate
   influenza and provide an estimated US$102 billion in annual savings for
   the US healthcare system. A primary benefit to society of using OTC
   medicines to manage influenza is decreased use of the healthcare system,
   thereby mitigating the socioeconomic burden of influenza. Considering
   the stresses placed on the US healthcare system and the substantial
   productivity losses resulting from seasonal influenza as well as the
   growing self-care movement, OTC medicines will play an important role in
   the course of future influenza epidemics.

AB Objectives: BMI and waist circumference (WC) tend to be highly
   correlated, but changes in lifestyle behaviors may promote greater
   accumulation of abdominal fat for the same BMI in recent years. We
   examined secular shifts in BMI and WC distributions, and investigated
   whether WC for a given BMI has changed over time among Mexican-origin
   women in Mexico and the US, and in US white women as a comparison.
   Methods: Nationally representative surveys for women aged 20-49 years
   from Mexico (1988, 1999, and 2012) (n=37,116) and the US (1988-1994,
   1999-2002, and 2007-2010) (n=6,985) were used. Quantile regressions
   estimated age-adjusted changes in BMI and WC across years; linear
   regression tested changes in mean WC over time, adjusting for age and
   BMI.
   Results: In all women, BMI and WC at most centiles increased over time.
   WC was also significantly higher over time for the same BMI, though the
   increase was largest in Mexican women. For example, WC was 6.7 cm
   (standard error (SE): 0.17, P< 0.0001) higher in 2012 than in 1999 among
   Mexican women, holding age and BMI constant. Estimates were smaller in
   magnitude for Mexican-American and white women (similar to 3 cm, P<
   0.01), even when comparing over a longer timeframe (1988-1994 to
   2007-2010). In all groups, WC adjusted for BMI increased to a larger
   extent among younger cohorts.
   Conclusion: WC for the same BMI has increased in Mexican-American,
   white, and Mexican women of reproductive age. These patterns may have
   implications for future cardio-metabolic burden in Mexico and the US.

AB Local agriculture, food security and food supply are limited in Alaska,
   as well as in much of the circumpolar North. These limitations stem from
   a suite of challenges that have never been well characterized,
   categorized, or wholly defined. We identify these challenges as being
   environmental, geophysical, biological, or socioeconomic in nature,
   noting that some challenges are interrelated. Additionally, Alaska is
   expansive, and growing conditions are highly variable across different
   regions and microclimates of the state. Environmental challenges to
   Alaskan agriculture are generally linked to high latitude and include
   strong seasonality, a short growing season, cold temperatures, and
   unpredictable frosts. Geophysical challenges are characterized by a high
   percentage of soils that are wet and cold or low in natural fertility.
   Biological challenges include cultivar adaptability and selection; the
   control of various pests, weeds, and diseases; and decreased microbial
   activity in cold soils, which can allow pesticides to linger and slow
   mineralization of organic fertilizers. Socioeconomic challenges to
   farming in Alaska are especially limiting and may categorically
   represent the strongest hindrances to agriculture. They often overlap or
   interact with many of the identified agro-ecological and biogeographic
   challenges. Major socioeconomic issues can be a relatively low financial
   incentive or reward for farmers; inconsistent or limited markets; the
   high cost of land, infrastructure, and inputs; zoning challenges; a lack
   of cooperatives; and for rural farmers, time conflicts with more
   traditional means of subsistence food acquisition. These challenges
   collectively represent factors that limit agriculture in Alaska, and
   they-provide a basis and justification for developing more sustainable
   solutions.

   funeral before the introduction of Christianity and agrees in most
   details with other accounts of funerals from the region. Additionally,
   along with Peary's and Dr. T.S. Dedrick's journal entries from that
   time, the funeral and the circumstances surrounding it provide insight
   into the complex relationships between Peary, his American companions,
   Dedrick and Matthew Henson, and the Inughuit men and women who
   overwintered with them at Fort Conger.

AB Background: Depression during pregnancy has been demonstrated to be
   predictive of low birthweight, prematurity, and postpartum depression.
   These adverse outcomes potentially have lasting effects on maternal and
   child well-being. Socio-economically disadvantaged women are twice as
   likely as middle-class women to meet diagnostic criteria for antenatal
   major depression (MDD), but have proven difficult to engage and retain
   in treatment. Collaborative care treatment models for depression have
   not been evaluated for racially/ethnically diverse, pregnant women on
   Medicaid receiving care in a public health system. This paper describes
   the design, methodology, culturally relevant enhancements, and
   implementation of a randomized controlled trial of depression care
   management compared to public health Maternity Support Services (MSS).
   Methods: Pregnant, public health patients, >18 years with a likely
   diagnosis of MDD or dysthymia, measured respectively by the Patient
   Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the Mini-International
   Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), were randomized to the intervention
   or to public health MSS. The primary outcome was reduction in depression
   severity from baseline during pregnancy to 18-months post-baseline
   (one-year postpartum).
   Baseline results: 168 women with likely MDD (96.4%) and/or dysthymia
   (24.4%) were randomized. Average age was 27.6 years and gestational age
   was 22.4 weeks; 58.3% racial/ethnic minority; 71.4% unmarried; 22% no
   high school degree/GED; 65.3% unemployed; 42.1% making <$10,000
   annually; 80.4% having recurrent depression; 64.6% PTSD, and 72%
   unplanned pregnancy.
   Conclusions: A collaborative care team, including a psychiatrist,
   psychologist, project manager, and 3 social workers, met weekly,
   collaborated with the patients' obstetrics providers, and monitored
   depression severity using an electronic tracking system. Potential
   sustainability of the intervention within a public health system
   requires further study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Shiao, Bode, Beyer, and Selvig argue that the theory of race as a social
   construct should be revisited in light of recent genetic research, which
   they interpret as demonstrating that human biological variation is
   patterned in clinal classes that are homologous to races. In this reply,
   I examine both their claims and the genetics literature they cite,
   concluding that not only does constructivist theory already accommodate
   the contemporary study of human biology, but few geneticists portray
   their work as bearing on race. Equally important, methods for
   statistically identifying DNA-based clusters within the human species
   are shaped by several design features that offer opportunities for the
   incorporation of cultural assumptions about difference. As a result,
   Shiao et al.'s theoretical distinction between social race and
   biological clinal class is empirically jeopardized by the fact that even
   our best attempts at objectively recording natural human groupings are
   socially conditioned.

AB In the second decade of the twenty-first century, women continue to be
   dramatically underrepresented in elective office in the United States.
   Two decades after the much-ballyhooed "Year of the Woman" of 1992, the
   United States ranks below most advanced democracies. Here we revisit a
   question posed over a decade ago: "Why do women so rarely serve in
   midwestern state legislatures?" Our investigation is framed around three
   sets of factors: (i) electoral systems, (2) the political opportunity
   structure, and (3) individual candidates' attributes. Drawing on data
   from 2010 general election candidates in the upper Midwest, we test for
   the latter two sets of factors. Our analysis confirms other studies that
   women are just as likely to be elected as men. However, we found fewer
   women serve in public office because fewer women are candidates. We
   conclude with a proposal to integrate research from feminist scholars to
   unravel probable reasons for this lack of participation.

AB Open-access databases with utility in fisheries science have grown
   exponentially in quantity and scope over the past decade, with profound
   impacts to our discipline. The management, distillation, and sharing of
   an exponentially growing stream of open-access data represents several
   fundamental challenges in fisheries science. Many of the currently
   available open-access resources may not be universally known among
   fisheries scientists. We therefore introduce many national- and
   global-scale open-access databases with applications in fisheries
   science and provide an example of how they can be harnessed to perform
   valuable analyses without additional field efforts. We also discuss how
   the development, maintenance, and utilization of open-access data are
   likely to pose technical, financial, and educational challenges to
   fisheries scientists. Such cultural implications that will coincide with
   the rapidly increasing availability of free data should compel the
   American Fisheries Society to actively address these problems now to
   help ease the forthcoming cultural transition. RESUMENen la ultima
   decada, el numero de bases de datos de acceso abierto con utilidad para
   la ciencia pesquera ha crecido exponencialmente en cantidad y alcance y
   su impacto ha sido considerado como muy importante en esta disciplina.
   El manejo, depuracion e intercambio de datos de acceso abierto
   representa retos fundamentales en la ciencia pesquera. Muchos de los
   recursos actualmente disponibles de acceso abierto pueden no ser
   conocidos por los cientificos pesqueros. Por lo tanto, aqui se presentan
   varias bases de datos a nivel nacional e internacional de libre acceso
   con aplicacion en las ciencias pesqueras y se da un ejemplo de como
   pueden ser aprovechadas para realizar valiosos analisis sin hacer
   esfuerzos adicionales de trabajo de campo. Tambien se discute como el
   desarrollo, mantenimiento y uso de las base de datos de libre acceso muy
   posiblemente representaran retos importantes para los cientificos de la
   pesca en cuanto a las dimensiones tecnica, financiera y educativa. Tales
   implicaciones culturales, que coincidiran con la disponibilidad cada vez
   mayor de datos gratuitos, debieran servir de impulso a la Sociedad
   Americana de Pesquerias a que volcara activamente su atencion sobre
   estos problemas con el fin de facilitar la transicion cultural que se

AB A basic premise of diffusion theories is that actors vary in their
   susceptibility to social influence and yet little is known about the
   nature and consequences of such heterogeneity in specific market
   domains. The present study examines variation in social influence with
   respect to academic research and citation accumulation. Based on
   theories of uncertainty, signaling, and legitimacy, the main hypothesis
   is that disciplinary outsiders are more likely than insiders to cite
   papers that are already highly cited. The empirical analysis, which
   spans six disciplines and 13 flagship journals, is based on over 800
   articles and the 55,000+ citations they accumulate over a 20-year
   period. Each citation received is classified with respect to both its
   timing and the discipline from which it was sent. The results show that
   the effect of prior citation attention is greater for external citation
   accumulation even after controlling for the fact that externals adopt
   later on average than internals. Contrary to intuition, however,
   outsiders do not appear to uniformly exacerbate citation inequality. The
   broader implications of this study for diffusion and the sociology of
   science are discussed in the conclusion.

AB The idea of Cultural Innovative Society is the social life commonly
   expected by various thinkers with political ideals in the history. The
   social civilization has experienced distinct social development stages
   and types of society after more than two millennia. Is the ideal
   harmonious society is apparent, or is it still an unknown state never
   being seen? Such questions have been buried in the mind of people with
   ideal and passion for the society. Based on the basis of sustainable
   social-theory and state philosophy, this study tends to discuss the
   construction path of Cultural Innovative Society. The employees and
   volunteers in Social Affairs Bureau of Kaohsiung City Government, the
   neighborhood magistrates in Kaohsiung City, and the instructors of
   Department of Sociology in public and private universities in southern
   Taiwan are randomly sampled as the research subjects. Total 270 copies
   of questionnaires are distributed, and 208 valid ones are retrieved,
   with the retrieval rate 77%. According to the empirical analyses, the
   following conclusions are proposed in this study. Content Innovation,
   weighted 0.347, is mostly emphasized, about 34.7% of overall weight, in
   the evaluation dimensions, followed by Cultural Development (weighted
   0.276), Mechanism Innovation (weighted 0.219), and Theoretical
   Innovation (weighted 0.158). By organizing the overall weight of the
   evaluation indicators in the critical success factors in Cultural
   Innovative Society construction from the questionnaire, the top five
   emphasized indicators, within 13 evaluation indicators, contain Trend of
   the Times, National Spirit, Cultural Integration, Management Mechanism,
   and Cultural Restructuring. It is expected that this study could
   continue and increase the explanation and analysis coverage of theories
   for broader application. On the other hand, it is also expected, through
   analyses, to provide positive inspiration for the construction and
   development of Cultural Innovative Society and key state policies.

AB Sexuality research has a long history of controversy in the USA. This
   article examines sexuality research as a form of dirty work, an
   occupation that is simultaneously socially necessary and stigmatized.
   Using survey data of contemporary sociologists engaged in sexuality
   research, historical data on 20th century sexologists, and content
   analysis of top-tier sociology journals, I focus on the university
   system and its related functions of publishing, funding, and ethical
   review boards. I argue that sexuality research is constructed as dirty
   work by systematic practices of the university system, and further
   suggest that these practices impose stigma effects that are not simply
   individual but represent persistent patterns of institutional
   inequality. Further, I show how these institutional practices are shaped
   by cultural schemas regarding sexuality, enacted through cognitive and
   affective bias of institutional actors. The construction of sexuality
   research as dirty work affects not only researchers themselves but
   shapes the broad production of sexual knowledge.

AB In aesthetic terms, the category of 'sound' is often split in two:
   'noise', which is chaotic, unfamiliar, and offensive; and 'music', which
   is harmonious, resonant, and divine. These opposing concepts are brought
   together in the phenomenon of Noise Music, but how do practitioners make
   sense of this apparent discordance? Analyses that treat recorded media
   as primary texts declare Noise Music to be a failure, as a genre without
   progress. These paint Noise as a polluted form in an antagonistic
   relationship with traditional music. But while critiques often point to
   indeterminate structure as indicative of the aesthetic project's
   limitations, we claim that indeterminacy itself becomes central to
   meaningful expression when the social context of Noise is considered.
   Through observational and interview data, we consider the contexts,
   audiences, and producers of contemporary American Noise Music.
   Synthesizing the performance theories of Hennion and Alexander, we
   demonstrate how indeterminacy situated in structured interaction allows
   for meaning-making and sustains a musical form based in claims to
   inclusion, access, and creative freedom. We show how interaction, not
   discourse, characterizes the central performance that constructs the
   meaning of Noise.

   contributions to policymaking for health equity. We presented a new
   conceptual model and 2 case studies to illustrate the connections among
   CBPR contexts and processes, policymaking processes and strategies, and
   outcomes. We extended the critical role of civic engagement by those
   communities that were most burdened by health inequities by focusing on
   their political participation as research brokers in bridging evidence

AB Objectives. We assessed whether 2 types of public housing-scattered
   among market-rate housing developments or clustered in small public
   housing projects-were associated with the perceived health and health
   behaviors of residents' social networks.
   Methods. Leveraging a natural experiment in Montgomery County, Maryland,
   in which residents were randomly assigned to different types of public
   housing, we surveyed 453 heads of household in 2011. We asked residents
   about their own health as well as the perceived health of their network
   members, including their neighbors.
   Results. Residents in scattered-site public housing perceived that their
   neighbors were more likely to exercise than residents of clustered
   public housing (24.7% of network members vs 14.0%; P < .001). There were
   no significant differences in the proportion of network members who were
   perceived to have major health problems, depressed mood, poor diet, or
   obesity. Having more network members who smoked was associated with a
   significantly higher likelihood of smoking.
   Conclusions. Different types of public housing have a modest impact on
   the health composition of one's social network, suggesting the
   importance of housing policy for health.

   recruited participants (n = 828) from 20 low-income housing developments
   in the Boston area. We interviewed 1 participant per household and
   conducted a brief inspection of the unit (apartment). We created binary
   indexes and a summed index for household exposures: mold, combustion
   by-products, secondhand smoke, chemicals, pests, and inadequate
   ventilation. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the
   associations between each index and household characteristics and
   between each index and self-reported health.
   Results. Environmental problems were common; more than half of homes had
   3 or more exposure-related problems (median summed index = 3). After
   adjustment for household-level demographics, we found clustering of
   problems in site (P < .01) for pests, combustion byproducts, mold, and
   ventilation. Higher summed index values were associated with higher
   adjusted odds of reporting fair-poor health (odds ratio = 2.7 for
   highest category; P < .008 for trend).
   Conclusions. We found evidence that indoor environmental conditions in
   multifamily housing cluster by site and that cumulative exposures may be
   associated with poor health.

AB Objectives. We examined older jail inmates' predetainment acute care use
   (emergency department or hospitalization in the 3 months before arrest)
   and their plans for using acute care after release.
   Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 247 jail inmates aged
   55 years or older assessing sociodemographic characteristics, health,
   and geriatric conditions associated with predetainment and anticipated
   postrelease acute care use.
   Results. We found that 52% of older inmates reported predetainment acute
   care use and 47% planned to use the emergency department after release.
   In modified Poisson regression, homelessness was independently
   associated with predetainment use (relative risk = 1.42; 95% confidence
   interval = 1.10, 1.83) and having a primary care provider was inversely
   associated with planned use (relative risk = 0.69; 95% confidence
   interval = 0.53, 0.89).
   Conclusions. The Affordable Care Act has expanded Medicaid eligibility
   to all persons leaving jail in an effort to decrease postrelease acute
   care use in this high-risk population. Jail-to-community transitional
   care models that address the health, geriatric, and social factors
   prevalent in older adults leaving jail, and that focus on linkages to
   housing and primary care, are needed to enhance the impact of the act on
   acute care use for this population.

AB Objectives. We investigated the underlying mechanisms of the influence
   of socioeconomic status (SES) on mental health and self-rated health
   (SRH), and evaluated how these relationships might vary by
   race/ethnicity, age, and gender.
   Methods. We analyzed data of 44 921 adults who responded to the 2009
   California Health Interview Survey. We used a path analysis to test
   effects of SES, neighborhood safety, and physical activity on mental
   health and SRH.
   Results. Low SES was associated with greater neighborhood safety
   concerns, which were negatively associated with physical activity, which
   was then negatively related to mental health and SRH. This model was
   similar across different racial/ethnic and gender groups, but mean
   levels in the constructs differed across groups.
   Conclusions. SES plays an important role in SRH and mental health, and
   this effect is further nuanced by race/ethnicity and gender. Identifying
   the psychological (neighborhood safety) and behavioral (physical
   activity) factors that influence mental health and SRH is critical for
   tailoring interventions and designing programs that can improve overall
   health.

AB Objectives. We compared the strength of association between average
   5-year county-level mortality rates and area-level measures, including
   air quality, sociodemographic characteristics, violence, and economic
   distress.
   Methods. We obtained mortality data from the National Vital Statistics
   System and linked it to socioeconomic and demographic data from the
   Census Bureau, air quality data, violent crime statistics, and loan
   delinquency data. We modeled 5-year average mortality rates (1998-2002)
   for all-cause, cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases
   as a function of county-level characteristics using ordinary least
   squares regression models. We limited analyses to counties with
   population of 100 000 or greater (n = 458).
   Results. Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, particularly the
   percentage older than 65 years and near poor, were top predictors of
   all-cause and condition-specific mortality, as were a high concentration
   of construction and service workers. We found weaker associations for
   air quality, mortgage delinquencies, and violent crimes. Protective
   characteristics included the percentage of Hispanics, Asians, and
   married residents.
   Conclusions. Multiple factors influence county-level mortality. Although
   county demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are important,
   there are independent, although weaker, associations of other
   environmental characteristics. Future studies should investigate these
   factors to better understand community mortality risk.

AB Objectives. We examined the roles of utilitarian and recreational
   walking in relation to occurrence of outdoor falls in older adults.
   Methods. We analyzed data on walking habits, falls, and fall injuries
   among participants of MOBILIZE Boston, a prospective cohort study of 765
   community-dwelling women and men, mainly aged 70 years or older, in
   Boston, Massachusetts. Neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES)
   indicators were assessed at census block group level. Falls were
   recorded during a total of 2066.5 person-years of follow-up (September
   2005-December 2009), and the median length of follow-up was 2.9 years
   (range = 0.04-4.3).
   Results. Lower neighborhood SES indicators were associated with more
   utilitarian walking and higher rates of falls on sidewalks, streets, and
   curbs. Falls on sidewalks and streets were more likely to result in an
   injury than were falls in recreational areas. Utilitarian-only walkers
   tended to live in neighborhoods with the lowest neighborhood SES and had
   the highest rate of outdoor falls despite walking 14 and 25 fewer blocks
   per week than the recreational-only and dual walkers, respectively.
   Conclusions. Improving the safety of walking environments in areas where
   older adults shop and do other errands of necessity is an important
   component of fall prevention.

AB Objective: In the United States, over 6 million children were referred
   to child protective services in 2012. Black children are overrepresented
   among children investigated for child abuse and neglect. Understanding
   why black children are disproportionately reported for maltreatment is
   critical to informing policy and practice solutions. Two competing
   theories attribute disproportionality to either racial bias or
   concentrated risk factors. Although prior work has focused on national
   data, this study examines the relationship between risk factors and
   maltreatment at the state level, focusing on outcomes for young
   children. Method: We examine the relationship between early childhood
   poverty and maltreatment victimization across white, black, and Hispanic
   children (0-3 years). Using state-level data (N = 48), we determine
   ratios of disproportionate outcomes in child maltreatment and
   associations to poverty and other risk factors. Results: Study findings
   for state-level data show greater disproportionality of black and
   Hispanic children living in poverty relative to their white
   counterparts. This imbalance is associated with greater
   disproportionality in maltreatment rates. Results also indicate that
   disproportionality of maltreatment rates was associated with state
   disproportionality in rates of unmarried and teenage mothers for blacks
   and Hispanics. Conclusion: Exposure to risks such as poverty is an
   important factor driving the overrepresentation of minority groups in
   the child welfare system. Effective strategies for reducing maltreatment
   must include strategies for reducing poverty and supporting young
   at-risk mothers.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of ultrasound

   in overweight subjects. A secondary purpose was to evaluate racial
   differences in EI, mCSA and body composition. In 33 overweight subjects,
   mCSA and EI were determined from a panoramic ultrasound scan of the
   vastus lateralis. Body composition was determined using dual-energy
   X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Reliability of mCSA and EI was calculated
   from the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of
   the measurement (SEM) and minimal difference (MD). The ICC, SEM and MD
   for mCSA and EI were 0.87, 2.12, 5.89 and 0.74, 4.58, 12.69,
   respectively. There were no significant racial differences in body
   composition (p > 0.05); however, EI was significantly lower for black
   subjects (p = 0.018). These results suggest ultrasound measures of mCSA
   and EI are reliable in overweight subjects, and EI may provide
   additional muscle composition evaluations, beyond DXA measures. (E-mail:

AB OBJECTIVE To determine whether socioeconomic status (SES) predicts the
   size and local extent of tumors at presentation, and if this association
   leads to differences in survival.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS The National Cancer Institute's Survival,
   Epidemiology, and End Results registry was queried for patients
   diagnosed with renal cancers between 2004 and 2010. Demographic, tumor,
   survival, and socioeconomic data were obtained. Cancers with T0
   classification, nonrenal cell histology, or missing clinical or
   pathologic data were excluded. An SES measure was created from available
   metrics. Outcomes analyzed were tumor size, TNM classifications at
   diagnosis, tumor grade and histology subtype, and survival duration.
   RESULTS A total of 40,212 cases were identified. On regression modeling,
   lower SES was an independent risk factor for tumor size >= 4 cm (P =
   .003) and for T classification >= T2 (P = .040) at presentation, but did
   not predict histology subtype, positive lymph nodes, or metastasis.
   Lower SES predicted high-grade disease on univariate analysis (P = .012)
   but lost significance in the multivariate model. Lower SES was also
   independently predictive of shortened cancer-specific survival on
   multivariate analysis after adjusting for available cofactors (lowest vs
   highest SES quartile; P = .001).
   CONCLUSION This study suggests that low SES is correlated with poorer
   survival outcomes in renal cancer, and this may be related to a tendency
   toward larger and more locally advanced tumors at diagnosis. Additional
   investigation is needed to ascertain whether these effects could be
   mediated by relatively lower rates of incidental detection via abdominal
   imaging in disadvantaged populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB All matters related to ethnography flow from a decision that originates
   at the very beginning of the research process-the selection of the basic
   object of analysis-and yet fieldworkers pay scant attention to this
   crucial task. As a result, most take as their starting point bounded
   entities delimited by location or social classification and in so doing
   restrict the kinds of arguments available to them. This article presents
   the alternative of relational ethnography. Relational ethnography
   involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than
   bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural
   conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its
   own set of challenges, it offers an ethnographic method that works with
   the relational and processual nature of social reality.

AB Objectives. We (1) compared use of various health services nationally
   between Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA/PI) veterans and
   veterans of other racial/ethnic groups and (2) specifically compared
   perceived barriers and stigma related to mental health services.
   Methods. Using bivariate and multivariable statistics, we analyzed a
   population-weighted sample of 8315 veterans from the 2010 National
   Survey of Veterans and a random sample of 567 recent veterans from
   Hawaii.
   Results. A total of 1.5% of veterans were AA/PI compared with 0.4% a
   decade ago. Compared with other veterans, AA/PI veterans reported higher
   socioeconomic status and better mental health, although these findings
   may be specific to AA veterans. Adjusting for sociodemographic and
   health differences, we found no differences in health service use or
   perceived barriers or stigma related to mental health services.
   Conclusions. AA/PIs are a small but fast-growing racial/ethnic group
   within the veteran population that deserves attention. Although veteran
   status may be protective against some barriers to mental health care
   found in the general AA/PI population, efforts to reduce barriers to
   health care among veterans should be continued.

AB Despite data demonstrating a substantial gender gap in the United
   States, many women do not self-identify as feminist. An evaluation of
   the literature suggests four potential reasons for the lack of
   identification, 1) a negative connotation associated with the term
   "feminist," 2) the dichotomous presentation of feminism (e.g., the lack
   of grey area between feminism and non-feminism), 3) a belief that
   feminism may no longer be necessary, and 4) a perceived lack of cultural
   relevance. Previous research on feminism has not adequately addressed
   the dynamic and contextual factors that can influence a woman's decision
   of whether to self-identify. Therefore, the goal of this project was to
   use qualitative methodology to allow for the identification of potential
   personal barriers for women associating with the feminist movement. The
   data suggest that feminism is viewed as an obsolete entity with largely
   negative connotations associated with the term. The implications of
   these barriers and several suggestions for change in the movement are
   discussed.

AB Recent research has begun to focus on the subclinical presentation of
   autistic-like traits in individuals, a construct termed the broader
   autism phenotype (BAP). The presence of the BAP has been established in
   both first-degree relatives of individuals with autism as well as in the
   general population. The current study aimed to examine how self-reported
   BAP characteristics, social interaction anxiety, and fear of negative
   evaluation relate to social functioning (specifically, loneliness) in a
   sample of college students. Results showed that for all subjects, BAP,
   social interaction anxiety, and fear of negative evaluation did not
   predict loneliness in a regression model. However, for males these
   predictors accounted for approximately 48 % of the variance in
   loneliness scores. Among males, individuals rating themselves as having
   lower social skills, lower imagination, and higher social interaction
   anxiety were more likely to also report feeling lonely. These results
   indicate that the predictors used may function differently among males
   and females. Although BAP characteristics and social interaction anxiety
   may not be important correlates of social functioning for females in
   this sample, they appear to be very important for males' subjective
   feelings of loneliness.

AB Objective: Racial/ethnic differences in the course of treatment for a
   major depressive episode (MDE) among adolescents may arise, in part,
   from variation in the perceived rationale for treatment. We examined
   racial/ethnic differences in the perceived reasons for receiving mental
   health (MH) treatment among adolescents with an MDE. Method: A total of
   2,789 adolescent participants who experienced an MDE and received MH
   treatment in the past year were drawn from the 2005 to 2008 National
   Survey on Drug Use and Health. Adolescents reported the settings in
   which they received care and reasons for their most recent visit to each
   setting. Distributions of specific depressive symptoms were compared
   across racial/ethnic groups. Racial/ethnic differences in endorsing each
   of 11 possible reasons for receiving treatment were examined using
   weighted probit regressions adjusted for sociodemographic
   characteristics, health and mental health status, treatment setting, and
   survey year. Results: Despite similar depressive symptom profiles,
   Hispanic adolescents were more likely than whites to endorse "breaking
   rules" or getting into physical fights as reasons for MR treatment.
   Black adolescents were more likely than white adolescents to endorse
   "problems at school" but less likely to endorse "felt very afraid or
   tense" or "eating problems" as reasons for treatment. Asian adolescents
   were more likely to endorse "problems with people other than friends or
   family" but less likely than whites to endorse "suicidal
   thoughts/attempt" and "felt depressed" as reasons for treatment.
   Conclusion: Racial/ethnic minority participants were more likely than
   white participants to endorse externalizing or interpersonal problems
   and less likely to endorse internalizing problems as reasons for MH
   treatment. Understanding racial/ethnic differences in the patient's
   perceived treatment rationale can offer opportunities to enhance
   outcomes for depression among diverse populations.

AB Background: Research focused on identifying vulnerable populations and
   revealing specific risk factors for barriers along the pathway from ESRD
   to kidney transplantation has been mostly descriptive and the causes of
   existing disparities remain unclear. However, several socio-economic
   factors that are associated with the access to and the outcome of the
   kidney transplantation have been identified. Summary: While the presence
   of racial, gender, and geographic disparities is noted, we were
   interested mostly to describe potential socioeconomic factors associated
   with and possibly responsible for the presence of such disparities. In
   this review we focused on five factors: education level, employment
   status, income, presence of substance addiction or abuse, and marital
   status. We describe the new method to quantify patients' socio-economic
   status and identify the group of high risk in terms of the transplant
   outcome, easily calculated social adaptability index, previously
   associated with clinical outcome in several patient populations
   including those with kidney transplant. At the end, based on literature
   analyzed we offer potential interventions that potentially can be used
   in order to reduce the degree of disparities. Conclusion: Based on
   review of literature socio-economic factors are associated with and
   possibly responsible for healthcare disparities. Social adaptability
   index allows quantifying the degree of socio-economic status and
   identifying the group of high risk for inferior transplant outcome.

AB Background: Studies have tried to link obesity rates and physical
   activity with multiple aspects of the built environment.
   Purpose: To determine the relation between residential property values
   and multiple perceived (self-reported) measures of the obesogenic
   environment.
   Methods: The Seattle Obesity Study (SOS) used a telephone survey of a
   representative, geographically distributed sample Of 2,001 King County
   adults, collected in 2008-2009 and analyzed in 2012-2013. Home addresses
   were geocoded. Residential property values at the tax parcel level were
   obtained from the King County tax assessor. Mean residential property
   values within a 10-minute walk (833-m buffer) were calculated for each
   respondent. Data on multiple perceived measures of the obesogenic
   environment were collected by self-report. Correlations and
   multi-variable linear regression analyses, stratified by residential
   density, were used to examine the associations among perceived
   environmental measures, property values, and BMI.
   Results: Perceived measures of the environment such as crime, heavy
   traffic, and proximity to bars, liquor stores, and fast food were all
   associated with lower property values. By contrast, living in
   neighborhoods that were perceived as safe, quiet, clean, and attractive
   was associated with higher property values. Higher property values were
   associated, in turn, with lower BMIs among women. The observed
   associations between perceived environment measures and BMI were largely
   attenuated after accounting for residential property values.
   Conclusions: Environments perceived as obesogenic are associated with
   lower property values. Studies in additional locations need to explore
   to what extent other perceived environment measures can be reflected in
   residential property values. (C) 2014 American Journal of Preventive

AB The use of social network theory in evaluating animal social groups has
   gained traction in recent years. Despite the utility of social network
   analysis in describing attributes of social groups, it remains unclear
   how comparable this approach is to traditional behavioral observational
   studies. Using data on Gunnison's prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) social
   interactions we describe social networks from three populations. We then
   compare those social networks to groups identified by traditional
   behavioral approaches and explore whether individuals group together
   based on similarities. The social groups identified by social network
   analysis were consistent with those identified by more traditional
   behavioral approaches. However, fine-grained social sub-structuring was
   revealed only with social network analysis. We found variation in the
   patterns of interactions among prairie dog social groups that was
   largely independent of the behavioral attributes or genetics of the
   individuals within those groups. We detected that some social groups
   include disproportionately well-connected individuals acting as hubs or
   bridges. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence
   that-social networks analysis is a robust and efficient tool for
   examining social dynamics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Despite comparatively lower socioeconomic status (SES),
   immigrants tend to have lower body weight and weaker SES gradients
   relative to US-born individuals. Yet, it is unknown how changes in SES
   over the life-course relate to body weight in immigrants versus US-born
   individuals.
   Methods We used longitudinal data from a nationally representative,
   diverse sample of 13 701 adolescents followed into adulthood to
   investigate whether associations between SES mobility categories
   (educational attainment reported by individuals as adults and by their
   parents during adolescence) and body mass index (BMI) measured in
   adulthood varied by immigrant generation. Weighted multivariable linear
   regression models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity and
   immigrant generation.
   Results Among first-generation immigrants, although parental education
   was not associated with adult BMI, an immigrant's own education
   attainment was inversely associated with BMI (beta=-2.6 kg/m(2); SE=0.9,
   p<0.01). In addition, upward educational mobility was associated with
   lower adult mean BMI than remaining low SES (beta=-2.5 kg/m(2); SE=1.2,
   p<0.05). In contrast, among US-born respondents, college education in
   adulthood did not attenuate the negative association between parental
   education and adult BMI. Although an SES gradient emerged in adulthood
   for immigrants, remaining low SES from adolescence to adulthood was not
   associated with loss of health advantage relative to US-born respondents
   of US-born parents of similar SES.
   Conclusions Immigrants were able to translate higher SES in adulthood
   into a lower adult mean BMI regardless of childhood SES, whereas the
   consequences of lower childhood SES had a longer reach even among the
   upwardly mobile US born.

AB Background: This piece aims to examine the relationships between hollow
   viscus injury (HVI) and socioeconomic factors in determining outcomes.
   HVI has well-defined injury patterns with complex postoperative
   convalescence and morbidity, representing an ideal focus for identifying
   potential disparities among a homogeneous injury population.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective review included patients admitted
   to a level I trauma center with HVI from 2000-2009, as identified in the
   Trauma Registry of the American College of Surgeons. Patients with
   concomitant significant solid organ or vasculature injury were excluded.
   US Census (2000) median household income by zip code was used as
   socioeconomic proxy. Demographic and injury-related variables were also
   included. Endpoints were mortality and outcomes associated with HVI
   morbidity.
   Results: A total of 933 patients with HVI were identified and 256 met
   inclusion criteria. There were 23 deaths (9.0%), and mortality was not
   associated with race, gender, income, or payer source. However, lower
   median household income was significantly associated with longer
   intervals to ostomy takedown (P = 0.032). Additionally, private payers
   had significantly lower rates of anastomotic leak (0% [0/73] versus 7.1%
   [13/183], P = 0.019) and fascial dehiscence (5.5% [4/73] versus 16.9%
   [31/183], P = 0.016), while self-payers had significantly higher rates
   of abscess formation, both overall (24% [24/100] versus 10.2% [16/156],
   P = 0.004) and among penetrating injuries (27.4% [23/84] versus 13.6%
   [12/88], P = 0.036).
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status may not impact overall mortality among
   trauma patients with hollow viscus injuries, but private insurance
   appears to be protective of morbidity related to anastomotic leak,
   fascial dehiscence, and abscess formation. This supports that
   socioeconomic disparity may exist within long-term outcomes,
   particularly regarding payer source. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found that unconscious biases may
   influence physicians' clinical decision making. The objective of our
   study was to determine, using clinical vignettes, if unconscious race
   and class biases exist specifically among trauma/acute care surgeons
   and, if so, whether those biases impact surgeons' clinical decision
   making.
   METHODS: A prospective Web-based survey was administered to active
   members of the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma.
   Participants completed nine clinical vignettes, each with three
   trauma/acute care surgery management questions. Race Implicit
   Association Test (IAT) and social class IAT assessments were completed
   by each participant. Multivariable, ordered logistic regression analysis
   was then used to determine whether implicit biases reflected on the IAT
   tests were associated with vignette responses.
   RESULTS: In total, 248 members of the Eastern Association for the
   Surgery of Trauma participated. Of these, 79% explicitly stated that
   they had no race preferences and 55% stated they had no social class
   preferences. However, 73.5% of the participants had IAT scores
   demonstrating an unconscious preference toward white persons; 90.7%
   demonstrated an implicit preference toward upper social class persons.
   Only 2 of 27 vignette-based clinical decisions were associated with
   patient race or social class on univariate analyses. Multivariable
   analyses revealed no relationship between IAT scores and vignette-based
   clinical assessments.
   CONCLUSION: Unconscious preferences for white and upper-class persons
   are prevalent among trauma and acute care surgeons. In this study, these
   biases were not statistically significantly associated with clinical
   decision making. Further study of the factors that may prevent implicit
   biases from influencing patient management is warranted. (Copyright (C)

AB Home gardens have been recognized as repositories of agricultural
   biodiversity across the world. The influence of socioeconomics and
   location-specific factors on urban gardening patterns merits continued
   study. Using Beijing Municipal Province in China, a rapidly urbanizing
   region, as a case study, we address two questions: 1) How do
   biodiversity patterns change between different urbanized regions in
   Beijing? 2) How do ecosystem services provided by Beijing home gardens
   change with socioeconomic status and location-based preferences of
   gardeners? We surveyed 104 home gardens in Beijing Municipal Province
   for plant biodiversity, abundance, and species ecosystem services (ES)
   (provisioning or cultural uses). The gardens were distributed across
   three urbanized regions (suburban, peri-urban, and exurban). We found
   that species biodiversity and abundance shift according to a hierarchy
   of need from ornamentals (cultural ES) to edibles (provisioning ES) with
   increasing distance from Beijing. These trends are related to reduced
   income, lowered food security, and lack of urban markets in exurban
   regions. Rarefaction curves indicate ornamental species drive beta
   diversity. Ordination also showed a shift in species composition with
   increasing isolation from the city; Suburban and exurban gardens were
   the most different, while peri-urban gardens were similar to both
   others. Only exurban gardens had a positive relationship between species
   and area. High edible cover and high species density indicates that
   demand for edibles in exurban regions may be higher than space
   constraints allows. Our study better quantifies species biodiversity
   patterns in Beijing, and can inform urban planners about the value and
   usefulness of home garden space.

AB Several social theories have been proposed to explain the uneven
   distribution of vegetation in urban residential areas: population
   density, social stratification, luxury effect, and ecology of prestige.
   We evaluate these theories using a combination of demographic and
   socio-economic predictors of vegetative cover on all residential lands
   in New York City. We use diverse data sources including the City's
   property database, time-series demographic and socio-economic data from
   the US Census, and land cover data from the University of Vermont's
   Spatial Analysis Lab (SAL). These data are analyzed using a multi-model
   inferential, spatial econometrics approach. We also examine the
   distribution of vegetation within distinct market categories using
   Claritas' Potential Rating Index for Zipcode Markets (PRIZM (TM))
   database. These categories can be disaggregated, corresponding to the
   four social theories. We compare the econometric and categorical results
   for validation. Models associated with ecology of prestige theory are
   more effective for predicting the distribution of vegetation. This
   suggests that private, residential patterns of vegetation, reflecting
   the consumption of environmentally relevant goods and services, are
   associated with different lifestyles and lifestages. Further, our
   spatial and temporal analyses suggest that there are significant spatial
   and temporal dependencies that have theoretical and methodological
   implications for understanding urban ecological systems. These findings
   may have policy implications. Decision makers may need to consider how
   to most effectively reach different social groups in terms of messages
   and messengers in order to advance land management practices and achieve
   urban sustainability.

   also examined parents' follow-in utterances that co-occurred with each
   state. We found that only HSJE predicts later social communication and

AB An important line of research relates to whether school personnel, such

   periods, such as lunch-recess, could successfully implement
   interventions to improve socialization between students with ASD and
   their typical peers in a group setting. Therefore, within the context of
   a multiple baseline across participants design, we assessed whether
   training paraprofessionals to provide social interventions would enhance
   social development in students with ASD in a group setting. Results
   showed that paraprofessionals who were not providing any social
   opportunities during baseline were able to meet fidelity of
   implementation following a brief training. Consequently, the children
   with ASD increased their levels of engagement and rates of initiation
   with typically developing peers following intervention. Implications for
   training paraprofessionals to implement effective social interventions
   for students with ASD are discussed.

AB In the last three decades there has been ample research to demonstrate
   that instituting Multisystemic Therapy for serious juvenile offenders,
   keeping them in the community with intensive intervention, can
   significantly reduce recidivism. When there is recidivism, it is less
   severe than in released incarcerated juveniles. Multisystemic Therapy
   provides 24 h available parental guidance, family therapy, individual
   therapy, group therapy, educational support and quite importantly a
   change of peer group. In New York City, there is the new mandate through
   the Juvenile Justice Initiative to implement interventions to keep
   juvenile offenders in the community rather than sending them to be
   incarcerated. However, this paper aims to examine how teaching prosocial
   values in early childhood can reduce the incidence of first-time
   juvenile delinquency. Programs such as the Perry School Project will be
   discussed to demonstrate that although somewhat expensive, these
   innovative programs nonetheless are quite cost-effective as the cost to
   society of adjudication, incarceration and victim damages are
   significantly greater. Along with teaching prosocial 0020 values, there
   has been renewed interest in early identification of youth at risk for
   developing Antisocial Personality Disorder. An update is given on the
   status of both promising approaches in early intervention to prevent
   serious juvenile delinquency and hence adult criminality.

AB Emile Durkheim summarily rejected Gabriel Tarde's imitation thesis,
   arguing that sociology need only concern itself with social suicide
   rates. Over a century later, a burgeoning body of suicide research has
   challenged Durkheim's claim to a general theory of suicide as 4 decades
   worth of evidence has firmly established that (1) there is a positive
   association between the publicization of celebrity suicides and a spike
   in the aggregate suicide rate, (2) some social environments are
   conducive to epidemic-like outbreaks of suicides, and (3) suicidal ideas
   or behavior spreads to some individuals exposed to a personal role
   model's suicidal behavior-for example, a friend or family member.
   Revisiting Tarde, the article examines why Tarde's theory deserves
   renewed attention, elucidates what he meant by imitation, and then
   formalizes his "laws" into testable theses, while suggesting future
   research questions that would advance the study of suicide, as well as
   other pathologies. Each "law" is elaborated by considering advances in
   contemporary social psychology as well as in light of its ability to
   supplement Durkheim's theory in explaining the "outlier" cases.

AB Objective. The aim of this study is to examine a relationship between
   neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation and weight change in a
   multi-ethnic cohort from Dallas County, Texas and whether
   behavioral/psychosocial factors attenuate the relationship.
   Methods. Non-movers (those in the same neighborhood throughout the study
   period) aged 18-65 (N = 939) in Dallas Heart Study (DHS) underwent
   weight measurements between 2000 and 2009 (median 7-year follow-up).
   Geocoded home addresses defined block groups; a neighborhood deprivation
   index (NDI) was created (higher NDI = greater deprivation). Multi-level
   modeling determined weight change relative to NDI. Model fit improvement
   was examined with adding physical activity and neighborhood environment
   perceptions (higher score = more unfavorable perceptions) as covariates.
   A significant interaction between residence length and NDI was found
   (p-interaction = 0.04); results were stratified by median residence
   length (11 years).
   Results. Adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, and
   education/income, those who lived in neighborhood > 11 years gained 1.0
   kg per one-unit increment of NDI (p = 0.03), or 6 kg for those in
   highest NDI tertile compared with those in the lowest tertile. Physical
   activity improved model fit; NDI remained associated with weight gain
   after adjustment for physical activity and neighborhood environment
   perceptions. There was no significant relationship between NDI and
   weight change for those in their neighborhood <= 11 years.
   Conclusions. Living in more socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods
   over a longer time period was associated with weight gain in DHS.

AB Background. Given the obesity epidemic, it is critical to understand
   factors associated with youth physical activity and sedentary behavior
   at home, where youth spend significant time. We examined relationships
   between these child behaviors and home environment factors.
   Methods. Data were obtained from 713 children aged 6 to 11 in Washington
   and California 2007-2009. Multivariate regression analyses controlling
   for socio-demographics examined associations between parent-reported
   home environment factors and child's accelerometer-measured
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time,
   overall and at home, and parent-reported child screen time.
   Results. Children averaged 47.2% of time at home, which included 43.6%
   and 46.4% of overall MVPA and sedentary behavior, respectively. Parental
   support for physical activity and having a basketball hoop were
   positively associated with MVPA and negatively associated with sedentary
   behavior. Combined parental support and a basketball hoop was associated
   with even higher MVPA. Children with fewer bedroom media devices and
   more fixed play equipment had lower overall sedentary behavior and
   screen time than either factor alone. Findings were similar regardless
   of weight status.

AB Women remain underrepresented in electoral politics at every level. Much
   has been written about how dominant gender values shape political
   women's decisions to run for office, how the media portrays women on the
   campaign trail, and how voters respond to women candidates. Yet,
   research on women in politics has too often assumed a monolithic
   standard of femininity, overlooking the ways in which gender values are
   varied and deeply racialized. Drawing from data gathered through 46
   interviews I conducted with women leaders and political activists in
   Texas, I explore the narratives politically active women cultivate to
   account for their decisions whether or not to run for public office. I
   illuminate how these "deciding to run" narratives reflect racialized
   standards of femininity and how these discourses are mediated by the
   political context and by political and activist organizations.

AB To what extent do early intuitions about ownership depend on cultural
   and socio-economic circumstances? We investigated the question by
   testing reasoning about third party ownership conflicts in various
   groups of three- and five-year-old children (N = 176), growing up in
   seven highly contrasted social, economic, and cultural circumstances
   (urban rich, poor, very poor, rural poor, and traditional) spanning
   three continents. Each child was presented with a series of scripts
   involving two identical dolls fighting over an object of possession. The
   child had to decide who of the two dolls should own the object. Each
   script enacted various potential reasons for attributing ownership:
   creation, familiarity, first contact, equity, plus a control/neutral
   condition with no suggested reasons. Results show that across cultures,
   children are significantly more consistent and decisive in attributing
   ownership when one of the protagonists created the object. Development
   between three and five years is more or less pronounced depending on
   culture. The propensity to split the object in equal halves whenever
   possible was generally higher at certain locations (i.e., China) and
   quasi-inexistent in others (i.e., Vanuatu and street children of
   Recife). Overall, creation reasons appear to be more primordial and
   stable across cultures than familiarity, relative wealth or first
   contact. This trend does not correlate with the passing of false belief
   theory of mind. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) are well documented, and many researchers have proposed
   that biogeographical ancestry (BGA) may play a role in these
   disparities. However, studies examining the role of BGA on T2DM have
   produced mixed results to date. Therefore, the objective of this
   research was to quantify the contribution of BGA to racial/ethnic
   disparities in T2DM incidence controlling for the mediating influences
   of socioeconomic factors.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Boston Area Community Health Survey,
   a prospective cohort with approximately equal numbers of black,
   Hispanic, and white participants. We used 63 ancestry-informative
   markers to calculate the percentages of participants with West African
   and Native American ancestry. We used logistic regression with
   G-computation to analyze the contribution of BGA and socioeconomic
   factors to racial/ethnic disparities in T2DM incidence.
   Results: We found that socioeconomic factors accounted for 44.7% of the
   total effect of T2DM attributed to black race and 54.9% of the effect
   attributed to Hispanic ethnicity. We found that BGA had almost no direct
   association with T2DM and was almost entirely mediated by
   self-identified race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusions: It is likely that nongenetic factors, specifically
   socioeconomic factors, account for much of the reported racial/ethnic
   disparities in T2DM incidence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are prevalent among
   Black adults. Studies have demonstrated that functional social support
   buffers CVD risk. The objective of our study is to assess whether
   specific types of functional social support or their cumulative total
   buffers CVD risk factors among a convenience sample of Black adults, and
   whether these associations differ by sex or partner status.
   Design: Cross-sectional study using self-reported survey data.
   Setting: Large church in Houston, TX.
   Participants: A total of 1,381 Black adults reported their perceived
   social support using appraisal, belonging, and tangible subscales of the
   Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12. A cumulative score was created
   based on the three subscales. Participants also reported on a number of
   sociodemographic characteristics.
   Main Outcome Measures: Three self-reported CVD risk factors: diabetes,
   high blood pressure, and high cholesterol (yes vs no).
   Results: A series of multivariate logistic regressions controlling for
   sociodemographic characteristics were used to calculate adjusted odds
   ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CVD risk factors.
   Cumulative social support, rather than any specific type of social
   support, was significantly related to diabetes and high blood pressure.
   Higher cumulative social support was associated with lower odds of
   experiencing diabetes (aOR=.97, 95% CI=.94, .99) and high blood pressure
   (aOR=.98, 95% CI=.95, .99). Neither sex nor partner status moderated
   associations.
   Conclusion: In a high risk population for CVD, increasing all types of
   social support - appraisal, belonging, and tangible - might be useful in
   preventing or delaying the onset of CVD.

AB While the importance of ethnographic research for causal understanding
   is widely recognized, the logic of this argument has not been well
   articulated. The purpose of this paper is to specify the conditions
   under which direct field observations become essential for causal
   studies. It is argued in this paper that the concept of "human
   causation" is fundamental for understanding the causal relevance of
   ethnographic research. Specifically, ethnographic methods are most
   suited for observing conjunctures of action sequences in particular
   social settings. In causally fixed settings, ethnographers focus on the
   recurrent causal pathways leading to a predictable outcome; and in
   causally open settings, ethnographers study the critical junctures in
   and important conjunctures of contingent sequences of events that give
   rise to unpredictable outcomes. In both instances, the immersion of the
   researcher into the setting to observe the unfolding of the events being
   studied plays a key role in uncovering and understanding the underlying
   causal processes. The limitations of ethnographic methods for causal
   studies are also discussed in the paper.

AB Perceived descriptive norms are one of the strongest predictors of
   college drinking. Social Identity Theory posits that much of our
   identity is based on groups with which we affiliate. Prior research
   suggests that there is an association between perceived descriptive
   norms and drinking among those who identify more strongly with the
   normative referent group. However, no studies to date have examined how
   different facets of social identity affect the relationship between
   perceived descriptive norms and drinking. The purpose of this study was
   to examine whether the interaction between perceived descriptive norms
   and social identity on drinking varied as a function of different
   dimensions of social identity among college students. Participants were
   1095 college students from a large, public, southern university who
   completed an online survey about drinking behaviors and related
   attitudes. Drinks per week was examined as a function of norms, the
   Importance, Commitment, Deference, and Superiority subscales of the
   Measure of Identification with Groups, as well as the two-way
   interactions between each dimension of social identity and norms.
   Results indicated that norms were associated with drinking, but that
   this relationship varied as a function of identity dimension. The
   association between norms and drinking was stronger among those who
   viewed the university's student body as part of their own identity and
   were more committed to their fellow students, but weaker among those who
   reported greater deference to student leaders. This research suggests
   the importance of examining multiple dimensions of social identity in
   considering social influences on drinking. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research examining face-to-face status hierarchies suggests that
   individuals attain respect and admiration by engaging in behavior that
   influences others' judgments of their value to the group. Building on
   this research, we expected that high-status individuals would be less
   likely to engage in behaviors that violate group norms and expectations,
   relative to low-status individuals. Adolescent participants took part in
   an interaction in which they teased an opposite-gender friend (Study 1)
   or an experiment in which taunting or cheering expectations were
   manipulated (Study 2). Consistent with the hypothesis, high-status boys
   and girls engaged in teasing behaviors consistent with their gender
   roles, relative to their low status counterparts (Study 1). In Study 2,
   high-status boys engaged in more direct provocation and off-record
   commentary while taunting, and more affiliative behavior while cheering
   on their partner, relative to low-status boys. Discussion focused on how
   expectation-consistent actions help individuals maintain elevated

AB To Malthus, rapid human population growth-so evident in 18th Century
   Europe-was obviously unsustainable. In his Essay on the Principle of
   Population, Malthus cogently argued that environmental and socioeconomic
   constraints on population rise were inevitable. Yet, he penned his essay
   on the eve of the global census size reaching one billion, as nearly two
   centuries of super-exponential increase were taking off. Introducing a
   novel extension of J. E. Cohen's hallmark coupled difference equation
   model of human population dynamics and carrying capacity, this article
   examines just how elastic population growth limits may be in response to
   demographic change. The revised model involves a simple formalization of
   how consumption costs influence carrying capacity elasticity over time.
   Recognizing that complex social resource-extraction networks support
   ongoing consumption-based investment in family formation and
   intergenerational resource transfers, it is important to consider how
   consumption has impacted the human environment and demography-especially
   as global population has become very large. Sensitivity analysis of the
   consumption-cost model's fit to historical population estimates, modern
   census data, and 21st Century demographic projections supports a
   critical conclusion. The recent population explosion was systemically
   determined by long-term, distinctly pre-industrial cultural evolution.
   It is suggested that modern globalizing transitions in technology,
   susceptibility to infectious disease, information flows and
   accumulation, and economic complexity were endogenous products of much
   earlier biocultural evolution of family formation's embeddedness in
   larger, hierarchically self-organizing cultural systems, which could
   potentially support high population elasticity of carrying capacity.
   Modern super-exponential population growth cannot be considered
   separately from long-term change in the multi-scalar political economy
   that connects family formation and intergenerational resource transfers
   to wider institutions and social networks.

AB Existing research on the adverse health effects of exposure to pollution
   has devoted relatively little attention to the potential impact of
   ambient air pollution on cognitive function in older adults. We examined
   the cross-sectional association between residential concentrations of
   particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m or less (PM2.5)
   and cognitive function in older adults. Using hierarchical linear
   modeling, we analyzed data from the 2004 Health and Retirement Study, a
   large, nationally representative sample of US adults aged 50 years or
   older. We linked participant data with 2000 US Census tract data and
   2004 census tract-level annual average PM2.5 concentrations. Older
   adults living in areas with higher PM2.5 concentrations had worse
   cognitive function (beta = -0.26, 95% confidence interval: -0.47, -0.05)
   even after adjustment for community-and individual-level social and
   economic characteristics. Results suggest that the association is
   strongest for the episodic memory component of cognitive function. This
   study adds to a growing body of research highlighting the importance of
   air pollution to cognitive function in older adults. Improving air
   quality in large metropolitan areas, where much of the aging US
   population resides, may be an important mechanism for reducing
   age-related cognitive decline.

   paper first summarizes unique features of the gift record data that
   circumvent five prevailing sampling and measurement issues in the

   both the individual level and the dyadic link level using previous data
   sources. We then document our research project in rural China that
   implements a multiple wave census-type household survey and a long-term
   gift record collection. The pattern of gift-giving in major household
   social events and its recent escalation is analyzed. There are
   significantly positive correlations between gift network centrality and
   various forms of informal insurance. Finally, economic inequality and

AB Children of low socioeconomic status (SES) are at elevated risk for
   health problems across the lifespan. Observational studies suggest that
   nurturant parenting might offset some of these health risks, but their
   design precludes inferences about causal direction and clinical utility.
   Here we ask whether a psychosocial intervention, focused improving
   parenting, strengthening family relationships, and building youth
   competencies, can reduce inflammation in low-SES, African Americans from
   the rural South. The trial involved 272 mothers and their 11-y-old
   children from rural Georgia, half of whose annual household incomes were
   below the federal poverty line. Families were randomly assigned to a
   7-wk psychosocial intervention or to a control condition. When youth
   reached age 19, peripheral blood was collected to quantify six cytokines
   that orchestrate inflammation, the dysregulation of which contributes to
   many of the health problems known to pattern by SES. Youth who
   participated in the intervention had significantly less inflammation on
   all six indicators relative to controls (all P values < 0.001; effect
   sizes in Cohen's d units ranged from -0.69 to -0.91). Mediation analyses
   suggested that improved parenting was partially responsible for the
   intervention's benefits. Inflammation was lowest among youth who
   received more nurturant-involved parenting, and less harsh-inconsistent
   parenting, as a consequence of the intervention. These findings have
   theoretical implications for research on resilience to adversity and the
   early origins of disease. If substantiated, they may also highlight a
   strategy for practitioners and policymakers to use in ameliorating
   social and racial health disparities.

AB Background: The practice of sharing sanitation facilities does not meet
   the current World Health Organization/UNICEF definition for what is
   considered improved sanitation. Recommendations have been made to
   categorize shared sanitation as improved sanitation if security, user
   access, and other conditions can be assured, yet limited data exist on
   user preferences with respect to shared facilities.
   Objective: This study analyzed user perceptions of shared sanitation
   facilities in rural households in East Java, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.
   Methods: Cross-sectional studies of 2,087 households in East Java and
   3,000 households in Bangladesh were conducted using questionnaires and
   observational methods. Relative risks were calculated to analyze
   associations between sanitation access and user perceptions of
   satisfaction, cleanliness, and safety.
   Results: In East Java, 82.4% of households with private improved
   sanitation facilities reported feeling satisfied with their place of
   defecation compared to 68.3% of households with shared improved
   facilities [RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.09, 1.31]. In Bangladesh, 87.7% of
   households with private improved facilities reported feeling satisfied
   compared to 74.5% of households with shared improved facilities [RR
   1.15, 95% CI 1.10, 1.20]. In East Java, 79.5% of households who reported
   a clean latrine also reported feeling satisfied with their place of
   defecation; only 38.9% of households who reported a dirty latrine also
   reported feeling satisfied [RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.45, 2.08].
   Conclusion: Simple distinctions between improved and unimproved
   sanitation facilities tend to misrepresent the variability observed
   among households sharing sanitation facilities. Our results suggest that
   private improved sanitation is consistently preferred over any other
   sanitation option. An increased number of users appeared to negatively
   affect toilet cleanliness, and lower levels of cleanliness were
   associated with lower levels of satisfaction. However, when sanitation
   facilities were clean and shared by a limited number of households,
   users of shared facilities often reported feeling both satisfied and
   safe.

   variables identified in bivariate analyses were included in multivariate
   analyses predicting >= 90% adherence. Higher annual household income (p
   = .004) and religious affiliation (p = .031) were predictive of greater
   adherence. Participants who said their beliefs gave meaning to their
   lives, made them feel they had a connection with a higher being, were
   influential during their recovery, and helped them feel connected to
   humanity were more likely to be >= 90% adherent (p < .015). Conversely,
   participants who believed God created all things in the universe; that
   God will not turn his back on them; and those who regularly attended
   religious services, participated in religious rituals, and prayed and
   meditated to get in touch with God were less likely to be >= 90%
   adherent (p <= .025). Results indicate that a patient's religious
   beliefs and practices may predict medication adherence. Interventions
   should be designed to emphasize the use of positive religious coping
   strategies and address the adverse implications of religious fatalism.

AB Universal coverage of essential interventions would reduce neonatal
   deaths by an estimated 71%, benefit women and children after the first
   month, and reduce stillbirths. However, the packages with the greatest
   effect (care around birth, care of small and ill newborn babies), have
   low and inequitable coverage and are the most sensitive markers of
   health system function. In eight of the 13 countries with the most
   neonatal deaths (55% worldwide), we undertook a systematic assessment of
   bottlenecks to essential maternal and newborn health care, involving
   more than 600 experts. Of 2465 bottlenecks identified, common
   constraints were found in all high-burden countries, notably regarding
   the health workforce, financing, and service delivery. However,
   bottlenecks for specific interventions might differ across similar
   health systems. For example, the implementation of kangaroo mother care
   was noted as challenging in the four Asian country workshops, but was
   regarded as a feasible aspect of preterm care by respondents in the four
   African countries. If all high-burden countries achieved the neonatal
   mortality rates of their region's fastest progressing countries, then
   the mortality goal of ten or fewer per 1000 livebirths by 2035
   recommended in this Series and the Every Newborn Action Plan would be
   exceeded. We therefore examined fast progressing countries to identify
   strategies to reduce neonatal mortality. We identified several key
   factors: (1) workforce planning to increase numbers and upgrade specific
   skills for care at birth and of small and ill newborn babies, task
   sharing, incentives for rural health workers; (2) financial protection
   measures, such as expansion of health insurance, conditional cash
   transfers, and performance-based financing; and (3) dynamic leadership
   including innovation and community empowerment. Adapting from the 2005
   Lancet Series on neonatal survival and drawing on this Every Newborn
   Series, we propose a country-led, data-driven process to sharpen
   national health plans, seize opportunities to address the quality gap
   for care at birth and care of small and ill newborn babies, and
   systematically scale up care to reach every mother and newborn baby,
   particularly the poorest.

AB Objectives Community violence is associated with health-compromising
   behaviors (HCBs) and adverse general health and pregnancy outcomes. It
   is unknown whether these effects persist after adjusting for health
   behaviors.
   Methods Retrospective cohort study of 36,637 pregnancies, 2005-2009,
   using birth certificate/hospital discharge databases. Community violence
   rate = (nonaccidental injuries/total injuries) x 100%. ZIP codes were
   categorized into levels (CVL) by quartiles (lowest, 1, to highest, 4).
   Outcomes included HCBs (tobacco, alcohol, or drugs), fetal death,
   preterm birth, and infant small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Covariates
   included HCBs and maternal characteristics.
   Results The CVL median (interquartile range) was 5.5% (3.8%-8.8%). As
   CVL increased, rates of HCBs (8% vs 13% vs 14% vs 16%), fetal death (4
   vs 5 vs 6 vs 8/1000 pregnancies), preterm birth (8% vs 9% vs 11% vs
   13%), and infant SGA (8% vs 10% vs 13% vs 16%) increased. The odds of
   preterm birth (CVL1 = 1.00 [reference] vs CVL2 = 1.00 [0.88-1.14] vs
   CVL3 = 1.10 [0.96-1.26] vs CVL4 = 1.25 [1.09-1.42]) and infant SGA (CVL2
   = 1.03 [0.93-1.17] vs CVL3 = 1.15 [1.01-1.30] vs CVL4 = 1.21
   [1.07-1.38]) increased, after controlling for HCB.
   Conclusions CVL is associated with fetal death, preterm birth, and
   infant SGA, independent of HCB. These findings may support the role of
   violence-reduction programs in improving pregnancy health behaviors and
   outcomes.

AB This paper is based on conversations that took place during a scholarly
   reading group on the sociology of emotions. The members of the group
   shared an interest in the body, movement, and culture, but our academic
   and 'athletic' backgrounds were quite varied. Our diverse socio-cultural
   understandings of emotions were complicated by our own (emotional)
   experiences of physical (in)activity, thus conversations cut a wide and
   varied path. One idea, however, continued to resonate throughout our
   discussions; we found the experiential, theoretical, and methodological
   notion of messiness to hold great possibility as it allowed us to avoid
   the urge to reduce diverse experiences to a singular voice (Christians,
   2011; Cornforth et al,, 2012; Ellingson, 2009; Noble, 2009).
   Consequently, our project here is twofold. First, we experiment with
   communal writing as a method for undertaking a study of physical
   activity. Second, rather than any one perspective taking precedence we
   use this practice as a way to demonstrate the potential of embracing
   messiness as a collaborative ethical and theoretical method for
   understanding the complexities of emotions in relation to (in)active
   bodies. Specifically, using a variety of disciplinary and theoretical
   lenses we explore physical (in)activity in relation to pain/pleasure,
   and the gaze and performance. The result is a conversation made up of
   traditional and non-traditional approaches to academic writing that work
   to reconfigure and to challenge traditional dichotomies and hierarchical
   understandings of the active body, understandings that potentially
   over-simplify and close-down our emotional experiences of physical
   (in)activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the rapidly evolving world of social media, social networks, mobile
   applications and citizen science, online communities can develop
   organically and separately from larger or more established
   organisations. The One Health online community is experiencing expansion
   from both the bottom up and the top down. In this paper, the authors
   review social media's strengths and weaknesses, earlier work examining
   Internet resources for One Health, the current state of One Health in
   social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) and online social
   networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn and ResearchGate), as well as social
   media in One Health-related citizen science projects. While One Health
   has a fairly strong presence on websites, its social media presence is
   more limited and has an uneven geographic distribution. In work
   following the Stone Mountain Meeting,the One Health Global Network Task
   Force Report recommended the creation of an online community of
   practice. Professional social networks as well as the strategic use of
   social media should be employed in this effort. Finally, One
   Health-related research projects using volunteers (citizen science)
   often use social media to enhance their recruitment. Including these
   researchers in a community of practitioners would take full advantage of
   their existing social media presence. In conclusion, the interactive
   nature of social media, combined with increasing global Internet access,
   provides the One Health community with opportunities to meaningfully
   expand their community and promote their message.

AB Exceptional cases are at odds with the typical: they stand out as
   bizarre and rare. What then could justify their systematic analysis?
   Elaborating the analytical distinction between anomalies, exceptions and
   outliers, this paper outlines three potential epistemic contributions of
   exceptional cases. First, exceptional cases reveal the limits of
   standard classification categories. In so doing, they problematize usual
   classificatory grids. Their input is critical. Second, exceptional cases
   point to new classes of objects. They acquire paradigmatic status when
   they exemplify the characteristic features of these new classes with
   utmost clarity. Third, exceptional cases magnify relational patterns
   that in more mundane contexts lack visibility. Here their contribution
   is heuristic. These three contributions become possible when we put at
   bay normative expectations of what should happen, and specify cases by
   reference to an analytical space of constitutive dimensions. To
   underscore the general significance of these observations, I draw on
   examples borrowed from different quarters of the social sciences: the
   sociology of organizations, ethnomethodology, comparative historical
   sociology and the history of science.

AB The devastating eruptions of Mount Tungurahua in the Ecuadorian
   highlands in 1999 and 2006 left many communities struggling to rebuild
   their homes and others permanently displaced to settlements built by
   state and nongovernmental organizations. For several years afterward,
   households diversified their economic strategies to compensate for
   losses, communities organized to promote local development, and the
   state and nongovernmental organizations sponsored many economic recovery
   programs in the affected communities. Our study examined the ways in
   which gender and gender roles were associated with different levels and
   paths of access to scarce resources in these communities. Specifically,
   this article contrasts the experiences of men and women in accessing
   household necessities and project assistance through formal institutions
   and informal networks. We found that women and men used different types
   of informal social support networks, with men receiving significantly
   more material, emotional, and informational support than women. We also
   found that men and women experienced different challenges and advantages
   when pursuing support through local and extralocal institutions and that
   these institutions often coordinated in ways that reified their biases.
   We present a methodology that is replicable in a wide variety of
   disaster, resettlement, and development settings, and we advocate an
   inductive, evidence-based approach to policy, built upon an
   understanding of local gender, class, and ethnic dynamics affecting
   access to formal and informal resources. This evidence should be used to
   build more robust local institutions that can resist wider social and
   cultural pressures for male dominance and gendered exclusion.

AB Objectives. We examined the coevolution of adolescent friendships and
   peer influences with respect to their risk behaviors and social
   networking site use.
   Methods. Investigators of the Social Network Study collected
   longitudinal data during fall 2010 and spring 2011 from 10th-grade
   students in 5 Southern California high schools (n = 1434). We used
   meta-analyses of stochastic actor-based models to estimate changes in
   friendship ties and risk behaviors and the effects of Facebook and
   MySpace use.
   Results. Significant shifts in adolescent smoking and drinking occurred
   despite little change in overall prevalence rates. Students with higher
   levels of alcohol use were more likely to send and receive friendship
   nominations and become friends with other drinkers. They were also more
   likely to increase alcohol use if their friends drank more. Adolescents
   selected friends with similar Facebook and MySpace use habits. Exposure
   to friends' risky online pictures increased smoking behaviors but had no
   significant effects on alcohol use.
   Conclusions. Our findings support a greater focus on friendship
   selection mechanisms in school-based alcohol use interventions. Social
   media platforms may help identify at-risk adolescent groups and foster
   positive norms about risk behaviors.

AB Objectives. We examined socioeconomic disparities in tobacco dependence
   treatment outcomes from a free, proactive telephone counseling quitline.
   Methods. We delivered cognitive-behavioral treatment and nicotine
   patches to 6626 smokers and examined socioeconomic differences in
   demographic, clinical, environmental, and treatment use factors. We used
   logistic regressions and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to model
   abstinence and account for socioeconomic differences in the models.
   Results. The odds of achieving long-term abstinence differed by
   socioeconomic status (SES). In the GEE model, the odds of abstinence for
   the highest SES participants were 1.75 times those of the lowest SES
   participants. Logistic regression models revealed no treatment outcome
   disparity at the end of treatment, but significant disparities 3 and 6
   months after treatment.
   Conclusions. Although quitlines often increase access to treatment for
   some lower SES smokers, significant socioeconomic disparities in
   treatment outcomes raise questions about whether current approaches are
   contributing to tobacco-related socioeconomic health disparities.
   Strategies to improve treatment outcomes for lower SES smokers might
   include novel methods to address multiple factors associated with
   socioeconomic disparities.

AB Purpose: This study was designed to assess perceptions of untreated
   hypospadias and quality of life in culturally disparate low or middle
   income countries, to highlight the demographic and care differences of
   patient groups treated for hypospadias in the surgical workshop context,
   and to evaluate the long-term outcomes achieved by these workshop
   groups.
   Materials and Methods: Family member perceptions of hypospadias,
   perioperative process measures and urethrocutaneous fistula rates were
   compared between 60 patients from Vietnam and Senegal treated for
   hypospadias through training workshops by local surgeons and pediatric
   urologists from the U. S. between 2009 and 2012, of whom approximately
   42% had previously undergone repair attempts.
   Results: More than 90% of respondents surveyed believed that untreated
   hypospadias would affect the future of their child at least to some
   degree. Patient cohorts between the 2 sites differed from each other and
   published high income country cohorts regarding age, weight for age and
   frequency of reoperation. Telephone based outcomes assessment achieved
   an 80% response rate. Urethrocutaneous fistula was reported in 39% and
   47% of patients in Vietnam and Senegal, respectively.
   Conclusions: Family members perceived that the social consequences of
   untreated hypospadias would be severe. Relative to patient cohorts
   reported in practices of high income countries, our patients were older,
   presented with more severe defects, required more reoperations and were
   often undernourished. Urethrocutaneous fistula rates were higher in
   cohorts from low or middle income countries relative to published rates
   for cohorts from high income countries. Our study suggests that outcomes
   measurement is a feasible and essential component of ethical
   international health care delivery and improvement.

AB Objective: To examine the association of patient-and medication-related
   factors with postdischarge medication errors.
   Patients and Methods: The Vanderbilt Inpatient Cohort Study includes
   adults hospitalized with acute coronary syndromes and/or acute
   decompensated heart failure. We measured health literacy, subjective
   numeracy, marital status, cognition, social support, educational
   attainment, income, depression, global health status, and medication
   adherence in patients enrolled from October 1, 2011, through August 31,
   2012. We used binomial logistic regression to determine predictors of
   discordance between the discharge medication list and the
   patient-reported list during postdischarge medication review.
   Results: Among 471 patients (mean age, 59 years), the mean total number
   of medications reported was 12, and 79 patients (16.8%) had inadequate
   or marginal health literacy. A total of 242 patients (51.4%) were taking
   1 or more discordant medication (ie, appeared on either the discharge
   list or patient-reported list but not both), 129 (27.4%) failed to
   report a medication on their discharge list, and 168 (35.7%) reported a
   medication not on their discharge list. In addition, 279 participants
   (59.2%) had a misunderstanding in indication, dose, or frequency in a
   cardiac medication. In multivariable analyses, higher subjective
   numeracy (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98) was associated with
   lower odds of having discordant medications. For cardiac medications,
   participants with higher health literacy (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95),
   with higher subjective numeracy (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.95), and who
   were female (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46-0.78) had lower odds of
   misunderstandings in indication, dose, or frequency.
   Conclusion: Medication errors are present in approximately half of
   patients after hospital discharge and are more common among patients
   with lower numeracy or health literacy. (C) 2014 Mayo Foundation for

AB We examine the emergence and proliferation of payday lenders, fringe
   businesses that provide small short-term, but high-cost loans. We link
   the organizational dynamics of these businesses to two trends in
   consumer lending in the United States: the continuing consolidation of
   mainstream financial institutions; and the expansion of such
   institutions in the provision of financial services regarded as similar
   to payday loans. We explain the coexistence in mature industries of
   large-scale organizations in the market center and smaller specialists
   in the periphery by testing and extending the organizational model of
   resource partitioning. Our focus is on two under-examined aspects of the
   model: the dynamic underlying the partitioning process, and the
   conditions under which the market remains partitioned. The empirical
   analysis covers payday lenders, banks, and credit unions operating in
   Wisconsin between 1994 and 2008.

AB Do historically contingent political accounts help explain the growth in
   family income inequality in the United States? We use time-series
   regressions based on 60 years to detect such relationships by assessing
   interactive associations between the neoliberal departure coincident
   with Ronald Reagan's election and the acceleration in inequality that
   began soon after Reagan took office. We find evidence for this and for a
   second contingent relationship: stronger unions could successfully
   resist policies that enhanced economic inequality only before Reagan's
   presidency and before the neoliberal anti-union administrations from
   both parties that followed Reagan. Politically inspired reductions in
   union membership, and labor's diminished political opportunities during
   and after Reagan's presidency, meant unions no longer could slow the
   growth in U.S. inequality. Coefficients on these two historically
   contingent interactions remain significant after many additional
   determinants are held constant. These findings indicate that political
   determinants should not be neglected when researchers investigate the
   determinants of U.S. inequality.

AB This paper analyses the problem of the asocial view of the market at the
   theoretical core of contemporary economic sociology. Despite much
   emphasis on the apparent interpenetration of society and the economy,
   contemporary economic sociology is rooted in an analytical distinction
   between the two spheres. The implicit reliance on the neoclassical
   economic conception of the market helps to explain why the new economic
   sociology' often collapses into disequilibrium economics, where
   disequilibrium becomes the central but unstated prediction of a good
   deal of the work in the paradigm. Using a sample of contributions from
   the field, I demonstrate that a strong tendency running through much of
   the new economic sociology tends to understand society as a
   fundamentally distortionary force. To resolve this problem, I argue that
   an independent field of economic sociology necessitates a distinction
   between social relationships and social relations.

AB Very effective combination chemotherapy using novel agents has become
   available in multiple myeloma (MM). Its impact on the use of high-dose
   chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
   (AHCT) as part of initial therapy is unknown. Using the National Cancer
   Data Base, we studied the rate of upfront AHCT use among 137,409 newly
   diagnosed MM patients from 1998 to 2010 in the United States and
   determined whether disparity exists among various sociodemographic as
   well as geographic subgroups. Overall, 12,378 (9.0%) patients received
   AHCT as part of initial treatment. The use of upfront AHCT increased
   steadily from 5.2% in 1998 to 12.1% in 2010 (trend test, P < 0.001),
   with no sign of plateau. This was seen across all socio-geo-demographic
   subgroups except among patients treated in the Northeast where the rate
   fell from 8.7% in 1998 to 6.6% in 2010. In multivariable analysis,
   patients with the following characteristics were the least likely to
   receive AHCT (odds ratio): year of diagnosis from 1998 to 2003 before
   the era of novel agents (0.67), older age (0.35), Black race (0.58),
   Hispanic ethnicity (0.78), low level of education or annual household
   income (0.55), residence in a metro area (0.66), no or unknown medical
   insurance (0.30), treatment at a community cancer center (0.16), and
   treatment facility located in the Northeast region (0.54). Even after
   the introduction of novel agents, the rate of upfront AHCT in MM
   continues to increase annually. Significant disparities exist dependent
   on demographic, social, and geographic factors. (C) 2014 Wiley

AB Objective. Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pain may be
   attributed to peripheral inflammation or other causes, such as central
   pain mechanisms. The aim of this study was to use self-report measures
   and physical examination findings to identify clusters of RA patients
   who may have different causes of pain as well as different prognoses and
   treatment options.
   Methods. Data from 169 RA patients with pain scores of >0 (on a 10-point
   numeric rating scale) in the Brigham and Women's Hospital Rheumatoid
   Arthritis Sequential Study were analyzed. The patients completed
   questionnaires on pain, fatigue, and psychosocial factors. A
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering procedure with Ward's method was
   used to obtain subgroups. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to
   determine the contribution of each variable in a cluster. General linear
   regression models were used to examine differences in clinical
   characteristics across subgroups. Discriminant analyses were performed
   to determine coefficients for linear combinations of variables that
   assigned cluster membership to individual cases.
   Results. Three clusters best fit these data. Cluster 1 consisted of 89
   individuals with low levels of inflammation, pain, fatigue, and
   psychosocial distress. Cluster 2 consisted of 57 individuals with
   minimal inflammation but high levels of pain, fatigue, and psychosocial
   distress. Cluster 3 consisted of 23 individuals with active inflammatory
   disease, manifested by high swollen joint counts, high C-reactive
   protein levels, and high levels of pain and fatigue.
   Conclusion. Although most patients had low levels of inflammation, pain,
   and fatigue, 47.3% continued to report having moderate to high levels of
   pain and fatigue. Most of these patients had minimal signs of
   inflammation but high levels of fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and sleep
   disturbance, indicative of a chronic widespread pain syndrome.

AB This essay examines the long-standing Malagasy role of vadimbazaha, a
   word that literally means "the spouse of a European." Malagasy women
   have historically aspired to this role to gain status and wealth as
   intermediaries who link social networks, enabling the flow of wealth,
   people, and opportunities among families. Prior generations of
   vadimbazaha stayed in Madagascar. Today, in the context of economic
   hardship, women seek European men and migrate to France. Their goal is
   to use their position in France to build a life-sustaining flow of
   resources back to Madagascar. Women achieve this goal by managing their
   French husbands' and Malagasy kin's horizons of expectation with respect
   to race, gender, kinship, and reputation. Understanding vadimbazaha's
   economic practice requires attending to their ability to manage the
   meanings associated with their sexual, reproductive, and caring labor as
   much as the money they earn through low-wage labor and remittances.

AB This essay describes commonalities between religious and economic
   thought from an independent cultural perspective concentrating on
   sacrifice as practiced among Luo speakers and others in and around
   western Kenya. Several features appear in common, including concepts of
   flow, of giving to gain, and of surrogacy. As a response to crisis and
   to perennial uncertainties, animals have been offered to spirits and
   divinity for diverse motives and reasons and with varied evident
   functions. Some explicitly involve notions of conditional exchange, as
   in entrustment and indebtedness. These can be likened to gambling,
   investment, or insurance. But the acts that get called sacrifice have
   other dimensions, behavioral and emotional, that economic terms and
   quantification hardly reflect. More basically, sacrifice is a polythetic
   class (or family resemblance without a single core feature) and an idea
   without simple, direct translation into the Luo language. Nor, indeed,
   can economy or religion easily be translated either as naturally
   discrete domains. Under demographic and ideological pressure and amid
   concerns about rights, animal sacrifice has been supplemented and
   supplanted by other forms. Remaining unanswered questions concern the
   origins and future of sacrificial custom, the neural overlapping of
   religious and economic thought, and ways to balance human and animal
   sentiments.

AB Adverse social environments in early life are hypothesized to become
   biologically embedded during the first few years of life, with
   potentially far-reaching implications for health across the life course.
   Using prospective data from a subset of a US birth cohort, the
   Collaborative Perinatal Project, started in 1959-1966 (n = 566), we
   examined associations of social disadvantage assessed in childhood with
   cardiometabolic function and chronic disease status more than 40 years
   later (in 2005-2007). Social disadvantage was measured with an index
   that combined information on adverse socioeconomic and family stability
   factors experienced between birth and age 7 years. Cardiometabolic risk
   (CMR) was assessed by combining information from 8 CMR biomarkers; an
   index of chronic disease status was derived by assessing 8 chronic
   diseases. Poisson models were used to investigate associations between
   social disadvantage and CMR or chronic disease scores while adjusting
   for childhood covariates and potential pathway variables. A high level
   of social disadvantage was significantly associated with both higher CMR
   (incident rate ratio = 1.69, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 2.39) and
   with a higher number of chronic diseases (incident rate ratio = 1.39,
   95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.92) in minimally adjusted models.
   Associations with CMR persisted even after accounting for childhood and
   adult covariates.

AB Purpose: Understanding how to mitigate the present black white obesity
   disparity in the United States is a complex issue, stemming from a
   multitude of intertwined causes. An appropriate but underused approach
   to guiding policy approaches to this problem is to account for this
   complexity using simulation modeling.
   Methods: We explored the efficacy of a policy that improved the quality
   of neighborhood schools in reducing racial disparities in
   obesity-related behavior and the dependence of this effect on social
   network influence and norms. We used an empirically grounded agent-based
   model to generate simulation experiments. We used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
   design that represented the presence or absence of improved neighborhood
   school quality, the presence or absence of social influence, and the
   type of social norm (healthy or unhealthy). Analyses focused on time
   trends in sociodemographic variables and diet quality.
   Results: First, the quality of schools and social network influence had
   independent and interactive effects on diet behavior. Second, the black
   white disparity in diet behavior was considerably reduced under some
   conditions, but never completely eliminated. Third, the degree to which
   the disparity in diet behavior was reduced was a function of the type of
   social norm that was in place; the reduction was the smallest when the
   type of social norm was healthy.
   Conclusions: Improving school quality can reduce, but not eliminate
   racial disparities in obesity-related behavior, and the degree to which
   this is true depends partly on social network effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Many people view religion as a crucial source of morality. However, 6
   experiments (total N = 1,078) revealed that good deeds are perceived as
   less moral if they are performed for religious reasons. Religiously
   motivated acts were seen as less moral than the exact same acts
   performed for other reasons (Experiments 1-2 and 6). Religious
   motivations also reduced attributions of intention and responsibility
   (Experiments 3-6), an effect that fully mediated the effect of religious
   motivations on perceived morality (Experiment 6). The effects were not
   explained by different perceptions of motivation orientation (i. e.,
   intrinsic vs. extrinsic) across conditions (Experiment 4) and also were
   evident when religious upbringing led to an intuitive moral response
   (Experiment 5). Effects generalized across religious and nonreligious
   participants. When viewing a religiously motivated good deed, people
   infer that actually helping others is, in part, a side effect of other
   motivations rather than an end in itself. Thus, religiously motivated
   actors are seen as less responsible than secular actors for their good
   deeds, and their helping behavior is viewed as less moral than identical
   good deeds performed for either unclear or secular motivations.

   contest to experimentally compare interventions for reducing the

   interventions that were tested an average of 3.70 times each in 4
   studies (total N = 17,021), with rules for revising interventions
   between studies. Eight of 17 interventions were effective at reducing
   implicit preferences for Whites compared with Blacks, particularly ones
   that provided experience with counterstereotypical exemplars, used
   evaluative conditioning methods, and provided strategies to override
   biases. The other 9 interventions were ineffective, particularly ones
   that engaged participants with others' perspectives, asked participants
   to consider egalitarian values, or induced a positive emotion. The most
   potent interventions were ones that invoked high self-involvement or
   linked Black people with positivity and White people with negativity. No
   intervention consistently reduced explicit racial preferences.
   Furthermore, intervention effectiveness only weakly extended to implicit
   preferences for Asians and Hispanics.

AB BACKGROUND: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has the
   potential to reduce the number of uninsured children in the United
   States by as much as 40%. The extent to which immigrant families are
   aware of and interested in obtaining insurance for their children is
   unclear.
   METHODS: Data from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health
   were analyzed to examine differences by immigrant generational status in
   awareness of children's health insurance options. Adjusted odds ratios
   (AORs) were calculated for each outcome variable that showed statistical
   significance by generation status.
   RESULTS: Barriers to obtaining insurance for children in immigrant
   (first and second-generation) families include awareness of and
   experience with various health insurance options, perceived costs and
   benefits of insurance, structural/policy restrictions on eligibility,
   and lower likelihood of working in large organizations that offer
   employee insurance coverage. Although noncitizen immigrants are not
   covered by ACA insurance expansions, only 38% of first-generation
   families report being uninsured because of the inability to meet
   citizenship requirements. Most families in this sample also worked for
   employers with <50 employees, making them less likely to benefit from
   expansions in employer-based insurance. In multivariate analyses,
   third-generation families have increased odds of knowing how to enroll
   in health insurance (AOR 7.1 [3.6-13.0]) and knowing where to find
   insurance information (AOR 7.7 [3.8-15.4]) compared with
   first-generation families.
   CONCLUSIONS: ACA navigators and health services professionals should be
   aware of potential unique challenges to helping immigrant families
   negotiate Medicaid expansions and state and federal exchanges.

AB Although past research suggests that nonstandard parental work
   arrangements have negative implications for children, researchers
   typically assess the effects of maternal and paternal work schedules
   independently, and studies among older adolescents are rare. Combining
   insights from family sociology and criminology, we evaluate the effects
   of household work arrangements on family processes and delinquency among
   a national sample of 10- to 17-year-old children. We find that children
   from households where both parents work nonstandard hours report weaker
   levels of family bonding, which in turn is associated with greater
   delinquency. Children from single-mother households in which the mother
   works evening or night shifts report weaker levels of parent-child
   closeness and family bonding, which fully mediate the association with
   greater delinquency. We also find that select maternal nonstandard
   schedules in conjunction with paternal standard schedules are associated
   with lower delinquency among children. We derive implications for
   parental work schedules in households with adolescents.

   The study aimed to describe the percentage of current HCV infection,
   defined by HCV RNA positivity, among those tested positive for anti-HCV,
   and to examine characteristics of those with current infection.
   Using nationally representative data from the 2003 to 2010 National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, descriptive analyses and
   regressions were performed on data from anti-HCV-positive adults aged a
   parts per thousand yen40 years.
   Of 13,909 participants examined, 304 were anti-HCV-positive. Of these,
   238 or 75.3 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 67.5-81.8 %] had detectable
   viral RNA. The percentage of current, unresolved HCV infection was
   highest among non-Hispanic Blacks (91.1 %) and lowest among those with a
   college education (57.3 %). In multivariate analyses, non-Hispanic
   Blacks were more likely to have current HCV infection compared to
   non-Hispanic Whites (adjusted odds ratio 3.9, 95 % CI 1.6-9.2). Among
   persons with current HCV infection, most had elevated alanine
   aminotransferase (56.5 %) or aspartate aminotransferase (71.8 %) levels,
   but only 35.3 % reported having been diagnosed with any abnormal liver
   conditions. Excessive alcohol drinking was reported by 27.3 % of
   participants with current HCV infection.
   Among adults aged a parts per thousand yen40 years who had ever been
   infected with HCV, approximately three-quarters had current, unresolved
   HCV infection. Non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to have current
   infection than non-Hispanic Whites. The majority of those with current
   infection had abnormal liver function tests but had not received
   appropriate diagnoses. Many currently infected persons would benefit
   from lifestyle modifications to avoid the multiplicative effect of
   alcohol on HCV infection.

AB Background Social difficulties are closely linked to emotion
   dysregulation among children with typical development (TD). Children
   with developmental delays (DD) are at risk for poor social outcomes, but
   the relationship between social and emotional development within this
   population is not well understood. The current study examines the extent
   to which emotion dysregulation is related to social problems across
   middle childhood among children with TD or DD.
   Method Children with TD (IQ >= 85, n = 113) and children with DD (IQ <=
   75, n = 61) participated in a longitudinal study. Annual assessments
   were completed at ages 7, 8 and 9 years. At each assessment, mothers
   reported on children's emotion dysregulation, and both mothers and
   teachers reported on children's social difficulties.
   Results Children with DD had higher levels of emotion dysregulation and
   social problems at each age than those with TD. Emotion dysregulation
   and social problems were significantly positively correlated within both
   TD and DD groups using mother report of social problems, and within the
   TD group using teacher report of social problems. Among children with
   TD, emotion dysregulation consistently predicted change in social
   problems from one year to the next. However, among children with DD,
   emotion dysregulation offered no unique prediction value above and
   beyond current social problems.
   Conclusions Results suggested that the influence of emotion regulation
   abilities on social development may be a less salient pathway for
   children with DD. These children may have more influences, beyond
   emotion regulation, on their social behaviour, highlighting the
   importance of directly targeting social skill deficits among children
   with DD in order to ameliorate their social difficulties.

AB Objective: Religious involvement may help individuals with chronic
   medical illness cope better with physical disability and other life
   changes. We examine the relationships between religiosity, depressive
   symptoms, and positive emotions in persons with major depression and
   chronic illness.
   Methods: 129 persons who were at least somewhat religious/spiritual were
   recruited into a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
   religious vs. secular cognitive behavioral therapy. Reported here are
   the relationships at baseline between religious involvement and
   depressive symptoms, purpose in life, optimism, generosity, and
   gratefulness using standard measures.
   Results: Although religiosity was unrelated to depressive symptoms (F =
   0.96, p = 0.43) and did not buffer the disability-depression
   relationship (B = -1.56, SE 2.90, p = 0.59), strong relationships were
   found between religious indicators and greater purpose, optimism,
   generosity, and gratefulness (F = 7.08, p < 0.0001).
   Conclusions: Although unrelated to depressive symptoms in the setting of
   major depression and chronic medical illness, higher religious
   involvement is associated with positive emotions, a finding which may
   influence the course of depression over time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB The rapid development of social media and social networking sites in
   human society within the past decade has brought about an increased
   focus on the value of social relationships and being connected with
   others. Research suggests that we pursue socially valued or rewarding
   outcomes-approval, acceptance, reciprocity-as a means toward learning
   about others and fulfilling social needs of forming meaningful
   relationships. Focusing largely on recent advances in the human
   neuroimaging literature, we review findings highlighting the neural
   circuitry and processes that underlie pursuit of valued rewarding
   outcomes across non-social and social domains. We additionally discuss
   emerging human neuroimaging evidence supporting the idea that social
   rewards provide a gateway to establishing relationships and forming
   social networks. Characterizing the link between social network, brain,
   and behavior can potentially identify contributing factors to
   maladaptive influences on decision making within social situations.

AB By aggregating self-reported health statuses across millions of users,
   we seek to characterize the variety of health information discussed in
   Twitter. We describe a topic modeling framework for discovering health
   topics in Twitter, a social media website. This is an exploratory
   approach with the goal of understanding what health topics are commonly
   discussed in social media. This paper describes in detail a statistical
   topic model created for this purpose, the Ailment Topic Aspect Model
   (ATAM), as well as our system for filtering general Twitter data based
   on health keywords and supervised classification. We show how ATAM and
   other topic models can automatically infer health topics in 144 million
   Twitter messages from 2011 to 2013. ATAM discovered 13 coherent clusters
   of Twitter messages, some of which correlate with seasonal influenza (r
   = 0.689) and allergies (r = 0.810) temporal surveillance data, as well
   as exercise (r = .534) and obesity (r = -.631) related geographic survey
   data in the United States. These results demonstrate that it is possible
   to automatically discover topics that attain statistically significant
   correlations with ground truth data, despite using minimal human
   supervision and no historical data to train the model, in contrast to
   prior work. Additionally, these results demonstrate that a single
   general-purpose model can identify many different health topics in
   social media.

AB Drawing on ethnographic data about 15 juvenile offenders, collected

   introspectively reflect on the obstacles female ethnographers may
   encounter as they are trying to build rapport in a male-dominated
   setting. My narrative shows that the apprentice role, often adopted by
   male ethnographers of the American inner city, may be challenging for
   women to take on. Sexual advances and limited access to male-only
   spheres can significantly impede data collection. Yet, as I will
   demonstrate, women can alternatively rely on nonsexual, gender-specific
   roles, such that of a mother, not only to build rapport but also to
   broaden the perspective on field sites that have largely been explored
   from a male point of view.

   The purpose of this study is to examine the bidirectional relationship
   between social support and HIV stigma.
   We collected quarterly data from a cohort of 422 people living with HIV
   in Uganda, followed for a median of 2.1 years. We used multilevel
   regression to model the contemporaneous and 3-month-lagged associations
   between social support and both enacted and internalized stigma.
   Lagged enacted stigma was negatively correlated with emotional and
   instrumental social support, and lagged instrumental social support was
   negatively correlated with enacted stigma. Internalized stigma and
   emotional social support had reciprocal lagged associations.
   Interventions to reduce enacted stigma may strengthen social support for
   people living with HIV. Improved social support may in turn have a
   protective influence against future enacted and internalized stigma.

   To test self-efficacy and social support as mediators of Active Choices,
   a telephone-delivered physical activity intervention, and Active Living
   Every Day, a group-based physical activity intervention, implemented
   with midlife and older adults in community settings.
   MacKinnon's product of coefficients was used to examine social support
   and self-efficacy as mediators of change in physical activity. The
   proportion of the total effect mediated was calculated. Each model
   controlled for age, gender, race (white vs. non-white), body mass index
   (BMI), and education (high school graduate or less vs. at least some
   college).
   Increases in self-efficacy mediated increases in physical activity among
   Active Choices (n = 709) and Active Living Every Day (n = 849)
   participants. For Active Living Every Day, increases in social support
   also mediated increases in physical activity in single mediator models.
   Increasing self-efficacy and social support may help increase physical

   reactivation in children and adults. The present study examined whether
   different dimensions of childhood experience those pertaining to
   socioeconomic status (SES), physical environment, or family
   relationships relate differentially to CMV serostatus and reactivation
   during adulthood. Participants were 140 healthy adults, aged 18-55 years
   (41% female; 64% white). Childhood environments were assessed
   retrospectively and included family SES (parental housing tenure);
   childhood neighborhood environment (urban residence; physical
   conditions; safety; and social atmosphere); residential exposures
   (parental smoking and physical condition of home); and family
   relationships (parental divorce; warmth; harmony; dysfunction; parental
   bonding). Approximately 39% (n = 53) of participants were CMV+. In
   individual analyses controlling for age, sex, race, body mass, current
   adult SES and smoking status, fewer years of parental home ownership,
   having a parent who smoked, and living in a poorly maintained or unsafe
   neighborhood each were associated with greater odds of infection with
   CMV. By comparison, in individual analyses limited to CMV+ participants,
   less family warmth, less harmony, greater dysfunction, and suboptimal
   parental bonding each were related to higher antibody levels,
   independent of the aforementioned covariates. Findings were not
   attributable to current adult perceptions of psychological stress or
   relative levels of emotional stability. These results suggest that
   different types of childhood adversity may be associated with
   differential effects on CMV infection and latency. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Coastal and ocean planning comprises a broad field of practice. The
   goals, political processes, and approaches applied to planning
   initiatives may vary widely. However, all planning processes ultimately
   require adequate information on both the biophysical and social
   attributes of a planning region. In coastal and ocean planning practice,
   there are well-established methods to assess biophysical attributes;
   however, less is understood about the role and assessment of social
   data. We conducted the first global assessment of the incorporation of
   social data in coastal and ocean planning. We drew on a comprehensive
   review of planning initiatives and a survey of coastal and ocean
   practitioners. There was significantly more incorporation of social data
   in multiuse versus conservation-oriented planning. Practitioners engaged
   a wide range of social data, including governance, economic, and
   cultural attributes of planning regions and human impacts data. Less
   attention was given to ecosystem services and social-ecological
   linkages, both of which could improve coastal and ocean planning
   practice. Although practitioners recognize the value of social data,
   little funding is devoted to its collection and incorporation in plans.
   Increased capacity and sophistication in acquiring critical social and
   ecological data for planning is necessary to develop plans for more
   resilient coastal and ocean ecosystems and communities. We suggest that
   improving social data monitoring, and in particular spatial social data,
   to complement biophysical data, is necessary for providing holistic
   information for decision-support tools and other methods. Moving beyond
   people as impacts to people as beneficiaries, through ecosystem services
   assessments, holds much potential to better incorporate the tenets of
   ecosystem-based management into coastal and ocean planning by providing
   targets for linked biodiversity conservation and human welfare outcomes.

AB Shark finning is prohibited in many countries, but high prices for fins
   from the Asian market help maintain the international black-market and
   poaching. Traditional shark fin bans fail to recognize that the main
   driver of fin exploitation is linked to cultural beliefs about sharks in
   traditional Chinese culture. Therefore, shark finning should be
   addressed considering the social science approach as part of the fishery
   management scheme. This paper investigates the cultural significance of
   sharks in traditional Chinese and Hawaiian cultures, as valuable
   examples of how specific differences in cultural beliefs can drive
   individuals' attitudes toward the property of shark finning. We suggest
   the use of a social science approach that can be useful in the design of
   successful education campaigns to help change individuals' attitudes
   toward shark fin consumption. Finally, alternative management strategies
   for commercial fishers are provided to maintain self-sustainability of
   local coastal communities.

AB Ecosystem-based approaches to aquaculture integrate environmental
   concerns into planning. Social-ecological systems research can improve
   this approach by explicitly relating ecological and social dynamics of
   change at multiple scales. Doing so requires not only addressing direct
   effects of aquaculture but also considering indirect factors such as
   changes in livelihood strategies, governance dynamics, and power
   relations. We selected the community of Puerto Morazan, Nicaragua as a
   case study to demonstrate how the introduction of small-scale
   aquaculture radically transformed another key livelihood activity,
   lagoon shrimp fishing, and the effects that these changes have had on
   lagoons and the people that depend on them. We find that shrimp
   aquaculture played a key role in the collapse, in the 1990s, of an
   existing lagoon common-property management. Shrimp aquaculture-related
   capital enabled the adoption of a new fishing technique that not only
   degraded lagoons but also led to their gradual privatization. The
   existence of social ties between small-scale shrimp farmers and other
   community members mitigated the impacts of privatization, illustrating
   the importance of social capital. Since 2008, community members are
   seeking to communally manage the lagoons once again, in response to
   degraded environmental conditions and a consolidation of the shrimp
   industry at the expense of smaller actors. This research shows that
   shrimp aquaculture intersects with a complex set of drivers, affecting
   not only how ecosystems are managed but also how they are perceived and
   valued. Understanding these social-ecological dynamics is essential to
   implement realistic policies and management of mangrove ecosystems and
   address the needs of resource-dependent people.

AB Background IQ is thought to explain social gradients in mortality. IQ
   scores are based roughly equally on Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Performance IQ
   tests. VIQ tests, however, are suspected to confound true verbal ability
   with socioeconomic status (SES), raising the possibility that
   associations between SES and IQ scores might be overestimated. We
   examined, first, whether two of the most common types of VIQ tests
   exhibited differential item functioning (DIF) favouring persons of
   higher SES and/or majority race/ethnicity. Second, we assessed what
   impact, if any, this had on estimates of the extent to which VIQ
   explains social gradients in mortality.
   Methods Data from the General Social Survey-National Death Index cohort,
   a US population representative dataset, was used. Item response theory
   models queried social-factor DIF on the Thorndike Verbal Intelligence
   Scale and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, Revised Similarities test.
   Cox models examined mortality associations among SES and VIQ scores
   corrected and uncorrected for DIF.
   Results When uncorrected for DIF, VIQ was correlated with income,
   education, occupational prestige and race, with correlation coefficients
   ranging between vertical bar 0.12 vertical bar and vertical bar 0.43
   vertical bar. After correcting for DIF, correlations ranged from
   vertical bar 0.06 vertical bar to vertical bar 0.16 vertical bar.
   Uncorrected VIQ scores explained 11-40% of the Relative Index of
   Inequalities in mortality for social factors, while DIF-corrected scores
   explained 2-29%.
   Conclusions Two of the common forms of VIQ tests appear confound verbal
   intelligence with SES. Since these tests appear in most IQ batteries,
   circumspection may be warranted in estimating the amount of social
   inequalities in mortality attributable to IQ.

AB The emergent processes driving cultural history are a product of complex
   interactions among large numbers of individuals, determined by
   difficult-to-quantify historical conditions. To characterize these
   processes, we have reconstructed aggregate intellectual mobility over
   two millennia through the birth and death locations of more than 150,000
   notable individuals. The tools of network and complexity theory were
   then used to identify characteristic statistical patterns and determine
   the cultural and historical relevance of deviations. The resulting
   network of locations provides a macroscopic perspective of cultural
   history, which helps us to retrace cultural narratives of Europe and
   North America using large-scale visualization and quantitative dynamical
   tools and to derive historical trends of cultural centers beyond the
   scope of specific events or narrow time intervals.

AB One of the most important aspects of adolescent health is sexual and
   reproductive health (SRH). Currently, sexually transmitted infections
   (STIs) threaten the health of adolescents more than any other age group,
   and as many as 2.2 million adolescents are living with HIV.
   Understanding adolescents' SRH needs and how to invest in improving
   their health can be best addressed by knowing more about the contexts
   that increase their vulnerability to poor sexual health outcomes. Recent
   evidence has highlighted an increasingly marginalised segment of the
   adolescent population-and that is the urban poor adolescent population
   in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Using an urban health
   framework, this paper examines the contextual factors within an urban
   community that influence the SRH of adolescents in LMIC. Findings show
   that while there is substantial research that has explored factors
   within the social environment, there is limited research that has
   explored factors within the physical environment, as well as research
   that has specifically explored urban adolescents' use of SRH services
   and how such services can be best provided to this vulnerable
   population. This paper highlights the need for further research to
   understand the relationships between the urban poor environment and the
   SRH risks that adolescents face while living in such environments.

AB The past 200,000 years of human cultural evolution have witnessed the
   persistent establishment of behaviors involving innovation, planning
   depth, and abstract and symbolic thought, or what has been called
   "behavioral modernity." Demographic models based on increased human
   population density from the late Pleistocene onward have been
   increasingly invoked to understand the emergence of behavioral
   modernity. However, high levels of social tolerance, as seen among
   living humans, are a necessary prerequisite to life at higher population
   densities and to the kinds of cooperative cultural behaviors essential
   to these demographic models. Here we provide data on craniofacial
   feminization (reduction in average brow ridge projection and shortening
   of the upper facial skeleton) in Homo sapiens from the Middle
   Pleistocene to recent times. We argue that temporal changes in human
   craniofacial morphology reflect reductions in average androgen
   reactivity (lower levels of adult circulating testosterone or reduced
   androgen

AB Background: Whether and to what extent racial/ethnic disparities in
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis occur by
   kindergarten entry is currently unknown. We investigated risk factors
   associated with an ADHD diagnosis by kindergarten entry generally, and
   specifically whether racial/ethnic disparities in ADHD diagnosis occur
   by this very early time period. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from
   children enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort
   (ECLS-B), a large, nationally representative cohort of US children born
   in 2001. Data include information from birth certificates, parent and
   teacher questionnaires, and in-person developmental assessments
   conducted with children at intervals from 9 months through kindergarten
   entry. The analytic sample included children enrolled in the ECLS-B at
   the 60-month assessment (N = 6,550). Results: Black children in the
   United States were 70% (1 - OR of .30) less likely to receive an ADHD
   diagnosis than otherwise similar White children. Hispanic children
   initially appeared to be underdiagnosed for ADHD. However, their
   disparity with Whites became statistically nonsignificant after
   controlling for whether a language other than English was primarily
   spoken in the home. Analyses of kindergarten teacher-reported classroom
   behavior indicated that neither Black nor Hispanic children displayed
   less frequent ADHD-related behaviors than Whites. Conclusions: Although
   they are not less likely to display ADHD-related behaviors, children who
   are Black or being raised in households where non-English is primarily
   spoken are less likely than otherwise similar White children to be
   diagnosed with ADHD in the US.

AB Purpose: This study aimed to investigate gender, race/ethnicity,
   education, and income as moderators of relations of perceived
   neighborhood crime, pedestrian, and traffic safety to physical activity.
   Methods: Participants were from two samples: adults (N = 2199, age =
   25-65 yr) and older adults (N = 718, age = 66+ yr) from high-and
   low-walkable neighborhoods in the Washington, DC, and Seattle,
   Washington, areas. Neighborhood safety and transportation and leisure
   walking were assessed via survey, and moderate to vigorous physical
   activity was assessed using accelerometers. Sociodemographic moderators
   were investigated using interaction terms and follow-up within-group
   tests from mixed-effects regression models. Results: Overall direct
   effects of safety on physical activity were not found, with one
   exception. Seven interactions were found in each sample. Interactions
   were found for all physical activity outcomes, although total moderate
   to vigorous physical activity was involved in more interactions in
   adults than older adults. Half of the interactions revealed significant
   positive relations of pedestrian and traffic safety to physical activity
   in the more affluent/advantaged group (i.e., high education, high
   income, and non-Hispanic white) and null associations in the less
   affluent/advantaged group. Race/ethnicity was a moderator only in older
   adults. One-third of the interactions involved gender; half of these
   involved crime safety. Interactions involving crime safety showed
   nonsignificant positive trends in the more affluent/advantaged group and
   women and nonsignificant negative trends in the less affluent/advantaged
   group and men. Conclusions: Sociodemographic moderators of neighborhood
   safety explained some of the variation in adults' and older adults'
   physical activity. Patterns suggested positive associations between
   safety and physical activity in participants with more
   affluent/advantaged sociodemographic characteristics, although some
   patterns were inconsistent, particularly for gender. More refined
   conceptualizations and measures of safety are needed to understand if
   and how these constructs influence physical activity.

AB Current estimates of the incidence of congenital heart disease (CHD) are
   derived from small clinical studies and metaanalyses. For the true
   incidence of CHD in the United States of America to be estimated, a
   single large representative population must be analyzed. All the data in
   this study were derived from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database.
   The study determined the overall and lesion-specific incidences of CHD
   diagnoses among all birth hospitalizations in 2008, stratified by race,
   gender, socioeconomic status, and hospital geographic location. The
   study identified 13,093 CHD diagnoses among 1,204,887 birth
   hospitalizations, yielding an incidence of 10.8 per 1,000, with a
   predominance of mild lesions and septal defects. Atrial septal defect
   (ASD) and pulmonic stenosis were more common among females, whereas
   aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, hypoplastic left heart
   syndrome, and d-transposition of great arteries were more common among
   males. No racial difference was observed in the overall CHD incidence.
   However, isolated patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal
   defects (VSDs) were more common among Caucasians, whereas ASDs were more
   common among Hispanics. The incidences of CHD diagnoses were similar for
   all socioeconomic classes except the lowest socioeconomic class, which
   had a significantly lower CHD incidence. There was no geographic or
   seasonal variation in CHD incidence. This study demonstrated the
   incidence of echocardiographically confirmed CHD diagnosis to be 10.8
   per 1,000 live births, marked by a high proportion of mild cardiac
   lesions and isolated PDAs. The high incidence of isolated PDAs in this
   study may be explained by the inclusion of only CHD diagnoses during
   birth hospitalization.

AB Objective. To determine whether racial and ethnic disparities in
   cholesterol screening persist after controlling for socioeconomic
   status, access to care and language.
   Methods. Data were obtained from the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System for men aged 35 and older and women aged 45 and
   older in accordance with the United States Preventive Services Task
   Force guidelines. Self-reported cholesterol screening data are presented
   for 389,039 respondents reflecting over 141 million people. Sequential
   logistic regression models of the likelihood of never having been
   screened are presented adjusted for demographic characteristics, health
   status, behavioral risk factors, socioeconomic status, health care
   access, and questionnaire language.
   Results. A total of 9.1% of respondents, reflecting almost 13 million
   individuals, reported never having been screened. After adjustment for
   socioeconomic status, health care access and Spanish language,
   disparities between whites and Blacks and Hispanics, but not Asians and
   Pacific Islanders, were eliminated.
   Conclusions. Lower socioeconomic status, lack of healthcare access and
   language barriers explained most of the racial and ethnic disparities in
   cholesterol screening. Expanding insurance coverage, simplifying cardiac
   risk assessment and improving access to culturally and linguistically
   appropriate care hold the greatest promise for improving cardiovascular
   disease screening and treatment for vulnerable populations. (C) 2014

AB A wide spectrum and large number of children's toys and toy jewelry
   items were purchased from both bargain and retail vendors and analyzed
   for arsenic, cadmium, and lead metal content using multiple analytical
   techniques, including flame and furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy
   as well as X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. Particularly dangerous for
   young children, metal concentrations in toys/toy jewelry were assessed
   for compliance with current Consumer Safety Product Commission (CPSC)
   regulations (F963-11). A conservative metric involving multiple
   analytical techniques was used to categorize compliance: one technique
   confirmation of metal in excess of CPSC limits indicated a "suspect"
   item while confirmation on two different techniques warranted a
   non-compliant designation. Sample matrix-based standard addition
   provided additional confirmation of non-compliant and suspect products.
   Results suggest that origin of purchase, rather than cost, is a
   significant factor in the risk assessment of these materials with 57% of
   toys/toy jewelry items from bargain stores non-compliant or suspect
   compared to only 15% from retail outlets and 13% if only low cost items
   from the retail stores are compared. While jewelry was found to be the
   most problematic product (73% of non-compliant/suspect samples), lead
   (45%) and arsenic (76%) were the most dominant toxins found in
   non-compliant/suspect samples. Using the greater Richmond area as a
   model, the discrepancy between bargain and retail children's products,
   along with growing numbers of bargain stores in low-income and urban
   areas, exemplifies an emerging socioeconomic public health issue. (C)

AB Background: Adult alcohol consumption is influenced by peer consumption,
   but whether peer drinking is associated with first-onset alcohol
   dependence (AD) in adults after age 30 is unknown.
   Methods: 703 adult participants in the St. Louis Epidemiologic Catchment
   Area Survey (ECA) with no prior history of AD, but with high risk based
   on previously reported drinking or family history, were re-interviewed
   11 years after the last ECA assessment to detect new cases of AD (age at
   follow-up: M(S.D.) = 42.9 (8.2)). Incident AD during the assessment
   interval was examined in relation to drinking patterns in the social
   network and history of alcohol problems in parents.
   Results: Fifteen percent of the sample had a first-onset of AD; another
   19.5% never developed AD but were high-risk drinkers at follow-up. Of
   those who developed AD, 32.1% were remitted and 67.9% were unremitted
   (current AD) or unstably remitted (asymptomatic high-risk drinkers).
   Compared to abstinent or low-risk drinkers who did not develop AD,
   high-risk drinkers with no AD and unremitted/unstably remitted
   individuals were 4 times as likely to report moderate drinkers in their
   networks and remitted individuals were nearly 3 times as likely to
   report network members in recovery from alcohol problems. Associations
   of social network drinking with remitted and current AD were similar in
   strength to those of parental alcohol problems.
   Conclusions: Social network drinking patterns are associated with
   high-risk drinking and with the development of incident AD in adults,
   with effects equal to that of alcohol problems in both parents. (C) 2014

AB It has recently been discovered that the beta blocker drug, propranolol,
   can potentially reduce implicit racial bias among its users. By acting
   upon the affective conditions associated with implicit racial bias
   functioning at the non-conscious and pre-conscious levels, researchers
   have expressed excitement about the potential of propranolol and similar
   drugs to decrease implicit racial attitudes, and, thus, potentially
   decrease racism. This study and others like it not only provide
   indications of an affective component to modern-day racism, but, more
   importantly, an epistemological shift in the meaning of racism within
   academia from a social and cultural problem to a medical problem. In
   this article, we examine this shift in academic discourse towards a
   pathologization of racism and the implications of this on the

AB Night eating is a complex behavior associated with disruptions in
   eating, sleep, and mood regulation. While night eating has been
   associated with alterations in neuroendocrine functioning, night eating
   and Night Eating Syndrome (NES) are not well understood in patients with
   prevalent metabolic conditions, such as diabetes. In this study, 194
   adults with Type 2 diabetes completed questionnaires assessing night
   eating symptoms as well as eating, sleep, and depressive symptoms.
   Glycemic control data, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), were
   gathered from patient medical charts. Results indicated that 7% of
   participants met criteria for NES. Increased symptoms of night eating
   were associated with poorer glycemic control and disruptions in eating,
   sleep, and mood, including significantly increased likelihood of having
   HbA1c levels >7% and endorsing clinical levels of depressive symptoms.
   Increasing understanding of the relationship between night eating and
   metabolic and psychosocial functioning in patients with diabetes may
   provide new avenues for treatment of these patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB To combat the obesity epidemic, interventions and treatments often
   recommend low-calorie dieting. Calorie restriction (CR) as a weight
   intervention, however, is often unsuccessful, as most people cannot
   sustain the behavior. Yet one small group has maintained extreme CR over
   years - members of the CR Society and followers of The CR Way. This
   study examined stable psychosocial characteristics of these individuals
   to identify traits that may promote success at long-term CR. In 65
   participants, we measured diet, eating behaviors, and personality traits
   comparing calorie restrictors with two age-, gender-, ethnicity-, and
   education-matched comparison groups (normal weight and
   overweight/obese). We first tested whether the CR group restricted
   calories without indications of eating disorder pathology, and second,
   what crystallized psychosocial characteristics set them apart from their
   nonrestricting comparisons. Results indicated the CR group averaged 10
   years of CR but scored lower than comparison groups on measures of
   disordered eating (p < .001) and psychopathology (p < .001).
   Particularly against overweight/obese participants, CR participants
   scored lower on neuroticism (p < .04) and hostility (p < .01), and were
   stronger in future time orientation (p < .05). Overall, CR profiles
   reflected high self-control and well being, except for having few close
   relationships. This study suggests a potential predisposition for
   successful long-term CR without disordered eating. Since modifying trait
   factors may be unrealistic, there may be psychosocial boundaries to the
   capacity for sustaining CR. Paralleling a movement toward personalized
   medicine, this study points toward a personalized behavioral medicine
   model in behavioral nutrition and treatment of overweight/obesity. (C)

AB Although substance abuse treatment has been considerably scaled up in
   China, impediments to accessing these services remain among drug users.
   The authors examine the primary psychosocial barriers to drug treatment
   in this population and evaluate factors associated with these barriers.
   Barriers to accessing drug treatment were measured using the Barriers to
   Treatment Inventory (BTI). A Structural Equation Model was used to
   examine whether the internal barriers were associated with treatment
   history and frequent methamphetamine use as well as how demographic
   characteristics influence such barriers. We found four primary factors
   of internal barriers to drug treatment-absence of problem, negative
   social support, fear of treatment, and privacy concerns - to fit well.
   Demographic factors, notably age and employment status, indirectly
   influence barriers to treatment via other factors. Frequency of
   methamphetamine use and drug treatment history are directly associated
   with the absence of problem and negative social support dimensions of
   the BTI, and it is through these pathways that demographic factors such
   as age and employment status shape barriers to treatment. The findings
   indicate that perceived absence of a problem and negative social support
   are the barriers most influenced by the personal domains of Chinese drug
   users' lives. Efforts to engage drug users in China about drug treatment
   options may consider how these barriers are differentially perceived in
   order to effectively reach this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Novelties are a familiar part of daily life. They are also fundamental
   to the evolution of biological systems, human society, and technology.
   By opening new possibilities, one novelty can pave the way for others in
   a process that Kauffman has called "expanding the adjacent possible''.
   The dynamics of correlated novelties, however, have yet to be quantified
   empirically or modeled mathematically. Here we propose a simple
   mathematical model that mimics the process of exploring a physical,
   biological, or conceptual space that enlarges whenever a novelty occurs.
   The model, a generalization of Polya's urn, predicts statistical laws
   for the rate at which novelties happen (Heaps' law) and for the
   probability distribution on the space explored (Zipf's law), as well as
   signatures of the process by which one novelty sets the stage for
   another. We test these predictions on four data sets of human activity:
   the edit events of Wikipedia pages, the emergence of tags in annotation
   systems, the sequence of words in texts, and listening to new songs in
   online music catalogues. By quantifying the dynamics of correlated
   novelties, our results provide a starting point for a deeper
   understanding of the adjacent possible and its role in biological,
   cultural, and technological evolution.

AB Twitter is a major social media platform in which users send and read
   messages ("tweets") of up to 140 characters. In recent years this
   communication medium has been used by those affected by crises to
   organize demonstrations or find relief. Because traffic on this media
   platform is extremely heavy, with hundreds of millions of tweets sent
   every day, it is difficult to differentiate between times of turmoil and
   times of typical discussion. In this work we present a new approach to
   addressing this problem. We first assess several possible "thermostats"
   of activity on social media for their effectiveness in finding important
   time periods. We compare methods commonly found in the literature with a
   method from economics. By combining methods from computational social
   science with methods from economics, we introduce an approach that can
   effectively locate crisis events in the mountains of data generated on
   Twitter. We demonstrate the strength of this method by using it to
   locate the social events relating to the Occupy Wall Street movement
   protests at the end of 2011.

AB Musical meters vary considerably across cultures, yet relatively little
   is known about how culture-specific experience influences metrical
   processing. In Experiment 1, we compared American and Indian listeners'
   synchronous tapping to slow sequences. Inter-tone intervals contained
   silence or to-be-ignored rhythms that were designed to induce a simple
   meter (familiar to Americans and Indians) or a complex meter (familiar
   only to Indians). A subset of trials contained an abrupt switch from one
   rhythm to another to assess the disruptive effects of contradicting the
   initially implied meter. In the unfilled condition, both groups tapped
   earlier than the target and showed large tap-tone asynchronies (measured
   in relative phase). When inter-tone intervals were filled with
   simple-meter rhythms, American listeners tapped later than targets, but
   their asynchronies were smaller and declined more rapidly. Likewise,
   asynchronies rose sharply following a switch away from simple-meter but
   not from complex-meter rhythm. By contrast, Indian listeners performed
   similarly across all rhythm types, with asynchronies rapidly declining
   over the course of complex-and simple-meter trials. For these listeners,
   a switch from either simple or complex meter increased asynchronies.
   Experiment 2 tested American listeners but doubled the duration of the
   synchronization phase prior to (and after) the switch. Here, compared
   with simple meters, complex-meter rhythms elicited larger asynchronies
   that declined at a slower rate, however, asynchronies increased after
   the switch for all conditions. Our results provide evidence that ease of
   meter processing depends to a great extent on the amount of experience
   with specific meters.

AB Public goods and common-pool resources are fundamental features of
   biological and social systems, and pose core challenges in achieving
   sustainability; for such situations, the immediate interests of
   individuals and the societies in which they are embedded are in
   potential conflict, involving game-theoretic considerations whose
   resolution need not serve the collective good. Evolution has often
   confronted such dilemmas-e. g., in bacterial biofilms-in the challenges
   of cancer, in nitrogen fixation and chelation, in the production of
   antibiotics, and in collective action problems across animal groups;
   there is much to learn from the Darwinian resolution of these situations
   for how to address problems our societies face today. Addressing these
   problems involves understanding the emergence of cooperative agreements,
   from reciprocal altruism and insurance arrangements to the social norms
   and more formal institutions thatmaintain societies. At the core are the
   issues of how individuals and societies discount the future and the
   interests of others, and the degree that individual decisions are
   influenced by regard for others. Ultimately, as Garrett Hardin
   suggested, the solution to problems of the commons is in "mutual
   coercion, mutually agreed upon," and hence in how groups of individuals
   form and how they arrive at decisions that ultimately benefit all.

AB Our species exhibits spectacular success due to cumulative culture.
   While cognitive evolution of social learning mechanisms may be partially
   responsible for adaptive human culture, features of early human social
   structure may also play a role by increasing the number potential models
   from which to learn innovations. We present interview data on
   interactions between same-sex adult dyads of Ache and Hadza
   hunter-gatherers living in multiple distinct residential bands (20 Ache
   bands; 42 Hadza bands; 1201 dyads) throughout a tribal home range.
   Results show high probabilities (5%-29% per year) of cultural and
   cooperative interactions between randomly chosen adults. Multiple
   regression suggests that ritual relationships increase interaction rates
   more than kinship, and that affinal kin interact more often than dyads
   with no relationship. These may be important features of human
   sociality. Finally, yearly interaction rates along with survival data
   allow us to estimate expected lifetime partners for a variety of social
   activities, and compare those to chimpanzees. Hadza and Ache men are
   estimated to observe over 300 men making tools in a lifetime, whereas
   male chimpanzees interact with only about 20 other males in a lifetime.
   High intergroup interaction rates in ancestral humans may have promoted
   the evolution of cumulative culture.

AB Disparities in tobacco use and smoking cessation by race/ethnicity,
   education, income, and mental health status remain despite recent
   successes in reducing tobacco use. It is unclear to what extent media
   campaigns promote cessation within these population groups. This study
   aims to (1) assess whether exposure to antitobacco advertising is
   associated with making a quit attempt within a number of population
   subgroups, and (2) determine whether advertisement type differentialy
   affects cessation behavior across subgroups. We used data from the New
   York Adult Tobacco Survey (NY-ATS), a cross-sectional, random-digit-dial
   telephone survey of adults aged 18 or older in New York State conducted
   quarterly from 2003 through 2011 (N = 53,706). The sample for this study
   consists of 9,408 current smokers from the total NY-ATS sample.
   Regression methods were used to examine the effect of New York State's
   antismoking advertising, overall and by advertisement type (graphic
   and/or emotional), on making a quit attempt in the past 12 months.
   Exposure to antismoking advertising was measured in two ways: gross
   rating points (a measure of potential exposure) and self-reported
   confirmed recall of advertisements. This study yields three important
   findings. First, antismoking advertising promotes quit attempts among
   racial/ethnic minority smokers and smokers of lower education and
   income. Second, advertising effectiveness is attributable in part to
   advertisements with strong graphic imagery or negative emotion. Third,
   smokers with poor mental health do not appear to benefit from exposure
   to antismoking advertising of any type. This study contributes to the
   evidence about how cessation media campaigns can be used most
   effectively to increase quit attempts within vulnerable subgroups. In
   particular, it suggests that a general campaign can promote cessation
   among a range of sociodemographic groups. More research is needed to
   understand what message strategies might work for those with poor mental
   health.

AB Objective(s): HIV stigma is considered to be a major driver of the
   HIV/AIDS pandemic, yet there is a limited understanding of its
   occurrence. We describe the geographic patterns of two forms of HIV
   stigma in a cross-sectional sample of women of childbearing age from
   western Kenya: internalized stigma (associated with shame) and
   externalized stigma (associated with blame).
   Design: Geographic studies of HIV stigma provide a first step in
   generating hypotheses regarding potential community-level causes of
   stigma and may lead to more effective community-level interventions.
   Methods: Spatial regression using generalized additive models and point
   pattern analyses using K-functions were used to assess the spatial
   scale(s) at which each form of HIV stigma clusters, and to assess
   whether the spatial clustering of each stigma indicator was present
   after adjustment for individual-level characteristics.
   Results: There was evidence that externalized stigma (blame) was
   geographically heterogeneous across the study area, even after
   controlling for individual-level factors (P = 0.01). In contrast, there
   was less evidence (P = 0.70) of spatial trend or clustering of
   internalized stigma (shame).
   Conclusion: Our results may point to differences in the underlying
   social processes motivating each form of HIV stigma. Externalized stigma
   may be driven more by cultural beliefs disseminated within communities,
   whereas internalized stigma may be the result of individual-level
   characteristics outside the domain of community influence. These data
   may inform community-level interventions to decrease HIV-related stigma,
   and thus impact the HIV epidemic. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health

AB Background: Suicide is a major public health problem. Current thinking
   about suicide emphasizes the study of psychiatric, psychological, or
   biological determinants. Previous work in this area has largely relied
   on surrogate outcomes or samples enriched for psychiatric morbidity.
   Objective: To evaluate the relationship between social integration and
   suicide mortality.
   Design: Prospective cohort study initiated in 1988.
   Setting: United States.
   Participants: 34 901 men aged 40 to 75 years.
   Measurements: Social integration was measured with a 7-item index that
   included marital status, social network size, frequency of contact,
   religious participation, and participation in other social groups. Vital
   status of study participants was ascertained through 1 February 2012.
   The primary outcome of interest was suicide mortality, defined as deaths
   classified with codes E950 to E959 from the International Classification
   of Diseases, Ninth Revision.
   Results: Over 708 945 person-years of follow-up, there were 147
   suicides. The incidence of suicide decreased with increasing social
   integration. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression
   model, the relative hazard of suicide was lowest among participants in
   the highest (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.69])
   and second-highest (AHR, 0.52 [CI, 0.30 to 0.91]) categories of social
   integration. Three components (marital status, social network size, and
   religious service attendance) showed the strongest protective
   associations. Social integration was also inversely associated with
   all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, but accounting for
   competing causes of death did not substantively alter the findings.
   Limitations: The study lacked information on participants' mental
   well-being. Some suicides could have been misclassified as accidental
   deaths.
   Conclusion: Men who were socially well-integrated had a more than 2-fold
   reduced risk for suicide over 24 years of follow-up.

AB In many places of the world, a Neolithic Demographic Transition (NDT) is
   visible as a several-hundred-year period of increased birth rates
   coupled with stable mortality rates, resulting in dramatic population
   growth that is eventually curtailed by increased mortality. Similar
   processes can be reconstructed in particular detail for the North
   American Southwest, revealing an anomalously long and spatially variable
   NDT. Irrigation-dependent societies experienced relatively low birth
   rates but were quick to achieve a high degree of sociopolitical
   complexity, whereas societies dependent on dry or rainfed farming
   experienced higher birth rates but less initial sociopolitical
   complexity. Low birth rates after A.D. 1200 mark the beginning of the
   decline of the Hohokam. Overall in the Southwest, birth rates increased
   slowly from 1100 B.C. to A.D. 500, and remained at high levels with some
   fluctuation until decreasing rapidly beginning A.D. 1300. Life
   expectancy at 15 increased slowly from 900 B.C. to A.D. 700, and then
   increased rapidly for 200 y before fluctuating and then declining after
   A.D. 1400. Life expectancy at birth, on the other hand, generally
   declined from 1100 B.C. to A.D. 1100/1200, before rebounding. Farmers
   took two millennia (similar to 1100 B.C. to similar to A.D. 1000) to
   reach the carrying capacity of the agricultural niche in the Southwest.

AB BACKGROUND: The relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer
   incidence in the United States has not traditionally been a focus of
   population-based cancer surveillance systems. METHODS: Nearly 3 million
   tumors diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 from 16 states plus Los Angeles
   were assigned into 1 of 4 groupings based on the poverty rate of the
   residential census tract at time of diagnosis. The sex-specific risk
   ratio of the highest-to-lowest poverty category was measured using
   Poisson regression, adjusting for age and race, for 39 cancer sites.
   RESULTS: For all sites combined, there was a negligible association
   between cancer incidence and poverty; however, 32 of 39 cancer sites
   showed a significant association with poverty (14 positively associated
   and 18 negatively associated). Nineteen of these sites had monotonic
   increases or decreases in risk across all 4 poverty categories. The
   sites most strongly associated with higher poverty were Kaposi sarcoma,
   larynx, cervix, penis, and liver; those most strongly associated with
   lower poverty were melanoma, thyroid, other nonepithelial skin, and
   testis. Sites associated with higher poverty had lower incidence and
   higher mortality than those associated with lower poverty. CONCLUSIONS:
   These findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of including a
   measure of socioeconomic status in national cancer surveillance. (C)

AB Research on human social interactions has traditionally relied on
   self-reports. Despite their widespread use, self-reported accounts of
   behaviour are prone to biases and necessarily reduce the range of
   behaviours, and the number of subjects, that may be studied
   simultaneously. The development of ever smaller sensors makes it
   possible to study group-level human behaviour in naturalistic settings
   outside research laboratories. We used such sensors, sociometers, to
   examine gender, talkativeness and interaction style in two different
   contexts. Here, we find that in the collaborative context, women were
   much more likely to be physically proximate to other women and were also
   significantly more talkative than men, especially in small groups. In
   contrast, there were no gender-based differences in the
   non-collaborative setting. Our results highlight the importance of
   objective measurement in the study of human behaviour, here enabling us
   to discern context specific, gender-based differences in interaction
   style.

AB Background: A large literature has indicated a robust association
   between birth spacing and child survival, but evidence on the
   association of birth timing with physical growth in low and middle
   income countries (LMICs) remains limited.
   Methods and Results: Data from 153 cross-sectional Demographic and
   Health Surveys (DHS) across 61 LMICs conducted between 1990 and 2011
   were combined to assess the association of birth timing with child
   stunting (height-for-age z-score <-2). A total of 623,789 children of
   birth order 1-5 contributed to the maternal age analysis, while the
   birth spacing dataset consisted of 584,226 children of birth order 2 and
   higher. Compared to 27-34 year old mothers, maternal age under 18 years
   was associated with a relative stunting risk of 1.35 (95% CI: 1.29-1.40)
   for firstborn children, whereas the relative risk was 1.24 (95% CI:
   1.19-1.29) for mothers aged 18-19 years. The association of young
   maternal age with stunting was significantly greater for urban residents
   and those in the top 50% of household wealth. Birth intervals less than
   12 months and 12-23 months had relative risks for stunting of 1.09 (95%
   CI: 1.06-1.12) and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.05-1.06) as compared to a 24-35 month
   inter-pregnancy interval, respectively. The strength of both teenage
   pregnancy and short birth interval associations showed substantial
   variation across WHO region. We estimate that 8.6% (6.9-10.3%) of
   stunted cases in the South Asian DHS sample would have been averted by
   jointly eliminating teen pregnancies and birth intervals less than 24
   months, while only 3.6% (1.5-5.7%) of stunting cases would have
   prevented in the Middle East and North Africa sample.
   Conclusions: Postponing the age of first birth and increasing
   inter-pregnancy intervals has the potential to significantly reduce the
   prevalence of stunting and improve child development in LMICs.

AB Why is he poor? Why is she failing academically? Why is he so generous?
   Why is she so conscientious? Answers to such everyday questions-social
   explanations-have powerful effects on relationships at the interpersonal
   and societal levels. How do people select an explanation in particular
   cases? We suggest that, often, explanations are selected based on the
   individual's pre-existing general theories of social causality. More
   specifically, we suggest that over time individuals develop general
   beliefs regarding the causes of social events. We refer to these beliefs
   as social explanatory styles. Our goal in the present article is to
   offer and validate a measure of individual differences in social
   explanatory styles. Accordingly, we offer the Social Explanatory Styles
   Questionnaire (SESQ), which measures three independent dimensions of
   social explanatory style: Dispositionism, historicism, and
   controllability. Studies 1-3 examine basic psychometric properties of
   the SESQ and provide positive evidence regarding internal consistency,
   factor structure, and both convergent and divergent validity. Studies
   4-6 examine predictive validity for each subscale: Does each explanatory
   dimension moderate an important phenomenon of social cognition? Results
   suggest that they do. In Study 4, we show that SESQ dispositionism
   moderates the tendency to make spontaneous trait inferences. In Study 5,
   we show that SESQ historicism moderates the tendency to commit the
   Fundamental Attribution Error. Finally, in Study 6 we show that SESQ
   controllability predicts polarization of moral blame judgments:
   Heightened blaming toward controllable stigmas (assimilation), and
   attenuated blaming toward uncontrollable stigmas (contrast). Decades of
   research suggest that explanatory style regarding the self is a powerful
   predictor of self-functioning. We think it is likely that social
   explanatory styles-perhaps comprising interactive combinations of the
   basic dimensions tapped by the SESQ-will be similarly potent predictors
   of social functioning. We hope the SESQ will be a useful tool for
   exploring that possibility.

   the smell of strawberries to the color pink or red. These associations
   are forms of crossmodal correspondences. Recently, there has been
   discussion about the extent to which these correspondences arise for
   structural reasons (i.e., an inherent mapping between color and odor),
   statistical reasons (i.e., covariance in experience), and/or
   semantically-mediated reasons (i.e., stemming from language). The
   present study probed this question by testing color-odor correspondences
   in 6 different cultural groups (Dutch, Netherlands-residing-Chinese,
   German, Malay, Malaysian-Chinese, and US residents), using the same set
   of 14 odors and asking participants to make congruent and incongruent
   color choices for each odor. We found consistent patterns in color
   choices for each odor within each culture, showing that participants
   were making non-random color-odor matches. We used representational
   dissimilarity analysis to probe for variations in the patterns of
   color-odor associations across cultures; we found that US and German
   participants had the most similar patterns of associations, followed by
   German and Malay participants. The largest group differences were
   between Malay and Netherlands-resident Chinese participants and between
   Dutch and Malaysian-Chinese participants. We conclude that culture plays
   a role in color-odor crossmodal associations, which likely arise, at
   least in part, through experience.

AB Growing epidemiological evidence identifies key domains relevant to
   behavioral cardiology, including health behaviors, emotions, mental
   mindsets, stress management, social connectedness, and a sense of
   purpose. Each of these domains exists along a continuum, ranging from
   positive factors that promote health, to negative factors, which are
   pathophysiological. To date, there has been relatively little
   translation of this growing knowledge base into cardiology practice.
   Four initiatives are proposed to meet this challenge: 1) promulgating
   greater awareness of the potency of psychosocial risks factors; 2)
   overcoming a current "artificial divide" between conventional and
   psychosocial risk factors; 3) developing novel cost-effective
   interventions using Internet and mobile health applications, group-based
   counseling, and development of tiered-care behavioral management; and 4)
   in recognition that "one size does not fit all" with respect to
   behavioral interventions, developing specialists who can counsel
   patients in multidisciplinary fashion and use evidence-based approaches
   for promoting patient motivation and execution of health goals. (C) 2014

AB Residents of environmental justice (EJ) communities may bear a
   disproportionate burden of environmental health risk, and often face
   additional burdens from social determinants of health. Accounting for
   cumulative risk should include measures of risk from both environmental
   sources and social determinants. This study sought to better understand
   cumulative health risk from both social and environmental sources in a
   disadvantaged community in Texas. Key outcomes were determining what
   data are currently available for this assessment, clarifying data needs,
   identifying data gaps, and considering how those gaps could be filled.
   Analyses suggested that the traditionally defined EJ community in Port
   Arthur may have a lower environmental risk from air toxics than the rest
   of the City of Port Arthur (although the entire city has a higher risk
   than the average for the state), but may have a larger burden from
   social determinants of health. However, the results should be
   interpreted in light of the availability of data, the definitions of
   community boundaries, and the areal unit utilized. Continued focus on
   environmental justice communities and the cumulative risks faced by
   their residents is critical to protecting these residents and,
   ultimately, moving toward a more equitable distribution and acceptable
   level of risk throughout society.

AB The sequencing of the human genome and the advent of low-cost
   genome-wide assays that generate millions of observations of individual
   genomes in a matter of hours constitute a disruptive innovation for
   social science. Many public use social science datasets have or will
   soon add genome-wide genetic data. With these new data come technical
   challenges, but also new possibilities. Among these, the lowest-hanging
   fruit and the most potentially disruptive to existing research programs
   is the ability to measure previously invisible contours of health and
   disease risk within populations. In this article, we outline why now is
   the time for social scientists to bring genetics into their research
   programs. We discuss how to select genetic variants to study. We explain
   how the polygenic architecture of complex traits and the low penetrance
   of individual genetic loci pose challenges to research integrating
   genetics and social science. We introduce genetic risk scores as a
   method of addressing these challenges and provide guidance on how
   genetic risk scores can be constructed. We conclude by outlining
   research questions that are ripe for social science inquiry.

AB Background: An HIV vaccine could substantially impact the epidemic.
   However, risk compensation (RC), or post-vaccination increase in risk
   behavior, could present a major challenge. The methodology used in
   previous studies of risk compensation has been almost exclusively
   individual-level in focus, and has not explored how increased risk
   behavior could affect the connectivity of risk networks. This study
   examined the impact of anticipated HIV vaccine-related RC on the
   structure of high-risk drug users' sexual and injection risk network.
   Methods: A sample of 433 rural drug users in the US provided data on
   their risk relationships (i.e., those involving recent unprotected sex
   and/or injection equipment sharing). Dyad-specific data were collected
   on likelihood of increasing/initiating risk behavior if they, their
   partner, or they and their partner received an HIV vaccine. Using these
   data and social network analysis, a "post-vaccination network" was
   constructed and compared to the current network on measures relevant to
   HIV transmission, including network size, cohesiveness (e.g., diameter,
   component structure, density), and centrality.
   Results: Participants reported 488 risk relationships. Few reported an
   intention to decrease condom use or increase equipment sharing (4% and
   1%, respectively). RC intent was reported in 30 existing risk
   relationships and vaccination was anticipated to elicit the formation of
   five new relationships. RC resulted in a 5% increase in risk network
   size (n = 142 to n = 149) and a significant increase in network density.
   The initiation of risk relationships resulted in the connection of
   otherwise disconnected network components, with the largest doubling in
   size from five to ten.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates a new methodological approach to
   studying RC and reveals that behavior change following HIV vaccination
   could potentially impact risk network connectivity. These data will be
   valuable in parameterizing future network models that can determine if
   network-level change precipitated by RC would appreciably impact the
   vaccine's population-level effectiveness.

AB Although an increasing number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in
   sub-Saharan Africa are benefiting from the rapid scale-up of
   antiretroviral therapy (ART), retention in HIV care and treatment
   services remains a major concern. We examined socioeconomic and
   sociocultural barriers and potential facilitators of retention in ART in
   Iringa, Tanzania, a region with the second highest prevalence of HIV in
   the country. In 2012, 116 in-depth interviews were conducted to assess
   community members' perceptions, barriers and facilitators of HIV
   treatment in Iringa, including key informants, persons at heightened
   risk for infection, and HIV service-delivery users. Data were
   transcribed, translated, entered into Atlas.ti, coded, and analyzed for
   key themes. In order to provide the full range of perspectives across
   the community on issues that may affect retention, we report findings
   from all 116 participants, but draw on verbatim quotes to highlight the
   experiences of the 14 PLHIV who reported that they were receiving HIV
   care and treatment services. Despite the growing availability of HIV
   care and treatment services in Iringa, participants reported significant
   barriers to retention, including lack of knowledge and misperceptions of
   treatment, access problems that included difficulties in reaching
   distant clinics and pervasive poverty that left PLHIV unable to cope
   with out-of-pocket costs associated with their care, persistent
   stigmatization of PLHIV and frequent reliance on alternative healing
   systems instead of biomedical treatment. Positive perceptions of the
   efficacy of ART, improved ART availability in the region, improved
   access to care through supplemental aid, and social support were
   perceived to enhance treatment continuation. Our findings suggest that
   numerous socioeconomic and sociocultural barriers inhibit retention in
   HIV care and treatment services in this setting. Intervention strategies
   that improve ART accessibility, incorporate supplemental aid, enhance
   social support, reduce stigma, and develop partnerships with alternative
   healers are needed to improve HIV-related outcomes.

AB Adolescents and young adults who affiliate with friends who engage in
   impulsive behavior are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors
   themselves, and those who associate with prosocial (i.e. more prudent,
   future oriented) peers are more likely to engage in prosocial behavior.
   However, it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of peer
   influence vs. peer selection (i.e., whether individuals choose friends
   with similar traits) when interpreting social behaviors. In this study,
   we combined a novel social manipulation with a well-validated delay
   discounting task assessing impulsive behavior to create a social
   influence delay discounting task, in which participants were exposed to
   both impulsive (smaller, sooner or SS payment) and non-impulsive
   (larger, later or LL payment) choices from their peers. Young adults in
   this sample, n = 51, aged 18-25 had a higher rate of SS choices after
   exposure to impulsive peer influence than after exposure to
   non-impulsive peer influence. Interestingly, in highly susceptible
   individuals, the rate of non-impulsive choices did not increase after
   exposure to non-impulsive influence. There was a positive correlation
   between self-reported suggestibility and degree of peer influence on SS
   choices. These results suggest that, in young adults, SS choices appear
   to be influenced by the choices of same-aged peers, especially for
   individuals who are highly susceptible to influence.

AB One of the most important components of Antonio Gramsci's social theory
   is his discussion of political strategy, particularly his distinction
   between 'war of maneuver' and 'war of position'. For Gramsci, the
   classical model of revolution through military insurrection (war of
   maneuver) has been supplanted within advanced capitalism by a cultural
   struggle of much longer duration and complexity (war of position).
   Despite the significance of Gramsci's analysis of war of maneuver/war of
   position for contemporary Marxism, it is striking that so little
   attention has been paid to these terms. These terms have a history, both
   in military theory and in Marxism, which predates Gramsci's prison
   notebooks. An examination of the military writings of Engels, Lenin and
   Trotsky, which are grounded more directly on military theory, leads to
   different conclusions about the nature of political strategy and the
   relationship between war of maneuver and war of position.

AB Today, to perceive the link between society and environment does not
   require that we engage in an effort of great abstraction. What remains
   paradoxical is that the intensity and scale of societally induced
   environmental degradation, which rose to historically unprecedented
   levels during the latter half of the 20th century, is synchronous with
   an equally impressive increase in public concern for and attention to
   the biophysical world. This article examines values-based and
   traditional Marxist-oriented approaches to environmental sociology in
   the USA in order to assess whether or not - and if so, how exactly -
   these approaches help us make sense of the aforementioned paradox.
   Against this background, the necessity of critical theory for
   environmental sociology is illuminated. In order to further research
   efforts accordingly, this article advances the concept of
   sociobiophysicality, which allows us to grasp objective drivers of
   human-ecological transformation and forms of subjectivity as synchronous

   psychoanalytically trained psychiatrists (who prescribe medications and
   practice talk therapy) about their experiences navigating treatment in a
   profession dominated by the medical model. Psychiatrists' descriptions
   of their field and their patients' troubles support the central claims
   in sociology about the medicalization of psychiatry. Since the 1980s,
   the extent to which psychiatric troubles are medicalized has increased
   dramatically and in new ways. Pharmaceutical companies, insurance
   companies and consumers drive the current era in medicalization.
   Psychiatric training is also highly influential on practitioners'
   propensities to think and act medically. Qualitative data are crucial
   for understanding the extent to which medicalization influences
   practitioners and the degree to which they foster the use of medical
   interventions. Very few researchers have examined the medicalization of
   psychiatry from the perspective of psychiatrists, especially
   psychoanalysts, who offer insight into why medicalization is largely
   unchallenged within psychiatry.

   consequence of post-combat mental illnesses such as PTSD and major
   depression, we analyze the contrast between the participants' identities
   as soldiers and their identities as civilians. We find that the postwar
   transition causes adverse mental health effects that stem from contrasts
   between the military's demands for deindividuation, obedience,
   chain-of-command, and dissociation and the civilian identity
   expectations of autonomy, self-advocacy, and being relational. Veterans'
   reintegration to civilian society is further hindered by a culture that
   is perceived (by veterans) as having decreased understanding of the
   soldier/veteran experience itself. These identity conflicts-what we term
   warring identities-have an important yet understudied effect on
   veterans' combat-related mental health problems.

AB For decades, sociological theory has documented how our lives are
   simultaneously produced through and against normative structures of sex,
   gender, and sexuality. These normative structures are often believed to
   operate along presumably "natural," biological, and essentialized
   binaries of male/female, man/woman,and heterosexual/homosexual. However,
   as the lives and experiences of transgender people and their families
   become increasingly socially visible, these normative structuring
   binaries are called into stark question as they fail to adequately
   articulate and encompass these social actors' identities and social
   group memberships. Utilizing in-depth interviews with 50 women from the
   United States, Canada, and Australia, who detail 61 unique relationships
   with transgender men, this study considers how the experiences of these
   queer social actors hold the potential to rattle the very foundations
   upon which normative binaries rest, highlighting the increasingly blurry
   intersections, tensions, and overlaps between sex, gender, and sexual
   orientation in the 21st century. This work also considers the potential
   for these normative disruptions to engender opportunities for social
   collaboration, solidarity, and transformation.

AB This article examines gift giving as a nation-building mechanism.
   Instead of treating giving to the nation as a sign of existing
   sentiments, it treats national giving as an organizational
   accomplishment and studies how this practice informed Jewish American
   sense of belonging. Specifically, the article examines the establishment
   of the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) during the 1940s. The UJA provided
   donors with an institutional setting within which the nation became
   relevant. Through participation in UJA events, the Jewish nation turned
   into a more practicable and meaningful category for donors.
   Interestingly, rather than simply emphasizing the unity of the nation,
   the UJA engaged in simultaneous marking and blurring of the boundaries
   between different groups of Jews. This observation suggests a model of
   nation building that is based not simply on imagined homogeneity but on
   a simultaneous drawing and erasing of internal differences that generate
   a sense of unequal commonality.

AB This paper provides a framework for understanding the ways in which
   social processes produce social inequality. Specifically, we focus on a
   particular type of social process that has received limited attention in
   the literature and in which inter-subjective meaning-making is central:
   cultural processes. Much of the literature on inequality has focused on
   the actions of dominant actors and institutions in gaining access to
   material and non-material resources, or on how ecological effects cause
   unequal access to material resources. In contrast, we focus on processes
   that contribute to the production (and reproduction) of inequality
   through the routine and taken-for-granted actions of both dominant and
   subordinate actors. We highlight two types of cultural processes:
   identification and rationalization. We describe and illustrate four
   processes that we consider to be significant analytical exemplars of
   these two types of cultural processes: racialization and stigmatization
   (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for
   rationalization). We argue that attention to such cultural processes is
   critical and complementary to current explanations of social inequality.

AB The preceding article by Lamont, Beljean and Clair (LBC) entitled 'What
   is Missing? Cultural Processes and Causal Pathways to Inequality'
   invites us to extend our socio-economic imagination regarding
   inequality. While much economic and social inequality is structural in
   nature, LBC discuss how the human experience of inequalities is strongly
   grounded in cultural process. Cultural processes here include both
   identification and rationalization, which LBC discuss in relation to
   four processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification)
   and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). While cultural
   processes are the contested terrain within which inequalities are shaped
   and played out, LBC argue why scholars should pay stronger attention to
   them than in previous research. Socio-Economic Review invited a group of
   leading scholars in the fields of inequality and cultural process to
   discuss the paper of LBC, and relate this both to their past work and
   the future of inequality research. Douglas Massey opens with a
   reflection on why US sociology in particular has neglected the role of
   culture in the study of inequality. The next two contributions by Leslie
   McCall and co-authors Donald Tomaskovic-Devey and Dustin Avent-Holt
   raise important questions about how the cultural processes described by
   LBC relate to the analysis of social structures, such as political
   discourses or the meso-level dynamics of organizations. Finally, Monin,
   Forgues and Wang look at how cultural processes operate in
   organizational settings, and use these insights to analyse the boundary
   conditions thereof.

AB Objective. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a package of roadway
   modifications in New York City funded under the Safe Routes to School
   (SRTS) program.
   Methods. We used a Markov model to estimate long-term impacts of SRTS on
   injury reduction and the associated savings in medical costs, lifelong
   disability, and death. Model inputs included societal costs (in 2013 US
   dollars) and observed spatiotemporal changes in injury rates associated
   with New York City's implementation of SRTS relative to control
   intersections. Structural changes to roadways were assumed to last 50
   years before further investment is required. Therefore, costs were
   discounted over 50 consecutive cohorts of modified roadway users under
   SRTS.
   Results. SRTS was associated with an overall net societal benefit of $
   230 million and 2055 quality-adjusted life years gained in New York
   City.
   Conclusions. SRTS reduces injuries and saves money over the long run.

AB Objectives. Little is known about the use of social media as a tool for
   health communication. We used a mixed-methods design to examine
   communication about childhood obesity on Twitter.
   Methods. NodeXL was used to collect tweets sent in June 2013 containing
   the hashtag #childhoodobesity. Tweets were coded for content; tweeters
   were classified by sector and health focus. Data were also collected on
   the network of follower connections among the tweeters. We used
   descriptive statistics and exponential random graph modeling to examine
   tweet content, characteristics of tweeters, and the composition and
   structure of the network of connections facilitating communication among
   tweeters.
   Results. We collected 1110 tweets originating from 576 unique Twitter
   users. More individuals (65.6%) than organizations (32.9%) tweeted. More
   tweets focused on individual behavior than environment or policy. Few
   government and educational tweeters were in the network, but they were
   more likely than private individuals to be followed by others.
   Conclusions. There is an opportunity to better disseminate
   evidence-based information to a broad audience through Twitter by
   increasing the presence of credible sources in the #childhoodobesity
   conversation and focusing the content of tweets on scientific evidence.

AB Background: Measures of social context, such as marriage and religious
   participation, are associated with remission from alcohol use disorders
   (AUDs) in population-based and treatment samples, but whether these
   associations hold among individuals at high familial risk for AUD is
   unknown. This study tests associations of measures of social context and
   treatment with different types of remission from DSM-5 AUD in a
   high-risk sample.
   Methods: Subjects were 686 relatives of probands (85.7% first-degree)
   who participated in a high-risk family study of alcohol dependence. All
   subjects met criteria for AUD at baseline and were re-interviewed 5
   years later. Follow-up status was categorized as persistent AUD,
   high-risk drinking, remitted low-risk drinking, and abstinence. Social
   context measures were defined as stable or changing from baseline to
   follow-up, and their bivariate and multivariate associations with
   follow-up status were tested.
   Results: At follow-up, 62.8% of subjects had persistent AUD, 6.4% were
   high-risk drinkers, 22.2% were remitted low-risk drinkers, and 8.6% were
   abstinent. Birth of first child during the interval was the only measure
   of social context associated with remitted low-risk drinking and was
   significant for women only. Abstinent remission was characterized by
   being stably separated or divorced for women, new marriage for both
   sexes, experiencing low levels of family support and high levels of
   friend support, and receiving treatment. High-risk drinkers were more
   likely than individuals with persistent AUD to have a stable number of
   children and to have been recently unemployed.
   Conclusions: The social contexts accompanying different types of
   remission in this high-risk sample resemble those found in
   population-based and clinical samples. Low-risk drinkers resemble
   natural remitters from population-based samples who change their
   drinking habits with life transitions. Abstainers resemble clinical
   samples in marital context, support from friends, and treatment.
   High-risk drinkers appear to continue to experience negative
   consequences of heavy drinking.

AB Purpose: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is among the leading causes
   of cancer death in the United States. Previous studies found mixed
   results regarding disparities in survival by race, ethnicity, and
   socioeconomic status (SES). However, race comparisons were usually
   limited, with comparisons made between black and white patients only or
   by merging race and ethnicity together as non-Hispanic black,
   non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic patients. Even fewer studies included
   race, ethnicity, and SES together while controlling for extensive
   confounding variables. Thus, because we have access to a large and
   unique population-based database that includes tumor characteristics and
   patient comorbidities, the purpose of this study was to explore
   disparities in NSCLC survival.
   Methods: We linked data from the 1996 to 2007 Florida Cancer Data System
   registry to the Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration and the
   US Census (n = 98,541). Survival time was from date of diagnosis to
   death or last contact. Race was white, black, Native American, Asian,
   Pacific Islander, Asian Indian/Pakistani, or other. Ethnicity was
   non-Hispanic or Hispanic. Socioeconomic status was measured as
   percentage of the participant's census tract living below the federal
   poverty line. Median survival and survival rates were calculated by
   Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression models produced
   unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
   (95% CIs).
   Results: The majority of patients were white (91.9%) and non-Hispanic
   (94.1%). Blacks had the lowest median survival (8.4 months). At 5 years
   after diagnosis, survival rate was highest in whites (16.3%) and lowest
   for Pacific Islanders (6.4%). In the adjusted model, Asians had
   significantly improved survival compared with whites (HR, 0.85; 95% CI,
   0.76-0.95). Patients in middle-low (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99),
   middle-high (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.94), and highest (HR, 0.87; 95%
   CI, 0.84-0.91) SES areas had significantly improved survival compared
   with those in lowest areas. Significantly worse survival was found for
   patients with complicated diabetes (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), weight
   loss (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11), fluid and electrolyte disorders (HR,
   1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.11), and alcohol abuse (HR, 1.11; 95% CI,
   1.07-1.14).
   Discussion: We found strong evidence for racial and socioeconomic
   disparities in Floridian NSCLC survival. Asians had improved survival
   compared with whites, a novel finding. Our findings confirmed that
   patients living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods have worse outcomes
   than their wealthier neighborhood counterparts. Finally, we found an
   association between some modifiable factors/comorbidities and worse
   survival. Clinicians may be able to use this information to improve
   patients' likelihood of better outcomes.

AB This article examines how Robert Park's work, first at the American
   Congo Reform Association (ACRA) as a secretary/publicity agent and later
   at Tuskegee Institute as Booker T Washington's researcher, ghostwriter,
   and co-author, influenced how he conceptualized what academic sociology
   could do and should be. Once he secured an academic position at the
   University of Chicago, Park, like many of his peers, sought to establish
   his difference from and superiority over practical reformers by defining
   his object of study -society - as a 'social organism' which was governed
   by natural laws. Park's definition of sociology and its object of study
   made it possible not only to exclude non-academic researchers from the
   discipline but also to place his own actions as a 'reformer' (i. e.
   imperial consultant at Tuskegee and the ACRA) beyond scholarly inquiry.
   Park's relationship to Washington helps to explain the relationship
   between sociology's separation from the reform movement and the erasure
   of colonialism and imperialism from disciplinary history. It also
   partially accounts for why contemporary sociology's analytical structure
   still struggles to account for and theoretically capture the
   complexities of colonial history.

AB How is genetic involvement interpreted for disorders whose
   medicalisation is contested? Framing psychiatric and behavioural
   disorders in terms of genetics is expected to make them seem more
   medical. Yet a genetic aetiology can also be used to frame behaviour as
   acceptable human variation, rather than a medical problem (for example,
   sexual orientation). I analyse responses to the idea that there is a
   genetic component in anorexia and bulimia nervosa (AN or BN) via
   semi-structured interviews with a sample of 50 women diagnosed with an
   eating disorder (25 had recovered). All but three volunteered that
   genetics would medicalise AN or BN by (i) making eating disorders seem
   more like 'real diseases'; implying that these disorders need (ii)
   professional treatment or (iii) a biologically based treatment. The
   results also indicate there are several counter-logics by which genetic
   framing could support non-medical definitions of AN or BN. I argue that
   genetic framing reduces perceived individual responsibility, which can
   support definitions of behaviour as either a reflection of disease
   (which entails intervention) or a reflection of normal human diversity
   (which does not). In the context of public scepticism as to the
   'reality' of AN or BN, genetic involvement was taken as evidence of
   disease in ongoing negotiations about the medical and moral status of
   people with eating disorders.

AB Although the study of signals has been part of human behavioral ecology
   since the field's inception,(1) only recently has signaling theory
   become important to the evolutionary study of human behavior and
   culture.(2) Signaling theory's rise to prominence has been propelled
   mainly by applications of costly signaling theory,(3) which has shed
   light on a wide variety of human behaviors ranging from hunting(4) to
   religion.(5,6) Costly signaling rests on the idea that wasteful but
   highly visible traits and behaviors can be explained as honest
   indicators of underlying qualities that are otherwise difficult to
   detect. For example, a laborious hunting technique may serve as a
   display of skill on the part of the hunter, who may then be favorably
   perceived by potential mates and allies.(4) The costs of the activity
   ensure that the signal is honest, since unskilled hunters will not be
   able to perform as well. Despite the usefulness of this perspective,
   many such studies begin by documenting a costly behavior that is then
   explained with reference to costly signaling theory. Because such
   behaviors are easy to detect, they may be overemphasized in the
   literature.(7) Moreover, costly signaling theory by itself can explain
   neither all signals nor all aspects of signal design. In this review, we
   argue that a focus on the role that the psychology of the intended
   receiver plays in signal design can expand the scope of signaling theory
   as a promising avenue to explain human behavior.

AB Owing to humans' unique life history pattern, particularly comparatively
   short interbirth intervals, early weaning, and prolonged support of
   multiple dependents, human females have greater reproductive value and
   higher lifetime fertility, on average, than do their Great Ape
   counterparts.(1-4) As hominin females began weaning their young early
   and "stacking" dependents of various ages, they must have had
   cooperative allomaternal care partners already in place or been
   successful at concurrently soliciting help to ensure a high rate of
   survival of their offspring.(1-6) Following Hrdy, I define allomaternal
   care (and its derivatives, such as "allomothers" and "allomothering") as
   "care from anyone other than the mother," which thus encompasses a wide
   range of individuals, including fathers.(7) Who the likely allomother
   candidates mothers were and what form that cooperation took remain
   intriguing, difficult-to-answer questions, which are limited, in some
   capacity, by the lines of evidence available to us. Here, I present a
   framework for the ways in which we can integrate
   neurobiological-endocrine and social-behavioral data
   ("socioendocrinology")(8) to contribute to this dialogue in terms of
   evaluating fathers' roles.

AB Objective: To test whether family chaos influences adolescents'

   Methods: A total of 244 families with an adolescent aged 13 to 16 years
   participated. Parents completed measures of family SES and family chaos.
   Both systemic inflammation and stimulated proinflammatory cytokine
   production in response to bacterial challenge were assessed in
   adolescents. Results: Our results suggest that SES moderates the
   detrimental effect of family chaos on systemic inflammation and
   interleukin-6 (B = -0.010, standard error [SE] = 0.004, p = .026), but
   not C-reactive protein (B = 0.009, SE = 0.006, p = .11), and on
   stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production (B = -0.098, SE = 0.044,
   p = .026) in adolescents, such that a chaotic family environment is
   positively associated with greater systemic inflammation and greater
   stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production in adolescents as family
   SES declines. Conclusions: These findings indicate that living in
   chaotic family environments places youth who may be vulnerable based on
   socioeconomic factors at a potentially higher risk for
   inflammation-related diseases.

   positive long-term effects on mental states, and a particularly strong
   positive effect on perceptions of identity. This article discusses if
   these previous findings can be found in the experience of gay people,
   who are often taught by their culture and religion that their
   lifestyles, values, and sexual orientation are unacceptable. The
   qualitative study examined the interview responses of 17 self-identified
   gay and lesbian participants who had drunk ayahuasca in a ceremonial
   context within the past three years, regarding their self-perceptions
   and integration of group beliefs. Participants drank either in shamanic
   or Santo Daime ceremonies or, in the case of one participant, with an
   Afro-Brazilian group that used ayahuasca. Participants reported
   affirmation of their sexual orientation, and no participants reported
   negative effects on perception of identity. Additional positive effects
   in other areas of their lives, which they attributed to ayahuasca
   sessions, contributed to the overall positive outcomes that were
   reported by this group as a result of their ritual participation.

AB Despite considerable discussion and debate about adherence to
   preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
   scant data are available that characterize patterns of adherence to
   open-label PrEP. The current evidence base is instead dominated by
   research on adherence to placebo-controlled investigational drug by way
   of drug detection in active-arm participants of large randomized
   controlled trials (RCTs). Important differences between the context of
   blinded RCTs and open-label use suggest caution when generalizing from
   study product adherence to real-world PrEP use. Evidence specific to
   open-label PrEP adherence is presently sparse but will expand rapidly
   over the next few years as roll-out, demonstration projects, and more
   rigorous research collect and present findings. The current evidence
   bases established cannot yet predict uptake, adherence, or persistence
   with open-label effective PrEP. Emerging evidence suggests that some
   cohorts could execute better adherence in open-label use vs
   placebo-controlled research. Uptake of PrEP is presently slow in the
   United States; whether this changes as grassroots and community efforts
   increase awareness of PrEP as an effective HIV prevention option remains
   to be determined. As recommended by multiple guidelines for PrEP use,
   all current demonstration projects offer PrEP education and/or
   counseling. PrEP support approaches generally fall into community-based,
   technology, monitoring, and integrated sexual health promotion
   approaches. Developing and implementing research that moves beyond
   simple correlates of either study product use or open-label PrEP
   adherence toward more comprehensive models of sociobehavioral and
   socioecological adherence determinants would greatly accelerate
   progress. Intervention research is needed to identify effective models
   of support for open-label PrEP adherence.

AB Choosing from whom to learn is an important element of social learning.
   It affects learner success and the profile of behaviors in the
   population. Because individuals often differ in their traits and
   capabilities, their benefits from different behaviors may also vary.
   Homophily, or assortment, the tendency of individuals to interact with
   other individuals with similar traits, is known to affect the spread of
   behaviors in humans. We introduce models to study the evolution of
   assortative social learning (ASL), where assorting on a trait acts as an
   individual-specific mechanism for filtering relevant models from which
   to learn when that trait varies. We show that when the trait is
   polymorphic, ASL may maintain a stable behavioral polymorphism within a
   population (independently of coexistence with individual learning in a
   population). We explore the evolution of ASL when assortment is based on
   a nonheritable or partially heritable trait, and when ASL competes with
   different non-ASL strategies: oblique (learning from the parental
   generation) and vertical (learning from the parent). We suggest that the
   tendency to assort may be advantageous in the context of social
   learning, and that ASL might be an important concept for the
   evolutionary theory of social learning.

AB Objective. To determine the impact of geographic location on
   advanced-stage ovarian cancer care adherence to the National
   Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in relation to race and
   socioeconomic status (SES)
   Methods. Patients diagnosed with stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian cancer
   (1/1/96-12/31/06) were identified from the California Cancer Registry.
   Generalized additive models were created to assess the effect of spatial
   distributions of geographic location, proximity to a high-volume
   hospital (>= 20) cases/year), distance traveled to receive care, race,
   and SES on adherence to NCCN guidelines, with simultaneous smoothing of
   geographic location and adjustment for confounding variables.
   Disparities in geographic predictors of treatment adherence were
   analyzed with the x(2) test for equality of proportions.
   Results. Of the 11,770 patients identified, 45.4% were treated according
   to NCCN guidelines. Black race (OR = 1.49, 95%CI = 1.21-1.83), low-SES
   (OR = 1.46, 95%CI = 1.24-1.72), and geographic location >= 80 km/50 mi
   from a high-volume hospital (OR = 1.88, 95%CI = 1.61-2.19) were
   independently associated with an increased risk of non-adherent care,
   while high-volume hospital treatment (OR = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.53-0.66) and
   travel distance to receive care >= 32 km/20 mi (OR = 0.80, 95%CI =
   0.69-0.92) were independently protective. SES was inversely associated
   with location km/50 mi from a high-volume hospital, ranging from 6.3%
   (high-SES) to 33.0% (low-SES) (p < 0.0001). White patients were
   significantly more likely to travel >= 32 km/20 mi to receive care
   (21.8%) compared to Blacks (14.4%), Hispanics (15.9%), and Asian/Pacific
   Islanders (15.5%) (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion. Geographic proximity to a high-volume hospital and travel
   distance to receive treatment are independently associated with NCCN
   guideline adherent care for advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Geographic
   barriers to standard ovarian cancer treatment disproportionately affect
   racial minorities and women of low-SES. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Lauded alike by ancient civilizations and modern society, pharaonic
   Egyptian medicine remains an object of fascination today. This article
   discusses its surprisingly sophisticated understanding of a
   cardiovascular system. The term "cardiovascular system," however,
   carries assumptions and meanings to a modern audience, especially
   readers of this journal, which simply do not apply when considering
   ancient conceptions of the heart and vessels. For lack of better
   language, this article will use "cardiovascular" and similar terms while
   recognizing the anachronistic inaccuracy. After briefly summarizing
   ancient Egyptian medicine generally, it will review the anatomy,
   pathology, and treatment of the vasculature. The practice of
   mummification in ancient Egypt provides a unique opportunity for
   paleopathology, and the conclusion will explore evidence of arterial
   disease from a modern scientific perspective.

AB What is the role of measurement in the sociology of culture and how can
   we sort out the complexities that distinguish qualitative from
   quantitative approaches to this domain? In this article, we compare the
   issues and concerns of contemporary scholars who work on matters of
   culture with the writings of a group of scholars who had prepared papers
   for a special symposium on scientific measurement held at the annual
   meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
   (AAAS) back in 1956. We focus on three issues-the recurring need to
   reinvent measurement (as illustrated by the career of the psychologist
   S.S. Stevens), the linkage between qualitative and quantitative methods
   of analysis (as articulated in the writings of the sociologist Paul
   Lazarsfeld), and the assertion (by philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Peter
   Caws) that theorizing necessarily precedes measuring. We review a number
   of important advances in the way that measurement is theorized and
   implemented in the sociology of culture and we also point to a number of
   enduring dilemmas and conundrums that continue to occupy researchers in
   the field today.

AB This article develops a theory of humor and uses it to assess the
   attempt to measure meaning-structures in cultural sociology. To
   understand how humor operates, researchers need to attend to two layers
   of cultural competencies: general typifications and situation-specific
   know-how. These cultural competencies are then invoked in ways that
   define humor as a specific form of experiential frame-the bi-sociation
   of meaning, its condensation, and resonance with experienced tensions in
   the social world. I show the usefulness of this theorization through the
   empirical case of AIDS humor in Malawi, a small country in South-East
   Africa. Using conversational diaries, everyday interactions, and
   newspaper cartoons, I argue both that such humor is widespread and that
   it reveals important facets of life in a country ravaged by the
   pandemic-what it means for the shadow of AIDS to be ever-present.
   Through this case, I then turn back to the question of measurement,
   arguing that although measuring tools may be able to identify
   large-scale semantic shifts, they necessarily miss forms of interaction
   such as humor, that are based on allusion, condensation, and what is
   left unsaid.

AB When it comes to making aesthetic decisions, people commonly account for
   their taste with intuition. A cultural good, symbol, or object is simply
   right and respondents "know it when they see it." This article
   investigates the cultural meanings professional tastemakers see as they
   make such deliberations, while also illustrating the problems
   sociologists have in seeing culture. Using the case of fashion model
   casting and scouting, I present four methods to trace how cultural
   producers recognize and value models' looks in the global fashion
   market, demonstrating how each method results in a different emphasis on
   how culture is used to acquire and deploy aesthetic sense. First,
   interviews capture justifications of aesthetic decisions, as well as
   general processes about day-to-day work routines, which are next tested
   with network analysis, the second method, which emphasizes structural
   arrangements in taste decisions. The third method, ethnography,
   discovers taste as a situated form of knowledge production and
   emphasizes culture in interaction. The fourth and related method,
   observant participation, sees taste as phenomenological as culture
   becomes embodied and tacit consciousness. Each of these methods is an
   optical device that renders a particular and complimentary account of
   taste and affords researchers a certain way to see how culture works.

AB Moral culture can mean many things, but two major elements are a concern
   with moral goods and moral prohibitions. Moral psychologists have
   developed instruments for assessing both of these and such measures can
   be directly imported by sociologists. Work by Schwartz and his
   colleagues on values offers a well-established way of measuring moral
   goods, while researchers using Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory have
   developed validated measures of moral prohibitions. Both values and
   moral foundations are distributed across the social landscape in
   systematic, sociologically interesting ways. Although typically measured
   using questionnaires, we show that values and moral foundations also can
   be used to analyze interview, archival, or "big data." Combining
   psychological and sociological tools and frameworks promises to clarify
   relations among existing sociological treatments of moral culture and to
   connect such treatments to a thriving conversation in moral psychology.

AB Building on a long tradition of measuring cultural logics from a
   relational perspective, we analyze a recent survey of American
   university students to assess whether institutional logics operate in
   the lived experience of individuals. An institutional logic is an
   analytic troika of object, practice, and subject linked together through
   dually ordered systems of articulations. Using the formal method of
   correspondence analysis (MCA) we identify two latent dimensions that
   order physical, verbal, emotional, categorical, and moral practices of
   and investments in love. We take these dimensions as evidence of an
   institutional logic. The dominant first dimension is organized through
   talk of love, non-genital physical intimacies, and affective investment.
   It has no sexual specificity. The subsidiary second dimension is
   organized through moral investment and it has a genital sexual
   specificity. There is little difference between women and men, either in
   the way these dimensions are organized or in the location of men and
   women within these dimensionalized spaces. We find that romantic love
   has a situated material effect in terms of increasing the probabilities
   of orgasm.

AB Recent research and theory at the intersection of cultural sociology and
   network analysis have converged around the notion of cultural holes:
   patterns of cultural choice that position the person as a bridge not
   between other persons but between cultural worlds. This is an approach
   that promises to open up new vistas in our conceptualization of the
   relationship between social position and cultural taste, but that so far
   lacks operational grounding. In this article, I draw on Breiger's (1974)
   formalization of the idea of the duality of persons and groups along
   with classical formalizations of brokerage for sociometric networks
   (Burt 1992) to suggest that the "cultural ego network" of a typical
   survey respondent can be reconstructed from patterns of audience overlap
   among the cultural items that are chosen by each respondent. This leads
   to a formalization of the notion of omnivorousness as relatively low
   levels of clustering in the cultural network: namely, omnivorousness as
   cultural network efficiency. I show how this metric overcomes the
   difficulties that have plagued previous attempts to produce ordinal
   indicators of omnivorousness from simple counts of the number of
   cultural choices, while providing novel substantive (and sometime
   counter-intuitive) insights into the relationship between
   socio-demographic status markers and patterns of cultural choice in the
   contemporary United States.

AB The rise of culture in economic studies has resulted in systematic
   investigations of the shared meanings that shape markets, economic
   decisions, and outcomes. A number of social scientists have a)
   privileged the heterogeneity of meanings within organizations and groups
   over monolithic accounts, b) used thick description and single or
   comparative case studies to investigate the incessant contestations over
   meanings and the corresponding actions facilitated, and c) have
   developed empirically testable propositions without insisting on the
   reduction of meanings to simple principles embedded in structures. This
   line of work does not deny that relatively stable cultural meanings
   exist or that parsimony is possible. Instead, it offers a parallel track
   privileging three modes of analysis: 1) the identification of discursive
   inflection points as leading indicators of market takeoffs, privileging
   thick minimalism over parsimony; 2) breached sequence analyses of
   transactions, highlighting experimental methods; and 3) relational
   analyses of networks and contested circuits, tying situated negotiations
   to overarching cultural structures. The article concludes with a plea to
   keep cultural analyses interpretive, historically grounded, and
   intuitively attuned to the meanings of social life.

AB While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources,
   content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future
   projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with
   the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not
   happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be
   studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives,
   performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I
   call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened,
   future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot
   project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the
   online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
   Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de
   Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public
   interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green
   economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their
   temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network
   mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level
   of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive,
   imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and
   oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of
   future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes
   of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation,
   institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.

AB The rise of the Internet, social media, and digitized historical
   archives has produced a colossal amount of text-based data in recent
   years. While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for
   automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical
   direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural
   sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins
   of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond
   micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that
   adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for
   automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First,
   I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the
   contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of
   automated text-classification methods to classify different types of
   culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I
   explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional
   qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements
   over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and
   cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several
   challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of
   information about the social context in which texts are produced, the
   construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated
   algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural
   sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently
   necessary to work with big data.

AB Objective. Despite lower socioeconomic status (SES) and higher disease
   burden, Hispanics in the US paradoxically display equal or lower
   mortality on average than non-Hispanic whites. Our objective was to
   determine if the "Hispanic paradox" occurs among patients with
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods. In a cohort of 706 RA patients, we compared differences in RA
   severity and comorbidity between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white ethnic
   groups at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
   estimate and compare mortality risk between Hispanics and non-Hispanic
   whites.
   Results. We studied 706 patients with RA, of whom 434 were Hispanic and
   272 were non-Hispanic white. Hispanics had significantly lower SES,
   greater inflammation, as well as higher tender and swollen joint counts.
   Patients were observed for 6,639 patient-years, during which time 229
   deaths occurred by the censoring date (rate 3.4 per 100 person-years;
   95% confidence interval 3.0, 3.9). Age-and sex-adjusted mortality was
   not significantly different between the 2 ethnic groups (hazard ratio
   [HR] 0.96). After adjustment for comorbidities, RA severity, and level
   of acculturation, mortality among Hispanics was lower (HR 0.56, P =
   0.004).
   Conclusion. Despite greater severity in most clinical manifestations and
   lower SES among Hispanics, paradoxically, their mortality was not
   increased. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms
   underlying this survival paradox.

AB Objective. To analyze the effect of sociodemographic, disease, and

   community of residence on the subsequent initiation of treatment with
   biologic agents for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods. We analyzed data from the University of California, San
   Francisco Rheumatoid Arthritis Panel Study for the years 1999-2011.
   Principal data collection was by a structured annual phone survey. We
   estimated Kaplan-Meier curves of the time until initiation of biologic
   agents, stratified by age and income. We also used Cox regression to
   estimate the effect of individual-level sociodemographic and medical
   factors, contextual-level socioeconomic status measures, and density of
   health providers in the local community on the probability of initiating
   therapy with biologic agents for RA.
   Results. In total, 527 persons were included in the panel in 1999, and
   229 persons (44%) had initiated therapy with biologic agents by 2011. In
   multivariable Cox regression models, age <70 years (hazard ratio [HR]
   for ages 19-54 years 1.89 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.24-2.87]
   and HR for ages 55-69 years 1.25 [95% CI 0.84-1.87]), Hispanic ethnicity
   (HR 2.02 [95% CI 1.05-3.86]), household income >=$30,000/year (HR 1.61
   [95% CI 1.12-2.32]), being married or with a partner (HR 1.39 [95% CI
   1.00-1.92]), and residence in rural environments (HR 1.96 [95% CI
   1.28-2.99]) were associated with a higher probability of initiating
   biologic agents. Having no (HR 0.18 [95% CI 0.08-0.40]) or only 1-4
   rheumatology visits in the year prior to interview (HR 0.60 [95% CI
   0.45-0.81]) and living in an area with >= 1 federally qualified health
   centers (HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.41-0.96]) were associated with a lower
   probability.
   Conclusion. The probability of initiating therapy with biologic agents
   is affected by sociodemographic and health system characteristics as
   well as the nature of the community of residence, resulting in
   disparities in access to these medications.
